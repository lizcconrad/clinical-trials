  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
      versus Health-Enhancement Program (HEP) for patients with treatment-resistant major
      depressive disorder (MDD). Both arms of the study will continue to receive the standard
      medication management treatment as usual (TAU) throughout the study. MBCT is a new technique
      that has been found to be effective for prevention of relapse in individuals in complete
      recovery from depression. MBCT is a group-based, 8-week intervention that uses mindfulness
      meditation as its core therapeutic ingredient. It teaches people to have a different
      relationship to depressive thoughts and feelings. This study will use an active condition
      called the Health Enhancement Program (HEP) which was specifically developed to serve as a
      comparison condition for mindfulness interventions. HEP has been shown to decrease global
      stress levels and to increase perceived health. Stress has been considered a contributor to
      depression. One hundred and seventy four patients with MDD who have failed two or more
      adequate antidepressant trials will be identified and randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      MBCT+TAU or HEP+TAU. All patients who enroll in the study will undergo follow-up assessments
      at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months following the intervention. A supplemental portion of the study will
      enroll 88 patients to undergo functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) scans
      immediately before and after treatment to better understand the neural pathways implicated in
      depression and those that may be affected through treatment.

    <description>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a group treatment that integrates mindfulness meditation training with some CBT concepts and was specifically developed as a relapse prevention intervention for MDD. The program teaches skills that allow patients to disengage from habitual (&quot;automatic&quot;) dysfunctional cognitive routines, in particular depression-related ruminative thought patterns, as a way to reduce future risk of relapse and recurrence of depression.</description>

    <description>The Health Enhancement Program (HEP)was developed at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and is modeled after traditional activity and nutrition programs used in weight management- cardiac rehab and diabetes prevention programs. The program is designed to increase overall health and well-being by focusing on four health domains that impact health and are interventions regularly practiced at integrative medicine. These include: (I) Music Therapy (2) Nutrition (3) physical activity including, walking and stretching and (4) Functional movement.</description>
