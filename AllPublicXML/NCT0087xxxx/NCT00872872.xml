  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three-drug combination of antiretroviral regimens has been used increasingly in HIV-infected
      pregnant women worldwide, both for the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV
      (PMTCT) and for women's own health. Use of these drugs in pregnant women solely for PMTCT
      means that these drugs will need to be discontinued in the majority of women after delivery.

      Certain antiretroviral regimens contain drugs with long half-life (drugs that stay in the
      body for a longer period of time after discontinuation than other drugs in the same regimen),
      such as nevirapine (NVP). HIV can easily develop resistance to NVP when NVP is the only drug
      left in the body (similar to monotherapy). Given two other drugs for up to 1 week after
      discontinue NVP (to mimic three-drug regimen while waiting for NVP elimination) can help
      reduce, but not eliminate, the development of resistant virus.

      Unfortunately, NVP-containing regimens are the most widely used regimens for pregnant women
      in developing countries due to its low cost and its availability in fixed-dose combinations.
      These study will explore how fast NVP is eliminated from women after delivery and to see if
      given zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC) for 1 or 2 weeks after NVP discontinuation can help
      reduce the development of NVP resistant virus.
