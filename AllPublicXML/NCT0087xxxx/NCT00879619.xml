      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and prednisone, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving docetaxel and
      prednisone together with sunitinib malate may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best way to give docetaxel
      and prednisone together with sunitinib malate and to see how well it works in treating
      patients with prostate cancer that progressed after hormone therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response by prostate specific antigen (PSA) of docetaxel/prednisone plus
      sunitinib (sunitinib malate) in chemotherapy-naive, hormone refractory prostate cancer
      subjects with biochemical relapse.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DR) in subjects
      with measurable disease.

      II. To determine overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP). III. To evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of sunitinib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1, prednisone orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, and sunitinib malate PO once daily (QD) on days 2-15.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients then receive sunitinib malate PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 42 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 3 years.
