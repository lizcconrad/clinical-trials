  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research study to determine if putting local anesthetic through a tiny tube next to the
      nerves that go to the shoulder will improve shoulder range-of-motion following the shoulder
      procedure performed on the frozen shoulder. It will also help determine if patients have a
      higher quality-of-life and less pain, require fewer pain pills, experience fewer sleep
      disturbances, and are more satisfied with their post-procedure pain control.

      Primary Specific Aim: To determine if, compared with usual and customary analgesia, the
      addition of an ambulatory continuous interscalene nerve block will result in increased
      shoulder abduction following treatment for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder.

      Hypothesis: Following shoulder manipulation under a single-injection interscalene block for
      adhesive capsulitis, adding a three-day ambulatory continuous interscalene nerve blcok to
      usual and customary post-manipulation analgesia will result in a significantly greater
      shoulder abduction improvement the day following the manipulation.

      Secondary Specific Aims: To determine if, compared with usual and customary analgesia, the
      addition of an ambulatory continuous interscalene nerve block will result in an increased
      quality-of-life and shoulder range-of-motion, as well as a decreased chronic pain following
      treatment for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder.

      Hypothesis 1: Following shoulder manipulation under a single-injection interscalene blcok for
      adhesive capsulitis, adding a three-day ambulatory continuous interscalene nerve block to
      usual and customary post-manipulation analgesia will result in a significantly increased
      quality-of-life improvement and shoulder range-of-motion compared wiht baseline values after
      three months.

      Hypothesis 2: Following shoulder manipulation undera a single-injection interscalene block
      for adhesive capsulitis, adding a three-day ambulatory continuous interscalene nerve block to
      usual and costomary post-manipulation analgesia will result in a significantly decreased
      chronic pain compared with basedline falues after three months.
