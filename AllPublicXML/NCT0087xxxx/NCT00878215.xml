    <textblock>
      Image-guided surgery is a new technology, which is used to create 3-D pictures that generate
      a map of the liver. This map will allow surgeons to know the exact anatomical location of
      their instruments, including instances when direct visualization is not possible. This study
      is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of using image-guided techniques for
      treatment of liver tumors. The overall goal of this study is to use image-guided surgery for
      the improvement of the surgeon's ability to remove liver tumors.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Have a Successful Intraoperative Registrations (Phase 1 Portion of Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>10 successful intraoperative registrations with no more than 30% failure rate over all the cases will be considered a successful endpoint
A successful registration is defined as one which yields an RMS surface residual of â‰¤ 10 mm and is determined to be success after qualitative evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy With Which Image-guided Surgery (IGS) Can be Used to Implant a Ceramic Bead Inside a Tumor as Measured by Successful Deliveries of the Bead to Within 8mm of the Pre-operatively Planned Target Point (Phase 2 Portion of Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Calculation of bead delivery accuracy using the IGS system involves the acquisition of images of the resected specimen and then the co-registration of the post-resection images to the pre-operative image set. Given that the target location is marked in the pre-operative image set and the registration calculation allows an overlay of the two image sets a Euclidean distance error can be calculated between the true bead location and the pre-operatively determined target. Given that the error involved in computing the registration between the two image sets is included within the bead delivery target error calculation it is imperative that the impact of registration error is minimized.
Numbers represented are the distance between the planned target site and the true bead location</description>

             ablation and at least up to a month following surgery.

          -  Patients enrolled in Phase I must be candidates for surgical liver resection per a
             treating surgeon's discretion. Patients enrolled in Phase 2-3 must be candidates for
             surgical liver resection of liver mass. Patients enrolled in Phase 4 must be
             candidates for surgical ablation, but not candidates for surgical resection.

          -  Patients are scheduled clinically for use of the Pathfinder Explorer Liver Image
             Guided System which is indicated for open liver surgical procedures where
             image-guidance may be appropriate and where the patient can tolerate long apneic
             periods under general anesthesia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, might increase the risk to
             the subject or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the
             objectives of the study.

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject or his/her legal representative unable to
             understand informed consent to the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the
             study.

        <title>Accuracy With Which Image-guided Surgery (IGS) Can be Used to Implant a Ceramic Bead Inside a Tumor as Measured by Successful Deliveries of the Bead to Within 8mm of the Pre-operatively Planned Target Point (Phase 2 Portion of Study)</title>
        <description>Calculation of bead delivery accuracy using the IGS system involves the acquisition of images of the resected specimen and then the co-registration of the post-resection images to the pre-operative image set. Given that the target location is marked in the pre-operative image set and the registration calculation allows an overlay of the two image sets a Euclidean distance error can be calculated between the true bead location and the pre-operatively determined target. Given that the error involved in computing the registration between the two image sets is included within the bead delivery target error calculation it is imperative that the impact of registration error is minimized.
Numbers represented are the distance between the planned target site and the true bead location</description>
