  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open fractures are frequently encountered in orthopaedics. Treatment usually calls for a
      formal, operative procedure in which the bone is exposed, foreign tissue is debrided and the
      wound is irrigated. While this is the current standard of care, not all open fractures are
      equal. In retrospective studies, centers are reporting less aggressive operative management
      for open fractures may result in equal results without the time and expense of the operative
      theater. The investigators propose a prospective, randomized trial of children with type I
      open fractures to evaluate whether formal operative treatment is necessary. The
      investigators' hypothesis is that minor open fractures can be safely treated in the emergency
      room with irrigation, closed reduction and home antibiotics without an increased risk of
      infection or other complications. Children who meet the study criteria will be randomized
      into two treatment arms - formal operative management (OR) and emergency department (ED)
      management. Outcomes from each group will be evaluated and compared, including rate of
      infection, number of return visits to the operating room, time to union, and other
      complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fractures in which bone has been exposed to the outside world through an associated skin
      injury, known as open fractures, are frequently encountered in orthopaedics. Traditionally,
      treatment calls for a formal, operative treatment in which the bone is exposed, foreign
      tissue is debrided and the wound is irrigated. The bone itself, depending on the age of the
      patient, fracture location and stability is then treated by the appropriate method of casting
      or internal fixation. However, while this is the current standard of care for all open
      fractures, not all open fractures are the same and can differ in terms of the bone involved,
      energy causing the injury and the skeletal maturity of the patient. Children, for example,
      have a thick periosteum which may diminish the rate of infection and decrease the time to
      healing. In addition, the protocol of operative debridement was introduced at the same time
      as widespread antibiotic use. It is not known whether the mechanical operative management or
      antibiotic use has resulted in improved outcomes. In retrospective studies, centers are
      reporting emergency department management alone may result in equal results without the time
      and expense of the operative theater.

      We propose a prospective, randomized trial of children with type I open fractures to evaluate
      whether formal operative treatment is necessary. Our hypothesis is that minor open fractures
      in children can be safely treated in the emergency room with irrigation, closed reduction and
      home antibiotics without an increased risk of infection or other complications. If the
      inclusion criteria is met and informed consent is obtained, children will be randomized into
      two treatment arms - formal operative management (OR) and emergency department (ED)
      management. Children randomized to the OR arm will be taken to the OR within 24 hours for
      irrigation and debridement and appropriate bone management. Children in the ED arm will have
      a washout in the emergency room under conscious sedation, a closed reduction and home
      antibiotics. Both wounds will be examined at interval follow up periods for signs of
      infection. Outcomes evaluated will include the rate of infection, the number of return visits
      to the operating room, the time to bone healing, and other complications. This is a pilot
      study with the plan of eventually being a multicenter study evaluating open fracture care in
      children.
