  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to

        -  Test the effect of a dietary supplement beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) with and
           without Vitamin D to prevent and reverse the losses of muscular strength and
           functionality in older adults.

      The second aim of the study is to determine if HMB and Vitamin D improves markers of bone
      turnover in adults aged 60 plus years. HMB is a dietary supplement that comes from the amino
      acid leucine. HMB is found in foods and is made in your body after you eat protein (meat).
      Subjects will be randomized to one of four dietary supplement groups and will participate in
      a 3-day per week exercise program for 12 weeks. Each exercise day will be about 60 minutes
      long consisting of strength training exercises utilizing TherabandÂ® stretch cords and
      jumping.

      Subjects will consume the dietary supplement 2 times per day for 12 weeks. Tests will consist
      of the following:

        -  Measuring the strength of subjects' legs by using a Isokinetic Dynamometer

        -  Measuring body composition

        -  Measuring hand-grip strength using a hand-grip dynamometer

        -  Measuring functional mobility, balance and agility by the time it takes for you to rise
           from a chair, walk around a cone 8 feet in front of the chair and return to the chair
           (Up-&amp;-Go Test

        -  Filling out questionnaires and having blood drawn for biochemical measurements. Testing
           will be performed at the beginning and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.
