      Follow-on study to the VIAject™-08J study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of
      VIAject™ when used as prandial insulin in combination with Lantus® in subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

      The VIAject™-08J study is the efficacy and safety study for insulin VIAject™ to demonstrate
      equivalent blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with VIAject™
      insulin or regular human insulin as prandial insulin and to demonstrate an equivalent safety
      profile for VIAject™ in comparison to human insulin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Completed the VIAject™-08J protocol

          2. Informed consent must be obtained in writing for all subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of frequent severe hypoglycemia within the prior six months which prevent
             study participation at the discretion of the investigator

          2. History of known hypersensitivity to any of the components in the study medication

          3. Progressive disease likely to prove fatal

          4. Known significant hepatic disease or serum AST or ALT values &gt; 3 times the upper limit
             of normal or bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal

          5. Severe complications of diabetes mellitus including a history or finding of Stage III
             or IV diabetic retinopathy (see Appendix B), proteinuria &gt; 2+ by urine dipstick, serum
             creatinine of &gt;1.8 mg/dl for males or &gt;1.5 mg/dl for females, history of renal
             transplant, severe peripheral vascular disease, which has resulted in amputation or
             recent onset of chronic foot ulcers or claudication, or the recent, clinically
             documented loss a pedal pulse.

          6. History of moderate to severe ketoacidosis within the 3 months preceding screening for
             the study

          7. Current drug or alcohol abuse, or a history which in the opinion of the Investigator
             will impair subject safety or protocol compliance.

          8. Current significant cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal,
             neurological, psychiatric and/or hematological disease as evaluated by the
             Investigator

          9. A sexually active woman of childbearing age not actively and consistently practicing
             birth control by using a medically accepted device or therapy or a woman intending to
             become pregnant during the study

         10. Abnormal ECG, safety lab or physical examination results which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, render the participation of the subject in the study to be inappropriate
             or unsafe

         11. A history of lack of compliance with medical instructions, recent drug or alcohol
             abuse, or other reasons which, in the opinion of the investigator, render the
             participation of the subject in the study to be inappropriate or unsafe
