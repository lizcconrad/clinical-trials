  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cardiac operations under cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB), monitoring of brain tissue oxygen
      saturation with infrared spectrophotoscopy leads to a reduction of the number of packed red
      cell(PRC) transfusions during the period of extracorporeal circulation.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the use of brain tissue oxygen saturation
      monitoring will lead to a reduction of the intra-operative use of packed red cell units.

      Patients randomly allocated to groups A and B. In group A INVOS monitoring available. In
      group B, no access to INVOS for the attending anesthesiologist. An &quot;observer&quot;
      anesthesiologist has access to INVOS and provides information if it is considered necessary.

      For BOTH GROUPS:

      During CBP and before aortic unclamping, PRC not to be given if hemoglobin is &gt;7g/dl. For
      values less than 5.5g/dl, one unit of PRC is transfused and the patient is reevaluated. After
      weaning from CPB and retransfusion of the salvaged shed blood, transfusion when hemoglobin is
      &lt;8g/dl. During ICU stay, transfusion when hemoglobin is &lt;8g/dl. Between 8-10g/dl evaluation
      for transfusion in a multimodal manner.

      For GROUP A:

      As above and during CBP and before aortic unclamping, if hemoglobin is between 5.5-7g/dl,
      transfusion when INVOS is less than 60%.

      For GROUP B:

      As above and during CBP and before aortic unclamping, if hemoglobin is between 5.5-7g/dl,
      decision for transfusion is taken by the attending anesthesiologist (judgment).
