  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy (RT) has been a component of breast cancer treatment for almost 100 years.
      Although initially used for the treatment of chest wall recurrences after mastectomy and for
      advanced inoperable disease, RT has evolved into a critical component of early therapy for
      women with an intact breast following lumpectomy and for mastectomized women who are at high
      risk for local failure. Currently breast cancer patients need a multidisciplinary management
      including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, radiotherapy has a significant role in loco
      regional control of the disease. It is estimated that 87% of these women will develop some
      degree of radiation-induced dermatitis, varying from mild to brisk erythema or even moist
      desquamation.

      Topical agents, such as corticosteroid creams and other products including Aquaphor
      (Beirsdorf Inc, Wilton, CT), and trolamine (Biafine; Genmedix Ltd, France), are commonly
      prescribed at the onset of radiation dermatitis or, in some institutions, at the beginning of
      radiotherapy.

      The aim of this randomized phase III study was to assess the effectiveness of aloe vera cream
      for the prevention of acute radiation-induced dermatitis of grade 2 or higher during
      postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer, compared to best supportive care. The secondary
      objectives were to assess pain, treatment interruption as a result of skin reactions, and the
      quantity of life during the treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The women had to be 18 to 75 years of age with a nonmetastatic breast adenocarcinoma
             treated by either lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without adjuvant postoperative
             chemotherapy or hormonal treatment, and referred to the Department of Radiotherapy for
             postoperative radiotherapy. Concomitant chemotherapy was allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with bilateral cancer, patients who were allergic to either of the two agents,
             and pregnant women were excluded.

          -  No rash, ulceration, bleeding, or unhealed scar was allowed in the treatment area.

          -  Patients were excluded for: prior radiation therapy (RT), mastectomy, skin involvement
             by tumor, history of, or current connective tissue disorder, medical contraindication
             (allergy or sensitivity) to Aloevera or planned BSC, and inability to comply with
             treatment regime. The use of bolus was prohibited.
