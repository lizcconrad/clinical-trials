  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I, dose-escalation study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered GDC-0941 administered once daily
      (QD) and twice daily (BID) in the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
