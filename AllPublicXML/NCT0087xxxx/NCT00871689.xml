      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor umbilical cord blood
      stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's
      immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells and natural
      killer cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Giving
      interleukin-2 (IL-2, aldesleukin) after transplant may stimulate the natural killer cells to
      kill any remaining cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving combination chemotherapy
      together with total-body irradiation followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2, aldesleukin), and
      umbilical cord blood transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the rate of neutrophil engraftment and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host
           disease (GVHD) following a T cell depleted (TCD) umbilical cord blood (UCB)
           transplantation without post-transplant immunosuppression followed by administration of
           interleukin-2 (IL-2, aldesleukin) (every other day) days +3 to +13 to expand NK cells in
           vivo.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety of this regimen as assessed by monitoring the rates of graft
           failure, acute GVHD, and transplant-related mortality (TRM).

        -  To perform quantitative, phenotypic, and functional assessments of the in vivo expanded
           UCB-derived NK cells on (day +72).

        -  To assess clinical disease response (leukemia clearance and complete remission) and
           survival duration in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of aldesleukin in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the tolerance of IL-2

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1
           hour on days -7 to -5 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6. Patients undergo
           total-body irradiation twice daily on days -5 to -2.

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo T-cell depleted umbilical cord blood (UCB)
           transplantation on day 0.

        -  IL-2 (Aldesleukin) therapy: Patients receive aldesleukin subcutaneously on days +3 6
           doses every other day) and +60 (6 doses every other day).

      Patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years after transplant.
