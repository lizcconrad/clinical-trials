      Context. Nuclear imaging plays a central role in management of chromaffin-tissue derived
      tumors because tumor cells exhibit peptide receptors and proteins involved in metabolism that
      can be targeted with specific radiopharmaceutics. Recently, over expression dopamine-receptor
      D2 isoforms has been found in endocrine tumors.

      Objective. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of 123I-IBZM (a D2
      agonist radiolabelled with 123I) in patients with PHEO and/or PGL. Diagnostic accuracy will
      be also compared to traditional SPECT imaging procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age + 18 years. The women in ages to procreate have to have an effective contraception
             or a negative pregnancy test (in the absence of effective contraception) Having a
             radiological and functional imaging (balance sheet(assessment) pré--IBZM) considered
             adapted and complete for the pathology.

          -  Having a phéochromocytome or a paragangliome proving a surgical operation in view of
             the data of the balance sheet(assessment) pré--IBZM.

             test.
