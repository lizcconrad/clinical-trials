    <textblock>
      A Phase III trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PTK 0796 in the treatment of
      complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacologic profile of PTK 0796 in humans suggests that it has the potential to be used
      safely and effectively for this indication. Data from in vitro and animal studies support
      this hypothesis.

      In PTK 0796-CSSI-0805 the safety and efficacy of PTK 0796 in the treatment of cSSSI will be
      compared to an antibiotic approved for this indication by the FDA. Initial treatment will be
      administered intravenously with the option for subsequent oral treatment.
