  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The enormous global burden of mental illness has been estimated through the publication of
      the Global Burden of Disease Study, adding momentum to refugee mental health studies (1,2).
      As research confirms that high levels of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression
      occur in post-conflict settings, it is essential to develop effective treatment for
      psychological trauma in refugee populations recovering from mass violence (3-4). PTSD and
      depression are risk factors for anger, interpersonal discord and violence, not only among
      those who have trauma and depression, but also among their spouses and children (5-9). This
      &quot;infectious&quot; model of trauma/violence is critically important in the setting of ethnic
      conflict, as increased levels of interpersonal violence within the afflicted community hinder
      its recovery and fuel future cycles of conflict. To date, there has been little research on
      the interpersonal effects of trauma among refugee populations. The proposed research is a
      pilot and randomized controlled trial of &quot;Interpersonal Therapy&quot; (IPT) for Sudanese refugees
      living in Cairo. IPT, a very effective therapy for depression, has been adapted for PTSD
      treatment and sub-Saharan Africa settings (10-12). Measures will evaluate success of the
      treatment not only in terms of individual PTSD and depression symptoms, but also with respect
      to interpersonal conflict. Hypotheses: (1) After IPT intervention, Sudanese refugees will
      have lower levels of depression and trauma symptoms compared to wait list controls (2) After
      IPT intervention, Sudanese refugees will have lower levels of interpersonal violence compared
      to wait list controls.
