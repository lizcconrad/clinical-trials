      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence study comparing Sumatriptan Succinate
      Tablets 100 mg (containing sumatriptan succinate equivalent to 100 mg sumatriptan)
      manufactured by OHM Laboratories Inc. with IMITREX® tablets 100 mg (containing sumatriptan
      succinate equivalent to 100 mg sumatriptan) manufactured by GlaxoSmithkline Research Triangle
      Park, NC 27709, Made in Canada in healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fasting
      condition.

      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of sumatriptan succinate
      tablets 100 mg (containing 140 mg of sumatriptan succinate equivalent to 100 mg sumatriptan)
      of either test or reference formulation was administered during each period of the study,
      along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature under low light condition and
      supervision of trained study personnel.

      32 subjects were enrolled into the study. However, twenty seven (27) subjects completed both
      the periods of the study. Pharmacokinetic and Statistical analysis was performed on twenty
      seven subjects (27) subjects.
