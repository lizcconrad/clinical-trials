  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and systemic exposure of an experimental
      influenza (flu) treatment medication called DAS181. DAS181 is a dry powder that is
      administered via oral inhalation using a special device. Study participants will include
      healthy non-smoking males and females, ages 18-65. They will be given either DAS181 or
      placebo. Participants will remain in the clinic overnight to be watched for health changes
      for 24 hours after receiving the medication. Study procedures include: physical exams, chest
      x-rays, ECGs, lung function tests, collection of blood and urine samples, and throat swabs.
      Follow-up visits will occur on study days 2, 7, 14 and 30.

             medical history.

          -  Subjects must be able to verbalize understanding of the consent form, provide written
             informed consent and verbalize willingness to complete study procedures

             interval ≤ 440 ms.

          -  Blood pressure within normal limits (systolic 90-140mmHg; diastolic 50-90 mmHg) and
             heart rate between 45 and 100 beats per minute.

          -  Chest X-ray and FEV1 results show no clinically significant abnormalities.
