      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ursodiol, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and
      fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can
      block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.
      Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor. Giving ursodiol together with leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and
      bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ursodiol when given
      together with combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab in treating patients with stage IV
      colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the active dose and/or maximum tolerated dose of ursodiol when given in
           combination with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen), and
           bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of ursodiol when given with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the systemic metabolic effects of ursodiol activation of nuclear receptor
           farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in glucose and lipid metabolism.

        -  To develop assays to detect ursodiol activation of FXR.

        -  To identify and evaluate potential serum biomarkers of FXR activation.

        -  To determine genes regulated by activation of FXR at target tissues.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ursodiol.

      Patients receive oral ursodiol twice daily on days 1-28 (days -6 to 28 of course 1),
      leucovorin calcium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15, fluorouracil IV over 46
      hours on days 1-2 and 15-16, and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood sample is collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are also analyzed
      for the role of nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in glucose uptake and metabolism
      using PET scan imaging, an oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c levels; the effects of FXR
      activation on lipid metabolism; and a marker for response to FXR activation via western blot.
      Available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue blocks are analyzed for FXR
      expressing via IHC; expression of known FXR target genes via RNA analysis and real-time PCR;
      and expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism.
