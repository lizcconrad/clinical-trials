      Urodynamic study is an objective method to evaluate female patients with lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS). However, this method includes place a urinary catheter, thus prevents it as
      a routine method to evaluate and follow up patients with LUTS. Therefore, it is necessary to
      find a simple and objective method to help in evaluating female patients with LUTS. Several
      kinds of biomarker had been reported in diagnosing patients with overactive bladder; however,
      the sensitivity remained poor. The aim of this study is to find a useful biomarker,
      biomarkers, or combinations, with the aid of urodynamic study, to objectively and precisely
      in evaluating the female patients with LUTS.
