      The purpose of this study is to determine the short and long term outcome of endoscopic
      vacuum assisted closure of intrathoracic postsurgical leaks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrathoracic leakage is a serious complication after esophageal surgery. The reported
      incidence of esophageal anastomotic leaks after gastrectomy and esophagectomy ranges from 5%
      to almost 30%. Within the last 10 years endoscopic treatment has changed the approach to
      intrathoracic anastomotic leakages. Application of metal clips, injection of fibrin glue and
      placement of self expanding metal or plastic stents (SEMS/SEPS) have been reported to
      successfully achieve closure of postoperative anastomotic leaks in approximately 66-100%.
      Alternative endoscopically treatment modalities are welcome especially in cases of failure of
      the above mentioned endoscopic treatment modalities to prevent the necessity of surgical
      reintervention which is associated with high mortality or mutilating surgical outcome such as
      proximal diversion with cervical esophagostomy.

      Vacuum-assisted closure (V.A.C.) is an established treatment modality for extensive cutaneous
      infected wounds. The V.A.C. system device is based on a negative pressure applied to the
      wound via a vacuum sealed sponge tissue. The sponge results in formation of granulation
      tissue, while the vacuum removes wound secretions and reduces edema and therefore improves
      blood flow, all together achieving consecutive wound closure. Since its introduction in the
      late 1990´s the number of indications for the V.A.C. system has steadily increased. Recently
      the endoluminal application of a vacuum assisted wound closure system for the closure of
      rectal anastomotic fistulas has been reported. Our group reported the successful closure of
      intrathoracic anastomotic leaks in two cases by endoscopic placement of a vacuum assisted
      closure system. Here we plan to study the efficacy, safety and long term outcome of E-V.A.C.
      to treat major intrathoracic postsurgical leaks.
