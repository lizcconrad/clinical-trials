      RATIONALE: Panobinostat and sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib may also stop the growth of liver cancer by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of panobinostat when
      given together with sorafenib in treating patients with liver cancer that is metastatic
      and/or cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of panobinostat when combined with standard doses of
           sorafenib tosylate in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of panobinostat when combined with standard doses
           of sorafenib tosylate in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival.

        -  Determine the overall survival rate.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of panobinostat.

      Patients receive panobinostat IV on days 1 and 8 and oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.

    <description>To ensure comparability, baseline methods and on-study methods for response assessment must be performed using identical techniques. In addition, all subjects with evidence of objective tumor response (CR, PR or SD) should have the response confirmed with repeat assessments at least 21 days after the first documentation of response, resuming bimonthly (every 42 days) assessments thereafter. Objective tumor response will be assessed using the RECIST method.</description>
