  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeting the blood supply of cancer, called anti-angiogenesis is a new but proven treatment
      strategy. There are two ways of achieving this effect. The first way to specifically target
      the molecular pathways that promote new blood vessel formation in cancer. An example of such
      an agent is sorafenib, which is an oral agent and which is already in use worldwide for the
      treatment of kidney and liver cancers. The second way is to target the cells lining the blood
      vessels by using low dose of chemotherapy agents administered at frequent intervals. This
      strategy is called metronomic chemotherapy. It is possible that combining agents like
      sorafenib and metronomic chemotherapy may further enhance anti-cancer effects. This study
      aims to determine the optimal way of combining oral vinorelbine in metronomic doses and
      sorafenib. Oral vinorelbine is a chemotherapy agent that is already approved for use in
      cancer treatment such as lung cancer. By combining both oral anti-cancer agents to optimize
      their anti-angiogenic effects in this study, the potential benefit to the patients can be
      tremendous and far-reaching. Special radiologic imagings and blood tests will be incorporated
      into this study to help further the understanding of the anti-angiogenic processes of both
      agents.

      Phase I Dose-finding study: The patients will be divided into 3 cohorts (15 patients per
      cohort), each cohort receiving a fixed metronomic (thrice a week) dose of oral vinorelbine at
      60 mg/week, 90 mg/week, and 120 mg/week respectively. Each patient within each cohort will
      receive a starting dose of sorafenib at 200 mg bid for 4 weeks. In the absence of
      dose-limiting toxicities, the dose of sorafenib will be escalated to 400 mg bid for another 4
      weeks, 600 mg bid for 4 weeks and then finally 800 mg bid. We should arrive at 3 different
      MTDs from the 3 cohorts.

      Once the MTD has been determined for each cohort, we will recruit an additional 12 patients
      for each cohort and study the PK profile of both drugs. The 12 patients in each cohort will
      be sequentially alternated to group 1 or group 2 treatment schedules. Group 1 (N=6 patients
      in each cohort) will receive vinorelbine three times per week starting on Monday (Day 1)
      followed by Wednesday (Day 3) and Friday (Day 5). In the subsequent weeks vinorelbine will be
      given on the same working days (i.e. Monday, Wednesday and Friday). The first PK profile of
      vinorelbine (without concomitant sorafenib) will be determined on Day 15 under steady state
      conditions.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC

          2. At least one or 2 prior lines of chemotherapy, including oral EGFR tyrosine-kinase
             inhibitor for metastatic disease or locally advanced unresectable disease. There
             should be at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy; patients who
             decline conventional chemotherapy or oral EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor as salvage
             2nd or 3rd line treatment are also eligible.

          3. Minimum body-surface area (BSA) of 1.4 m2 at point of recruitment. This is a safeguard
             against recruiting small-built patients who may experience adverse reaction on
             absolute dosing of oral vinorelbine. At this body surface area, the maximum dosing of
             oral vinorelbine at 120 mg/week is equivalent to 86 mg/m2/week for a patient with BSA
             of 1.4 m2.

          4. Age &gt;21 years

          5. ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%)

          6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined here: leukocytes
             &gt;3,000/mcL, absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL, platelet count &gt; 100,000/mcL, serum
             bilirubin within normal institutional limits, AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X upper limit
             of normal, and creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance
             &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients. These tests must be done within 1 week of study
             treatment.

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          2. Patients receiving any other investigational agents

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Oral Vinorelbine or other agents used in study

          5. Prior and / or concomitant treatment with drugs known to induce or inhibit cytochrome
             P450 3A4: phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, imidazole antifungals
             (such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, metronidazole), omeprazole and
             ritonavir. Patients who are taking gastric acid-lowering agents such as H2 antagonist
             or antacids will be evaluated regarding the need to continue with these medications.
             If discontinuation of these medications is medically contraindicated, the patient will
             be excluded as these agents are known to lower the solubility of sorafenib and hence
             may limit their efficacy.

          6. Significant malabsorption syndrome or disease affecting the gastro-intestinal tract
             function

          7. Significant peripheral or autonomic neuropathy affecting sensation or bowel motility

          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          9. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic
             pressure &gt;90 mmHg despite optimal management

         10. Pregnancy or breast-feeding or women of childbearing potential not using effective
             contraception

         11. Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

         12. Thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident including transient
             ischemic attacks within the past 6 months

         13. Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt;CTCAE grade 2 within 4 weeks of recruitment

         14. Any other hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt;CTCAE grade 3 within 4 weeks of recruitment
