      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of enhanced pharmacist care (patient
      identification, assessment, education, prescribing/titration of antihypertensive medications
      and close follow-up) on systolic blood pressure (BP) reduction in patients with poorly
      controlled hypertension in the community setting.

    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, controlled trial of enhanced pharmacist care, with the unit of
      randomization as the patient. Participants will be randomized to enhanced pharmacist care
      (patient identification, assessment, education, close follow-up and prescribing/titration of
      antihypertensive medications or usual care. Participants will be patients in Alberta with
      undiagnosed or uncontrolled BP as defined by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program. The
      primary intervention will be enhanced pharmacist care. Pharmacists will assess patients with
      regards to cardiovascular risk reduction including reviewing BP control, treatment goals and
      determining lifestyle modifications for the patient to undertake to help manage their BP. The
      primary outcome will be a comparison of difference in change in systolic BP between enhanced
      care and usual care at 24 weeks follow-up. Secondary outcomes include the number of patients
      at their BP target at 24 weeks, number of new antihypertensive medication starts, number of
      antihypertensive dosage changes, number of antihypertensive medication changes and number of
      new prescriptions for ASA and cholesterol medications.

    <description>The primary intervention will be enhanced pharmacist care. Pharmacists will assess patients with regards to cardiovascular risk reduction including reviewing BP control, treatment goals and determining lifestyle modifications for the patient to undertake to help manage their BP. The pharmacist will also review the patient's current hypertensive therapy regimen and decide on the options for improvement of BP control (lifestyle modification, increase dose, additional BP medications), and implementation of these strategies.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to usual care will receive a wallet card for BP readings, pamphlet on BP and usual pharmacist and physician care. Patients will be seen at 12 weeks for interim BP measurement only. Both groups of patients will be seen at 24 weeks for BP measurement.</description>
