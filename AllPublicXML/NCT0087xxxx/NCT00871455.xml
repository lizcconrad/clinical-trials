  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is used as a measure of the body's ability to produce
      growth hormone. Growth hormone is important for muscle tissue as well as many other tissues
      in the body. Growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I have been shown to be reduced in many persons with
      SCI. Baclofen is a FDA approved drug that is used to treat spasticity. Persons receiving
      long-term baclofen therapy have been demonstrated to have increased growth hormone and IGF-I
      levels. IGF-I levels will be determined before and after treatment with baclofen. In this
      study, the investigators will determine the minimum dose of baclofen at which improvements in
      GH and IGF-1 levels occur.
