  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the feasibility of evaluating YSPSL for the amelioration of
      ischemia reperfusion injury following liver transplantation by administering YSPSL into the
      liver graft directly ex vivo via the portal vein and to the recipient intravenously prior to
      reperfusion. This study is an extension of the recent pilot study YSPSL-0002 with an almost
      identical study protocol. The rationale of this and the previous study is based on the recent
      observation that P-selectin expression has been associated in liver grafts with prolonged
      cold storage times and rejection. By examining biomarkers of IRI including P-selectin by
      immunohistochemistry and/or quantitative PCR, liver histology and hepatic blood flow using
      established techniques, the goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using these
      modalities for future studies of safety and efficacy.

      YSPSL-0003 is an extension into 36 patients of the previous 12 patient pilot study YSPSL-0002
      under an almost identical study protocol with extended inclusion criteria. Like YSPSL-0002,
      YSPSL-0003 is a single-center (UCLA), randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.
      Patients are randomly assigned to either active study drug (Active group) or placebo (Control
      group) prior to transplantation. The active study drug dose includes both a 1 mg/kg IV
      infusion for the recipient and a 20 mg [approximately 0.27 mg/kg] as an ex vivo flush. The
      doses are administered via 2 separate infusions of study agent: one 20 mg dose into the
      portal vein of the liver prior to implantation as an ex vivo flush with Viaspan®; and the
      second infusion of 1 mg/kg intravenously into the recipient, when technically feasible, prior
      to the hepatic artery anastomosis. Placebo of a volume equivalent to active study drug is
      prepared for administration to the control group to help maintain the blind. Those patients
      that experience an intraoperative blood loss of &gt;10 units, receive an additional 1 mg/kg IV
      infusion of study agent (or placebo equivalent) at the end of the transplant surgery. The
      Investigator/Sponsor is blinded to the treatment assignment for each patient. Randomization
      assignment is maintained by UCLA's clinical pharmacist.
