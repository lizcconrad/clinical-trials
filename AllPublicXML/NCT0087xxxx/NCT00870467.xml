  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the potential of adalimumab to inhibit radiographic progression in joint
      destruction compared with placebo in adult Japanese subjects with recent onset of rheumatoid
      arthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      study designed to evaluate the inhibition of radiographic progression by adalimumab compared
      with placebo in adult Japanese patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had not been
      previously treated with methotrexate (MTX). Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to
      receive either a subcutaneous injection of adalimumab 40 mg or matching placebo every other
      week (eow) during the 26-week double-blind phase. All participants also received 6 mg to 8 mg
      MTX weekly as basal treatment for their disease. Participants who experienced an increase in
      disease activity (more than 20% increase in tender joint count and swollen joint count) at
      Week 12, 16, or 20 compared with Baseline after having increased MTX dose to 8 mg per week
      for at least 4 weeks were discontinued from the double-blind phase and were eligible to
      receive open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow as rescue treatment. Participants who completed the
      26 weeks of treatment (either double-blind study drug [adalimumab or placebo] treatment or
      open-label adalimumab treatment) were eligible to enter the 26-week open-label phase in which
      they received adalimumab 40 mg eow. Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at
      Baseline and at designated study visits.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp X-Ray Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) is a measure of joint health, used in evaluation of inhibition of radiographic progression of disease. Digitized X-rays of hands and feet were obtained then scored in a blinded manner: for erosions (0 [no damage] to 5 [complete collapse or total destruction of joint]) and for joint space narrowing (0 [no damage] to 4 [complete luxation of joint]). Scores were added, giving total mTSS (0 [normal] to 380 [maximal disease]). Large positive change in mTSS indicates disease progression; small positive/no change indicates slowing/halting of disease progression.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is a combined index used to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Calculation of the DAS28 score used the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. DAS28(ESR) scores range from 0 (no disease activity) to 9 (maximal disease activity); decrease is indicative of improvement in disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp X-Ray Score at Week 26</title>
        <description>Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) is a measure of joint health, used in evaluation of inhibition of radiographic progression of disease. Digitized X-rays of hands and feet were obtained then scored in a blinded manner: for erosions (0 [no damage] to 5 [complete collapse or total destruction of joint]) and for joint space narrowing (0 [no damage] to 4 [complete luxation of joint]). Scores were added, giving total mTSS (0 [normal] to 380 [maximal disease]). Large positive change in mTSS indicates disease progression; small positive/no change indicates slowing/halting of disease progression.</description>

        <description>Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is a combined index used to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Calculation of the DAS28 score used the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. DAS28(ESR) scores range from 0 (no disease activity) to 9 (maximal disease activity); decrease is indicative of improvement in disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp X-Ray Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) is a measure of joint health, used in evaluation of inhibition of radiographic progression of disease. Digitized X-rays of hands and feet were obtained then scored in a blinded manner: for erosions (0 [no damage] to 5 [complete collapse or total destruction of joint]) and for joint space narrowing (0 [no damage] to 4 [complete luxation of joint]). Scores were added, giving total mTSS score (0 [normal] to 380 [maximal disease]). Large positive change in mTSS indicates diseae progression; small positive/no change indicates slowing/halting of disease progression.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp X-Ray Score at Week 52</title>
          <description>Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) is a measure of joint health, used in evaluation of inhibition of radiographic progression of disease. Digitized X-rays of hands and feet were obtained then scored in a blinded manner: for erosions (0 [no damage] to 5 [complete collapse or total destruction of joint]) and for joint space narrowing (0 [no damage] to 4 [complete luxation of joint]). Scores were added, giving total mTSS score (0 [normal] to 380 [maximal disease]). Large positive change in mTSS indicates diseae progression; small positive/no change indicates slowing/halting of disease progression.</description>

        <description>Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is a combined index used to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Calculation of the DAS28 score used the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. DAS28(ESR) scores range from 0 (no disease activity) to 9 (maximal disease activity); decrease is indicative of improvement in disease activity.</description>

          <description>Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is a combined index used to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Calculation of the DAS28 score used the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. DAS28(ESR) scores range from 0 (no disease activity) to 9 (maximal disease activity); decrease is indicative of improvement in disease activity.</description>
