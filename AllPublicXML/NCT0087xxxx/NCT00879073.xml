      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Test the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Bendamustine with whole brain radiation therapy
           (WBRT)

        -  To determine the plasma pharmacokinetics (a blood test to see how much of the drug is
           getting into the patient's system and how long it lasts in the system) of Bendamustine

        -  To determine the presence of Bendamustine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (fluid from the
           brain and spinal cord) of study patients Bendamustine is approved by the Food and Drug
           Administration (FDA) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, Bendamustine will be
           used in this study as an investigational agent.

      Bendamustine will be started in the first group at a dose of 60 mg/m²; patients in group 2
      will be given Bendamustine at a dose of 80 mg/m²; patients in Group 3 will be given
      Bendamustine at 100 mg/m². Each cohort will receive Bendamustine once weekly for a total of 4
      weeks.

      Approximately 3-6 patients enrolled in this study will receive lumbar punctures. Patients
      will be told before study enrollment whether they will have a lumbar puncture to withdraw
      CSF.

    <description>Approximately 15-24 study patients will be enrolled in this Phase I trial. Study patients will receive a weekly dose of IV bendamustine with whole brain radiation therapy for 3 weeks and then receive a fourth dose of IV bendamustine one week after completion of whole brain radiation therapy. The first dose of IV bendamustine will be given when whole brain radiation is initiated.</description>
