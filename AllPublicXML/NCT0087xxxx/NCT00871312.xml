      The AOTI two2 therapy trial is a randomized, double-blinded, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled, multi-center study intended to evaluate the efficacy of Topical Wound
      Oxygen (two2) therapy in relation to placebo when added to standard of care in the treatment
      of diabetic lower extremity ulcers.

          -  Subject has an acute or active Charcot foot per clinical and radiology results or
             significant bony prominences that would preclude adequate off-loading with the
             standard off-loading device. The presence of Charcot foot in itself does not exclude
             the subject;
