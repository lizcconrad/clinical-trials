  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Kinrix when
      co-administered with varicella (Varivax® [varicella virus vaccine live], Merck and Company)
      and (measles mumps rubella) MMR vaccines, compared to Kinrix co-administered with MMR vaccine
      alone. Both Kinrix and the second dose of Varivax are indicated in children 4-6 years of age,
      and there is great potential for the vaccines to be given concurrently. The aim of this trial
      is to demonstrate that co-administered Varivax does not negatively affect the immunogenicity
      or reactogenicity of Kinrix.

      Subjects 4-6 years of age will be randomized into two groups to receive either Kinrix,
      Varivax and M-M-RII on day 0 (Group 1) or Kinrix and M-M-RII on day 0 and Varivax at month
      1(Group 2).

      All subjects in both groups to provide blood samples prior to vaccination on day 0 and at
      month 1 (for Group 2, blood sampling is prior to vaccination with Varivax).

      Duration of the study will be approximately 6 months for each subject with a safety telephone
      contact 6 months after vaccinations.

        <description>An unsolicited adverse event is any adverse event (i.e. any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Also any &quot;solicited&quot; symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms will be reported as an unsolicited adverse event.</description>
