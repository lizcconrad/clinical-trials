  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a molecule or particle that is found only on cancer cells and is unique to
      cancer cells, as it is not detected on normal tissue. The molecule is known as &quot;oncofetal
      antigen&quot; or OFA. Because OFA is unique to cancer, the investigators feel OFA could be used to
      educate the patients' own defenses to more effectively fight the cancer on his or her own,
      that he or she is harboring. Although investigators found OFA to be present in large
      concentrations on all cancers, it was found to be especially abundant in breast cancers.
      Therefore, the investigators feel that this molecule would be a good target for stimulating
      patient defenses especially against breast cancer cells. To accomplish this, certain defense
      cells (immune cells)will be washed out from the patients' blood using a machine to which the
      patient is connected through two small cannula placed into veins located in the patients'
      arms those cells will be manipulated in the laboratory with artificially engineered OFA.
      These &quot;reeducated&quot; cells will be injected into the skin of patients. There will be a series
      of three skin injections in 4 week intervals. It is hoped that this treatment will convert
      the patients' defenses to a point that effective anti-cancer responses will be induced.
      Effectiveness of the treatment will be monitored with blood tests and assessment of the size
      of the cancers.
