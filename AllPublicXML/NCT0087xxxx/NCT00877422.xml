    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the fourth leading cause of death and frequently occurs in institutionalized
      elderly people in Japan. Recently, several clinical and experimental studies have reported
      the importance of vitamin D in the regulation of immune functions and its deficiency is
      associated with susceptibility to some infections. In the present study, the investigators
      hypothesize that deficiency of serum vitamin D is associated with development of pneumonia,
      and supplementation of vitamin D may lower the incidence of pneumonia and prolong survival in
      institutionalized elderly subjects.
