  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance of a large metal-on-metal bearing
      from the DePuy ASR™ System in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring hip
      resurfacing surgery or a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be
      evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray
      assessments.

      The Study was terminated with effect from 30th November 2011 following the completion of 2
      year follow up assessments for those patients remaining in the study.

      Please note that prior to this decision DePuy voluntarily recalled the ASR products on 24
      August 2010. Additional information regarding this voluntary recall and the follow-up of
      patients affected by the recall can be found at the following links
      http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/Safetywarnings/MedicalDeviceAlerts/CON155761 and

        General Inclusion Criteria:

        i) Male or female subjects, aged between 18 and 65 years inclusive.

        ii) Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
        this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

        iii) Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this
        investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return to
        the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

        Inclusion Criteria for DePuy ASR™ Resurfacing system:

        i) Subjects with primary osteoarthritis indicated for standard MoM hip resurfacing
        arthroplasty with cementless fixation in the acetabulum.

        Inclusion Criteria for ASR™ XL Head system:

        i) Subjects whose bone morphology and bone quality mean that standard MoM hip resurfacing
        arthroplasty is not indicated, but for whom cementless fixation in the acetabulum and
        receipt of a large MoM bearing are still possible.

        General Exclusion Criteria:

        i) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that would
        compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.

        ii) Subjects with compromised renal function defined as those whose measured values lie
        outside the normal range for a particular investigational site.

        iii) Subjects with proven metal sensitivity.

        iv) Subjects with infectious, highly communicable diseases, which may limit follow-up i.e.
        Active tuberculosis, hepatitis, immuno-compromised conditions, etc.

        v) Women who are pregnant or who intend to become pregnant within 2 years of surgery.

        vi) Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
        could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

        vii) Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
        the last 6 month(s).

        viii) Subjects who are currently, or have been in the last 12 months, participating in a
        clinical study which involves exposure to ionising radiation.

        ix) Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

        x) Subjects who are undergoing corticosteroid treatment.

        xi) Subjects with active or recent joint sepsis.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for DePuy ASR™:

        i) Subjects with proven significant osteoporosis and poor bone quality.

        ii) Subjects with marked atrophy or deformity in the upper femur, skeletal immaturity, or
        where loss of musculature or neuromuscular disease would render the procedure
        unjustifiable.

        iii) Subjects whose anatomical CCD angle is below 120°.

        iv) Subjects who have undergone irradiation of the affected hip.
