  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate the effects of D-cycloserine (DCS) combined with
      cognitive-behavioral treatment with exposure therapy in a sample of patients who developed
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a consequence of various traumas (e.g., motor vehicle
      and accidents, burns and other injuries, combat, World Trade Center attack, etc.). In
      addition, this study hopes to determine whether a common human genetic single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) in a growth factor, brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF SNP
      (Val66Met), predicts treatment response to PTSD.

      Patients living in areas that are not geographically proximal to the Weill-Cornell Medical
      Center New York City campus will receive cognitive behavioral therapy using telemedicine
      (videoconferencing technology).

      Overall, this study aims 1) to determine if subjects administered DCS show a significantly
      larger decrease in symptoms of PTSD as compared to those administered a placebo, 2) to
      determine if subjects administered DCS show a decrease in PTSD symptomatology significantly
      earlier (as measured by weeks) than those administered a placebo, 3) to determine if
      differences in symptomatology are evident at a 6-month follow-up and indicate long-term
      differences between groups, 4) to determine if the BDNF SNP predicts treatment response, 5)to
      determine if it is feasible and acceptable to provide imaginal exposure (IE) therapy for PTSD
      using videoconferencing technology.

      Following an initial assessment evaluating eligibility for the study, eligible participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: imaginal exposure (IE) plus DCS
      (100mg) or IE plus placebo (sugar pill). DCS is a broad spectrum antibiotic that has recently
      been implicated as a cognitive enhancer and may enhance the treatment that occurs. The
      participant, assessor and treating clinicians will be blinded to which pill the participant
      is receiving. The dose of medication will need to be taken only on the days of therapy
      sessions during which the exposure occurs (approximately 9 times). Both groups will be
      treated with a standardized cognitive-behavioral exposure therapy protocol utilizing
      gold-standard treatment, consisting of 12-14 weekly individual (one-on-one) sessions with a
      highly qualified clinical psychologist. Treatment interventions include imaginal exposure,
      graduated in vivo exposure, psycho-education, relaxation training, behavioral activation, and
      cognitive restructuring. Assessments will occur prior to treatment, following sessions 3, 6
      and 10, following completion of treatment, and 6 months after the conclusion of treatment. In
      addition, all participants will be genotyped once for the BDNF SNP (Val66Met) using a
      non-invasive saliva sample.
