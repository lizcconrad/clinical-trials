      The study is a phase I, open, randomised, crossover, single dose pharmacokinetic study
      performed in a single centre. The study consists of 2 treatment periods, during which the
      study subjects will receive the test product and the reference product in a randomised order.
      During both treatment periods, the study subjects will receive 1 mg of alprazolam as a single
      oral dose administered after a high-calorie, high-fat meal. Following an overnight fast of at
      least 10 hours, the study subjects will eat the standardised meal 30 minutes prior to
      administration of the study treatments. Blood samples will be drawn during both treatment
      periods.

      The duration of the study per subject will be approximately 5 weeks and at most 9 weeks
      including a screening visit, 2 treatment periods with a wash-out between the study treatment
      administrations and a post-treatment period.

             electrocardiogram [ECG] and vital signs) that may interfere with the interpretation of
             test results or cause a health risk for the subject if he/she participates in the
             study, as judged by the investigator.
