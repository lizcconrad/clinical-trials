  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study using a 3 + 3 design to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered GDC-0941 administered QD.
      This study will include patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, NHL, or
      multiple myeloma (MM) (expansion stage only) for which standard therapy either does not exist
      or has proven ineffective or intolerable.

             women while participating in the study

          -  For patients participating in Stage 1 after an adequate exposure has been predicted or
             observed on the basis of PK analysis and for approximately 12 patients participating
             in Stage 2 (excluding patients with MM): A biopsy-accessible lesion from which tissue
             can be obtained safely with CT guidance or direct visualization and agreement from the
             patient to undergo sequential (pre-treatment and post-treatment) biopsies.

          -  For patients participating in Stage 2 DCE-MRI and MRS imaging: Patients will have at
             least one metastatic liver lesion measuring &gt;= 5 cm in one dimension or one tumor
             lesion elsewhere measuring &gt;= 2 cm in one dimension (lung and mediastinum lesions do
