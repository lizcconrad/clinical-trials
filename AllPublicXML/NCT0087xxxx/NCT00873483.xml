          -  Normal cervical smear not requiring further follow-up (a cervical smear has to be
             taken at screening visit or a normal result has to be documented within the previous 6
             months)

          -  History of regular cyclic menstrual periods

          -  Willingness to use non-hormonal methods of contraception during the entire study.

             lactation before start of treatment)

          -  Hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drug

          -  Significant skin reaction to transdermal preparations or sensitivity to
             surgical/medical tape

          -  Any diseases or conditions that can compromise the function of the body systems and
             could result in altered absorption, excessive accumulation, impaired metabolism, or
             altered excretion of the study drug (e.g., known skin disease with suspected
             alteration of dermal absorption or poor adherence of the patch such as psoriasis)

          -  Any disease or condition that may worsen under hormonal treatment.
