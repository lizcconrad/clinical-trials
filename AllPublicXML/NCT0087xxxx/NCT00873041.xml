    <textblock>
      CICL670A2209: This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in
      non-transfusion dependent thalassemia patients with iron overload. Patients will be treated
      either with active treatment (deferasirox) or placebo for 12 months (core study phase).
      Patients who complete the core study phase will be offered to continue their study with the
      active treatment (deferasirox) in a 12 months extension phase. During the core and extension,
      the effects of treatment on iron overload in the liver will be evaluated using magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) assessments.

      CICL670A2209E1: A one-year open-label extension to a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, phase II study to evaluate efficacy and safety of deferasirox in
      non-transfusion dependent thalassemia patients with iron overload (Thalassa).
