    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 520 treatment-naive and 150 treatment-experienced patients to take
      the first line or second line of antiviral therapy. This study aims to set up a well-trained
      clinical and laboratory team in China, to explore the effects and side-effects of the
      first-line and the second line of ARV treatment in Chinese HIV/AIDS adult patients, to
      investigate the side-effects of ARV drugs, such as hepatotoxicity, lipoatrophy,
      cardiovascular influence, to explore the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of Chinese
      generic ARV regiments and effective drug concentrations and to explore primary and secondary
      drug resistance in China and the immune reconstitution characters of long term ARV in Chinese
      adult AIDS patients. This study might provide more practical and optimizing prove for the
      treatment guideline for resource limited areas.

      Three arms will be studied in this research, 520 naive-treatment patients would be randomized
      to two groups, taking the generic drugs 3TC+D4T+NVP or AZT+3TC+NVP, 6 months later half of
      the 3TC+D4T+NVP group will switch to AZT+3TC+NVP, in order to observe the efficiency and
      safety of the first line drugs. Arm 2 will recruit 100 patients who are taking ARV for about
      three years already. Arm 3 will recruit 150 patients who have a Viral load of more than 1000
      copies/ml, i.e., drug resistance. The second line drug 3TC+TDF+LPV/RTV will given to them and
      the safety and efficiency will be observed. All patients should be explored in terms of the
      clinical features, drugs side-effects, and immunological and viral response. The drug
      concentration and the metabolism changes would be explored also. Also the immune
      reconstitution will be studied for all patients. This study will be the first large-scale,
      multicentered, randomised, prospective ARV therapy study in China for HIV/AIDs patients. The
      result would provide proves for further practical antiviral therapy for China or other
      resource limited countries.
