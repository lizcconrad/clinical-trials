    <textblock>
      FDA has accepted atypical antipsychotics of olanzapine and aripiprazole as the adjuvant
      medications for refractory major depression. But there is still no trial about atypical
      antipsychotics combined with antidepressant of SSRI used in fresh major depressive patients.
      This project aims to compare the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline with or without
      low-dosed aripiprazole added in fresh major depression.

      This double-blind, placebo-control, fixed dose, randomized study will be conducted at a
      tertiary clinical setting. Patients over 18 y/o fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for major
      depression, having a baseline HAM-D score ≧ 14 and a HAM-D item 3 score ＜ 3 will be recruited
      into the groups. The study group of patients will receive ten weeks of treatment with a
      combination of fix-dosed sertraline and aripiprazole. The control group will received
      sertraline only. The score reduction in HAM-D17, CGI, SF-36 and Brief Symptom Rating Scale
      (BSRS-50) will be periodically estimated as an efficacy following the use of a SSRIs or and
      aripiprazole.
