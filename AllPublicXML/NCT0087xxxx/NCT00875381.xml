    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate and define the mean number, degree of confluence,
      and depth of penetration of melanocytes in chronically sun exposed skin of the head and neck
      using Mart-1 immunostains on frozen sections. The study was conducted to confirm whether
      similar results were found using permanent sections. The present study used hematoxaline and
      eosin (H&amp;E) staining as well as Mart-1 staining, and included patients from both Mayo Clinic
      Jacksonville and Rochester.

      For each study participant we recorded their age, sex, state they lived in, tumor type, tumor
      location, recent sun exposure (during the two weeks prior to the surgery), whether or not a
      follicle was present on the slide, and if so the follicular extension (mm) from the granular
      layer, presence of atypia, nesting, pagetoid spread. Two slides were obtained; one stained
      with Mart-1; the other with H&amp;E. For both, melanocyte counts per high power field (400 X HPF
      magnification) were obtained in three locations of the slide. The mean of the 3 counts was
      used for analysis, though the individual counts were considered in some data summaries (see
      below). Classification of photo-aging according to the Glogau scale was noted by the surgeon
      as type1: &quot;no wrinkles&quot;; type II &quot;wrinkles in motion&quot;; type III &quot;wrinkles at rest&quot; and type
      IV &quot;only wrinkles.&quot; Confluence was categorized by the number of adjacent melanocytes as none,
      mild (2 side-by-side), moderate (3-6), or severe (7 or more).

    <measure>The mean number of melanocytes per high power field for Mart-1 was 12.7 in FL and 11.2 in MN. Using H&amp;E, the means were 10.3 and 8.3 for FL and MN respectively.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of higher means in FL than in MN after adjusting for age and gender (p&lt;0.001 for H&amp;E, p=0.08 for Mart-1) and strong evidence of an increase in observed numbers of melanocytes with use of the Mart-1 stain compared to the H&amp;E stain (p&lt;0.001)</measure>

      The proposed dog-ears excised, that were to be discarded during reconstruction, were
      evaluated for the presence of any visible lesions (i.e. ephelid, lentigo, seborrheic
      keratosis, nevi). Dog-ears with any skin lesions were excluded. The specimens were inked by
      the surgeon on the side to be cut by the histotechnician. The specimens were placed in
      formalin bottles and submitted to the pathology department at Mayo Clinic Rochester for
      processing. The tissue was cut (4 microns) along its long access and stained with routine H&amp;
      E and Mart-1 (MelanA) immunostains.
