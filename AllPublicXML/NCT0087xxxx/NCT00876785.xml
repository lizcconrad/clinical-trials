  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to investigate subjective appetite during 8 hours after
      intake of iso-caloric rye bread breakfasts varying in dietary fiber composition and content.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Energy-dense foods that require little effort to consume and that are rapidly digested may
      cause passive over-consumption by failure to provide a feeling of fullness corresponding to
      the energy content. A diet that is predominantly based on such foods may lead to overweight.
      It is therefore important to identify properties of foods that facilitate energy balance by
      creating a high satiety per calorie. A number of studies have confirmed that foods naturally
      rich in dietary fiber promote the feeling of fullness and reduce hunger in the short term.

    <description>A randomised, within-subject comparison design was used. Appetite (hunger, satiety and desire to eat) was rated regularly from just before breakfast at 08:00 until 16:00. Amount, type and timing of food and drink intake during the study period were standardised.</description>
