  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective multicenter study is to assess any fracture
      fixation complication and revision rates during the clinical use of the Proximal Femoral Nail
      Antirotation Asia (PFNA Asia) for the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From several studies, e.g. on hip prostheses, it is known that the Asian population has other
      geometric proportions than Caucasians, e.g. Japanese woman have shorter femoral necks,
      smaller femoral neck angles and a more anterior bowing of the shaft than white Americans.
      This was one of the reasons for the development of a new PFNA Asia with adapted sizes and
      geometry. No controlled clinical data are available whether the rate of mismatch and
      mismatch-related complications could be reduced.
