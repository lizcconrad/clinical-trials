    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, non-interventional post-marketing surveillance study is to
      obtain data on safety and efficacy of Levitra in routine treatment of erectile dysfunction.
      Furthermore, the data collection particularly focuses on the experience of the patient and
      his satisfaction with the treatment. Treatment naive patients as well as pre-treated patients
      will be included in the study.The maximum observation period per patient is 12 months.Besides
      the physician's documentation, the patient should fill out a questionnaire at every visit.
      The questionnaires will be handed out and collected by the physician. Furthermore, an
      additional questionnaire for the patient's partner can be distributed at each visit in case
      the partner is willing to participate.
