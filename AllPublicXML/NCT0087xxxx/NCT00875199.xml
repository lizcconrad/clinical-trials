  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and provide preliminary evidence for
      efficacy of a 12-week contingency management intervention to promote weight loss in
      overweight and obese low income adults in a community-based clinic. The study has three
      primary goals: (a) to determine if the contingency management treatment can be effectively
      applied to a new application, weight loss; (b) to obtain preliminary evidence for contingency
      management's efficacy in promoting weight loss and improving treatment retention, diet
      quality, physical activity levels, and self efficacy; and (c) to identify barriers and
      challenges to implementing contingency management for weight loss among low income patients.

    <description>Participants assigned to Group A will receive the DPP manual (Wing &amp; Gillis, 1996), a behavioral weight-loss program with demonstrated efficacy in facilitating weight loss. Participants in Group A will be instructed to read a section of the manual each week and complete suggested activities. They will also meet with the research staff once a week for weigh-in and supportive counseling.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to Group B will receive the DPP manual and will meet with research staff each week for weigh-in and supportive counseling. They will also receive contingency management or the opportunity to earn draws with the chance of winning prizes for losing weight and completing healthy activities.</description>
