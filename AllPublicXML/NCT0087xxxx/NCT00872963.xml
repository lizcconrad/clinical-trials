  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is one of the leading causes of deaths in children below five years old. Despite
      antimalarial drugs and insecticide treated bed nets, the established means of treatment and
      protection, malaria still continues to affect many children. A malaria vaccine would be a
      very effective way of reducing malaria infection in the community. RTS,S/AS01E is a leading
      malaria vaccine candidate which is being developed for children in Africa. The investigators
      have done a study to find out if this vaccine is effective in reducing infection by malaria
      in children aged 5-17 months living in Kenya and Tanzania. The follow up of the original
      study was 14-18 months. The extended follow up is proposed to continue for another four
      years.

      The RTS,S/AS01E candidate malaria vaccine is being developed for the routine immunization of
      infants and children living in malaria-endemic areas as part of the Expanded Program of
      Immunization (EPI). 30% efficacy against clinical malaria and 58% efficacy against severe
      malaria disease was seen with a related vaccine, RTS,S/AS02A, in children aged 1 to 4 years
      (Malaria-026) in Mozambique. The efficacy against clinical malaria and infection was
      sustained beyond 18 months. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccines have been developed in parallel with the
      RTS,S/AS02 vaccines, and differ in the adjuvant formulation which has been shown to be more
      immunogenic.The utility of a partially effective vaccination depends heavily on the overall
      effect of malaria incidence during a childâ€Ÿs acquisition of natural immunity. However, other
      cohorts vaccinated in Phase II studies have already discontinued follow up for episodes of
      malaria, and the planned Phase III studies will run for at most 30 months post vaccination.
      The proposed extended follow up is expected to run for four years and will inform the design
      of Phase 4 studies and may prove critical in informing public health policy once the vaccine
      is licensed.

        The local population is predominantly from Mijikenda ethnic group. The study area is within
        Kilifi District at the Kenyan coast and majority are subsistence farmers.Kilifi District
        experiences long rains in May-July and short rains in November/December. Measured
        Entomological Inoculation Rates in the area vary from 10-50 per year.
