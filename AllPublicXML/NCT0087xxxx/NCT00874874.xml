      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with
      angiosarcoma that is locally advanced, metastatic, or unable to be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of non-progression at 9 months in patients with unresectable, locally
           advanced, or metastatic angiosarcoma treated with sorafenib tosylate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of non-progression at 60, 120, and 180 days.

        -  Determine the median time to progression.

        -  Determine overall survival.

        -  Determine the best response rate.

        -  Determine the clinical and biological factors that predict clinical benefit.

        -  Evaluate tolerability by NCI CTCAE v3.0.

        -  Correlate efficacy with plasma expression of genes implicated in controlling
           angiogenesis.

        -  Explore the tumor expression of these genes in tissue from a tumor bank.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to disease type (cutaneous angiosarcoma [scalp, breast, or
      soft tissue] vs visceral angiosarcoma). All patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice
      daily for 9 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
