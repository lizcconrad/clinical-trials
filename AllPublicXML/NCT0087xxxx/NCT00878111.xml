  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to document the safety and antivascular effect of
      escalating doses of NGR-hTNF, from 60 mcg/sqm to 325 mcg/sqm, in patients affected by
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors not amenable of standard therapies.

      Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to NCI-CTCAE
      criteria (version 4.02).

    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical studies provide the support that NGR-TNF is endowed with a higher therapeutic
      index in animal models and studies of the mechanism of action showed that NGR-TNF can induce
      tumour necrosis when used at relatively high doses.

      Recently, a phase I dose-escalation study of NGR-hTNF has explored the dose range between 0.2
      and 60 µg/m2, showing DLT at 60 mcg/m2 experienced as transient acute infusion reaction few
      minutes after the first administration start. Considering the relationship with the infusion
      of these events, a further dose escalation will be explored in the present phase I study by
      using both a longer infusion time (i.e., 120 minutes instead of 60 minutes) and a mild
      premedication.

      The first cohort (n=4) of patients will be treated with NGR-hTNF administered at 60 mcg/m2 IV
      every three weeks, that is a dose level 33% higher than MTD and recommended dose selected in
      the previous phase I trial (i.e., 45 mcg/m2). If ≤1 of 4 patients experience DLT during the
      first cycle, following cohorts will be treated with escalating doses (from 80 to 325 mcg/m2)
      of NGR-hTNF IV every three weeks.
