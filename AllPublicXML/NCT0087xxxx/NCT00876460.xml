  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To confirm the safety of BIBF 1120 at a dose level up to 200 mg x 2/day (i.e., overseas
      recommended Phase III dose for combination treatment) with standard therapy of docetaxel (60
      mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2) in Japanese advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with
      stage IIIB/IV or recurrent after failure of first line chemotherapy and to determine the
      recommended dose for the Phase II trial.

    <description>Number of participants experienced Dose Limited Toxicity (DLT) in combination therapy of nintedanib and docetaxel.
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nintedanib combination with docetaxel were to be determined separately in the patient groups of body surface area (BSA) &lt;1.5 m2 and BSA ≥1.5 m2. The MTD were to be determined as a combination of a dose equal to or less than 200 mg b.i.d. of nintedanib and 60 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks of docetaxel at which either 0 out of 3, 1 out of 6, or 2 out of 6 patients experienced DLT.</description>

        <description>Number of participants experienced Dose Limited Toxicity (DLT) in combination therapy of nintedanib and docetaxel.
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nintedanib combination with docetaxel were to be determined separately in the patient groups of body surface area (BSA) &lt;1.5 m2 and BSA ≥1.5 m2. The MTD were to be determined as a combination of a dose equal to or less than 200 mg b.i.d. of nintedanib and 60 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks of docetaxel at which either 0 out of 3, 1 out of 6, or 2 out of 6 patients experienced DLT.</description>

        <description>For participants with known date of discontinuation of the study treatment (or progression [not necessarily confirmed by tumour imaging; can also be based on any clinical sign of tumour progression] or death): TTF [days] = earlier of date of discontinuation of the study treatment, progression, or death – date the study treatment started + 1.
