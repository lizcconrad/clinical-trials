  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in patients with advanced breast cancer is to compare the incidence
      and severity of neuropathy adverse events for the two treatment groups (eribulin versus
      ixabepilone) using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (NCI CTCAE version 3.0) grading.
