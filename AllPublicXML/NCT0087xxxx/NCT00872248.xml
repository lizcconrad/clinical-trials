    <textblock>
      The restless leg syndromes is a common sensorimotor disorder of unknown cause affecting
      approximately 10% of the population. Different literature had different views on the
      association between neuraxial anesthesia and the occurrence of restless leg syndrome. Some
      reported that spinal anesthesia induced postoperative restless leg syndrome, but other
      studies showed that spinal and general anesthesia all two did not cause restless leg
      syndrome. A potential difference amongst these studies is that a big difference exists in
      surgical types. The investigators proposed that different types of surgery performed
      undergoing various anesthesia, and that there is a big difference in original
      pathophysiological condition. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that pregnant women
      who have special physical states would have had an association between neuraxial anesthesia
      and restless leg syndrome in such patients who received selective cesarean section undergoing
      spinal or epidural anesthesia.
