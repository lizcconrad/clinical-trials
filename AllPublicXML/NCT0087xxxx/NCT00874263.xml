  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recently developed endoscopic Confocal probe microscopy system allows imaging of surface
      epithelium during ongoing endoscopy (upper and lower) with the potential of immediate
      diagnosis of various GI pre-malignant and malignant lesions. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if using this new Confocal probe system can find pre-cancerous abnormalities in the
      stomach and colon.

      Hypothesis: The confocal endomicroscopy images of colorectal lesions during the standard
      colonoscopies could help the classification in vivo of colorectal neoplastic and
      non-neoplastic lesions. This could direct further endoscopic interventions such as targeted
      biopsies of early colorectal cancer lesions and the endoscopic resection of such lesions
      during screening colonoscopies.

      Primary Aim

        1. To determine the key confocal image features of neoplastic and pre-neoplastic colorectal
           lesions including flat and raised adenomatous polyps, intraepithelial neoplasia and
           cancer as well as benign lesions such as hyperplastic polyps and normal colonic
           epithelium and to estimate which morphologic features best distinguish neoplastic and
           non-neoplastic tissues.

           Secondary Aims:

        2. To determine the initial sensitivity and specificity of confocal microendoscopy imaging
           for classification of adenomatous from hyperplastic polyps of the colon.

        3. In this exploratory phase of the study to develop a library of confocal microendoscopic
           imaging characteristics of other GI pathologies such as:

             1. Barrett's esophagus in comparison to Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia, and normal
                squamous esophagus.

             2. Other encountered inflammatory and neoplastic conditions within the GI tract in
                which biopsy or removal of tissue would routinely be indicated.

      The second phase of the study will focus on establishing the sensitivities, specificities,
      accuracy of confocal images of colorectal lesions and other GI pathologies as well as
      inter-observer agreement and learning curve in interpretation of confocal images.

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the U.S.
      Although removal of pre-malignant polyps has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal
      cancer, up to 50% of removed colonic polyps are hyperplastic with no malignant potential.
      Removal of these benign polyps exposes the patient to polypectomy-related complications and
      cost without any benefit. Current standard endoscopes with the use of accessory confocal
      endomicroscopy probe will allow both routine and confocal microscopy imaging. Colonoscopies
      or upper endoscopies will be performed as routine including conscious sedation. A special
      fiber through the scope, combined with a small amount of dye called fluorescein given by
      vein, will be used to obtain microscopic views during the endoscopic procedure. If a
      colorectal lesion or other GI lesion is found that would normally require biopsy, the site of
      biopsy will be evaluated by confocal imaging with the Cellvizio-GI Fiberoptic probes prior to
      biopsy or removal of the suspicious tissue. Following image acquisition, the lesion will be
      biopsied or removed as per standard clinical care. Standard endoscopic variables for each
      lesion will be recorded including: name and record number, date, time, an exact time of
      fluorescein injection and time of image acquisition, lesion location, size, and suspected
      findings (inflammation, dysplasia, type of polyp) and final histological diagnosis.

        All patients presenting to Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida for a screening, surveillance
        colonoscopy, and/or a diagnostic and surveillance upper endoscopy, will be eligible based
        on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be offered entry into the study
        on the day of the procedure in the hospital GI or Mayo Clinic Jacksonville endoscopy
