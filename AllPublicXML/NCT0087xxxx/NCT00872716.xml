  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that quetiapine XR has anxiolytic properties. The study aims to
      investigate the putative anxiolytic properties of quetiapine XR in patients with anxiety
      disorders. Therefore, in a proof-of-concept design patients with simple phobia will be
      selected to investigate specific anxiolytic and antipanic activity during acute anxiety.
      Moreover, in a combined fMRI/visual stimulus presentation paradigm activity of fear-network
      associated brain structures such as the amygdala will be investigated under treatment with
      quetiapine XR or placebo. Additionally, genetic factors potentially mediating anxiolytic
      properties of quetiapine will be studied.

             correctly such as: a hormonal oral, transdermal, or injectable contraceptive agent
             with a double-barrier method; an implantable contraceptive device with a failure rate
             less than 1% for at least 3 months prior to enrolment; vasectomized partner
