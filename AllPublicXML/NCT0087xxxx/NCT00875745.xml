  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of sorafenib and vorinostat when given
      together to see what effects (good and bad) it has on the patient and their acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This study is also being done to find the
      highest dose of sorafenib and vorinostat that can be given together without causing severe
      side effects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of AML (&gt; 20% myeloid blasts in the peripheral blood or
             bone marrow) or MDS with &gt; 10% myeloid blasts in the bone marrow. Patients with Acute
             Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) must be refractory to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and
             arsenic trioxide.

          -  The patients must have one of the following criteria:

               -  Age of 18 to 69 years; relapsed or refractory disease following at least one
                  prior therapeutic regimen; not a candidate for cytotoxic or other conventional
                  therapies due to disease refractoriness, poor performance status, or
                  co-morbidities

               -  Age of 70 years or older; received no previous therapies (other than
                  hematopoietic growth factors or hydroxyurea); not a candidate for cytotoxic or
                  other conventional therapies due to poor performance status, co-morbidities, or
                  personal preference

               -  Age of 70 years or older with relapsed or refractory disease

          -  The patient must have discontinued all previous therapies for acute leukemia for at
             least 14 days and recovered from the acute effects of the therapy.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG (Zubrod) performance status of 0-2

          -  Patients must be able to take and tolerate oral medications

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as specified in the protocol.

          -  Patients not on anti-coagulation must have an INR &lt; 1.5 and a PTT within normal
             limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers are not eligible for this trial.

          -  Patients may receive no other concurrent biologic therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy during this trial.

          -  Patients with one or more serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study. See protocol for
             listing.

          -  Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) leukemia by spinal fluid cytology,
             flow cytometry or imaging

          -  Patients with previous autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation who have
             current side effects and/or complications that in the opinion of the investigator can
             interfere with the interpretation of the toxicities.
