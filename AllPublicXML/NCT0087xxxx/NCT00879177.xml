  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In total, 260 patients with pre- and stage I hypertension, who are regular smokers, will be
      randomized to: varenicline alone or varenicline plus behavioral therapy. Patients in both
      conditions will receive varenicline (titrated to a maximal dose of 1.0 mg twice daily) for 12
      weeks along with standard smoking cessation therapy and regular carbon monoxide (CO) and
      cotinine monitoring. A significantly higher proportion of behavioral therapy patients are
      expected to achieve and maintain long durations of abstinence than patients receiving
      varenicline alone. Clinic and 24-hour blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) will be primary
      clinical outcomes. The investigators expect that BP and HR will decrease more among
      behavioral therapy than non-behavioral therapy patients and reductions in smoking may mediate
      decreases in these indices.
