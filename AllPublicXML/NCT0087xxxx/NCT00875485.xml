  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immune response against Hepatitis-A (HAV) and Hepatitis B
      surface (HBs) antigen in healthy subjects aged 12 to 15 years (at the time of primary
      vaccination), who received vaccination course with GSK Biologicals' Twinrix Adult and Twinrix
      Junior vaccine, approximately 10 years ago in the primary study. The subjects will be invited
      for blood sampling at 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 years after primary vaccination to evaluate the
      persistence of immune response. For subjects detected with decreased immunity, the presence
      of immune memory against hepatitis A &amp; B antigens will be investigated by the administration
      of a challenge dose of the appropriate vaccine 6 to 12 months after the Year 15 follow-up
      time-point.

      No new subjects will be recruited during this booster phase of the study.

Note: A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following complete retesting and reanalysis for years 11 to 13. Results of year 14 and year 15 were only analysed by CLIA.</description>

        <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any was defined as an adverse event (AE) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms was reported as an unsolicited adverse event. Grade 3 = AE that prevented normal activity. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>
