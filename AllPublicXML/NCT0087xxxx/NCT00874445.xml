    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the defibrillation efficacy between the 50/50% tilt
      biphasic waveform and the Tuned biphasic waveform in a single coil active can configuration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been one prospective study that found some benefit of using tuned waveforms over
      50/50% tilt waveforms.11 Other studies have failed to show much change in defibrillation
      efficacy with different duration biphasic waveforms. A vast majority of patients in these
      studies were tested with dual coil leads. Although dual coil leads can lower defibrillation
      thresholds, it is known that dual coil leads can make the lead extraction difficult, lead to
      venous obstruction and are more prone to failure. Results from a recent study showed that
      that a single coil configuration is adequate in a vast majority of patients when DFT testing
      was performed with tuned waveforms. This makes the use of single-coil leads during ICD/ CRT-D
      implants an attractive option.

      Theoretical analysis has shown that difference between the tuned and 50% tilt waveforms is
      amplified at high impedance levels with tuned waveforms being superior (unpublished).
      Accordingly, this study has been designed to prospectively compare the DFT estimates with
      tuned and 50% tilt waveforms in left-sided, active pectoral defibrillation lead systems when
      the SVC coil has been turned OFF or is not part of the shocking circuit.
