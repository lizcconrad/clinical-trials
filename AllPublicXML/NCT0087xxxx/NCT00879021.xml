    <textblock>
      This research study will test to see if people who receive pregabalin after their spinal cord
      injury will develop less nerve damage pain than people who do not receive it.

    <textblock>
      Pregabalin is one of the few agents that have demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of
      central NeP in SCI. Research is now proving that it is possible to prevent the development of
      pain in certain conditions. Pregabalin has been proven effective in this area with post
      surgical pain. Therefore, after traumatic SCI there may be a small window of time where we
      could prevent the development of NeP by administering an agent like Pregabalin.

      Objective: To test the hypothesis that pregabalin is an effective treatment in preventing
      post-spinal cord injury neuropathic pain.

      Design: double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, trial Setting: Spinal cord injury
      program, neurosurgery and tertiary care rehabilitation center Subjects: 30 patients with
      acute traumatic spinal cord injury Method: Pregabalin will be offered to patients with acute
      traumatic spinal cord injury pain in a double blind crossover, placebo control design.

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures will be the development of Neuropathic
      Pain and intensity of pain Secondary outcome measures will be Ashworth's Scale for spasticity
      and ASIA motor and Sensory Scores.

      Results: To be determined. Conclusion: To be determined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants will be 18 years of age or older

          -  Have suffered a traumatic spinal cord injury (complete or incomplete)

          -  Be free of Neuropathic pain

          -  Be in stable medical condition

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women: Because we do not know the risks of pregabalin in
             pregnancy, females of child bearing years must have a negative pregnancy test
             (performed on screening and subsequent follow up visits) and be using a reliable
             method of birth control including oral or injectible birth control hormones, barriers,
             intrauterine devices or tubal ligation, or abstinence throughout the duration of the
             study.

          -  Should a female become pregnant while participating in the study she will be
             un-blinded and, if on pregabalin, she will be weaned from the medication as quickly as
             is safe and withdrawn from the study. Appropriate follow-up for any pregnancy
             complications will be conducted.

          -  Persons with known hypersensitivity to pregabalin or its constituents

          -  Persons with Neuropathic pain at the time of enrollment

          -  Persons with a chronic pain diagnoses that may interfere with the evaluation of the
             presence of Neuropathic pain
