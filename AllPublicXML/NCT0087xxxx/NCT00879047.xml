  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed studies will examine the extent of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      interactions between alcohol and various antiretroviral therapies in those with HIV/AIDS,
      HIV/HCV co-infection, mild HCV and healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to improve the clinical care of human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV)-infected or HIV/Hepatitis C (HCV) co-infected, alcohol-using patients by
      identifying significant interactions which may occur between drugs commonly used to treat HIV
      disease known to be cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inducers or inhibitors and alcohol, the most
      frequently abused substance in the United States. We hypothesize that concomitant use of
      alcohol and currently utilized antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be associated with
      significant drug interactions including alteration of alcohol and ART pharmacokinetics as
      well as altered responses to alcohol administration. We plan to conduct alcohol and ART
      administration studies in 6 study samples (n=10 each): 1. those with HIV/AIDS and eligible
      for efavirenz-containing HAART, 2. those with HIV/AIDS and eligible for a ritonavir-boosted
      protease inhibitor based HAART, 3. those with HIV/AIDS and HCV eligible for an
      efavirenz-containing HAART, 4. those with HIV/AIDS and HCV eligible for a ritonavir-boosted
      protease inhibitor regimen, 5. healthy subjects taking clinically relevant doses of maraviroc
      and 6. those with mild HCV taking clinically relevant doses of maraviroc. Pharmacokinetics,
      subjective, and cognitive data will be serially collected over the course of study sessions
      where either alcohol or placebo is administered prior to and following ART. Data collected
      will elucidate the presence and clinical significance of drug interactions, both
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, between alcohol and ART in these populations.
