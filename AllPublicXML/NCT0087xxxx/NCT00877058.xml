  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study &quot;Elderly person in the risk zone&quot; form part of the research programme
      &quot;Support for frail elderly persons - from prevention to palliation&quot; (www.
      Vardalinstitutet.net) which comprises research into three interventions. A fundamental
      principle in the research programme is that it comprises interventions addressing frail
      elderly person in different phases of the disablement process, from elderly persons who are
      beginning to develop frailty to very frail elderly persons receiving palliative care in the
      final period of their lives. The interventions also address the different requirements that
      arise with regard to professional contributions during the various phases of the ageing and
      disease process, ranging from health promotion to a need for an increasing degree of medical
      care, nursing, special care and rehabilitation, and finally, efforts that promote symptom
      relief, quality of life, security and satisfaction with care during the final period of life.
      The intervention &quot;Elderly persons in the risk zone&quot; addresses elderly persons that are on the
      point of developing frailty (&quot;pre-frail&quot;) and are beginning to feel that they are being
      hindered from taking part in everyday activities. The hypothesis is that if an intervention
      is made when the persons are not so frail, it is possible to prevent/delay deterioration.

        1. Can a health-promoting and preventive intervention for &quot;prefrail&quot; elderly persons:

             -  prevent frailty, activity limitations and morbidity,

             -  be a supportive factor in the social and physical environment,

             -  affect life satisfaction

             -  have an impact on the consumption of care

             -  be cost-effective?

        2. How do the frail elderly persons experience the intervention and its importance to
           health?

    <description>ADL stair case:
Independence of, or dependence on, another person in ADL was assessed according to a cumulative scale of well-defined personal and instrumental activities, the ADL staircase. Nine out of the ten original activities were used; Cleaning, shopping, transportation, cooking, bathing, dressing, going to the toilet, transfer, and feeding (0-9). Dependence was defined as another person being involved in the activity by giving personal or directive assistance. People living together were assessed as independent if they performed the activity when alone. The number of partipants with dependence in two or more ADL at follow-up have been analyzed</description>

    <description>Preventive home visits: This intervention included a single home visit made by either a nurse, a physiotherapist, a qualified social worker or an occupational therapist. Participants received verbal and written information/advice about what the districts could provide. The preventive home visit was guided by a protocol, which included an opportunity for individuals to further elaborate on certain elements. The visit lasted between one and a half to two hours.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The senior meetings comprised four weekly meetings with about six participants in each group. The main purpose was to focus on two different topics: 1) information about the ageing process and its consequences and 2) provision of tools and strategies for solving problems that can arise in the home environment. A follow-up home visit took place two to three weeks after the group sessions were completed. The group meetings were led either by an occupational therapist, a registered nurse, a physiotherapist or a qualified social worker, all of whom spoke about their particular dimension of aging.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group had access to the ordinary range of services if requested from the urban districts for the aged. The aim of the municipal provision of care for the older persons is to ensure the ability to live as independently as possible. This includes remaining in their homes. When an older person in Sweden has difficulties managing independently, she or he can apply for assistance from the district. The extent of such support is subject to an assessment of needs and includes meals on wheels, help with cleaning and shopping, assistance with personal care, safety alarms and transportation service. The older person are also offered healthcare, provided either by municipal home help or home medical care services.</description>

Independence of, or dependence on, another person in ADL was assessed according to a cumulative scale of well-defined personal and instrumental activities, the ADL staircase. Nine out of the ten original activities were used; Cleaning, shopping, transportation, cooking, bathing, dressing, going to the toilet, transfer, and feeding (0–9). Dependence was defined as another person being involved in the activity by giving personal or directive assistance. People living together were assessed as independent if they performed the activity when alone.

The main purpose was to focus on two different topics: 1) information about the ageing process and its consequences and 2) provision of tools and strategies for solving problems that can arise in the home environment. A follow-up home visit took place two to three weeks after the group sessions were completed. The group meetings were led either by an occupational therapist, a registered nurse, a physiotherapist or a qualified social worker, all of whom spoke about their particular dimension of aging. They jointly planned and carried out the intervention and were responsible for their specific part of the meetings. T The participants' experiences formed the basis of the meetings.

          <title>2 Senior Meetings</title>
          <description>The intervention senior meetings comprised four weekly meetings with about six participants in each group. The main purpose was to focus on two different topics: 1) information about the ageing process and its consequences and 2) provision of tools and strategies for solving problems that can arise in the home environment. A follow-up home visit took place two to three weeks after the group sessions were completed. The group meetings were led either by an occupational therapist, a registered nurse, a physiotherapist or a qualified social worker, all of whom spoke about their particular dimension of aging. They jointly planned and carried out the intervention and were responsible for their specific part of the meetings. T The participants' experiences formed the basis of the meetings. A booklet was especially produced for the meetings, which includes texts that cover different areas of health, discussed at each of the meetings (table 1). http://www.vardalinstitutet.net/livslots.pdf.</description>

          <title>3 Control Group</title>
          <description>The control group had access to the ordinary range of services if requested from the urban districts for the aged. The aim of the municipal provision of care for the older persons is to ensure the ability to live as independently as possible. This includes remaining in their homes. When an older person in Sweden has difficulties managing independently, she or he can apply for assistance from the district. The extent of such support is subject to an assessment of needs and includes meals on wheels, help with cleaning and shopping, assistance with personal care, safety alarms and transportation service. The older person are also offered healthcare, provided either by municipal home help or home medical care services.</description>
