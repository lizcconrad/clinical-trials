    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of commercially manufactured exenatide once weekly and
      exenatide BID in subjects whose type 2 diabetes is managed with diet and exercise alone or
      with oral antidiabetic medications. The study will examine glycemic control (as measured by
      HbA1C), safety, and tolerability.
