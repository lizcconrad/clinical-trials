  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to SCH 727965 or a comparator drug (bortezomib for mantle
      cell lymphoma [MCL] or alemtuzumab for B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [B CLL]). Part 1
      of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants with MCL and
      participants with B-CLL. Part 2 of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965
      treatment in participants who experienced disease progression after standard treatment with
      the comparator drug during Part 1.
