    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, partially blinded phase 2 pilot study. Multicenter study
      (approximately 50 centers) in approximately 9 countries. Proposed start date is December
      2008. The study duration per patient is estimated to be 90 days. Overall study duration is
      estimated to be 12-18 months.

      This is a randomized, placebo‐controlled, multi‐center, partially blinded [i.e., 100 mcg and
      200 mcg IC43 with Al(OH)3,, respectively] and placebo, but unblinded for non‐adjuvanted IC43
      [i.e., 100 mcg w/o Al(OH)3] phase 2 pilot study. The study population consists of male or
      female ICU patients with a need for mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, aged
      between 18 and 80 years.
