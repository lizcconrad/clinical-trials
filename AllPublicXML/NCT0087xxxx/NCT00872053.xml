      The primary aim of this study is to:

        1. Collect pilot data on the effect of task-specific lower extremity training using the
           Anklebot on subjects with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and who have foot drop;

        2. Collect pilot data on the use of combination therapy on improving gait in subjects with
           MS. This therapy will use both Anklebot training and robot-assisted gait training.

      Hypothesis: Both trainings will result in improved walking performance, but the combination
      therapy will result in greater gains than ankle training alone.
