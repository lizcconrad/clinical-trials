    <textblock>
      The study aims to prospectively prove the equivalence of the test product and the reference
      solution in lowering intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and ocular
      hypertension. For this purpose the patients are randomized into two sequences of study drug
      administration in a crossover study with an adequate wash-out period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients of any race aged 18 years or older

          -  A clinical diagnosis of open angle glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion
             glaucoma, or ocular hypertension in one or both eyes

          -  IOP controllable on one drug treatment in the study eye in way that assures clinical
             stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study

          -  Baseline IOP between 18 and 32 mmHg in the study eye (in eyes not included in the
             study IOP must have been controllable on no pharmacologic treatment or on the study
             medicine only)

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or better in the study eye(s)

          -  Ability of subject to understand character and individual consequences of clinical
             trial

          -  Signed and dated informed consent of the subject must be available before start of any
             specific trial procedures

          -  Women with childbearing potential have to practicing a medically accepted
             contraception during trial and a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) should be
             existent before trial. Reliable contraception are systemic contraceptives (oral,
             implant, injection) and diaphragm or condoms with spermicidal. Women that are sterile
             by surgery or for more than two years postmenopausal can be participate in the trial.

          -  Current ocular infection, i.e. conjunctivitis or keratitis

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry

          -  Intraocular surgery or laser treatment within the past three months

          -  Inability to discontinue contact lens wear during the study

          -  Use of any systemic medication that would affect IOP with less than a

             1-month stable dosing regimen before the screening visit

          -  Pregnancy and lactation

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or to any drug
             with similar chemical structure or to any excipient present in the pharmaceutical form
             of the investigational medicinal product

          -  Participation in other clinical trials during the present clinical trial or within the
             last four weeks

          -  Medical or psychological condition that would not permit completion of the trial or
             signing of informed consent
