      The goal of this study is to see if it is safe and feasible to give chemotherapy, natural
      killer (NK) cells, and an antibody called 3F8. The NK cells must come from a family member
      who shares half of the HLA proteins which are immune proteins important in transplant. NK
      cells are a type of white blood cell. They can recognize and kill abnormal cells in the body
      and can work together with antibodies to kill target cells. The antibody 3F8 specifically
      recognizes a protein present on the target cancer cell.

    <description>This is a phase I study to assess the safety and feasibility of combining HLA-mismatched (KIR ligand incompatible) NK cells with 3F8 in high-risk NB patients. Following chemotherapy, patients will be treated in sequential groups of 3 patients/dose of NK cells. Four dose levels of NK cells, starting at dose level I, will be evaluated in this treatment protocol. In the unlikely case toxicity is encountered at dose level I, patients will then be treated at the lower dose level 0. Patients can receive up to 3 cycles of treatment on protocol. For subsequent cycles, patients will be treated at either less than or at the same dose level of NK cells as their first cycle.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive combination chemotherapy with intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide 70mg/kg/day (for patients with body weight&lt;70kg) or 2100mg/m2/day (for patients with body weight ≥70kg) for two days, IV vincristine 0.067mg/kg or 2mg/m2/day (lower of the two doses to be chosen; maximum 2mg) for one day, and IV topotecan 2.4 mg/m2/day for 3 days during their first cycle. If receiving a second and/or third cycle, the only chemotherapy patients will receive is cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/kg/day for 2 days. On Day 0, patients will receive a single dose of allogeneic NK cells isolated from a HLA-haploidentical related donor. On day +3, the patient will start daily infusion of 3F8 for 5 days. The treatment schedule may require minor adjustment by ±1 day as clinically indicated (e.g. due to PDH closure for holidays or due to inclement weather).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of NB as defined by international criteria, i.e., histopathology (confirmed
             by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or bone marrow metastases plus high urine
             catecholamine levels

          -  High-risk NB as defined by risk-related treatment guidelines and the International NB
             Staging System,57 i.e., stage 4 with (any age) or without (&gt;365 days of age) MYCN
             amplification, MYCN-amplified stage 3 (unresectable; any age), or MYCN-amplified stage
             4S.
