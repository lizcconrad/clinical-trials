  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn injury patients undergo a series of metabolic changes that, if untreated, could lead to
      reduced health outcomes. Nutrition is thought to play a vital role in post-burn recovery. The
      research team developed a novel vitamin and mineral supplementation protocol based on current
      scientific literature. The study will test the hypothesis that the novel vitamin and mineral
      supplement regimen will improve adult patient recovery from burn injury.

    <textblock>
      Burn injury patients undergo a series of metabolic events that, if untreated, could lead to
      severe physical impairment and even death. Antioxidants minimize free radical damage by
      neutralizing the chemical reaction as well as promoting cellular repair. Currently there is
      no consistent protocol for micronutrient repletion in adult burn patients. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the current vitamin regimen in comparison to the
      novel vitamin and mineral supplementation protocol developed by the research team. Dosages
      for oral and intravenous supplementation are based on current literature. The combination of
      intravenous and enteral treatment is important due to gastrointestinal mucosal swelling
      related to post-burn fluid resuscitation. Measurable health outcomes will include rate of
      infection, length of hospital stay, mortality rate, hospital cost, number of days in
      intensive care unit, number of ventilator-dependent days and wound healing. The investigators
      hypothesize that use of the novel vitamin and mineral supplement regimen will improve adult
      burn patient outcomes.
