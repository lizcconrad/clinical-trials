      Aim:

      The study was designed to test the time dependent efficacy in plaque removal of four
      toothbrushes: one electric toothbrush, the Philips Sonicare Elite with long (A) and short (B)
      brushing head and two manual brushes, the Gaba Sensitve (C), and the ADA reference brush (D)
      and.

      Materials and Methods:

      The study was a single-blind, randomized clinical timer study consisting of four identical
      experiments testing each brush in one quadrant. The distribution of the quadrants and brushes
      was randomized so that always all brushes were used within one participant. The teeth were
      brushed by a dental hygienist for 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 und 90 seconds per quadrant. No
      toothpaste was used throughout this study. The plaque assessment (Tureskey modified QHI) was
      done after each time interval blinded on six sites per tooth by a separate investigator.
      Ninety subjects participated in the study and received a professional prophylaxis prior to
      the experiment. They were requested to refrain from brushing their teeth for 48 hours prior
      to the experiment.
