      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to augment the response of
      patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B to entecavir by using a temporary
      peginterferon alpha-2a add-on strategy

    <description>Patients receive Entecavir in a dosage of 0.5 mg once daily per os from day 0, up to week 48. From week 24 to week 48, they also receive pegylated-interferon a-2a in a dose of 180 μg per week s.c. At week 48, response will be assessed. Responders will continue to take Entecavir until week 72, and quit subsequently. Non-responders at week 48 will continue on Entecavir up to week 96.</description>
