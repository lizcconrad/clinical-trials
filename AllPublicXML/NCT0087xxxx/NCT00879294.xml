      The purpose of this study is to see if chewing gum after surgery for perforated appendicitis
      will shorten the time of intestinal dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After operations for a ruptured appendix, children are usually not allowed to eat or drink
      anything. This is because the infection inside the abdomen and the manipulation of the
      intestines during the operation cause the bowels to stop their normal movement. The resulting
      lack of bowel function is called an &quot;ileus&quot;. When this occurs, intestinal secretions and
      anything taken in by mouth can become backed up, causing bloating, abdominal pain, nausea and
      vomiting. Children are not allowed to eat or drink anything during this time and require
      fluid hydration through an IV or even nutrition through an IV. This ileus usually lasts an
      average of 4-5 days, and can sometimes delay the discharge of children who are otherwise
      ready to go. The purpose of this research study is to determine if simple things, like gum
      chewing or anti-motion sickness bracelets can help speed the time it takes for the bowels to
      begin working after an operation for a ruptured appendix. Because the gum is not swallowed,
      it does not have the same effects as eating and drinking would on someone with an ileus. The
      same is true for the anti-motion sickness bracelets. Yet, it is thought that the chewing
      action from gum may stimulate the intestines into thinking that food is on the way and cause
      them to start working sooner than they otherwise might. The same may be true for the
      bracelets, and some studies show them to be helpful with nausea after surgery. Nevertheless,
      the effects of a bracelet on postoperative ileus are unproven.
