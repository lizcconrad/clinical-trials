      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, maximum administered dose, and dose
      limiting toxicity of SCH 727965 administered as an intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15
      of each 28 day cycle in participants with solid tumors, non Hodgkins lymphoma, multiple
      myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
