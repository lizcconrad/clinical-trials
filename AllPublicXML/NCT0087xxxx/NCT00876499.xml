      This goal of this research study is to learn more about fatigue, sleep quality, and other
      symptoms in patients with primary brain tumors who are being treated with radiation therapy.

      Objectives:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      1. The primary objective of this study is to provide preliminary data describing the severity
      and change over time in fatigue using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) during radiation
      therapy for patients with primary gliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To evaluate longitudinal changes in the severity of symptoms and the mean symptom burden
           as measured by the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) and
           mood using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) during radiation therapy.

        2. To assess alterations in circadian rhythms using actigraphy during radiation therapy and
           the association with sleep quality tools - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the
           Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS), and the severity of BFI and MDASI-BT scores over time.

        3. To explore the association between the levels of salivary hormones (melatonin and
           cortisol) and the occurrence of fatigue and symptom burden.

      Questionnaires:

      If you decide to take part in this study, before starting radiation therapy, weekly during
      radiation therapy, and again 3-4 weeks and 6-8 weeks after completing radiation therapy, you
      will complete 4 questionnaires. Three (3) of the questionnaires will be completed during a
      study visit, and the last 1 will be completed at home the next time you come into the clinic.
      You will return the questionnaire completed at home to the study doctor at a study visit. The
      questionnaires will ask questions about fatigue, any symptoms you may have, and your sleeping
      habits. It should take about 30 minutes total to complete all of the questionnaires each
      time.

      Sleep Diary:

      You will complete a sleep diary. The sleep diary will be provided to you before starting
      radiation therapy. You will record information in it about your sleep habits, caffeinated
      beverages and drugs you may take, the quality of your sleep, and how you feel when you wake
      up. You will complete the sleep diary during the 48 hours that you are wearing the actigraphy
      watch. You will bring the sleep diary to the clinic every week for the study doctor to
      review.

      Actigraphy Watch:

      You will wear an actigraphy watch on your wrist for 48 hours before starting radiation
      therapy, for 48 hours each week during radiation therapy, and again for 48 hours 3-4 weeks
      and 6-8 weeks after completing radiation therapy. The actigraphy watch will measure your
      activity during the day and night. You will bring the actigraphy watch to the clinic every
      week for the study doctor to review.

      Saliva Collection:

      You will collect a saliva sample four times during the day before starting radiation therapy,
      one time during the third and last week of radiation therapy, and again 3-4 weeks and 6-8
      weeks after completing radiation therapy. These samples will be used to measure levels of
      neurotransmitters and hormone levels. These are substances which are released in the body
      that may affect sleep and the immune system.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain on study for about 8 weeks after you complete radiation therapy.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M.D. Anderson.

          3. Age &gt;/= 18 years of age. Children are excluded from this study because of differences
             in tumor location and biology with differing symptom clusters. A separate study will
             be conducted in the future with children.

          4. Ability to speak, write, and read English

          5. On corticosteroids at the initiation of radiation therapy.
