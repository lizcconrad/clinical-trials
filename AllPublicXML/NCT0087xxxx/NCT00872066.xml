      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance of artificial hip joints implanted
      with two different bone cements, SmartSet® HV and SmartSet® GHV, in the treatment of patients
      with hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will
      be randomly allocated to SmartSet® HV or SmartSet® GHV and will be evaluated at regular
      intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray assessments
