  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate objective of this project was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a
      telemental health modality (video-teleconferencing) for providing an evidence-based group
      intervention (Cognitive Processing Therapy; CPT) to rural OIF/OEF Reservists, National
      Guardsmen, and veterans suffering with PTSD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project was a 5-year prospective randomized clinical trial which conducted a direct
      comparison of the VTC and in-person modalities using rigorous methodology and a sophisticated
      analysis of equivalency between clinical and process outcome domains. In addition, cost
      effectiveness of this modality will be addressed. Approximately 130 combat Reservists,
      National Guardsmen, or veterans were recruited from multiple clinical sites. Prospective
      participants received a comprehensive assessment at baseline to determine eligibility. The
      exclusion criteria selected are consistent with large PTSD randomized clinical trials as well
      as research using the CPT protocol with military populations with PTSD. The treatment was
      delivered twice a week over 6 weeks by a doctoral level psychologist. Quality control
      procedures were incorporated into the study's design to ensure integrity, fidelity and
      standard administration of the CPT intervention across both conditions. Participants received
      additional assessments at mid-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months
      post-treatment. Outcome domains include: 1) clinical outcomes (symptom severity, social
      functioning); 2) process outcomes (perception of treatment, satisfaction, group therapy
      alliance, treatment compliance, and attrition and treatment credibility); and (3)
      cost-effectiveness outcomes.

    <description>The CAPS is a 30-item interview measure that assesses the frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms during the past month and the impact these symptoms have had on social and occupational functioning. The CAPS also provides a global scale score of PTSD severity (range 0 - 136) with higher scores indicating worse symptoms, which was used as the primary outcome measure. Scores reported here are differences between individuals follow up scores (e.g. post-treatment CAPS score assessed at two-weeks following end of treatment) minus their baseline CAPS scores, such that negative numbers represent reductions in CAPS scores (or improvement) over time.</description>

        <description>The CAPS is a 30-item interview measure that assesses the frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms during the past month and the impact these symptoms have had on social and occupational functioning. The CAPS also provides a global scale score of PTSD severity (range 0 - 136) with higher scores indicating worse symptoms, which was used as the primary outcome measure. Scores reported here are differences between individuals follow up scores (e.g. post-treatment CAPS score assessed at two-weeks following end of treatment) minus their baseline CAPS scores, such that negative numbers represent reductions in CAPS scores (or improvement) over time.</description>
