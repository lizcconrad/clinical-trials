  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the number of daily basal insulin rate changes
      that are needed to achieve short-term near normal glucose control in insulin pump patients
      with type 2 diabetes
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be taught CHO counting after which they will be introduced to an insulin pump.
      They will wear the insulin pump for three weeks to adjust to the pump and its functions. Then
      the subject will wear a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System to determine rate changes needed
      to achieve short-term near normal glucose control. The primary endpoint is what are the mean
      number of changes in the basal infusion rate and what are the mean differences and mean
      duration of these changes. The secondary endpoint is what mathematical formulas describe the
      relationship between the dosing factors and do they significantly differ from those
      previously established by King and Armstrong.
