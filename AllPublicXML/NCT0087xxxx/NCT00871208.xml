  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether the addition of topical Altabax (R) to a
      treatment regimen of topical corticosteroid therapy speeds clearance of atopic dermatitis and
      improves quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Atopic dermatitis is a pruritic skin disorder which affects more than 10% of the
      United States population, one-third of whom report sleep disturbance and a quarter with
      chronic unremitting disease. Atopic dermatitis is a recurrent pruritic skin disorder which
      has a significant morbidity and extensive costs for the health care system. Quality of life
      is often impaired for patients with atopic dermatitis due to sleep disturbance, pruritus and
      the physical impairment of visible skin lesions.

      The rapidity in which pruritus and lesional appearance are noted to resolve correlates
      strongly with improved patient satisfaction and improved quality of life.

      Recently, a clinical trial of adding mupirocin into a regimen of topical corticosteroids has
      shown a significant enhancement in lesional clearance and symptom reduction with addition of
      mupirocin to the topical corticosteroid. These improvements were most notable within the
      first week of treatment.

      Proposal: A 4-week clinical trial of 60 atopic dermatitis patients (ages 9 months to 17
      years) would be conducted. All sixty patients would be given topical mid-potency
      corticosteroid (Locoid lipocream®) to be mixed with a second product. Half the patients would
      receive Altabax® and the other half would receive vehicle (blinded to subject and
      investigator). Patients would be advised to apply the topical randomized product first, let
      dry and then apply topical Locoid lipocream ® to affected areas, and then apply the topical
      randomized ointment product to each of the sites of skin disease on top of the Locoid
      lipocream ®. Treatment of affected areas would continue for 4 weeks or until lesions have
      cleared, which ever comes first. Parents of patients will be asked to maintain a written
      diary of drug application.
