  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary trial objective in this single arm trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      Selectikine (EMD 521873) given in combination with and local tumor irradiation and to
      determine whether the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached with EMD 521873 doses of up to
      0.45 mg/kg.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate PK, immunogenicity, overall response, changes in tumor
      marker levels and circulating tumor cell numbers, progression-free survival and overall
      survival. Also, to evaluate biological/immune responses to EMD 521873.

      NSCLC patients have to be stable (PR or SD) after first-line chemotherapy in order to be
      enrolled. A total of 12 to 24 patients are planned. Patients will remain on the dose
      throughout the trial. It is intended to administer at least 4 cycles (21 d each), or until
      progression or 2nd line therapy becomes necessary.
