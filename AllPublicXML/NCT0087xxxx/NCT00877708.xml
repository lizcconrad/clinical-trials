  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to review patients with E. coli infections at UPMC from
      September 1, 2008 to August 31, 2010 to determine if these infections have arisen in the
      community rather than in hospitals or nursing homes and determine their clinical outcomes.

      The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Review whether cephalosporin-resistant E. coli infections are hospital-acquired,
           healthcare-associated or community-associated.

        2. Determine the clinical outcome of the patients according to the antibiotics given.

      De-identified data will be obtained by the honest broker for the requested time period. In
      addtion, the honest broker will work with the microbiology laboratory to collect the isolates
      associated with the de-identified data. All data and samples will be de-identified.
      De-identified data will be given to the nurse coordinator to complete the case report forms
      and enter the data into the password protected database and the de-identified isolates will
      be stored and analyzed on the 8th floor Scaife in Dr. Yohie Doi's laboratory.

      Biologic samples (isolates) will be under the control of the principal investigator of this
      research project. All samples provided to the investigator are de-identified by the honest
      broker and will be coded with numbers. The information linking these code numbers to the
      corresponding subjects' identities will be kept in a separate, secure location that only the
      honest broker has access to. The investigator on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. Samples will be kept in the investigator's laboratory located in Scaife Hall,
      room 839, 3550 Terrace Street. At no time with the research investigators have access to any
      patient identifers. Medical record information and bacteria samples from facilities outside
      of UPMC will be provided to the PI de-identified. At not time will anyone on the research
      team have access to patient identifiers. All information and bacteria are collected as part
      of the patient's clinical treatment.
