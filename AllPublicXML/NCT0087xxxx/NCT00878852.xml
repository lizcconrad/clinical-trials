  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use among Spanish adolescents has been increasing in the last decade. It has been
      related to poor school achievement, delinquency, substance use and psychiatric disorders.
      Furthermore, psychoactive substance use in adolescents presenting psychiatric disorders can
      result in the development of substance use disorders or the worsening of psychopathology.
      Thus, there's an urge to develop efficient interventions in the treatment of these disorders.
      Therapeutic approaches based on cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing
      have demonstrated a limited efficacy in this population. Programs based on contingency
      management have been reported to be useful both in adult and adolescents, too. But it still
      remains unclear whether a combination of these therapeutic approaches is feasible and brings
      a better cost-benefit relation.

      The investigators' project aims to evaluate the added benefits of supplementing a standard
      intervention on cannabis use, based on combined approach that includes motivational and
      cognitive-behavioural elements, with a contingency management program. Therefore, pre and
      post-treatment evaluation will be carried forward in a sample of 30 adolescents (aged 12-18)
      that initiate treatment for cannabis use related disorder at the Child and Adolescent
      Psychiatry Department of the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to a standard treatment group or an experimental group in which standard treatment
      will be supplemented with a contingency management protocol. As a secondary objective, a
      prospective assessment of neuropsychological performance related to cannabis use or
      abstinence will be carried forward.

    <description>Participants assigned to this group will receive active treatment in form of 12-session intervention program. This program includes weekly intervention sessions developed according to the MET/CBT12 treatment protocol (Sampl, Kadden, 2001). Intervention includes Motivational interviewing (2 sessions) and Cognitive behavioral therapy (10 sessions). This treatment protocol will be supplemented with a contingency management intervention. Intervention will consist in a voucher program: negative urine-screens will be rewarded with vouchers. Voucher will have an increasing value. At the end of the program, vouchers can be changed by gifts. Potential gifts will be selected by the therapists and will be related to pro-social activities, aiming to change preexisting risk behaviours.</description>
