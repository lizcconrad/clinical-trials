  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this evaluation is to validate the previous clinical study results using a
      Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) device, as compared to the conventional urodynamics (UDS)
      testing. The experiment will use the commercially available Tetra-NIRS and Laborie UDS
      equipment.

      The hypothesis is that the Tetra-NIRS device, in the clinical environment, provides data to
      enhance the analysis using the standard urodynamics equipment (stand-alone Urodynamic
      procedure).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the commercially available Tetra-NIRS device to compare the results
      collected against conventional urodynamics. The study will evaluate male patients with lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) as well as female subjects with over-active bladder (OAB).

      The Tetra-NIRS unit uses near infrared light at 3 different wavelengths to measure changes in
      haemoglobin and cytochrome from the detrusor muscle from the human bladder wall. This process
      is similar to what is used for cerebral and muscle oxygenation monitoring (e.g., pulse
      oximetry). Previous clinical feasibility studies have identified the correlation between the
      changes in haemoglobin and cytochrome of the bladder, and bladder pressure values obtained
      during urodynamics procedures and uroflow procedures.

      For this study the Tetra-NIRS results will not be used by the urologist/nurse to guide in
      patient management and treatment decisions, but rather will only be used to collect
      measurements from the patient for the purposes of this study. The Tetra-NIRS sensor patch
      will be adhered externally to the skin surface where the bladder is located.

      For this study, a minimum of 30 male subjects with LUTS and 30 female subjects with OAB
      scheduled to undergo a urodynamics procedure are to be enrolled. Up to 20 female subjects
      with OAB will be enrolled. The investigators will attempt to equally enrol male subjects into
      each of the two categories including obstructed and non-obstructed groups according to
      prostate hyperplasia (equivocal subjects will be determined by the investigator).

    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The Tetra-NIRS device provides a linear pattern similar to the pressures obtained during urodynamics. The NIRS output shows relative change in hemoglobin concentrations (oxygenated and deoxygenated) where the numerical value does not actually indicate the concentration, so there is no unit of measure. The numerical output is used to track change over time, or trendline analysis. A qualified interpreter studied tracings for significant changes (+/-2 Hb units) in the NIRS patterning during detrusor overactivity events. As well, under its' approved intended use, Tetra-NIRS trendline analysis was compared against urodynamics during voiding in males, such that a downward trend during voiding indicates urethral obstruction, and an upward trend indicates an unobstructed urethra.</description>

    <description>Urodynamics will be performed as per standard of care for patients enrolled, whereby one catheter is inserted into the bladder and one in the rectum to analyze bladder filling, storage and voiding conditions via pressures measured and urine flow rates detected by a uroflowmeter. Tetra-NIRS will be concurrently performed where Tetra-NIRS unit uses near infrared light at 3 different wavelengths to measure changes in haemoglobin and cytochrome. A patch is applied externally to measure these changes in the detrusor muscle of the human bladder wall. This process is similar to what is used for cerebral and muscle oxygenation monitoring (e.g., pulse oximetry). Previous clinical feasibility studies have identified a correlation between the changes in haemoglobin and cytochrome and the pressure values obtained during urodynamics procedures.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Urodynamic Detrusor Overactivity Events or Prostatic Obstruction as Detected by Tetra-NIRS Compared to Urodynamics</title>
          <description>The Tetra-NIRS device provides a linear pattern similar to the pressures obtained during urodynamics. The NIRS output shows relative change in hemoglobin concentrations (oxygenated and deoxygenated) where the numerical value does not actually indicate the concentration, so there is no unit of measure. The numerical output is used to track change over time, or trendline analysis. A qualified interpreter studied tracings for significant changes (+/-2 Hb units) in the NIRS patterning during detrusor overactivity events. As well, under its' approved intended use, Tetra-NIRS trendline analysis was compared against urodynamics during voiding in males, such that a downward trend during voiding indicates urethral obstruction, and an upward trend indicates an unobstructed urethra.</description>
          <population>Male and female patients were included, where the urodynamics tracings were compared against the Tetra NIRS tracings.</population>

          <title>Urodynamics + Tetra-NIRS</title>
          <description>Single arm - all patients were recruited following a requirement for urodynamic testing. The patient is the invited to the clinic room to perform the urodynamics test concurrently with the Tetra-NIRS device. The clinic staff perform urodynamics per their standard protocol, with the Tetra-NIRS patch applied externally above the location of the bladder. The numerical pressure data resulting from the urodynamics machine plus the hemoglobin levels (oxygenated and deoxygenated) measured by the Tetra-NIRS device are displayed on a computer and saved. The test would take approx. 45 minutes to perform, after which time the patient is free to go home. Interpretation of the Tetra-NIRS had no bearing on the patients' diagnosis, however urodynamic interpretation was performed per their standard protocol.</description>
