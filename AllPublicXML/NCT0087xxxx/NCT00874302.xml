  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with symptomatic uterine fibroids will be enrolled and will receive daily oral study
      medication for 4 months. This will be followed by a 6 month off-drug interval until there is
      a return of significant symptomatology. If they experience symptoms of a certain severity,
      the subject will enter a second 4 month treatment cycle and then a follow-up period.

      Subjects with documented symptomatic uterine fibroids will be enrolled in the study.
      Following screening, subjects will receive daily oral study medication and will be assessed
      monthly for a 4 month treatment cycle. This first cycle will be followed by an off-drug
      interval until there is a return of significant symptomatology. Subjects will be followed for
      up to six (6) months post-treatment. If their lack of symptoms does not qualify them for a
      second cycle of treatment, they will be discharged from the study. If they experience
      symptoms of a certain severity, the subject will enter a second 4 month treatment cycle and
      then a follow-up period.
