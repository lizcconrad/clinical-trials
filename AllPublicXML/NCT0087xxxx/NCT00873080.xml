  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to verify the reliability of intra and inter-examiner of angular
      measures proposed by SAPO postural assessment software. Methods: 24 subjects were
      photographed and three experienced examiners analyzed the images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The body posture in the orthostatic position has been widely utilized as in the clinical
      practice as in the research, for the diagnosis and physiotherapy treatment planning. The
      photogrammetry has been used as a valuable resource for the physiotherapist's diagnosis and
      verification of measuring postural changes, but the lack of standardization of anatomic
      references, the used angles between them and their meaning embarrasses comparison among
      studies.
