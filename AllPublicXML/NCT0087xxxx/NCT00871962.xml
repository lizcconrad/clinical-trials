  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to determine factors involved in survival in
      new COPD patients treated by long-term oxygen therapy.

      Background: long-term oxygen therapy is indicated in patients with severe COPD. No studies
      have been performed in the past 20-25 years to examine the results of early clinical trials.
      Further studies are necessary to understand the utility of oxygen therapy in severe COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      long-term oxygen therapy prolongs life in patients with severe COPD and severe resting
      hypoxemia. The objective of this study is to measure the survival in relation to the level of
      initial resting hypoxemia, serious co-morbidities, and nutritional status in COPD patients
      treated by long-term oxygen therapy. After enrollment at the beginning of oxygen therapy,
      following data will be collected during 3 years. Lung function, blood gas analysis, exercise
      capacity measured by the 6-Min Walk Distance test (6-MWD), dyspnea scale, BODE index, quality
      of life, indirect and direct costs will be analyzed every year.
