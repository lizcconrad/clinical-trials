    <textblock>
      A range of psychological disorders occur in women in the postpartum period. These include
      &quot;the blues&quot;, which occurs in the first days after birth and which is very common and
      self-limiting; severe psychoses often associated with mania or bipolar illness, occurring in
      the first weeks after birth; and mild to moderate depression, occurring weeks to months after
      birth. Studies have been done focused on postpartum psychosis using a retrospective
      investigation, which gave only a limited material on the prevalence of psychological
      disorders in postpartum women. The investigators hypothesized that different pathways to
      psychosis function as the risk factors which may be overlapped, truly independent, mediating,
      or moderating, in new mothers who are at high risk and/or during the early period of
      delivery. In addition, the investigators purposed that the temporal sequence of biological,
      social and demographic variables are also the potential factors contributing to the
      development of postpartum psychosis.
