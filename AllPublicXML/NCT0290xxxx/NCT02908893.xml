  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators design a 6-week messaging campaign aimed at promoting flu vaccination among
      fully insured members of a national payer that participate in a wellness program offered by
      the insurer through a mobile app. Outcomes measured will include uptake in flu vaccination
      rate as measured by the insurer and engagement with the campaign through the app.

      The goal of the research is to assess the effectiveness of pervasive computing messaging in
      promoting preventative care treatments such as flu shots. An additional goal is that of
      quantifying the importance of emphasizing incentives to increase efficacy of the messages.

    <description>Messages in the salient arm highlight the number of incentives (points) received by getting a flu shot and recording it through the wellness program app.
Additionally, messages mention that flu shots can be received at the pharmacy while picking up an Rx.
Users in the arm are matched up with a second user from the same arm, randomly. For each pair, the messages are sent to both users at the same time within the specified time window. Such time is picked to be the day in which the first user is most likely to pick up an Rx from a pharmacy.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Messages in the non-salient arm highlight the benefits of getting vaccinated against flu, but make no mention of incentives received for getting vaccinated.
Incentives would still be earned through the wellness program if the vaccination is recorded. Messages mention that flu shots can be received at the pharmacy while picking up an Rx.
Users in the arm are matched up with a second user from the same arm, randomly. For each pair, the messages are sent to both users at the same time within the specified time window.

    <intervention_name>In-app and push notification mobile messages</intervention_name>
    <description>Short messages (100-250 characters) are to be delivered to a mobile app both by push notification (i.e., appearing on the phone dashboard like a text message if the user has allowed notifications from the app) and in-app messages (visible in the news feed of the wellness program app when the app is opened). Messages contain a short title (30 characters) and 2-3 lines of text in the body (30 characters each).</description>
