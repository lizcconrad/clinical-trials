  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly population is increasing quickly and their need for health care ressources through
      emergency care is also growing. While these patients are ageing physical impairment often
      happens along the way. Apart from senior homes, different types and levels of home care
      services have been developped in order to overcome or to adapt to these situations.

      Our goals are:

        -  to assess mortality rate depending on home care services level for the elderly
           population consulting in the ED or being taken in charge by the Emergency Medical System
           in France.

        -  to describe this population in terms of autonomy, impairment and home care services
