      endometrial hyperplasia

    <textblock>
      The study consisted of two groups. The first group was formed of the patients diagnosed
      endometrial hyperplasia histopathologically , and the controls were healthy women admitted to
      the clinic just for annual examination without any complain and symptoms. Patients in the
      35-50 age range in both groups were included in the study. The histopathologic diagnosis of
      patients was established for Kayseri Education and Research Hospital Pathology clinics.
      Demographic parameters such as age, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), body weight and
      known familial cancer story were registered.

      Pregnancy, liver function disorders, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, diabetes,
      chronic kidney disease, central nerves system disease, immunosuppressive drug use, another
      known malignancy and excessive exercises in among one month were all exclusion criteria for
      the patients.

      3 cc peripheral venous blood samples were taken in the patients' diagnosed endometrial
      hyperplasia in the course of evaluation the biopsy results and in controls during their
      examinations just for only once. Blood samples were centrifuged in 3200 rpm speed for 10
      minutes, and stored in -80 'C until the analysis. Blood samples were evaluated on the same
      day after four mounts for stored first blood sample. Serum Irisin levels were evaluated with
      enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays kit (Catalog number: K4761-100 Biovision USA) in Kayseri
      Research and Education Hospital Biochemical Clinics.
