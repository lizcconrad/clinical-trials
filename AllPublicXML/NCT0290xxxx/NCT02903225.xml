  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled exercise training is a valuable therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment
      in most patients with chronic heart failure, reducing long-term mortality, preventing cardiac
      remodeling and improving functional capacity. Despite the mechanism underlying its benefits
      might be multifactorial, a sustained improvement in autonomic balance is usually attributed
      as a major effect. Nevertheless, not all eligible subjects show the same response to
      exercise, probably due to several differences in the subpopulations enrolled. The
      investigators hypothesize that some Heart Rate Variability indexes could be valid tools to
      optimize the selection and follow-up of chronic heart failure patients to training

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty subjects followed in a University Heart Failure Management Program were prospectively
      included. All patients were evaluated before the randomization and after 24 weeks from
      enrollment. The investigators performed a detailed anamnesis and complete physical
      examination, Doppler echocardiography, Stress Testing, 6-minute walk test, heart rate
      variability analysis, and quality of life test. Patients were randomized either to a training
      group: performing a supervised training program, or a control group receiving usual care. All
      patients received an optimal pharmacologic treatment including diuretics, angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-adrenergic blocking
      agents. All patients included in the training group attended a supervised program 3-days/week
      during 24 weeks (68-74 sessions). Physical aerobic training appears to impart beneficial
      changes in autonomic control of patients with chronic heart failure through both
      parasympathetic and sympathetic control of hear rate. These effects produce changes in
      several Heart Rate Variability indices as HF and rMSSD related with parasympathetic tone.

    <description>Exercise Training program on a 3-days/week basis during 24 weeks (68-74 sessions). Each session started with a 10-min warm-up walking period followed by 20-min of breathing exercises and free non-resistance movements of limbs. This stage was followed by pedaling during 20-minutes at a circuit resistance training protocol using a stationary cycle-ergometer. Each session ended with a cool down period (5-minutes) including diverse stretching maneuvers of engaged muscle groups. The initial bicycle-ergometer workload (WL) was defined as 50% of the maximum achieved in the previous stress testing</description>
