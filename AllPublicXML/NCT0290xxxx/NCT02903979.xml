  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In front of a lack of evidence to determine the best treatment for deep cavitated carious
      lesions, the search for an effective restorative technique, which results in a least possible
      discomfort to patients, and reduce the time needed for the restorative treatment, if becomes
      relevant. The objective of this randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of high
      viscosity glass ionomer cement restorations (HVGIC) compared to restoration with calcium
      hydroxide restoration associated with high viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC) for
      treatment of deep lesions in primary molars, as well as the impact of treatment in the
      criteria focused on the patient as well as cost-efficacy of the techniques . Children with 4
      to 8 years will be selected randomly at the Clinic for Children at the University Ibirapuera
      of Dentistry. 108 teeth will be randomized into two groups: (1) restoration with calcium
      hydroxide cement associated with HVGIC and (2) HVGIC restoration. The restorations will be
      evaluated after 6, 12 and 24 months by two trained examiners blinded to the treatments. The
      efficacy of each treatment is measured by four main outcomes, which are: (1) criteria related
      to the effectiveness of the restorative treatment (2) criteria focused on the patient and (3)
      cost-efficacy. For comparison between the two groups will be used the Kaplan-Meier survival
      and the long-rank test. Cox regression is performed the assessment of the influence of some
      other variable results. For all analyzes, the significance level is set at 5%.
