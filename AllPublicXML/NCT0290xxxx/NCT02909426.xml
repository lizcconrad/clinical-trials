  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mammography screening has limited performance in young women or women with dense breasts
      although it is the only proven method for breast cancer screening that reduces the mortality.
      The investigators propose a multicenter trial of breast cancer screening to assess the
      effectiveness of supplemental ultrasonography for Korean women aged 40-59 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will screen same consecutive participants using both methods; digital
      mammography plus supplemental ultrasonography (intervention arm) and digital mammography only
      (control arm) for 5 years. The investigators will collect follow-up information by assessment
      of screening records, questionnaire, and official cancer registry. The primary outcome will
      be sensitivity, specificity, recall rate, cancer detection rate and stage distribution at the
      end of first round of screening. The secondary outcome will be cost-effectiveness and
      cost-utility of digital mammography with ultrasonography versus digital mammography only for
      breast cancer screening. It is hoped that the results of this trial will provide guidance of
      effective breast cancer screening strategy to women aged 40-59, especially with dense
      breasts.
