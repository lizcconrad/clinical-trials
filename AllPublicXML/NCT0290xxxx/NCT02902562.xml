  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to assess the degree of
      synovitis (joint inflammation) in patients with inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid
      arthritis, and whether it can be used for assessing a treatment response. The investigators
      hope to learn whether contrast enhanced ultrasounds are better than regular imaging
      techniques, such as MRI, when used to evaluate the response to disease modifying
      anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy in inflammatory arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory arthritis affects approximately 1% of the world population and can lead to
      significant pain and disability. Although radiographs can identify characteristic patterns of
      joint space narrowing and erosive changes, these findings are typically late findings and
      represent irreversible damage. With the development of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs), the goal is now to identify the pre-erosive inflammatory features and identify the
      patients that progress further into severe functional debility if not treated immediately.

      MRI with gadolinium enhancement is proven to be very effective in early detection of soft
      tissue, bone erosions, synovitis, the integrity of ligaments, cartilage and bone marrow
      edema. However, MRI is expensive, may be impractical for assessing multiple joints and has
      relatively long examination time. Some patients may have claustrophobia and some may have
      contraindications to gadolinium administration. The investigators overarching goal is to
      determine whether the perfusion information provided by novel ultrasound based techniques
      such as, contrast enhanced ultrasound and superb microvascular imaging, can be used for
      assessment of treatment response to DMARD therapy for inflammatory arthritis. The recent
      advances in evaluation of vascularity of the tumors using contrast ultrasound technique can
      also be applied to rheumatological diseases. It is ideal to develop a sensitive imaging
      technique that can be routinely available and is relatively cheap. Ultrasound is available
      and has low cost and can be used for assessment of treatment response to DMARD therapy

    <description>An intravenous line (IV) line will be inserted into a vein in your arm. You will be asked to lie on a table for the ultrasound imaging. First, a regular ultrasound (without contrast) will be performed and the images will be recorded. For the contrast enhanced ultrasound, the contrast agent will be injected into your IV line. We will perform another ultrasound and the images will be recorded</description>

    <description>For the contrast MRI, the contrast agent will be injected into your IV line The MRI scanner is a small, tunnel-like machine in which a patient will be required to lie still for a long period of time. There is little space inside the scanner, which causes anxiety and discomfort for patients who fear enclosed spaces. A technician will be present at all times during the examination to communicate with you about how you are feeling.</description>
