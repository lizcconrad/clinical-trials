    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted to evaluate the safety and technical effectiveness of using NCVC-CS1,
      a newly developed honeycomb microporous covered stent, for the treatment of intracranial
      aneurysms which are difficult to be cured by conventional surgical or endovascular
      procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        (Provisional registration)

          1. Age between 20 and 75 years.

          2. Target lesion is an unruptured aneurysm regardless of prior treatment diagnosed by
             angiography, CTA, or MRA within 180 days

               -  Target aneurysm located in petrous/cavernous portion of internal carotid artery,
                  intradural vertebral artery except for its union, or basilar artery below the
                  orifice of superior cerebellar artery.

               -  Target aneurysm is considered difficult to treat by conventional
                  surgical/endovascular procedures

               -  Target aneurysm with a sac diameter exceeding 7 mm.

               -  Target aneurysm with a neck diameter over 4 mm or with a ratio &quot;dome/neck&quot;
                  smaller than 2.

          3. Modified Rankin score of 3 or less

          4. Agreement for participating in the study and informed consent signed by the patient.

        (definitive registration)

        1. Target lesion must be reconfirmed by angiography or interventional procedure and is
        compatible with the conditions as follows:

          -  Target aneurysm located in petrous/cavernous portion of internal carotid artery,
             intradural vertebral artery except for its union, or basilar artery below the orifice
             of superior cerebellar artery.

          -  Target aneurysm is considered difficult to treat by conventional surgical/endovascular
             procedures

          -  Target aneurysm with a sac diameter exceeding 7 mm.

          -  Target aneurysm with a neck diameter over 4 mm or with a ratio &quot;dome/neck&quot; smaller
             than 2.

          -  Parent artery of target aneurysm is accessible by the investigational devices

          -  The diameter of the parent artery between 3.5 and 5 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (Provisional registration)

          1. Any invasive surgical procedure within 30 days before registration.

          2. Prior stent implantation at the site of target aneurysm

             is considered necessary, or co-existence of unruptured intracranial aneurysm whose sac
             diameter over 5mm within the target vessel.

          4. Coexistence of other unruptured intracranial aneurysms which are planned for
             intervention

          5. Target vessel not suitable for delivery and placement of covered stent because of
             anatomical configuration (i.e. severe bend or tortuosity).

          6. More than 50% stenosis in the target vessel or its proximity including extracranial
             region.

          7. Any intracranial hemorrhage within 42 days before registration.

          8. Co-morbid conditions that may limit survival to less than 6 months, or difficult to
             observe the patient for 6 months.

          9. Renal dysfunction whose serum creatinine more than 2.0

         10. Contraindications to antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment because of allergy or
             hemorrhagic diathesis.

         11. Platelets less than 100,000/mm3 or known dysfunction of platelets.

         12. Active bacterial infection.

         13. Any cardiac, hematological, intracranial, or vessel disease which are considered to
             have high risk of neurological events (severe cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation,
             arteritis, known carotid artery stenosis, etc.).

         14. History of severe allergy to contrast dye.

         15. Known allergy to cobalt-chromium alloy and polyurethane. clopidogrel, heparin,
             nitinol, local or general anesthesia

         16. Subjects who have enrolled, or are planned to participate in other clinical trial or
             intervention study.

         17. Pregnant woman

         18. Unsuitable patients judged by the physician attending this trial.

        (definitive registration)

          1. History of any invasive surgical procedure after the provisional registration.
