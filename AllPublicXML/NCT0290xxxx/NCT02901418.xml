  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide，HBV MTCT is the important
      reason to keep high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in China. Intrapartum infection is
      the main period of neonatal HBV infection. Injecting HBIG and hepatitis b vaccine immediately
      after birth is the most important method of blocking mother-to-child transmission of HBV.
      However, regular doses of HBIG combined with hepatitis b vaccine blocking measures still have
      a failure rate as high as 5% ~ 15%.There are numerous studies to explore pregnancy women with
      HBV positive, especially high viral load of those women during pregnancy being treated with
      nucleoside analogs to increase the blocking rate of HBV MTCT, but there is still a failure
      rate of 2.2% to 18%. In this study, we will explore the efficiency of personalized blocking
      method of HBV maternal-neonatal transmission in high-risk newborns,according to the venous
      blood HBsAg state of neonatus at birth.

      In this trial, the study population were consisted of patients suffering from chronic
      hepatitis B who had achieved HBeAg positive and HBV DNA &gt; 106 copies/ml and their newborns
      who were born with HBsAg positive. Before injecting hepatitis b vaccine and HBIG for
      newborns, we tested their vein blood HBsAg levels, and the venous blood HBsAg positive
      newborns were randomly divided into the control group and the interventional group in which
      group we injected the additional 200 IU HBIG within 24 hours after birth, in addition to
      routine injection. We gathered the neonatal venous blood of 0, 7 and 30 days to test the
      level of anti HBs, HBsAg and HBV DNA., then detected the level of anti HBs, HBsAg and HBV DNA
      when these children were seven months.According to the venous blood HBsAg state of neonatus
      at birth, exploring the efficiency of personalized blocking method of HBV MTCT in high-risk
      newborns.

      At the age of seven months, we extract venous blood of these children, separate the serums
      and collect the PBMC. Then, the serums are applied to test HBsAg, AntiHBs and HBVDNA which we
      adopt to analyse HLA classⅠand class Ⅱ gene polymorphism.
