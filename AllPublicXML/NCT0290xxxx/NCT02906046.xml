  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies evaluated the efficacy of adding weights on the lower limbs in patients with
      ataxic disorders. There is no current evidence on which would be the most appropriate weight
      for use in this context. To assess progress and benefits of using this load, gait of
      symptomatic carriers of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado Joseph disease the objective of
      the study is to evaluate the gait with and without different load weights on lower limbs.
      Outcomes were the Scale for the Assessment and Ataxia Rating of (SARA), kinematic gait
      assessment by the accelerometer and gyroscope and the Patient Global Impression (PGI) about
      which weight they prefer for walking.
