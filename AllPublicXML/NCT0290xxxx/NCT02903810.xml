      Clinical study of CD19 CAR-T in the treatment of blood and lymphatic system tumor has been
      achieved a breakthrough. The main solution in clinical research is to use CD19 CAR-T infusion
      alone. Because of the heterogeneity of the tumor, the patient often carries tumor cells with
      CD19 deficient but other positive target antigens (such as CD22). Specifically removal of
      CD19 positive tumor cells in CAR-T treatment, CD19 negative tumor cells or tumor cells which
      carry other target antigens would amplify with extra free space released at the same time,
      resulting in the relapse of tumors of heterogeneities. In order to effectively control the
      recurrence, CAR-T treatment scheme specific for several target antigens was presented and
      verified. However treatment with the sequential infusion of different target specific CAR-T
      cells, the window period between two times infusions may be the opportunity for the tumor
      recurrence of heterogeneity; and bispecific CAR-T has also been reported only one CAR can be
      fully functioned. In order to avoid these problems, this topic puts forward for the first
      time in the international with a treatment scheme of an equal amount of infusion of CD19-41BB
      and CD22-41BB two Car-T in the treatment of refractory hematologic malignancies. We expect
      the treatment is more effective in eliminating tumor burden, and also can inhibit the
      recurrence of tumor heterogeneity at the same time.
