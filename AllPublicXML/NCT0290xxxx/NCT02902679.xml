        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Classified at screening as having ESRD requiring hemodialysis at least 3 times per
             week for 3 months.

          -  Clinical, ECG, and laboratory findings consistent with renal dysfunction

          -  BMI of 18.0 to 38.0 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Subjects must receive unfractionated heparin during dialysis treatments and are able
             to withstand a decrease in their established heparin dose (75% of current dose)

          -  Women Not of child bearing potential (WNOCBP). Sexually active fertile men with
             partners who are WOCBP must use non-hormonal highly effective birth control

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of uncontrolled or unstable cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematopoietic, psychiatric, and/or neurological disease
             within 6 months of screening

          -  Evidence or history of coagulopathy, prolonged or unexplained clinically significant
             bleeding, or frequent unexplained bruising

          -  Current or recent (within 3 months of study drug administration) clinically
             significant gastrointestinal disease or gastrointestinal surgery that could interfere
             with absorption of study drug

          -  Any condition requiring anticoagulation such as, but not limited to, atrial
             fibrillation, mechanical prosthetic valve, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary
             embolism (other than heparin required during hemodialysis)

          -  Need for aspirin or need for P2Y12 antagonist therapy (for example clopidogrel,
             prasugrel, or ticagrelor)

          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply
