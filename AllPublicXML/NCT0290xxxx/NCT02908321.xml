  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often have other difficulties as a result of the
      disorder. Up to half of the children with ASD are thought to suffer with anxiety in a way
      that interferes with their wellbeing and every day functioning. In this project the
      investigators will study the effect of the group program The Cool Kids Anxiety Program:
      Autism Spectrum Disorder Adaptation (Cool Kids ASD) - an anxiety treatment program specific
      developed for children with ASD. The investigators expect a decrease in the overall anxiety
      level together with an increase in the ability of handling anxiety.

      The primary objective is to investigate the effect of a manualised Cognitive Behavioural
      Therapy (CBT) programme The Cool Kids Anxiety Program: Autism Spectrum Disorder Adaptation
      (Cool Kids ASD) for anxiety disorder adapted to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
      in a waitlist controlled design.

      The investigators will investigate treatment effects on anxiety diagnosis and anxiety
      symptoms. Further, the investigators will investigate outcomes related to general
      functioning, co-morbid psychiatric disorders (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD),
      hyperkinetic disorder and depression) and level of ASD symptoms (social and communicative
      skills).
