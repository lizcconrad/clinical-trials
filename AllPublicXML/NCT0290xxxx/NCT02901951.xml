        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  A male or female between and including 40 and 60 years of age (from and including the
             40th birthday up to, but excluding, the 61st birthday) at the time of the vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Documented evidence of previous vaccination with three or four consecutive doses of
             Engerix-B administered in adulthood (i.e. at least 18 years of age) with

               -  the last dose received 4 to 12 months after the previous one,

               -  no subsequent booster dose ever received later, and

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, hysterectomy, ovariectomy
                  or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

             diabetes).

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.
