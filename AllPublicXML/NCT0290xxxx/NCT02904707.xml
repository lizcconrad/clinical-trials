    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers (UDJ) is defined as a chronic skin wound, lasting for more than 4 to 6 weeks,
      between the knee and foot, and with no tendency to spontaneous healing.

      In 2002, the prevalence of leg ulcers is estimated between 0.5% and 1% of the general
      population and 3% in subjects over 65 years.

      The sex ratio is generally 3 females to 1 male. It is in most cases a complication of
      vascular disease, usually venous (70 to 90%), then blood (5-15%), mixed (5-10%) and
      microcirculatory.

      In three quarter of cases, the UDJ is a chronic painful wound to the social repercussions
      (sleep disorders, eating, work stoppages) and major economic (individual and collective costs
      of absorptions).

      The treatment of a chronic wound uses validated techniques for several years as the skin
      graft in tablets, associated with the etiological treatment.

      The latest recommendations HAS implemented to date from 2006 and concerns the management of
      leg ulcers predominantly venous.

      Few articles in the literature address the possibility of an analgesic effect of the
      transplant pellets in the treatment of chronic ulcers algic.

      In 2008, a Swedish article, evaluated pain before and after skin grafting in carriers of leg
      ulcer patients and feet and showed that there was a reduction in pain post transplant.

      We propose to evaluate the analgesic effect of the skin graft in pellet on a patient
      population having one or more Algic ulcers.

      Development of the study:

      An information note and the non-opposition of the patient will be collected on the first day
      of hospitalization. The written and signed consent will be recorded in the patient record.

      Clinical data will be collected during hospitalization of the patient, respecting his
      anonymity only initials and year of birth will be made in terms of data that distinguish
      patients.

      The EQ-5D questionary will be distributed at the beginning of hospitalization and completed
      by each patient, and will evaluate the impact of painful ulcers in their daily lives.

      Finally, a pain assessment questionary by NE (Numeric Evaluation) before and after the skin
      graft pellet, will be filled by a caregiver during an interview with each patient.

      Methodology :

      Design: open, prospective, single centric (Vascular Medicine Department), Interventional.

      The data to be collected are:

      The age, sex, weight, height Length of hospitalization, The type of ulcer, the size of the
      ulcer disease duration of current or ulcers, duration of ulcer disease The graft antecedent,
      number of grafts placed in the registry, the date of completion of the graft, The evaluation
      of pain before and after the completion of the graft on EN, The impact of pain on patient's
      quality of sleep, the type of pain experienced by patients in terms of their ulcers

      The type and number of analgesics taken by patients:

        -  Antiepileptic therapy (pregabapentine, gabapentin)

        -  Analgesic treatment to alleviate I (paracetamol), to overcome II (codeine paracetamol,
           Lamaline, tramadol, nefopam, Ixprim), and compensate III (morphine, opiates).
