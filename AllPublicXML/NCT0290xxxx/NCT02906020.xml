      Primary Objectives:

        -  Part 1: To determine the safety and tolerability of GZ/SAR402671 administered orally, as
           compared to placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) carrying a GBA
           mutation or other pre-specified variants.

        -  Part 2: To determine the efficacy of GZ/SAR402671 administered orally daily, as compared
           to placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease carrying a GBA mutation or
           other pre-specified variants.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Part 1:

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of oral dosing of GZ/SAR4027671 in plasma
           when administered in early-stage Parkinson's disease patients carrying a GBA mutation.

        -  To assess the exposure of GZ/SAR402671 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when administered in
           early-stage Parkinson's disease patients carrying a GBA mutation.

      Part 2:

        -  To demonstrate overall safety and tolerability of GZ/SAR4027671 administered orally in
           early-stage Parkinson's disease patients carrying a GBA mutation as compared to placebo.

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic response to daily oral dosing of GZ/SAR402671 in plasma
           and CSF as measured by glucosylceramide (GL-1) when administered in early-stage
           Parkinson's disease patients carrying a GBA mutation.

      The total study duration per subject in Part 2 will be approximately 168 weeks that will
      consist of 6.5 weeks of screening period, 52 weeks of treatment period, 104 weeks of
      follow-up period, and 6 weeks of post-treatment observation period. Part 1 maximal duration
      will be up to 48 weeks outside Japan, and up to 64 weeks in Japan.

             GBA mutation associated with PD.

          -  Patients carrying known sequence variants associated with GBA-PD (such as E326K) must
             have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) confirmed by historically
