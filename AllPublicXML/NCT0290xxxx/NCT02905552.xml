    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are characterized by quantitative and qualitative bone marrow
      failure and by a disorder of the medullary production which is a pre-leukemic state which can
      evolve into acute myeloid leukemia.

      The risk of leukemic transformation is estimated by the score IPSS (International Prognostic
      Score System). We distinguish the MDS of low risk (IPSS&lt;1) and those of high risk of leukemic
      transformation (IPSS=1,5).

      Besides the risk of leukemic transformation, MDS much be complicated of infections which
      could be life-threatening.

      The risk of developing first infection after the diagnosis of MDS of high risk is probably
      influenced by anamnestic (disease duration, comorbidities), clinical (veinous central
      catheter, previous hospitalization), biological (neutropenia, lymphopenia, serum ferritin)
      and therapeutics (demethylating agent, lenalidomide, erythropoietin, G-CSF, transfusions,
      anti-infectious preventive treatment) factors. Their identification will allow for improved
      targeting of the population which is is likely to benefit from anti-infective prophylaxis
      Primary objective is to identify risk factors associated with first acute episode of
      infection in patients with MDS, by comparing index cases and matched control cases who did
      not develop infection episode since diagnosis.

      Secondary objectives are to explore nature and severity of infectious episodes, number of
      recurrences during 1 year of follow up and survival at 6 and 12 months
