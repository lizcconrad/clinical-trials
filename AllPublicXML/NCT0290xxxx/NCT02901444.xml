      Stemming from the common practice of attribution of the technical helps in the posture in
      Canada, the multidisciplinary approach of positioning develops in France for more than 10
      years old.

      To date, no observatory study was led to estimate the impact of such consultation in daily
      activities, an essential objective conditioning the observance and the acceptance of
      assistive devices. This study wants to estimate the impact through modification of WHOM
      scale.
