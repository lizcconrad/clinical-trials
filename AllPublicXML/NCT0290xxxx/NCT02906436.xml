    <textblock>
      Only about 15% of the potential candidates for lung donation are considered suitable for
      transplantation. Thus, a strategy that could improve the quality and precision of assessment
      of nonacceptable donor lungs could have a major impact on reducing waiting time and mortality
      while on the list.

      A new method for ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) has been developed recently by Steen and
      colleagues to assess the quality of lungs from a non-heart-beating donor. The method can also
      be used to recondition &quot;marginal&quot; and nonacceptable donor lungs.

      After harvesting, the lungs were perfused ex vivo with Steen Solution, an extracellular
      matrix with high colloid osmotic pressure. A membrane oxygenator connected to the circuit
      received gas from a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, maintaining a normal mixed venous
      blood gas level in the perfusate. The lungs were gradually rewarmed, reperfused, and
      ventilated for evaluation through analyses of oxygenation capacity, pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR), lung compliance (LC), and biopsy.
