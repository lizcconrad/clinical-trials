    <textblock>
      This study seeks a better understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma in early life. The aim
      of this project is to determine whether the offspring of obese mothers at 3 years of life
      have increased the risk of asthma compared to children whose mothers were not obese and
      whether this increased risk is associated with a programming altered immune reactivity at
      birth.

      The general objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine whether the increased risk of asthma in children born from a pre-pregnant
           obese mother can be observed at 3 years of life and whether this increased risk
           associated with altered plasma levels of immune mediators at birth.

        2. To explore in children born from pre-pregnant obese mother whether monocyte physiology
           and M1-M2 polarization present an altered response and expression of asthma-related
           immune-modulations at birth.

        3. To study in neonates born from pre-pregnant obese mother whether the in vitro expression
           of TNFα, IL12, IL-10 and IL-4Rα in monocytes associates with changes in the DNA
           methylation status in the promoter regions of those genes.

      The study is performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and the study protocol
      was accepted by Institutional Review Boards at School of Medicine of the Pontificia
      Universidad Católica de Chile.

    <description>Obese (BMI&gt;30) or normal weight (BMI&lt;25) women at their first antenatal visit were invited to participate in the study at the moment of delivery at Sotero del Rio Hospital, Santiago. Information regarding birth outcomes, parental history, as well as environmental conditions was collected at recruitment. Follow-up questionnaires by phone were completed every 6 months. Umbilical cord blood samples were collected to measure IL-12, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-4; to evaluate metabolic status; to isolated monocytes and macrophage differentiation; and for DNA methylation status of the promoter regions of the genes coding for TNF-α, IL-12, IL-10, and IL-4Rα. Also, fasting blood samples of the mothers within 48 hours after delivery; and blood samples and skin prick test were collected.</description>

        The recruitment of participants was performed in the Sotero del Rio Hospital at Santiago.
        Women that were obese (BMI&gt;30) or normal weight (BMI&lt;25) at their first antenatal visit
        were invited to participate in the study at the moment of delivery.

        Questionnaires: Information regarding birth outcomes, maternal and paternal history of
        asthma and allergy, as well as environmental conditions at home (pet ownership, indoor
        smoking, heating system, and so on) was collected using a questionnaire at the moment of
        recruitment.

        Follow-up questionnaires by phone are completed every 6 months. These questionnaires
        collect information regarding diagnosis of asthma/allergy and acute respiratory illness,
        environmental conditions, and relevant confounding variables
