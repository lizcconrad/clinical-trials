  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This blinded randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the effect of drinking fermented
      milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei (IMULUS) on immune response against influenza.

    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in healthy volunteer using product approved by Thai FDA. This blinded
      randomized controlled trial compare immune response against influenza H1N1, H3N2 and Phu-B
      between study group and control group. The study group receives influenza vaccine and
      drinking fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei (IMULUS), while the control group
      receives influenza vaccine and placebo acidified milk. The trial lasts for 8 weeks and
      include four time points of data collection (0, 2, 6, 8 weeks). Subjects, outcome assessor
      and investigators are blinded throughout the study.
