  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are endemic in nursing homes (NHs) with prevalence
      rates surpassing those in hospitals. The aim of the study is to design and evaluate the
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention to reduce new acquisition of MDROs in NH
      residents. The intervention will incorporate resident-level, environmental, and caregiver
      based strategies. Using a cluster-randomized study design, three NHs will be randomized to
      the intervention group and three to the control group. Control NHs will be allowed to
      continue standard infection prevention practices. Nursing homes will serve as the unit of
      allocation. Analyses will be performed both at the resident and the cluster level. The
      primary outcomes of the study are reduction in MDRO prevalence, and reduction in new MDRO
      acquisition .

      The NH intervention will incorporate resident-level, environmental, and caregiver based
      strategies, including: a. Standard precautions and hand hygiene for care of all residents.
      Enhanced barrier precautions including hand hygiene, glove use, and gown use for healthcare
      workers (HCW) when providing activities of daily living (ADL) assistance for residents at
      highest-risk (caregiver intervention); b. Hand hygiene education to residents and families
      (resident-level intervention); c. Standardized bathing practices including using
      chlorhexidine-based cloths to reduce resident MDRO colonization (resident-level
      intervention); d. Standardized environmental protocol and education to reduce contamination
      on inanimate objects and surfaces (environmental intervention); e. Feedback monthly of
      facility-level microbial data and new MDRO acquisition rates to infection preventionists,
      front-line healthcare personnel, and facility leadership (facility intervention).
