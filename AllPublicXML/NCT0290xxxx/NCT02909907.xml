  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections in forearm flexors plus extensor
      muscles versus flexors alone for the treatment of essential hand tremor (ET).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot, single center, double blind, randomized, parallel, placebo
      controlled trial comparing 2 (BoNT) injection patterns for treatment of moderate to severe
      essential tremor. The investigators will recruit 20 patients with (ET).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 and over, male or female patient with (ET) involving at least their dominant
             hand, as diagnosed by a movement disorders neurologist.

          2. Having bothersome hand tremor in dominant hand with a hand TRS ≥2

          3. On stable medications during last 30 days prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of secondary causes of tremor, such as dystonia and parkinsonism

          2. Any contraindication to botulinum toxin injections (e.g. motor neuron disease,
             neuromuscular junction disease, etc.)

          3. History of surgical treatment for (ET).

          4. Dementia as defined by DSM-V criteria

          5. Patients with suboptimally treated depression and significant depressive symptoms as
             defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥15 (PHQ-9 scores 1-4 Minimal depression; 5-9 Mild
             depression; 10-14 Moderate depression; 15-19 Moderately severe depression; 20-27
             Severe depression). Antidepressant medications, prescribed for depression or anxiety,
             will be allowed if the patient has been on a stable dose for at least 30 days.

          6. Patients with suboptimally treated anxiety and significant anxiety symptoms as defined
             by a GAD-7 score of ≥15 (GAD-7 scores 0-4: minimal anxiety; 5-9: mild anxiety; 10-14:
             moderate anxiety; 15-21: severe anxiety). Anti-anxiety medications, prescribed for
             anxiety, will be allowed if the patient has been on a stable dose for at least 30
             days.

          7. Significant renal, hepatic, cardiac and thyroid disease
