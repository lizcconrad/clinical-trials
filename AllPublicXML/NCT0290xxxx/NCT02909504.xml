      This study is a 4-month open-label study of lithium in the acute treatment of patients with
      bipolar I or II disorder. Eligible patients will receive lithium 300 mg twice daily and
      titrated in 300 mg increments every 7 days as tolerated to levels &gt; 0.6 mEq/L. Blood samples
      are collected at baseline and at the end of study. Analyses of 45 molecule expressions in
      mononuclear blood cells at baseline and endpoint will be carried out after the completion of
      study. Fifty patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5)
      criteria for bipolar I or II will be enrolled.
