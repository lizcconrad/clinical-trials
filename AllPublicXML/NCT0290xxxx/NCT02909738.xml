  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to test how well healthy human volunteers power a modified
      oxygen concentrator. The investigators modified the oxygen concentrator to be powered by a
      bicycle instead of wall power so that it can be used in low resource countries where the
      power supply is unreliable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to test how many healthy people can power the oxygen
      concentrator by pedaling the bike for at least 30 minutes. If the healthy volunteers can bike
      for at least 30 minutes, the investigators assume they are pedaling at or below their lactate
      threshold. The investigators have literature values which suggest bigger people should be
      able to output more work, and the investigators wish to use a sample of the population to
      verify that most of the people can power our system. The investigators have a good estimate
      of the power required by our system, and the investigators want to verify the average person
      can actually do what we calculated is necessary.
