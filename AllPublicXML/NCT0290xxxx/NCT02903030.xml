  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physical and mental/emotional health of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are
      closely connected. The emerging data on immune abnormalities and gut microbiome differences,
      and interactions of the genome with these suggest a possible etiological link between
      physical and mental dysfunction, especially the gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and severe
      anxiety that many individuals with ASD manifest. The investigators have preliminary clinical
      evidence that children with ASD &amp; GI symptoms differ in microbiome composition and function
      from neurotypical children with GI symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that altered
      host-microbial signals, which include altered fecal neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA) levels contribute towards anxiety and sensory over-responsivity in ASD. Our
      preliminary findings also show that probiotic Visbiome Extra Strength, improves GI and pain
      symptoms, correlating with altered gut microbiome composition and related metabolites (the
      macrobiome). The proposed crossover trial will explore the possibilities of this new
      appreciation of the microbiome-mental/physical function connection for ASD, GI dysfunction,
      and anxiety. If altering the gut microbiome results in better GI and emotional function, it
      could improve the quality of life for children with ASD and their parents. A pilot trial with
      12 children with ASD will test feasibility for a proposed three-site crossover randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) of probiotics (beneficial bacteria including Lactobacilli &amp;
      Bifidobacteria) in 60 children 3-12 years old with ASD, GI dysfunction, &amp; anxiety. In a
      balanced crossover children will be randomized 1;1 to Visbiome or placebo first, 8 weeks per
      condition with 3 weeks washout between. The investigators have access to significant fecal
      microbiome and metabolome data from NIH-funded Human Microbiome Projects (HMP) on similar-age
      healthy and irritable-bowel children, with and without ASD. These will help leverage our
      understanding of macrobiome changes that correlate with functional improvement of GI and
      abdominal pain symptoms. Pilot study efficiency will also benefit from those HMPs having
      already collected and analyzed baseline stools for some children with ASD, thus saving
      significant costs for baseline stool analyses for the pilot.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gastrointestinal (GI) Module of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) (Varni et al., 2001; (Varni, Burwinkle, &amp; Seid, 2006; Varni et al, 2014)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screen, Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 11, Week 15, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>A 74-item survey with 14 scales (# of items): stomach pain &amp; hurt (6 items), discomfort when eating (5), food &amp; drink limits (6), trouble swallowing (3), heartburn/reflux (4), nausea/vomiting (4), gas &amp; bloating (7), constipation (14), blood in poop (2), diarrhea (7), worry about going poop (5), worry about stomachaches (2), medicines (4), and communication (5). Report forms for specific age ranges assess the parent's perception of the child's GI function and/or symptoms during the last month on a 5-point scale from 0 (never a problem) to 4 (almost always a problem). Items are reverse-scored and transformed to a 0-100 scale so lower scores reflect worse GI dysfunction Response choices are in Likert-scale format ranging from 0 to 4 (0=Never, 1=Almost Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Often, 4=Almost Always).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Target Symptom Rating (Arnold et al, 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 11, Week 15, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>Parents are asked to name the 2 problems of most concern to them at baseline; a clinician helps the parent quantify and describe the problem (frequency, duration, severity, interference with daily life) at baseline. At subsequent visits the clinician reminds the parent of the previous description and helps them again quantify/describe the current state. A panel of blind clinicians reviews the descriptions and rates each on a 9-point scale relative to baseline, from remission to disastrously worse, with 5=no change. These ratings are averaged, capturing the issues of most concern to parents across families. For purposes of this study, one of the 2 problems will be required to pertain to GI function, and will be analyzed separately as well as being averaged into the overall symptom rating.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parent Anxiety Checklist--ASD (Scahill, Lecavalier, Bears, &amp; Aman, 2015)</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) (Aman et al., 1985a, 1985b)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 11, Week 15, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC is a 58-item parent rating on a 0-3 scale with five subscales: 1) Irritability (includes agitation, aggression, and self-injury, 15 items); 2) Social Withdrawal (16 items); 3) Stereotypies (7 items); 4) Hyperactivity (16 items); and 5) Inappropriate Speech (4 items).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Costantino et al., 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Week 11, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>This 65-item rating scale measures the severity of autism spectrum symptoms as they occur in natural social settings. Completed by a parent or teacher in 15 to 20 minutes, the SRS provides a clear picture of a child's social impairments, assessing social awareness, social information processing, capacity for reciprocal social communication, social anxiety/avoidance, and autistic preoccupations and traits. It is appropriate for use with children from 4 to 18 years of age and will detect changes in core ASD symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) (Owens, Spirito, &amp; Mcguinn, 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Week 11, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>It includes 33 items rated retrospectively over the previous week by parents. Eight subscales include: (1) bedtime resistance (2) sleep onset latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) anxiety around sleep, (5) night awakenings, (6) sleep disordered breathing, (7) parasomnias and (8) morning waking/daytime sleepiness. In a recent study of the Autism Treatment Network, 75% of the participants analyzed had a CSHQ score &gt;41, the clinical threshold for sleep problems (Hollway, Aman, and Butter, 2013). Sleep greatly affects quality of life for both children and parents, and it is important to detect any changes in this important vegetative function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Parenting Stress Index Short Form (PSI) (Abidin,1995)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI is used to evaluate the degree of stress in the parent-child relationship. The Short Form has 36 items from the full length PSI, rated on a 5-point scale from 1 = strongly disagree, to 5 = strongly agree. It is completed in 10-15 minutes. The PSI may be used for parents of children up to 12 years. It yields a Total Score and three domain scores. This will detect effect on parental stress and QOL.</description>
