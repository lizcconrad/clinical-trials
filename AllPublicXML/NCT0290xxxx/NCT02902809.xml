      A 52-Week, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to Evaluate the Safety of Tralokinumab in Japanese
      Adults and Adolescents with Asthma Inadequately Controlled on Inhaled Corticosteroid plus
      Long-Acting β2-Agonist

    <textblock>
      This is a 52-week, open-label, multi-centre study designed to evaluate the safety of
      tralokinumab in a fixed 300 mg dose every 2 weeks, administered subcutaneously in adults and
      adolescents with indequately controlled asthma on medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroid
      plus long acting β-2 antagonist. Approximately 26 Japanese subjects will be recruited to
      receive 22 completed.
