  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly compared to placebo in
      Japanese patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic control on insulin monotherapy in
      addition to diet and exercise therapy. The primary hypothesis of the study is that
      omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) compared
      with placebo as assessed by change from baseline to Week 16 [Phase A (double-blind period)].

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a screening period of up to 2 weeks followed by a pretreatment period of 2 or 10 weeks,
      each participant will be receiving assigned double-blind treatment (omarigliptin 25 mg or
      placebo once weekly) for approximately 16 weeks (Phase A) followed by 36 weeks of open-label
      treatment (omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly, Phase B). After the end of treatment each
      participant will be followed for 21 days.
