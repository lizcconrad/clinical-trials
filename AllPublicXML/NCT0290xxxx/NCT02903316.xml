  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if extra systoles can be used to predict fluid
      responsiveness perioperatively in patients undergoing on pump coronary artery bypass graft
      (CABG) surgery. As an additional study we will investigate the ability of a mini fluid
      challenge to predict response of a larger volume of fluid.

    <textblock>
      From induction of anaesthesia to cardioplegia we will serve two fluid challenges. Before and
      after each challenge we will collect hemodynamic data and use this to asses our two
      hypotheses.

      Fluid responsiveness (the outcome to predict) will be defined as a 15% increase in stroke
      volume(SV) from immediately before fluid infusion is initiated (baseline) to after the full
      fluid infusion. Stroke volume is derived from the gold-standard pulmonary artery catheter
      measurement of cardiac output(CO), which is standard monitoring for these patients (SV =
      CO/heart rate). From subsequent offline analysis of the extracted curve data we will
      investigate if post-ectopic characteristics from identified extra systoles during the
      baseline period can predict fluid responsiveness (i.e. the SV change). This analysis
      addresses the primary hypothesis. Also, we will analyse the arterial waveform related to the
      mini fluid challenge for morphologic changes (comparing heart beats before the infusion with
      heart beats during the infusion) and see if such transient changes, e.g. in systolic blood
      pressure, are able to predict fluid responsiveness. This analysis addresses the secondary
      hypothesis.
