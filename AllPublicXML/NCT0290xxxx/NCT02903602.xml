      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an innovative methodology for
      training Community Health Workers that will improve their effectiveness in educating mothers
      to adopt best practice health behaviors in the home.

      Objective: Training of community health workers (CHW) is a growing priority to close the gap
      between health services and mothers/families in resource poor communities. To address
      research needs on how to improve effectiveness of CHW training, the investigators tested an
      innovative CHW teaching methodology called &quot;Sharing Histories&quot; hypothesizing that this would
      empower and enable CHW to better teach mothers to improve health knowledge and behaviors that
      contribute to improved child growth.

      Method: The study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial: 22 health facility jurisdictions
      were matched and randomly assigned as experimental or control. Health personnel Tutors and
      female CHW were trained using either the &quot;Sharing Histories&quot; methodology (experimental) or a
      standard but still participatory teaching method (control). Training content, materials, and
      other interventions were held constant between study groups. Impact on maternal knowledge and
      practices, and child growth and morbidity were measured in representative household surveys
      at baseline, midterm, and final evaluation, with 600 mothers interviewed - 300 in each study
      group - at each point in time.

    <description>Experimental clusters of primary health care facilities provided training to Community Health Workers (CHW) from their communities utilizing the experimental teaching methodology, &quot;Sharing Histories&quot;.
CHW in both study groups made home visits to pregnant women and mothers of children under two years of age to teach mothers, monitor behaviors and danger signs in pregnant women, newborns, and children, and refer cases when needed for preventive and curative care.</description>

    <description>Female Community Health Worker training participants were led through a guided process of recalling and sharing their autobiographical memories of their personal experiences in the first 1000 days of each of their children (pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum, newborn, breastfeeding, complementary feeding, infant diarrhea and hygiene, pneumonia). On the basis of memories, cultural beliefs and practices are identified and training content is built.</description>
