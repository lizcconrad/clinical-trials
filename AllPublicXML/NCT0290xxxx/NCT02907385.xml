      LifeSeal™ Kit, surgical sealant designed for staple-line reinforcement that is applied over
      the anastomotic line to prevent bowel content leakage until full physiological function is
      restored.

      RATIONALE : Postoperative anastomotic leakage is one of the most devastating and feared
      complications in colorectal surgery. The risk of postoperative anastomotic leakage varies
      widely depending on the level of anastomosis while the risk is higher in low anastomosis.

      In order to best demonstrate the benefits of LifeSeal™ in providing staple line reinforcement
      and helping to reduce leaks, the study includes high risk anastomoses, defined as colorectal
      and coloanal anastomoses performed within 10 cm from the anal verge.

      STUDY DESIGN: This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, multinational
      randomized, single-blind, double armed study PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this
      study is to assess the efficacy and safety of LifeSeal™ Kit as measured by the change in
      overall anastomotic leak rates in subjects undergoing low anterior resection with an
      anastomosis below 10 cm from the anal verge, over the first 17 weeks after surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: The secondary objective of this study is to assess the incidence of
      post-operative leaks and additional benefits that could be related to the use of LifeSeal™
      Kit such as reducing the severity and improving the outcome of a leak once it has occurred.
      In addition, the study will allow for collection and analysis of additional safety data and
      usability assessment of the device, medical resource utilization, and health related quality
      of life measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 21 years of age at Screening Visit.

          2. Written informed consent obtained from subject or subject's legal representative and
             ability for subject to comply with the requirements of the study.

          3. Subject is diagnosed with colorectal cancer

          4. Subject is scheduled for elective open, laparoscopic or robot assisted surgery
             involving the creation of a circular stapled anastomosis created within 10cm from the
             anal verge.

          5. Procedure involving Total Mesorectal Excision by an abdominal or transanal approach.

          6. Female subjects in child bearing age must be using acceptable contraception methods
             such as hormonal contraception or two forms of barrier contraception. Acceptable
             contraception must be used consistently from 30 days before screening until 3 years
             following surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pre-operative exclusion criteria:
