    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates adding high-dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to a standard therapy
      for non-small cell lung cancer. The standard therapy is radiation therapy combined with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel (types of chemotherapy). All subjects will receive high-dose
      ascorbate in addition to the standard therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For selected stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), standard treatment involves
      radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen typically used is paclitaxel and
      carboplatin. Both of these chemotherapeutic drugs are administered intravenously, using a
      vein in the arm. Radiation is administered using a machine external to the body (usually a
      linear accelerator). After combined therapy, NSCLC patients receive 2 extra cycles of
      chemotherapy, called &quot;consolidation chemotherapy.&quot;

      This study adds 75 grams of ascorbate (vitamin C, sometimes called pharmacological ascorbate
      because the dose is so high) at specific timepoints in the therapy. The ascorbate is
      administered intravenously - through a vein in your arm.

      Participants will:

        -  receive 75 grams of intravenous ascorbate 3 times per calendar week while they are
           receiving radiation therapy. The IV will be running while the radiation therapy is
           administered. This portion of the study is about 6 to 7 weeks.

        -  receive 75 grams of intravenous ascorbate 2 times per calendar week while they are
           receiving consolidation chemotherapy. Each cycle of consolidation chemotherapy is 3
           weeks, so this portion of the study is about 6 weeks.

        -  undergo imaging which is standard for their cancer and therapy. This can include CT
           scans, PET scans, and X-rays.

        -  provide blood samples to determine the biological effects, if any, the ascorbate has on
           the body during therapy

      This active therapy portion lasts for about 15 to 17 weeks. After that is done, participants
      go back to standard follow-up for their cancer and any additional therapy their doctors
      believe they need.

      However, it is very important the investigators remain in contact with participants; they
      will have life-long follow-up for this study.
