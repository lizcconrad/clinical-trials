      This study is an open-label, parallel group study to evaluate acute pulmonary safety and
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of two doses, separated by 2 hours, of CVT-427 zolmitriptan inhalation
      powder in three groups of adults: those with asthma, those who smoke and healthy volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  eligible subjects will be men or women aged 18 to 65 years inclusive;

          -  body mass index (BMI) 18 to 30 kg/m2;

          -  healthy adults must be in general good health with no clinically significant
             abnormalities that would affect ability to complete study.

          -  subjects with asthma must be non-smokers who have a forced expiratory volume in one
             second (FEV1) ≥ 60% of predicted for race, age, sex, and height;

          -  subjects who smoke must have at least a 12-month, 0.5 pack of cigarettes per day
             history or the equivalent consumption of cigars and a positive result for plasma
             cotinine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects with asthma will be excluded for more than 2 hospitalizations or emergency
             room visits, or more than 3 courses of systemic steroids in the past 12 months or 1
             course within the past 8 weeks for respiratory illness;

          -  asthma exacerbation within 8 weeks of before screening;

          -  unscheduled or urgent visit to any medical facility for asthma-related problems within
             8 weeks before screening;

          -  history of intubation or intensive care unit admission for asthma in the past 5 years.

          -  Subjects who smoke will be excluded if they have intrinsic lung disease including
             asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an FEV1 of &lt;60% of
             predicted and a score of ≥2 on the Medical Research Council Dsypnea Scale (MRC);

          -  any cardiovascular risk factor or contraindication for the use of triptans

          -  use of nonselective monamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), serotonin reuptake inhibitors
             (SSRIs), propranolol, or cimetidine within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, or
             planned use during the study;

          -  positive serology test (hepatitis B virus surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis C virus
             [HCV] antibody, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 1 &amp; 2 antibodies).
