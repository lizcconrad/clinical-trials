  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the sensitivity of the validated Merz Jawline Grading Scale (MJGS)
      to detect treatment effects following Radiesse (+) correction of subcutaneous volume loss and
      contour deficits of the jawline. Treatment effects detected on the MJGS will be correlated
      with assessments of aesthetic outcomes on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) and
      FACE-Q instrument
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open label study, in which both right and left jawlines will receive treatment
      with Radiesse (+). Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either a treatment group or
      an untreated control group. Jawlines will be assessed by masked evaluators on the MJGS.
      Treating physicians and treatment group subjects will assess satisfaction on the GAIS.
      Treatment group subjects will self-report aesthetic outcomes on the FACE-Q instrument.

      Treatment subjects will be evaluated at enrollment, and 1, 2 and 4 weeks after enrollment.
      Control group subjects will be required to be evaluated at enrollment and 4 weeks after
      enrollment.
