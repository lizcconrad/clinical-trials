    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand (1) why people gain weight when
      they quit smoking and (2) whether certain types of smoking cessation (i.e. quit smoking)
      counseling combined with the nicotine patch help people quit smoking and gain less weight.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of a behavioral activation intervention
      to smoking cessation and to post-cessation weight gain (BAS+) plus transdermal nicotine (TN)
      compared to standard smoking cessation counseling (SC) plus TN in treatment-seeking smokers.
      After completing an Intake Visit (~week -3), eligible smokers will be randomized (stratified
      by nicotine dependence, BMI and gender) to participate in 8 individual sessions of BAS+ or SC
      over a 10-week treatment period with two sessions prior to the target quit date (weeks -2,
      -1) and six sessions post-target quit date (TQD [week 0] and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8).
      Standard, 8-week; open-label TN will begin on the TQD. Moderators will be assessed
      pre-treatment. Mediating mechanisms will be assessed before, during, and at the end of
      treatment (EOT, week 8). Smoking will be assessed by self-report and biochemically confirmed
      (Carbon Monoxide [CO] &lt; 5) at all in-center visits after quitting, at EOT (week 8), and at
      the 12- and 26-week follow-ups. Weight will be assessed at these same time points. Food
      intake will be measured by three consecutive days of 24-hour food recalls at Baseline [week
      -2] and 4-, 8-, and 12- and 26-weeks post-TQD. Smoking cessation and post-cessation weight
      gain (PCWG) are the primary outcomes and food intake is a secondary outcome at 26-weeks
      post-TQD. Consistent with intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the investigators will measure
      smoking cessation and weight gain in the full sample at the 26-week follow-up, evaluating a
      smoking status by treatment interaction for the PCWG analysis.

    <description>Weight will be measured by a physician's scale (pounds) at the beginning of every in-person visit through study completion. Participants will be wearing light clothing without shoes. Pre-cessation weight will be computed as the average of weights at the Intake and Baseline Visits prior to any change in smoking behavior. Weight change from Baseline to the 26-week follow-up will serve as a primary weight outcome variable.</description>

The primary smoking outcome variable will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence (no smoking, not even a puff, for at least 7 days prior to the assessment) biochemically verified by CO &lt; 5 ppm at End of Treatment (week 8), and by saliva cotinine &lt; 15ng/ml at the 12- and 26-week follow-up.</description>

A trained member of the research staff will use a multi-pass method with an interactive computerized software program, the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall (ASA24Â®), to determine total kcal/day (outcome variable).</description>

    <description>The goal of the BAS+ is to maintain a level of overall reward after cessation by structuring and enhancing opportunities for reinforcement to: (1) ensure that not smoking is as reinforcing as smoking; and (2) prevent an over-reliance on food as a substitute reinforcer for smoking so that PCWG does not precipitate smoking relapse.</description>
