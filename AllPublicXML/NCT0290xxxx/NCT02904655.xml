  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, crossover meal-replacement pilot intervention to determine
      feasibility of a larger scale dietary trial in asthma and gather preliminary evidence for the
      impact of a healthy diet on asthma outcomes. Participants with doctor-diagnosed asthma were
      randomized to crossover trial of a 4-week dietary intervention or usual diet with a 4-week
      washout period. During the dietary intervention, all meals and snacks were provided by the
      study.

      The objective of the study is to demonstrate feasibility of a randomized, controlled clinical
      trial of a dietary intervention in a population of adults with asthma and to determine sample
      size estimates for a larger, more definitive trial aimed at improving asthma clinical
      outcomes and improving markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The study uses a feeding
      trial design comprised of a 4 week dietary intervention in which all meals are provided to
      study participants and a 4 week control diet comprised of usual dietary intake. Participants
      are randomized to the intervention or control diet and then cross over to the alternate
      assignment after a 4 week washout period.
