    <textblock>
      Research study which tests the safety and effectiveness of a new vascular closure device to
      close the femoral access puncture that is created in patients who require this form of access
      in order to perform the planned procedure. The MANTA device is expected to seal the femoral
      access puncture in less than 1 minute. This may result in less blood loss and a shorter time
      to walking compared to alternative closure means. Use of the MANTA device in this study is
      experimental. All other parts of the procedure involve standard medical care.

    <textblock>
      The MANTA device is a VCD intended for use in catheterization laboratories following
      percutaneous cardiac or peripheral procedures that use the retrograde common femoral artery
      access route for large bore (10‐18F ID) interventional devices. The function of MANTA is to
      percutaneously close the puncture in the artery wall (arteriotomy) through which the
      catheters were inserted for the procedure.

      The study is being conducted o demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of MANTA in achieving
      hemostasis in femoral arterial access sites in subjects undergoing percutaneous transcatheter
      interventional procedures using a large-bore procedure sheath.
