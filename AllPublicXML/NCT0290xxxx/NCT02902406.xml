  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow up study which aims to evaluate the correlation between several methylated
      genes (potential biomarkers) and oral cancers. A prospective case control trial is designed
      with sample size of at least 300 cases with estimated 200 subjects with precancerous lesion
      or oral cancer, and 100 subjects with normal oral mucosa. This study is approved by the
      National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethics Committee. After signing the informed
      consent, all subjects will receive an intraoral examination and followed by epithelial cells
      collection with oral swab. The gDNA will be extracted from the oral swab collected cells and
      followed by bisulfite conversion procedures. Subsequently, bisulfite converted DNA will be
      subjected to methylated gene detection by Real-Time PCR. The methylation index (clinical
      sensitivity and specificity) of oral cancer related genes will be evaluated. For diagnosis
      confirmation, photos and biopsy specimens will be taken upon observation of abnormal lesion.
