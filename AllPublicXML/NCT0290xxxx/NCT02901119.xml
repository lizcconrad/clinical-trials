  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is prevalent among chronic liver disease patients. Inadequate ingestion and/or
      metabolic alterations modify the body composition and biological functions. The purpose of
      this study is to determine whether whey protein comsumption, due to amino acid profile,
      digestibility and bioactive compounds may be beneficial for patients waiting for liver
      transplantation

      A randomized, double-blind, intervention study in which patients are randomly assigned to
      receive packages of 20g of whey protein (WP) or casein (CA) to take twice a day (20g in the
      morning and 20g at night), as a supplement, during 15 days. They are monitored weekly by
      calls. Regular usual diet is maintained. Patients underwent muscle functionality assessment
      by handgrip dynamometry and 6-min. walking test and, the inflammatory response by plasmatic
      cytokines. All tests are performed at the beginning and the end of intervention.
