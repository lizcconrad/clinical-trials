      Study over muscular stretching to reduce pain the oral cavity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a current opinion that muscular stretching is able to reduce pain and to allow increase
      of the opening excursion at the joints. To investigate this possibility in the face, the
      investigators developed a method of stretching associated with large dynamic jaws during
      chewing using a special device (Spring Device ®) for ten minutes, allowing the muscles of the
      oral cavity to relax. The height of the bite was set as two-thirds of the maximum opening
      (max. 2 cm.) of the mouth at rest (without forcing) thus avoiding maintaining the head of the
      condyle at maximum aperture for a long time. The subjects were then analyzed by means of
      kinesiography to determine the changes in the vertical dimension. Increasing stretching
      produces neuromuscular relaxation and a reduction of pain. This study showed that this
      therapy induces oral and extraoral pain reduction and increases neck mobility and mouth
      opening. The stimulation of trigeminal receptors is an important drive for therapy in the
      trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR).

    <measure>mandibular stretching induces a reduction of facial contraction and decrease of heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Those effects are described as trigemino-cardiac reflex. Application of a spring device (which consists of thin sheet of surgical steel bent in to a loop) induces a decrease of blood pressure and heart rate.</description>
