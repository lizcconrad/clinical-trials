  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is known to be frequent in depression, and in most of the psychiatric diseases. But
      as it can occur in patients with no psychiatric illness and doesn't occur in every patients
      with psychiatric illness, it has to be considered henceforth as a specific vulnerability.

      This trial will study two fMRI paradigms, emotional prosody recognition and decision making,
      in order to characterize emotional and cognitive trait factors in a population of patients
      vulnerable to suicide. Four different groups will be constituted : depressed suicide
      attempters, depressed patients with past history of suicidal acts, depressed patients with no
      history of suicidal acts and healthy controls.

      The main goal will be to correlate fMRI activation during the two paradigms in subjects
      vulnerable to suicide. The secondary goals will be to characterize emotional and cognitive
      trait factors in these subjects, to demonstrate that those characteristics are independent
      from depression and to correlate these trait factors with socio-demographic and clinical
      features with fMRI activations.
