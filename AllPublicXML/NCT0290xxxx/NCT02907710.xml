  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 300 patients with pathologically confirmed Locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, with 150 patients in
      each group. One group was treated with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar
      and the other group was treated with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy. The short term efficacy
      and the toxic and side effects of these treatments were evaluated. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year
      overall survival and progression-free survival of patients were analyzed. The investigators
      data may provide an alternative option for the treatment of Locoregionally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma with high efficacy and low toxicity.

      This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. A set of
      unified standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria,
      exclusion criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. Five medical centers
      participated in this study and 300 patients with pathologically confirmed Locoregionally
      advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. These patients were stratified according to
      clinical stage and participating center, and were randomly divided into two groups:
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, Endostar 7.5mg /
      m2, 3 cycles of intravenous infusion, and 2 cycles of maintenance therapy after radiotherapy)
      and concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, DDP 100mg / m2, intravenous infusion
      over 2 hours , for 2-3 cycles). After treatment, follow-up was performed every 3 months. The
      treatment toxicity, local control rate, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival,
      progression-free survival were observed and assessed.
