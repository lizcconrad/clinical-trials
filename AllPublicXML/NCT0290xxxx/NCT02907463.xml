      The purpose of this active, observational, open-label, non-randomized, post-market
      surveillance study is to confirm that EDWARDS INTUITY Elite reduces cross clamp time (XCT) in
      MIS setting when compared to published data with a conventional valve within the MIS setting.
      The published dataset will used as a control group. Then to describe short term (30 days) and
      long term (6 months) clinical safety, to assess and compare hemodynamic data with EDWARDS
      INTUITY Elite to a conventional valve at discharge and at 6 months post AVR, to assess
      Quality of Life at baseline, and at 6 months post AVR to assess NYHA functional class at
      baseline, discharge, 1 month and at 6 months post AVR to assess Fitness for hospital
      discharge.

      Aortic valve replacement with mechanical or biological heart valves is the treatment of
      choice for aortic valve stenosis. Over the past several years, life expectancy has increased
      in industrial nations, but this has been accompanied by a rising rate of elderly patients
      with multiple illnesses.

      Aortic stenosis remains the most common cause of adult valvular heart disease, the prevalence
      increasing with age. Average survival of patients treated conservatively has historically
      been reported as 2—5 years from the onset of symptoms. More recent studies have confirmed the
      dismal prognosis of severe aortic stenosis. Advanced age, reduced left-ventricular ejection
      fraction, congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency appear to be independent
      predictors of reduced survival. Asymptomatic patients with very severe aortic stenosis also
      share a poor prognosis with a high event rate and a risk of rapid functional deterioration.
      Early surgery offers a therapeutic option to improve clinical outcomes via decreasing cardiac
      mortality and improving symptoms.

      Bioprostheses offer several advantages over mechanical bioprostheses, the most important
      being freedom from anticoagulation with a low rate of thromboembolic accidents.

      In response to clinical need and in support of advances in minimally invasive surgical
      approaches to conventional AVR, Edwards Lifesciences developed the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite
      Valve System to achieve clinical benefits by reducing cardiopulmonary bypass and cross clamp
      times, while facilitating a less invasive approach to aortic valve replacement.

      The system includes the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite Valve System, Model 8300AB and the EDWARDS
      INTUITY Elite Delivery System, Model 8300DB; the valve is based on prior heart valve designs
      which have a long history of safety and effectiveness and have incorporated additional
      features designed to improve patient outcomes and safety.

      With only 3 guiding sutures and secure balloon expandable frame, the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite
      Valve system is well suited for smaller incisions and tight access, with an emphasis on
      procedural efficiency within existing operating suite of the surgeon.
