      The TwiCare® device is a removable brace that can be used in orthopedic referred to stimulate
      mandibular growth or in interception / contention.

      The proposed research project will focus initially on assessing the comfort and safety of
      TwiCare® device. The orthopedic efficiency therefore not part of this study.

      The comfort and safety of the brace will be evaluated firstly by the practitioner during the
      visit control around 2 ½ months (or 11 weeks) after the start of the port of the device, and
      with the help of a questionnaire completed by the patient at home 3 weeks and 6 weeks after
      the start of the port of the device, and during the control visit at 11 weeks.
