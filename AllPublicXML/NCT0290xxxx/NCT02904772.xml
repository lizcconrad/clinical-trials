  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to provide further confirmatory evidence of clinical benefit in LPLD
      patients treated with alipogene tiparvovec by assessing both the &quot;clinical response&quot; (as
      defined by a range of parameters), and &quot;the metabolic response&quot; (postprandial CM metabolism)
      in LPLD patients with and without an immunosuppressant regimen.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, randomised, open-label, parallel group study
      evaluating the clinical response as well as the dynamics of postprandial chylomicron
      metabolism in patients treated with alipogene tiparvovec with and without immunosuppressants.
      The study will be conducted in 12 LPLD patients who will be randomised into the Immuno+
      (cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil) or the Immuno- group.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The overall clinical response of alipogene tiparvovec in LPLD patients will be assessed compared to baseline, by a combination of measurements, of which each gives relevant information to obtain enough and solid evidence in a small trial. Each of these outcome measures will be evaluated in combination with the results of other measures (to get an overall conclusion relating the clinical response). Descriptive methods will be used (so no formal statistical analyses will be performed), due to the specific nature and the small sample size of a rare disease trial.</description>

    <description>Patients in the Immuno+ group will receive an immunosuppressant regimen to be initiated three days prior to alipogene tiparvovec administration.

Patients will receive IV bolus of 1mg/kg of methyl Prednisolone half an hour prior to IMP administration.</description>
