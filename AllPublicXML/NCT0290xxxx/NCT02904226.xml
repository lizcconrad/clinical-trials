    <textblock>
      JTX-2011-101 is a Phase 1/2, open label, dose escalation and expansion clinical study of
      JTX-2011 alone or in combination with a fixed dose of nivolumab in subjects with advanced
      solid tumors, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D), as well as to evaluate preliminary efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JTX-2011 is an agonist monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the Inducible
      CO-Stimulator of T cells (ICOS) to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is a Phase
      1/2, open label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion, first-in-human (FIH) clinical
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of the ICOS
      agonist monoclonal antibody JTX-2011 alone or in combination with a fixed dose of nivolumab
      in adult subjects with advanced refractory solid tumors. The study will be conducted in four
      parts: single agent (Part A) and combination therapy (Part B) dose escalation, and expansion
      cohorts of single agent (Part C) and combination therapy (Part D).
