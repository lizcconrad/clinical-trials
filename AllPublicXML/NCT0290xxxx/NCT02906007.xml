    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability
      of an antituberculosis drug, bedaquiline (BDQ), when used to treat multidrug-resistant
      tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected infants, children, and adolescents.

      This purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability
      of bedaquiline (BDQ) in combination with an optimized background multidrug-resistant
      tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment regimen in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected infants, children,
      and adolescents.

      The study will enroll HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children 0 to 18 years of age treated
      for clinically diagnosed or confirmed intrathoracic (pulmonary) MDR-TB and certain types of
      extrathoracic MDR-TB. Participants will be assigned to cohorts based on age. Cohort 1 will
      include children 6 years of age or older but less than 18 years of age; Cohort 2 will include
      children 2 years of age or older but less than 6 years of age; and Cohort 3 will include
      children 0 months of age and older but less than 2 years of age. Cohort 1 will be divided
      into two weight bands, one for participants weighing 15 kg or more but less than 30 kg and
      one for participants weighing 30 kg or more.

      Study visits will occur at enrollment (Day 0) and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32,
      40, 48, 60, 72, 96, and 120. Participants in Cohort 1 will take BDQ once a day during the
      first 2 weeks. For the next 22 weeks, BDQ will be taken three times a week. Dosing for
      Cohorts 2 and 3 will be determined based on data from Cohort 1.

      Study visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, an
      electrocardiogram (ECG), medical history reviews, and other assessments.

             protocol.

          -  Known personal or family history of long QT syndrome.

          -  Having a Grade 2 or higher for any of the following abnormalities at the time of
             screening or known within 30 days prior to enrollment according to the DAIDS Table for

             Version 2.0, November 2014:

                  higher increase in liver function test (LFT)

               -  Retesting and screening of the abnormalities listed above may be done as long as
                  the screening period of 30 days is observed. The last/latest values will be used
                  for purposes of final screening decisions.

          -  Having participated in other clinical studies with investigational agents or devices,
             within eight weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Currently taking any of the disallowed medications specified in the protocol. If
