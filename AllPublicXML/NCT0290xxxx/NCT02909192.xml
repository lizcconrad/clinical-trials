  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disruption of sleep and alertness is one of the most disabling non-motor symptoms of
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Mechanisms leading to impaired sleep and alertness in PD are not
      well understood, and treatment options remain limited. The proposed research will examine
      markers of the circadian system, sleepiness and sleep quality in PD patients. Further, the
      project will examine effects of bright light exposure on circadin function, sleep and
      alertness in PD.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of idiopathic PD as defined by the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank
             Criteria

          2. PD Hoehn and Yahr stage 2-4

          3. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score ≥ 5

          4. Treatment with levodopa and/or dopamine agonist; adjunctive PD medications will be
             allowed

          5. Stable dose of PD medications for at least 4 weeks prior to the study screening.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Atypical or secondary forms of parkinsonism

          2. Co-existent significant sleep apnea (as assessed by polysomnography- derived
             apnea/hypopnea index ≥15 events/hr of sleep)

          3. Co-existent restless legs syndrome (RLS), as assessed by the International
             Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICDS) diagnostic criteria for RLS

          4. Cognitive impairment as determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score
             of ≤ 26

          7. Use of hypno-sedative drugs for sleep or stimulants; participants will be allowed to
             taper these drugs and will become eligible 4 weeks after the taper is completed

          8. Use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) / Serotonin-Norepinephrine
             Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) antidepressants, unless the participant has been on a
             stable dose for at least 3 months prior to the screening

          9. Use of medications known to affect melatonin secretion, such as lithium, alpha- and
             beta-adrenergic antagonists

         10. Shift work, currently or within the prior 3 months

         11. Travel through ≥ 2 time zones within 60 days prior to study screening

         13. Pre-existing glaucoma/retinal disease contraindicated for light therapy (LT)

         14. Dense cataracts

         15. Use of medications known to photosensitize retinal tissue (phenothiazines,
             chloroquine, amiodarone, St. John's Wort)

         16. Unstable/serious medical illness.

         17. Pregnancy
