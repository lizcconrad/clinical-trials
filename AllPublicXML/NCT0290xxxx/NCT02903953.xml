      The very most part of clinical research in France takes place in teaching hospitals.
      Advantages to develop it in others hospitals are numerous: access to innovative treatments,
      improvement of healthcare quality, hospitals' attractiveness, increased inclusion rates and
      reduced selection bias. The objectives of the study are to report the current situation of
      clinical research outside of teaching hospitals in France.

      research outside of teaching hospitals in France.

      A three-stage survey was conducted between January and October 2012 in non-teaching hospitals
      of North-eastern France. First questionnaires were sent to administrative and medical boards
      of all hospitals with more than 100 beds, then to head doctors of every department in
