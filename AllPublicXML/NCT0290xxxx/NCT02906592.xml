      The objective of this study is to implement a brief geriatric oncology assessment (GOA) in a
      community-based oncology clinic, the Scotland Cancer Treatment Center - a clinic within the
      Duke Cancer Network, located in the rural, low resource Scotland County community of North
      Carolina. Secondly, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the brief GOA by
      comparing historical and post-GOA service referral patterns and adherence to planned cancer
      therapy. For this study, the investigators will prospectively enroll up to 60 patients who
      have been diagnosed and/or treated for cancer to complete the brief GOA. In addition to these
      60 patients, the investigators will also conduct retrospective chart reviews on 120 patients
      that would be eligible for this study to evaluate past referral patterns. Eligible and
      consented patients will complete the brief GOA at the Scotland Cancer Treatment Center
      alongside their normal clinic appointment. The investigators will assess impact on the
      healthcare system by evaluating referral patterns (i.e., how many, what type of services)
      using the brief GOA data and EHR data. The study value includes the possibility for
      recognition and access to additional health care referrals if needed.
