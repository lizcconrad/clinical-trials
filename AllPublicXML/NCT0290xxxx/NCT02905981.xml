  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to determine whether Triferic, administered orally with Shohl's solution,
      is safe and effective for the treatment of iron-refractory iron-deficiency anemia (IRIDA).

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, 3-period study assessing the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of
      Triferic and Shohl's solution administered orally to patients with IRIDA. A total of 28
      patients stratified by 4 age groups (age 0 to &lt;6 years, age 6 to &lt;12 years, age 12 to &lt;18
      years, and age &gt;=18 years) will be studied.

      Total participation in the study is between 4 weeks (Period 1) and 12 months (Periods 1, 2,
      and 3), depending upon how many Periods each patient participates in. Following screening, in
      Period 1 (iron absorption testing) patients undergo oral iron absorption testing during 3
      visits to confirm that they adequately absorb iron from Triferic when it is administered with
      Shohl's solution ('Triferic responders': patients with a maximal increase from baseline in
      serum iron concentration &gt;100 μg/dL following an oral Shohl's solution and Triferic dose).

      The 'Triferic responders' from Period 1 are then invited to participate in Period 2 (dose
      titration). The patients will receive Shohl's solution and Triferic orally up to 3 times per
      day for 4 months, titrated as needed based on laboratory results and patient tolerance, to
      determine whether their hemoglobin levels respond to this treatment. Period 2 'hemoglobin
      responders' (patients with an increase from baseline in Hgb concentration ≥1.0 g/dL at Visit
      9) will be invited to participate in period 3.

      In Period 3 patients will receive Shohl's solution and Triferic orally up to 3 times per day
      for an additional 6 months to determine whether the hemoglobin response observed in Period 2
      is sustainable. During Period 3, Shohl's solution and Triferic dose and frequency may
      continue to be titrated as needed based on laboratory results and patient tolerance.

      A follow-up visit will occur approximately 1 week after the last completed Period study
      visit, regardless of the Period that the patient completes the study.

All oral doses will be administered by study personnel at the research center. Blood tests will be conducted following each administration in order to measure iron absorption to see if patients qualify for Period 2.</description>

    <description>Patients who qualified as 'Triferic responders' in Period 1 will participate in Period 2. Patients will be given oral Shohl's solution and Triferic to administer at home 3 times per day, with the dose being titrated higher or lower based on lab results. The initial dose will be the same as Period 1 (Shohl's solution 0.67 mmol/kg followed 5 - 15 minutes later by Triferic orally 3 mg Fe/kg body weight) but may be adjusted during Period 2 based on lab results. Period 2 will involve 5 study visits, scheduled every 4 weeks. At the end of Period 2, blood tests will be performed to determine if patients qualify for Period 3.</description>
