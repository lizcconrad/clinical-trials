    <textblock>
      Project 2 of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) American Heart Association (AHA)
      Women's Health Program will assess 3-month changes in sitting time, standing time, physical
      activity and blood pressure in a randomized control trial (RCT). This 2-arm RCT will occur in
      the community with post menopausal Latina women (N=250) who spend at least 8 hrs/day sitting
      and have increased risk for cardiovascular disease through high BMI and other cardiometabolic
      risk factors. Women will be identified through the San Ysidro Health Center and assessed at
      the South Bay Latino Research Center.

      Project 2 will address the following aims:

        1. Investigate the 3 month effect of the intervention to impact the primary behavioral
           outcomes of sitting, standing and stepping time assessed objectively by a thigh worn
           inclinometer (ActivPAL) in Latinas at risk for heart disease.

        2. Investigate the 3 month effect of the intervention to impact the secondary health
           outcomes of blood pressure, depressive symptoms, and anthropometrics.

        3. Explore the psychosocial &amp; environmental mediators &amp; moderators of changes in sitting
           time.

    <description>The 'reduce sitting' intervention group will receive three in-person health coaching sessions followed by five counseling phone calls. Participants will wear a thigh worn inclinometer for the first 3 weeks of the intervention, and at the mid-point of the intervention. At each in-person health coaching session participants will receive feedback from the ActivPAL showing periods throughout the day where participants have been sitting. In addition to the three initial in-person counseling sessions using the ActivPAL feedback, participants will receive phone calls from the health educator biweekly to help overcome barriers, to work on self-monitoring and planning skills, and to prepare relapse prevention. Tools to help prompt standing, including a standing desk, will also be provided.</description>
