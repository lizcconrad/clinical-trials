  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and acceptability of two cognitive-behavioural
      interventions for reassurance seeking behaviour in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a
      family accommodation reduction protocol vs. a novel support-seeking protocol. Half of
      participants will be randomly assigned to participate in the support-seeking intervention,
      whereas the other half will participate in the family accommodation reduction intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An existing family accommodation reduction intervention to reduce reassurance seeking
      behaviour in OCD (which represents treatment as usual, or TAU) is being compared to a novel
      support-seeking intervention to determine which is more efficacious and acceptable to
      participants.

      The TAU protocol asks participants to make an agreement with their significant others to
      withhold reassurance when it is sought. It is believed that this behaviourally-based
      intervention encourages extinction of reassurance seeking over time by eliminating
      reinforcement of the behaviour by significant others.

      The support-seeking intervention asks participants to move towards adaptively seeking support
      from a significant other to manage anxiety or distress rather than seeking reassurance.
      Significant others are taught to provide support rather than reassurance. It is believed that
      support-seeking may reduce reassurance seeking behaviour because it helps participants manage
      the anxiety or distress that underlies the requests for reassurance without interfering with
      disconfirmatory learning.
