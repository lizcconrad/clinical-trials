      To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the independent effects of motivational interviewing
      and rate reduction, individually versus in combination, for motivating smokers who are not
      ready to quit (SNRTQ) to increase both quit attempts and tobacco abstinence. Given the
      disseminability and the fact that findings can be readily translated into the network of
      tobacco quitlines, we propose: (1) To test a tobacco quitline for SNRTQ, following methods
      that we have previously implemented and evaluated (HL-123978, CA-127964); (2) To randomize
      828 SNRTQs to: (a) Brief Advice + typical smoking cessation resources (control group); (b)
      motivational interviewing format recommended by the Clinical Practice Guidelines; (c)
      behavioral and pharmacologic rate reduction, and (d) both motivational interviewing and
      behavioral and pharmacologic rate reduction. This design allows us to evaluate the
      independent and additive effects of motivational interviewing and rate reduction on quit
      attempts and smoking cessation.

      We plan to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention utilizing point prevalence at the
      12-month follow-up. The Society for Research in Nicotine and Tobacco consensus paper
      concluded that point prevalence (7 days without a cigarette, &quot;not even a puff&quot;) is an
      appropriate measure in measuring long term outcome in cessation induction trials. Prolonged
      abstinence at the 12-month follow-up and quit attempts at the 2-, 4- and 6-month and the
      12-month follow-up are secondary endpoints. Self-efficacy, level of smoking reduction,
      tobacco dependence, intentions, motivation, and confidence to quit, and intervention
      adherence (# sessions attended, amount of nicotine replacement therapy used) will be tested
      as important treatment mediators.

    <textblock>
      On the Society for Research in Nicotine and Tobacco definition of a cessation induction
      trial, which is a treatment that promotes cessation among all smokers, including those not
      ready to quit.1 One implication of this design is that success is based on percent abstinent
      at a given point in time and do not tie a follow-up to a determined quit date (since smokers
      not ready to quit often don't typically set formal quit dates).

      Investigators research led to a four condition treatment design as the main independent
      variable of interest. Participants will be randomly assigned to four treatment conditions:
      (1) Brief advice; (2) motivational interviewing; (3) rate reduction; and (4) combination of
      motivational interviewing and rate reduction. All four intervention conditions will receive
      three sessions once a week, ideally, but can extend to a 6 week time period, each
      approximately 30 minutes in length, provided over a period of 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the
      participant's circumstances. Upon the completion of the main components, Booster sessions
      will be administered in 2-month increments throughout the intervention period (2 month, 4
      month, &amp; 6 month follow-up) in conjunction with study assessments. The window for the Booster
      sessions will be as indicated above 2M, 4M, and 6M after enrollment, but we will continue to
      try and reach them to complete the booster session for 4 weeks. For example, 2 month booster
      window opens at 8 weeks after enrollment and we will try to complete that 2 month booster
      within 4 weeks. Twelve months after randomization, prolonged abstinence will be measured.
