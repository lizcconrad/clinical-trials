  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, non-therapeutic study will determine whether a novel imaging technique can
      identify presumptive tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) in patients with ocular tumours.

      In this study, we will modify the standard angiography protocol by having patients return
      twice in the week following angiography for additional photographs. Photographs will be
      obtained 2-7 days after angiography, but without further injection of dye. This technique
      contrasts with normal angiography in which photographs are taken during the transit phase of
      dye circulation and in the minutes thereafter. Of note, both the dye and the cameras used for
      its detection have been approved for clinical use for several decades and are routinely used
      in the evaluation of patients with ocular tumours.

      We will evaluate 5 groups:

        1. Choroidal nevus (low-risk features): requires distinction from melanoma through
           diagnostic testing

        2. Choroidal indeterminate melanocytic lesion (high-risk features): requires diagnostic
           testing for identification and distinction from nevus and melanoma

        3. Choroidal melanoma: requires confirmation of diagnosis and evaluation for potential
           metatstases

        4. Suspected metastatic tumour (ie, primary tumour elsewhere): requires identification of
           primary tumour

        5. Locally treated ocular tumours: requires followup to evaluate response to treatment and
           potential change or repeat therapy

        Potential study subjects will be identified from within the circle of care of the attending
        physicians. Subjects must be 18 years of age or older, be able to understand the study
        protocol, and provide informed consent. They must be able to attend all three visits
