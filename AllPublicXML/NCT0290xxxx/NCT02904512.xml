  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several observational studies have shown that uncontrolled hyperglycemia in hospitalized
      patients in the non-critical care, non-Intensive Care Unit (non-ICU) setting is associated
      with prolonged length of stay, increased mortality and an increased incidence of infections.
      Randomized clinical trials in both the critical and the non-ICU settings have shown that by
      improving glucose control there is a decrease in the incidence of infections, length of stay
      and inpatient health care costs.

      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have evolved as useful devices providing
      excellent clinical care in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). These systems detect glucose
      in subcutaneous interstitial fluid using a glucose sensor that transmits glucose measurements
      to a receiving device that reads out average glucose levels every couple of minutes.

      In this clinical trial the investigators propose to examine the clinical use of CGM in
      hospitalized patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2). CGM use may improve glucometric
      values and clinical outcomes in hospitalized individuals with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2).

      We use CGM devices to monitor but also to transmit glucose values wirelessly to monitoring
      devices that are in the nursing station. Half of the participants are placed on Real Time CGM
      (alarms turned on) and half of them are placed on blinded CGM values (alarms turned off).
      Nursing staff will be notified when glucose is &lt;85 mg/dl , in order to treat and potentially
      prevent a potential hypoglycemic episode.
