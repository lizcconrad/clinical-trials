      Background:

      The investigators assessed the use of a colonoscopy instructional video to improve both bowel
      preparation and education prior to procedure. Preceding studies have been vague, pinning
      patient education via diagrams and text as both pivotal and useless for compliance in bowel
      preparations. These studies however lacked assessment of comprehension prior to procedure.

      Methodology:

      This is a prospective study of diverse, inner city outpatient university center, first time
      colonoscopy patients given 1 of 2 on-site videos and written/verbal instruction.
      Experimentals saw a 5 min video on the purpose of colonoscopy, bowel preparation,
      pre-colonoscopy diet, and proper laxative use. Controls saw a 5 min video from the same
      spokesperson on upper endoscopy; which was trivial. Both groups were given a quiz within 30
      days of the colonoscopy on demographics, and 14 test questions about colonoscopy and
      preparation. Subsequently, endoscopists used the additive Ottawa scale to rate quality of
      preparation (range 0-14) via: fluid (0=sm,1=mod, 2=lg) and cleanliness in each the right, mid
      and rectosigmoid colon, (0=excellent, 1=good, 2=fair, 3=poor, 4=inadequate).
