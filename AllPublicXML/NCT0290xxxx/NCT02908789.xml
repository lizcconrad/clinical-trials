  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) in deep
      carious lesions. This is an in vivo study approved at the Research Ethics Committee, which
      will be conducted in 30 patients between 3 and 12 years. Patients included in the study
      should have at least one primary molar or permanent with deep active caries limited occlusal
      / proximal surfaces involving beyond the inner half of dentin. The investigators will
      considered from exclusion criteria children whose parents refuse to sign the informed consent
      document; children who do not cooperate with the clinical examination/treatment; children
      with syndromes or chronic systemic diseases; teeth with painful symptoms consistent with
      irreversible pulpitis or mobility; periodontal changes; roots with pathological resorption;
      cases of primary teeth roots in advanced stage of physiological resorption and patients that
      have made the use of any antibiotics during the study period or within three months prior to
      its beginning. The treatments will be carried out after local anesthesia and isolation of the
      operative field with a rubber dam. The removal of carious dentin surface demineralized
      necrotic and not subject to remineralization will be held with drill at low rpm under cooling
      with sterile saline. The removal of decayed tissue will start by the side walls and later on
      the pulp wall. After this time the intervention with aPDT using 0.01% methylene blue as
      photosensitizer will be held. Finally, the cavity is restored with adhesive and composite
      resin system. The dentin samples will be collected with the help of spoon sterile dentine in
      two stages: C1 after digging and C2 after aPDT. The microbiological analyzes will be
      conducted with counting of colony forming units (CFU / mg of carious dentin), blindly from
      coded samples. The viability of microorganisms will be evaluated in the following culture
      media: Brain Heart Infusion agar for feasibility total microorganisms; CHROMagar candida to
      Candida genus; Mitis Salaviarius agar with addition of bacitracin 0.2 U/mL, sucrose and
      glucose to Streptococcus mutans; Mitis Salivarius agar to total Streptococcus; Rogosa Agar to
      Lactobacillus spp. and enterococcosel for Enterococcus genus. The reproducibility of the
      counting method will be verified between triplicates. Microbiological data will be evaluated
      with appropriate statistical tests with a level of 5%. Based on this project is expected to
      prove the clinical efficacy of aPDT using 0.01% methylene blue as an adjunct in reducing of
      microorganisms from interior of deep carious lesions contributing to the clinical and
      radiographic success.

    <description>The technique consists of a basic protocol of two steps: the use of a photosensitizer and the laser application. In the first step, the cavity was dried and then 0.01% methylene blue solution (Formula &amp; Ação, São Paulo, Brazil) was applied to the entire cavity using a carpule in order to keep in contact with all the walls. It remained in the cavity for a pre-irradiation period of 5 minutes. In the second step, the excess of 0.01% methylene blue solution was removed and the cavity was irradiated with an Indium Gallium Aluminum Phosphorus diode laser (InGaAlP) (Laser DUO®, MM Optics, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil) with a wavelength of 660 nm (visible red), a spot area of 3mm2, and fixed output power of 100 mW. We adopted the following parameters: energy of 9 J with 90 seconds of exposure time. The irradiation was applied in continuous mode and the laser array was positioned, in contact, directly over the central part of the cavity.</description>

    <description>Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is an effective low potency laser that involves the activation of a photosensitizer( 0.01% methylene blue ) by a visible light source that creates chemical reactions, producing cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and causing oxidative stress and inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms.</description>
