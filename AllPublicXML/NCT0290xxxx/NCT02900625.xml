  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is offered to young girls and women aged under 35 who have
      to undergo sterilizing gonadotoxic treatment, with the aim of preserving their fertility. The
      main part of the ovary is preserved, as primordial and primary follicles are resistant to
      freezing / thawing protocols. In the absence of other techniques (in vivo maturation,
      injecting isolated ovarian follicles, etc.) autografting this cryopreserved tissue is
      currently the only technique allowing fertility to be restored. Autograft is possible only if
      the indication for ovary cryopreservation is a non-neoplastic pathology or a malignant
      pathology with a low risk of ovarian metastasis. In other cases of neoplastic pathologies,
      particularly in cases of acute leukemia, tissue cannot as yet be re-used due to the lack of
      any codified technique for evaluating residual disease (MRD). The team has for two years been
      developing and validating a technique to look for residual disease in fragments of ovarian
      cortex in cases of acute leukemia. This technique is based on an original protocol for
      dissociating ovarian tissue to obtain a population of isolated ovarian cells that may be
      analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. The specificity and sensitivity of the technique have
      been demonstrated in an experimental model. This model consists in using 8 color flow
      cytometry to look for characterizable leukemia cells added in different dilutions to a
      population of isolated ovarian cells taken from model ovarian cortex and up to a dilution of
      10-5. When the molecular markers were present on diagnosis, they were found by RQ-PCR with
      the same dilutions. The model tissue came from laparoscopic ovarian drilling in patients with
      polycystic ovary syndrome. The main objective of this project is to validate techniques that
      have been previously codified with different populations of leukemia cells that may be
      characterized. The investigators then aim to adapt and validate this technique to look for
      MRD using 8 color flow cytometry on cryopreserved fragments of ovarian cortex from leukemia
      patients that are at risk of metastasis. Secondary objectives will be to implement procedures
      for oncological qualification of grafts in cases of malignant pathology and to consider the
      recommendations for using this cryopreserved ovarian tissue through the autograft technique
      for these indications.

        Ovarian cortex residues, coming from the preparation of ovarian cortex fragments, will be
        used as study material for research of the Minimal Residual Disease (MRD). Tissues will be
        obtained in patients candidates for cryopreservation of ovarian tissue before their
        gonadotoxic treatment against acute leukemia.
