             age-specific requirements apply:

             Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been

             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results

         18. Subjects with uncontrolled seizures.

         19. History of interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis
             (including drug induced), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT
             scan.
