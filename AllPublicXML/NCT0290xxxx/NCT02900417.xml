      The present study will recruit 9 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patient to receive
      sitagliptin 100mg daily for 12 weeks. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      composition of gut microbiota before and after the therapy of sitagliptin.

      The present study will included 9 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patient to receive
      sitagliptin 100mg daily for 12 weeks. These patients will receive 75g oral glucose tolerance
      test and fasting plasma glucose levels, lipids levels, fasting insulin levels and 2 hour
      post-load plasma glucose levels will be measured. Stool samples will be collected before the
      initiation of the use of sitagliptin. After 12 weeks, all patients will have fasting plasma
      glucose levels, lipids levels, fasting insulin levels tested. Stool samples will be collected
      again.
