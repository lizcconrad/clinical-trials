    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the effect of an intensive smoking cessation intervention
      (motivational counseling combined with nicotine replacement) on smoking cessation and disease
      activity in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Half of the patients will participate in
      a smoking cessation intervention; the other half will receive usual treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco smoking is a well-known environmental risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA). The onset of RA can occur in all age groups, with the majority being women aged 50-60
      years. RA is a chronic inflammatory disease and cannot be cured. However, the activity of the
      disease can be reduced by medication. During periods with high disease activity, patients
      experience increased pain and fatigue and subsequent restrictions in social life, psychical
      activity and activities of daily life. Furthermore, the inflammatory process underlying RA
      can cause pain, fatigue, reduced health-related quality of life and reduced physical
      function. Patients with RA are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases similar to the
      risk demonstrated in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, several studies indicate that
      smokers with inflammatory arthritis tend to experience more pain and fatigue, and a reduced
      quality of life compared to non-smokers.

      Aim: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) in patients with RA aims to examine the effect of
      intensive smoking cessation intervention (motivational counselling combined with tailored
      nicotine replacement therapy) versus standard care on smoking cessation, and consequently on
      disease activity. Secondary objectives are to explore the effect on flare, risk factors for
      CVD, lung function, physical function, HR-QoL, pain and fatigue in patients with RA.

      Material and Methods Trial design: The trial is an international, multicentre, randomized RCT
      in which daily smokers with RA in remission or with low-moderate disease activity â‰¤ 5.1 DAS28
      (Disease Activity Score - based on 28 joints assessment, serum-C-reactive protein (CRP) and
      patient's Global assessment of a visual analogue scale (VAS)) will be randomized 1:1 to
      either an intervention group or to a control group. Patients will be followed for 58 weeks,
      including the 6-week intervention period and 3 months, 6 months and 12 months into the
      post-intervention follow-up period.

      Study setting: We will recruit patients from the Center for Rheumatology and Spine Diseases,
      Rigshospitalet, Denmark and from the Preventive Cardio-Rheuma Clinic, Department of
      Rheumatology, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

      Randomization and blinding: Immediately after collecting baseline data using stratified block
      randomization (block size 6-10) participants will be randomized to either 1) the intervention
      group or 2) the control group. The stratification variables are trial site and Anti-cyclic
      citrullinated peptide (Anti-CCP status). The allocation sequence is generated using
      computer-generated random numbers. Participants will be informed about their group allocation
      directly after randomization. For participants randomized to the smoking cessation
      intervention group, the first intervention meeting will be scheduled as soon as possible,
      preferably immediately after randomization. It is not possible either to blind participants
      to their allocated intervention or to blind the project nurses performing the intervention.
      The primary outcomes will be assessed by blinded assessors and smoking cessation will be
      self-reported by participants and validated biochemically.

      Data collection:All outcomes are assessed at three months (18 weeks post-intervention), 6
      months (30 weeks post-intervention) and 12 months follow-up (58 weeks post-intervention).

      We will retrieve data from the DANBIO database regarding the participants' pharmacological
      treatment, duration of RA, CRP levels, IgM rheumatoid factor and Anti-CCP status. Additional
      descriptive data include participants' demography, socio economic situation, lifestyle
      (smoking and alcohol) and consumption of pain killers obtained via a questionnaire.
      Co-morbidities are assessed using the Charlson's Co-morbidity Scale obtained from the
      electronic patient journal.

      All participant-reported questionnaires will be completed electronically on a tablet
      connected to DANBIO, which will be used only for participants in the trial. Blood samples
      will be destroyed immediately after the analyses are done.

      All outcomes excluding patient-reported outcomes will be assessed by project nurses blinded
      to the patients' group allocation.

      Ethics, confidentiality and dissemination: The trial will be carried out in accordance with
      the Helsinki Declaration. The project has been approved by The Regional Committee on Health
      Research Ethics (H-16022001) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (I-suite number 04849).
      The trial has been reported to Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02901886). All data and information
      collected during the trial will be kept confidential and in accordance with the requirements
      of the Danish and Norwegian Data Protection Agencies and Good Clinical Practice.

    <description>Smoking status will be monitored by self-reported continuous smoking cessation and biochemically validated by exhaled CO. Continuous smoking cessation will be measured by asking the patients who reports 7-day point prevalence (7 day time-line follow back) how many days they have not been smoking. Smoking status information is self-reported by the participant and documented in the smoking diary at 3 months post intervention (week 18). To be grouped as having &quot;stopped smoking&quot; both self-reported and biochemical analysis should indicate this.</description>

    <description>HAQ is a standardized questionnaire for assessing disability and physical function in patients with RA. The instrument contains 20 items with four possible answers in eight categories; dressing, rising from a seat, eating, walking, personal hygiene, stretching for an object, grabbing an object and everyday activities. The questionnaire also includes VAS scales for pain, fatigue and general health. In DANBIO five additional questions have been added. They also have four possible answers and relate to physical function, sleep, anxiety and depression. In this study we will use the 25 questions as used in DANBIO.</description>

    <description>HR-QoL is measured using the following two questionnaires:
SF-36 is a generic instrument measuring HR-QoL by 36 items on eight scales. The scales are; physical function, physical activity, limitations, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional activity limitations and mental health; they are summarized in two summary scales; 1) the physical component scale (PCS) and 2) the mental component scale (MCS).
The questionnaire contains five items (movement, personal care, usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression) each with five possible ratings.</description>

    <description>The intervention includes 1) Individual motivational counseling in combination with 2) nicotine replacement therapy.
The intervention consists of five individual motivational counselling sessions, each lasting 20 to 40 minutes over a period of six weeks with a trained smoking cessation counsellor. The principles of motivational counselling are based on the trans theoretical model of change. The smoking cessation counsellor has also been trained in motivational counselling techniques specific to this intervention.
2. Nicotine replacement therapy The participants in the intervention group will be offered nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) free of charge and if accepted it will be tailored individually according to the FagerstrÃ¶m's Test for Nicotine Dependence.
The participants will note their tobacco and NRT consumption in a smoking diary.</description>
