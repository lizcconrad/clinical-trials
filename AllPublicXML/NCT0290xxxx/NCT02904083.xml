      Bipolar disorders are common psychiatric disorders characterized by severe and recurrent
      symptomatic periods (Major Depressive Episode, mania, hypomania) and interictal periods
      characterized by persistent residual symptoms, impaired functioning and quality of life. In
      addition, the prognosis of bipolar disorder is aggravated by an increased risk of suicide and
      a high frequency of somatic comorbidities. Poor adherence is one of the major factors
      influencing the course of the disorder and one of the causes of ineffective treatments.
      Considering that between 20 and 60% of patients with bipolar disorder have problems with
      adherence. Adherence is modulated by a number of socio-demographic, clinical and
      neuropsychological factors. It is also modulated by the knowledge, beliefs and In addition,
      studies have shown that the reasons attributed to poor adherence are different depending on
      whether questioning patients or healthcare professionals. This fault diagnosis, assessment of
      the causes and &quot;fit&quot; into the reasons associated with poor adherence is an aggravating factor
      of the problem. However, this factor seems modifiable by better training of professionals. A
      team from Newcastle University in England has developed a training program for all health
      professionals to improve the diagnosis and understanding of compliance issues in bipolar
      patients and provide simple tools to fight against patients with this problem. The
      investigators assume that this training will improve medication adherence among outpatients
      by trained professionals.
