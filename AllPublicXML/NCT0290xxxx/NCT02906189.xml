      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety of MRI in patients with non-MRI
      conditional pacemakers. The secondary objective is to determine if there are clinically
      relevant parameter changes in the devices.

        Patients with non-MRI conditional pacemakers and ICDs referred for clinically indicated MRI
        scans.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria. All patients with non-MRI conditional pacemakers and ICDs between the
        ages of 18-85 will be eligible to participate. Medical records will be reviewed to confirm
        the date and make/model of device implanted. Ordering physician discusses the MRI request
        with radiologist, documenting that there is no appropriate alternate imaging test. Patient
        must have an appointment with a cardiologist/electrophysiologist prior to MRI. Banner
        Health policy for standard of care guidelines involving patients receiving MRI's will be
        followed.

        Exclusion Criteria. Patients will be excluded from MRI based on the Department of Radiology
        protocol. Additional exclusion criteria include: ICD and pacemaker dependent, Pacemaker
        inserted before 2002, Epicardial leads, fractured leads, abandoned leads, or temporary
        pacemakers (post-coronary artery bypass graft temporary epicardial pacing wires are
        acceptable), Patient not awake or unable communicate, Battery voltage at elective
        replacement interval, implanted non-MRI conditional device (other than pacemaker/ICD).
