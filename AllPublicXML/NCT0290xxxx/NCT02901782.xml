  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microwave ablation of bone tumors is time-consuming and usually results in postoperative
      fractures. Hence the investigators designed and fabricated a titanium plate customized to the
      patient's bone structures for fixation after the removal of tumorous tissue, to improve the
      clinical outcomes of microwave ablation.

      3D models of tumor-bearing bone segments were constructed by using computed tomography (CT)
      and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 3D models were used to design the model of
      personalized titanium plates. The model of the plates was transferred into a numerical
      control machine for manufacturing the personalized titanium plates by 3D printing technology.
      The plates were then surgically implanted for reconstruction assistance following
      microwave-induced hyperthermia to remove the bone tumor. Implementation parameters and knee
      function were then evaluated.
