  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate the effect if whey protein on postprandial glycaemia and
      appetite in type II diabetics, assessing incretin (GLP-1, GIP), insulin, and appetite control
      (leptin, PYY3-36) hormone responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whey protein accounts of ~20% of whole milk protein. Ingestion of whey protein at meal times
      generates insulinotrophic/Î²-cell stimulation via amino acid absorption and the bioactive
      peptides generated during gastrointestinal digestion, resulting in attenuation of
      postprandial blood glucose. The bioactive peptides stimulate the release of incretin hormone,
      GLP-1, and inhibit DPP-IV activity potentially decreasing the rate of GLP-1 degradation.

      The current study will employ a randomised, double-blind, counter-balanced, cross-over
      design, whereby participants will each complete three trials; a) whey protein, b) hydrolysed
      protein, and c) placebo intervention. Hydrolysed protein provides amino acid content, without
      bioactive peptides associated with incretin release, therefore, demonstrating insulinotrophic
      properties, only.

      Many studies within the literature are limited for practical reasons, such as investigating
      high dosages (30-50 g) of whey protein, or high glycaemic index meal types which would be
      unlikely to form part of habitual dietary activity of type II diabetics. Therefore, the
      current study will objectively measure postprandial glycaemic and appetite responses
      following the ingestion of whey/hydrolysed protein, whilst ensuring ecological validity,
      dosages (18 g) and test meals applicable to everyday life, and true clinical utility for
      managing type-II diabetes by integrating interventions into the habitual lives of type-II
      diabetic individuals.
