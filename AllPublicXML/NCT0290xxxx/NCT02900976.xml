    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how rituximab and latent membrane protein (LMP)-specific
      T-cells work in treating pediatric solid organ recipients with Epstein-Barr virus-positive,
      cluster of differentiation (CD)20-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab may block tumor growth in different ways by
      targeting certain cells. LMP-specific T-cells are special immune system cells trained to
      recognize proteins found on post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder tumor cells if they
      are infected with Epstein-Barr virus. Giving rituximab and LMP-specific T-cells may be better
      in treating pediatric organ recipients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder than
      rituximab alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of treating pediatric and young adult solid organ transplant
      recipients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive CD20-positive
      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) with a novel T cell therapeutic,
      allogeneic Latent Membrane Protein(LMP)1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (third party
      latent membrane protein [LMP]-specific T cells), in a cooperative group setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percentage of eligible patients for whom a suitable LMP-specific T cell
      product derived from a third party LMP-specific T cell bank is available.

      II. To estimate the response rate (RR) to three doses of rituximab (RTX) as single agent in
      children and young adults with EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after solid organ
      transplantation (SOT).

      III. To estimate the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of children and young adults with
      EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX with/without LMP-specific T cells.

      IV. To estimate overall survival (OS) of children and young adults with EBV-positive
      CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX with/without LMP-specific T cells.

      V. To estimate the RR to LMP-specific T cells of children and young adults with EBV-positive
      CD20-positive PTLD after SOT who have not had a complete response to RTX.

      VI. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) of children and young adults with
      EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX with/without LMP-specific T cells.

      VII. To describe the toxicity of third party LMP-specific T cells in children and young
      adults with EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX and LMP-specific T
      cells.

      VIII. To validate that absence of EBV viremia correlates with RR, EFS and OS.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether third party LMP-specific T cells promote autologous immune
      reconstitution of EBV-specific T cells.

      II. To determine whether EBV viremia is inversely correlated with an increase in EBV-specific
      T cells in vivo.

      III. To determine whether plasma cytokine profile and changes in cytokines over time
      correlate with treatment response or toxicity (e.g. cytokine release syndrome).

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15. Course continues
      for up to 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (RTX): Patients with newly diagnosed PTLD who achieve a complete response (CR) receive
      additional rituximab as in induction.

      ARM II (LMP-TC): Patients with newly diagnosed PTLD who achieve a partial response (PR),
      stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), or recurrent PTLD regardless of response after
      induction, receive allogeneic LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes IV over 1- 2 minutes
      on days 0 and 7. Course continues for up to 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PR or SD after first course of course allogeneic
      LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes receive an additional course.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months.
