  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional analgesia via caudal neuraxial blockade provides pain relief for pediatric patients
      following urological and lower extremity procedures. The injection of local anesthetic into
      the caudal epidural space causes a sensory loss. This sympathetic blockade in turn causes a
      vasodilation, or increased blood flow, to the lower extremities.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the FLIR ONE thermographic camera, a
      smartphone attachment which utilizes an application (&quot;app&quot;) to measure the temperature at a
      site on an image of the lower extremity, will be able to differentiate between caudal,
      non-caudal, and failed caudal images.

    <description>Reviewers blinded to intervention groups will asses patient pre-caudal, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minute post-caudal images and rate whether, based on the image, they believe the patient received a caudal or not. The sensitivity and specificity of the FLIR ONE as a diagnositic tol will then be determined.</description>

    <measure>Temperature differences between pre-caudal and 5 minute post-caudal images</measure>
    <time_frame>Images will be captured prior to caudal and 5 minutes immediately afterwards. Assessments will be done through study completion, an average of 1 week following procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Temperature differences between pre-caudal and 5 minute images will be summarized in both groups. Images in the non-caudal group will be taken at similar time points following anesthesia induction relative to caudal group patients.</description>
