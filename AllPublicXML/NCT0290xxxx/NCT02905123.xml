    <textblock>
      Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is an online platform that has become a popular means of
      recruiting participants with problem drinking, gambling, or even illicit drug use for the
      purposes of survey-based research. There is also the possibility that potential participants
      could be identified through MTurk for online longitudinal studies, including for brief
      intervention research. The potential to quickly and easily identify large numbers of
      participants through MTurk is important for research evaluating online interventions during
      the period that these interventions are being developed and refined. However, before
      proposing MTurk workers as a viable source for participants in online intervention trials, it
      is important to evaluate the feasibility of using MTurk for such a purpose. This pilot study
      proposes to test this feasibility by systematically replicating a trial of an extensively
      evaluated brief online intervention for hazardous alcohol use (CheckYourDrinking; CYD) and
      will attempt to recruit and follow-up participants for this replication using people
      recruited through MTurk.

      Participants will be recruited through Amazon's MTurk crowdsourcing platform. Participants
      identified as problem drinkers based on an initial survey will be invited to complete another
      survey in 3 months time. Those who are interested will be randomized to receive access to the
      Check Your Drinking screener (CYD condition) or to a no additional information condition
      (control condition). At three-months post-baseline, the MTurk portal will be used to send
      invitation emails that contain a link to the follow-up survey. The primary hypothesis to be
      tested is that participants receiving access to the CYD intervention will report a greater
      level of reduction in number of drinks in a typical week between the baseline survey and
      three-month follow-up as compared to participants in the no information control condition.
