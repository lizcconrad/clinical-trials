      The First In Human (FIH) study is a long-term, single center, non-randomized study
      established by Lombard Medical, Inc. to collect &quot;on-label&quot; data in the clinical setting on
      patients undergoing endovascular repair with IntelliFlex™, the latest generation of the
      Aorfix™ AAA Flexible Stent Graft Delivery System, for treatment of abdominal aortic and
      aorto-iliac aneurysms in anatomy where the aorta in the aneurysm neck is bent through an
      angle between 0° and 90°.

    <description>Successful implant delivery is also called Primary Technical Success, defined as successful introduction and deployment of the device in the absence of surgical conversion or mortality, Type I or III endoleaks or graft limb obstruction. Treatment success, or Clinical Success should requires successful deployment of the endovascular device at the intended location without death as a result of aneurysm-related treatment, type I or III endoleak, graft infection or thrombosis, aneurysm expansion (diameter &gt;=5 mm, or volume &gt;=5%), aneurysm rupture, or conversion to open repair.
The numbers of participants having Primary Technical Success on completion of the index procedure and Clinical Success 12 months after the procedure will be recorded.</description>
