      The purpose of Iberis-HTN trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of renal
      denervation in subjects with primary hypertension by using Iberis multielectrode renal
      denervation system

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose was to evaluate 3-month outcomes of RDN for the treatment of primary hypertension
      in Chinese patients.In a prospective, multi-center study, 216 Chinese patients with primary
      hypertension would be recruited to undergo RDN by Iberis Multielectrode denervation system.
      The primary effectiveness endpoint wasReduction in average 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood
      pressue at 3 months follow-up.
