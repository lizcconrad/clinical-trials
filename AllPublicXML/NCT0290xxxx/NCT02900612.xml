  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effects of two water-based training models in physiological
      parameters of dyslipidemic elderly women. Thus, a randomized controlled clinical trial will
      be conducted in parallel with the participation of 45 dyslipidemic elderly women.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The women will be randomly divided into three groups: water aerobics training (WA),
      resistance aquatic training (WR) and the third is the control group (who will perform
      relaxation sessions under water). The three groups will attend classes during 10 weeks, with
      two weekly sessions of 45 minutes each. The WA and WR groups will use the same four exercises
      in their training.

      The WA group will be trained using the interval method, performing six blocks of five minutes
      each one, alternating four minutes at intensities corresponding to 90 to 100% of the heart
      rate corresponding to the second ventilatory threshold (HRVT2) and one minute at intensities
      between 80 and 90% HRVT2.

      The WR group will perform four to eight sets of 20 to 10 seconds along the macrocycle, always
      at maximal speed execution of the exercises.

      Will be measured, before and after the period of 10 weeks of intervention, biochemical,
      cardiorespiratory, neuromuscular and hemodynamic variables, parameters of quality of life and
      depressive symptoms in addition to the cardiovascular risk score of the participants of the
      three groups.

      Data will be described by means values and lower and upper limits, with a 95% confidence
      interval. Comparisons between and within groups were performed using the method of
      generalized estimates of equations (GEE), with Bonferroni post hoc, adopting a 0.05
      significance level.
