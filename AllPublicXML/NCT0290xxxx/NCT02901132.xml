  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition in oncologic patients has a negative impact on post- surgical recovery, survival
      and quality of life. The etiology of malnutrition in cancer patients is multifactorial,
      therefore, the nutritional assessment should be carried out by different parameters. The
      objective of this study is to investigate the association and prognostic value of five
      distinct methods of nutritional assessment (molecular, body composition, functional,
      anthropometric and subjective) in relation to postoperative complications and short-term
      survival in patients with cancer. Regarding the molecular parameter, mtor signaling pathwayon
      will be assessed in rectus muscle samples, harvested in the moment of the operation. Body
      composition was assessed by computed tomography (CT) and bioelectrical impedance test was
      conducted to evaluate the phase angle. Handgrip strength was used to determine functionality.
      The percentage of weight loss in relation to usual weight was the anthropometric parameter
      used. Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) was used to provide the nutritional diagnosis.
      Postoperative complications were classified according to the Dindo and Clavien
      classification. Overall time survival was the period between the first assessment of the
      patients until death or end of follow-up. Chi-square test, t test, Kaplan-Meier method and
      the Log Rank test and regression analysis will be used (p &lt;0.05).
