  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a new form of cancer treatment called immunotherapy which does not attack cancer
      directly but works on the immune system to make it more effective. This type of treatment may
      have side effects which are called autoimmune side effects and are caused by the immune
      system attacking the normal parts of the body. At the moment doctors cannot predict which
      patients may be at more risk of developing such autoimmune side effects and doctors also
      cannot predict which patients are more likely to benefit. This study will analyse blood
      samples from patients receiving immunotherapy to see if markers can be identified to help
      make such predictions.

    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is a new approach to treating cancers and the major side effects are classed as
      autoimmune because the immune system is targeting itself. Currently doctors are not able to
      identify patients at higher risk of developing such autoimmune toxicities and nor are doctors
      able to identify patients more likely to respond to such treatment. Markers in the immune
      system have already been identified which are associated with naturally occurring autoimmune
      diseases. In this study the investigators will examine immune cells from patients with
      advanced malignant melanoma receiving immunotherapy treatment with Pembrolizumab to see if
      similar immune system markers can be identified and if such markers may be related to the
      development of autoimmune side effects or response to treatment. This would enable better
      selection of patients for treatment with immunotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.

          2. Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Have a confirmed metastatic melanoma of cutaneous or mucosal origin, and if cutaneous
             to be confirmed BRaf wild-type.

          4. Be willing to provide blood samples in line with the study protocol.

          5. Have a performance status of 0 to 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          6. Demonstrate adequate organ function.

          7. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception.

          9. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy within 4 weeks of the first
             dose of treatment.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          3. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          4. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          5. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 6. Has had prior chemotherapy,
             targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events

        the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of
        the treating investigator.

        13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
        cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
