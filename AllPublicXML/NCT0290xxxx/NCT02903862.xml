  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to (1) track dementia caregiver health indicators over 12
      weeks, both with and without the Mindoula plus DANA intervention (case manager and mobile
      messaging and assessment applications) to determine if the intervention improves caregiver
      health and (2) obtain feedback from caregivers to inform on the design of future
      interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will track the mental status and cognition of caregivers with and without the
      Mindoula and DANA intervention and use subject feedback to aid in designing future
      interventions for caregivers.

      This is a remotely administered, virtual study targeting dementia caregivers who are mild to
      moderately depressed. Screening calls for online administration of four surveys to determine
      inclusion in the study arms. These surveys will be taken on the Health-eBrain website, both
      at baseline/screening and throughout participation. All other participation will be completed
      on the participant's mobile phone, and all psychological and cognitive tests will be
      self-administered.

      This study has a between-group design. Participants will be screened for eligibility and then
      randomized into each arm. The intervention arm will receive the Mindoula plus DANA
      intervention. The wait list control arm will take the psychological surveys at regular
      intervals then, after 12 weeks, be enrolled in the DANA-only observation group. The DANA-only
      group will take DANA and a usability questionnaire.

    <description>Participants will receive the intervention, Mindoula plus DANA, which involves working with a case manager via an app for 12 weeks. The case manager will help the participant cope with the stresses of caregiving as well as remind them to use the DANA cognitive assessment app. This arm will also take the study's psychological surveys.</description>

    <description>The Mindoula intervention is a combination of case management and a messenger application. Case managers monitor how the participant is doing and any needs and provide 24/7 support &amp; assistance, including care coordination, treatment adherence, and matching the participant with providers and community resources. Each participant will be given an intake questionnaire to establish goals and behavioral health history. Participants will use the app and work with the case manager for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>DANA is an FDA-cleared neurocognitive assessment software administered on a smartphone or tablet to measure changes in cognitive efficiency. DANA also includes Ecological Momentary Assessments to track mood, sleep, stress, and memory. Intervention participants will take DANA weekly. The Waitlist Control arm will take DANA weekly 12 weeks after enrollment.</description>
