  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug, palbociclib, has on
      prostate cancer and will look at the side effects of treatment with palbociclib. The
      researchers doing this study are also interested in looking for markers that may help predict
      which patients are most likely to be helped by palbociclib and to see how the cancer cells
      respond to palbociclib.

      The standard or usual treatment for this disease may be chemotherapy or other types of
      treatment to slow the spread of the disease and relieve some symptoms of cancer.

      Palbociclib is a new type of drug for prostate cancer. Laboratory tests show that it may help
      slow the growth of prostate cancer. Palbociclib has been shown to help patients with breast
      cancer but it is not known if the drug is useful for treating prostate cancer.
