  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves one dose of LY3039478 given by mouth followed by an intravenous infusion
      (IV) (via a tube linked to a small needle in the vein) of LY3039478. The results of this
      study will help to answer the following research questions:

        -  How much LY3039478 gets into the blood stream when given by mouth as a capsule compared
           to when given by an IV

        -  How long it takes the body to remove the study drug

        -  The safety of LY3039478 and any side effects that might be associated with it

      Participation in the study is expected to last up to 7 weeks. There will be screening, a
      single study period, and a follow-up.
