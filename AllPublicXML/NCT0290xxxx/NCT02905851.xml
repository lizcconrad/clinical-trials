      To see if teledermatology can be used to reduce antibiotic burden in patients on doxycycline
      or minocycline for acne vulgaris
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to ascertain if antibiotic burden can be reduced with tele
      dermatology use.

      There are two arms of the study:

        1. Feedback group

        2. Non feedback group

      All subjects will be randomised to either group, all subjects will take photos of their face
      and answer questions at baseline, visit 2 (1 month), visit 3 (2 months), visit 4 (3 months).

      The investigators will then use measurements of acne grading (patient grading, investigator
      global assessment, lesion counting, global acne grading) to reduce/taper antibiotics in the
      feedback group.

    <description>Feedback given to this group regarding their antibiotic use after baseline.
If the subject is in the feedback group, after this visit, a dermatologist will review all images and the survey results and give the patient information about whether they should:
Continue current dose
Reduce dose if there is at least a one point improvement in both the investigator acne global assessment AND the patient acne global assessment scores: A dose reduction will be such that the dose is halved from the previous dose. For example if the subject is on minocycline or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, they will be reduced to minocycline or doxycycline 100 mg daily.
Increase dose if had been previously reduced, dose will not be increased beyond the initial starting dose.</description>
