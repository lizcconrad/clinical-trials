  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to define the safety profile and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and preliminary efficacy of AbGn-107 administered every 28 days (4 weeks) in patients with
      chemo-refractory locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic gastric, colorectal or pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AbGn-107 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) which targets an antigen (AG7 antigen) present
      in gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer. This study is a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation
      design with cohort expansion. AbGn-107 will be administered every 28 days in patients with
      chemo-refractory locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic gastric, colorectal or pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. The primary objectives of this study are to define the safety profile and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years. A patient may be of either sex and of any race/ethnicity.

          2. Histologically confirmed, chemo-refractory, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic
             gastric (including GE junction), colorectal, or pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

               1. Patient must not have curative options available (e.g. a single metastatic focus
                  in the liver in a patient with MCRC eligible for metastasectomy).

               2. Chemo-refractory is defined as:

                    -  Progression on or following, or intolerant of, at least one prior line of
                       standard systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic gastric or pancreatic
                       cancers.

                    -  Progression on or following, or intolerant of, at least two prior lines of
                       standard systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancers.

                    -  Patients who have progressed/recurred following neoadjuvant/adjuvant
                       chemotherapy for earlier stage disease, if completed within the previous 6
                       months, are eligible.

          3. (For expansion cohort only): Tissue must be available to confirm positive expression
             of AG7 antigen, defined as proportional score ≥2, via slides or tumor block from
             either original diagnostic biopsy material or biopsy of relapsed disease

          4. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0-1.

          6. Adequate organ function within 3 weeks prior to first study drug administration as
             evidenced by:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L,

               2. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL,

               3. Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L,

               4. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or a calculated creatinine
                  clearance &gt;60 mL/min,

               5. Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN, except for patients with Gilbert's disease who are
                  eligible if total bilirubin ≤ 3mg/dL.

               6. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT)
                  and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)
                  &lt;2.5 x ULN, or, in the presence of documented liver metastases, ≤5 x ULN.

          7. Ability to adhere to dose and visit schedules.

          8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must have a negative pregnancy test result
             prior to enrollment. WOCP and men whose partners are WOCP must agree to use a highly
             effective method of birth control during the study and for 6 months following the last
             dose of study drug. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which
             results in a low failure rate (less than 1% per year).

          9. Ability to provide written informed consent

         10. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any persistent, unresolved Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
             Grade ≥2 drug-related toxicity (except alopecia, erectile impotence, tinnitus, hot
             flashes, and loss of libido) associated with previous treatment. Inclusion of patients
             with persistent neuropathy or hearing loss Grade ≥2 due to previous treatment requires
             discussion with the sponsor.

          2. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to first study drug administration.

          3. Major surgery within 3 weeks prior to first study drug administration.

             receipt of another investigational product within 21 days or 5 plasma half-lives,
             whichever is longer, prior to first day of drug administration (Day 1).

          6. Active central nervous system metastases. Patients with a history of brain metastases
             may be eligible, provided they have been definitively treated and are clinically
             stable, after discussion with sponsor. Treated or untreated leptomeningeal disease is
             not permitted.

          7. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or a known HIV-related malignancy.
             Note: HIV testing is not required unless there is any clinical suspicion that the
             patient might be HIV positive.

          8. Known active hepatitis B or C. HBV and HCV tests are required prior to Day 1.

          9. Any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the condition being
             studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair with their ability to
             receive or tolerate the planned treatment, or interfere with the study evaluations or
             optimal participation in the study.
