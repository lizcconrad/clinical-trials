    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to evaluate a treatment decision aid for patients with
      atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which the Anticoagulation Choice tool
      promotes shared decision making and its impact on anticoagulation use and adherence versus
      standard care in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

    <time_frame>After end of enrollment (1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>SDM quality will measure (a) knowledge transfer; (b) concordance; (c) quality of communication and satisfaction with shared decision making; and (d) satisfaction with the decision-making process. Knowledge Transfer-6 questions about afib and anticoagulation. Knowledge of Risk-1 question about risk of stroke. Collaborative Agreement-will assess decision concordance between patient and clinician. Patient decision satisfaction-16 items of Decisional Conflict Scale. Quality of communication- modified questions from the CAHPS Clinician and Group survey. Patient satisfaction with encounter- asking patients whether they would recommend the approach used to others for other discussions. Clinician satisfaction- questioning satisfaction with discussion about anticoagulation medication choice and whether they would recommend the approach used to other clinicians for other discussions.</description>
