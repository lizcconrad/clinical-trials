  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with metabolic alterations due
      mainly by the liberation of catabolic cytokines leading to changes in body composition as
      rheumatoid cachexia. Dynamic exercise (DE) has demonstrated to improve muscular, strength and
      joint function as well as inflammatory process. Also, a diet focused on the consumption of
      certain fatty acids like the Mediterranean is recommended to reduce inflammation. The aim of
      this study is to assess the effect of a dynamic exercise program in combination with a
      Mediterranean diet in strength, joint mobility and disease activity in women with RA.

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation,
      joint pain, destruction of the synovial membranes and metabolic alterations due mainly by the
      liberation of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta mainly and leading to
      changes in body composition as rheumatoid cachexia, which is characterized by involuntary
      loss of muscular mass with or without loss of body weight and with or without gain of fat
      mass and therefore reducing physical activity and affecting nutrition. Alternative therapies
      that could improve these metabolical changes are &quot;Dynamic exercise&quot; (DE) which has
      demonstrated to improve muscular function and muscular strength, as well as joint mobility
      and joint inflammatory markers without negative effects on RA. Also, &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot;
      (MD) which is recommended to reduce inflammation by the high intake of monounsaturated and
      polyunsaturated and low in saturated fats. Previous studies report the benefits of
      nutritional interventions but in the majority of the cases therapies are based on specific
      foods and not in the form of diet. Likewise, physical interventions are different regarding
      in time and type of movement. However both interventions have shown ambiguous findings in
      terms of body composition (mainly) and which prevents drawing conclusions and generate
      recommendations on the implementation of these therapies (in combination). As far as the
      investigators know, no studies evaluating the effect of a diet and exercise combined. Thus
      the aim of this study is to assess the effect of DE program in combination with a MD on body
      composition, strength, joint mobility and disease activity in women with RA.
