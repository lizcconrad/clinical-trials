  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut immune barrier is not fully restored in HIV-1-infected subjects despite they were
      receiving antiretroviral treatment. This leaky gut leads to microbial translocation from the
      gut lumen into the bloodstream that fuels deleterious systemic inflammation. The chemotaxis
      axes that allow T lymphocytes to migrate from the blood to the gut mucosa in order to
      reconstitute the mucosal immune barrier seems altered in treated HIV-1-infected subjects.This
      study aims at better understanding the mechanisms involved in this lack of mucosal immune
      restoration.
