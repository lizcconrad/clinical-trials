      The primary aims of this research project are to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of Camp NERF to improve child nutrition, physical activity, mental
           health, and anthropometric outcomes.

        2. Evaluate the efficacy of Camp NERF to improve caregiver self-efficacy for establishing
           healthy family nutrition and physical activity practices, amount of physical activity,
           and BMI.

        3. Evaluate the efficacy of Camp NERF to improve youth mentor nutrition, physical activity,
           and anthropometric outcomes.

      Background: The number of obese children in the US remains high, which is problematic due to
      the mental, physical, and academic effects of obesity on child health. Data indicate that
      school-age children, particularly underserved children, experience unhealthy gains in BMI at
      a rate nearly twice as fast during the summer months. Few efforts have been directed at
      implementing evidence-based programming to prevent excess weight gain during the summer
      recess.

      Methods: Camp NERF is an 8-week, multi-component (nutrition, physical activity, and mental
      health), theory-based program for underserved school-age children in grades Kindergarten -
      5th grade coupled with the USDA Summer Food Service Program. Twelve eligible elementary
      school sites will be randomized to one of the three programming groups: 1) Active Control
      (non-nutrition, physical activity, or mental health [4H curricula]); 2) Standard Care
      (nutrition and physical activity); or 3) Enhanced Care (nutrition, physical activity, and
      mental health) programming. Anthropometric, behavioral, and psychosocial data will be
      collected from child-caregiver dyads pre- and post-intervention. Site-specific
      characteristics and process evaluation measures will also be collected.

      Discussion: This is the first, evidence-based intervention to address the issue of weight
      gain during the summer months among underserved, school-aged children. Results from this
      study will provide researchers, practitioners, and public health professionals with insight
      on evidence-based programming to aid in childhood obesity prevention during this particular
      window of risk.
