    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center case control comparison of expression of target genes
      responsible for energy utilization, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress and levels of
      histone acetylation/ DNA methylation in obese and non-obese adult cardiac surgery patients.

    <description>To calculate the MOD score, the Respiratory Function (calculated as partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) divided by fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)), Cardiovascular (Pressure adjusted heart rate (PAR) ), Renal (Serum Creatinine), Hepatic (serum bilirubin), Hematologic (platelet count) and neurologic (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)) organ function need to be recorded at the following time points in the Case Report Form (CRF):
Pre-OP
ICU
12 hours post-op
24 hours post-op
48 hours post-op
72 hours post-op

    <time_frame>baseline, and up to 96 hours post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Acute Lung Injury (ALI) non-ARDS, ARDS. To define these different categories of acute lung injury, the Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be recorded in the CRF at time points: Pre-OP, ICU, 12 hrs post-op,24hrs post-op,48hrs post-op,72hrs post-op and 96hrs post-op. Along with the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, it will then be possible to categorise patients into the above definitions of acute lung injury as follows: ALI non-ARDS (200 mmHg &lt;PaO2/FiO2&lt;300 mmHg, regardless of PEEP),ARDS (PaO2/FiO2&lt;200 mmHg, regardless of PEEP), mild Berlin Definition(200mmHg &lt;PaO2/FiO2&lt;300mmHg with PEEP &gt; 5cm H2O),moderate Berlin Definition(100mmHg &lt;calculated as partial pressure of oxygen divided by fraction of inspired oxygen PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200mmHg with PEEP &gt; 5cm H2O) and Severe Berlin Definition (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 100mmHg with PEEP &gt; 5cm H2O)</description>

    <measure>Vasoactive inotrope score</measure>

      Atrial Biopsy: A 0.5cm x 0.5cm section of the right atrial wall is routinely excised to allow
      cannulation of the left atrium for connection to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. This
      segment is routinely discarded. We propose to collect this specimen immediately after it has
      been discarded.

        the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. This unit performs over 1,200 major
        cardiac procedures per year, of which 600 are patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
