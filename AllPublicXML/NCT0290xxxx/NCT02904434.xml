  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Voriconazole has better response rates, improved survival and less adverse side effects
      compared to other drugs for the treatment of invasive fungal infections making it a desirable
      therapeutic option for children. However, dosing is unpredictable in children and this leads
      to therapeutic failure. This study aims to understand the physiological differences between
      children and adults that leads to therapeutic failure of voriconazole in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Voriconazole clearance in children (2-12 years old) is 3-fold higher and bioavailability is
      one half of adult values. An important gap in knowledge exists that explain the mechanisms
      that result in higher clearance and lower bioavailability of voriconazole and places children
      at a substantial risk for sub-therapeutic concentrations and treatment failures. Preliminary
      data suggests that intestinal first-pass metabolism is responsible for the lower
      bioavailability in children, but not in adults. By inhibiting intestinal metabolism with
      grapefruit juice, the extent of the effect of intestinal first-pass metabolism on
      voriconazole pharmacokinetics can be determined. Inpatient children at the Children's
      Hospital of Philadelphia who are receiving oral voriconazole as standard of care will be
      enrolled in an open label, cross-over clinical trial to monitor plasma voriconazole levels
      after voriconazole administration with and without grapefruit juice to inhibit intestinal
      metabolism of voriconazole. The proposed research will elucidate the role of intestinal
      metabolism in the reduced oral bioavailability of voriconazole in children, which can be
      incorporated into a model simulation to guide accurate dosing.

On day 2 of the study, subjects will receive approximately 240mL of reconstituted grapefruit juice by mouth or via nasogastric tube 30 minutes prior to receiving a scheduled dose of voriconazole. Blood samples will be collected during the 12 hours following voriconazole dosing on both days of the study.</description>
