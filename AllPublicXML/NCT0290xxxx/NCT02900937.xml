  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of a new version of a
      coronary artery stent for treating blockages in the arteries supplying blood to the heart
      muscle. The Amaranth Medical MAGNITUDE scaffold releases a drug (sirolimus) to reduce the
      likelihood of the treated blood vessel developing a new blockage. In addition, the scaffold
      dissolves away over time, leaving no permanent implant after the blood vessel has healed.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the AmM MAGNITUDE
      Bioresorbable Drug-Eluting Coronary Scaffold for use in the treatment of up to two different
      de novo native coronary artery lesions in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary
      intervention. The scaffold is a single-use device comprised of a balloon-expandable,
      intracoronary drug coated scaffold pre-mounted on a rapid-exchange delivery catheter. The
      scaffold is made of Poly-L-Lactide (PLLA) and is coated with a polymer-antiproliferative drug
      (sirolimus) matrix. The scaffold provides mechanical support similar to a metallic stent to
      the vessel while it is healing, and then gradually breaks down over time leaving no permanent
      implant in the treated vessel. Compared to prior versions of the scaffold, the new device has
      a thinner strut design (a wall thickness of 100 µm rather than 120 µm or 150 µm), but is
      otherwise identical.

      The study design is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, non-inferiority trial. It
      will enroll a maximum of 70 patients from up to 20 investigational centers in Colombia and
      the European Union. Eligible patients who are at least 18 years of age diagnosed with
      symptomatic ischemic disease due to up to two different, de novo, stenotic lesions in native
      coronary arteries will be asked to participate in this study. After treatment with the
      investigational device, subjects will be followed for five years. Safety of the device will
      be evaluated using the incidence of target vessel failure during the follow-up period.
      Performance (efficacy) will be assessed using the in-scaffold late lumen loss measured by
      quantitative coronary angiography at nine months.

             for a period of two years following the index procedure. Questionnaire-based studies,
             or other studies that are non-invasive and do not require investigational devices or
             medications are allowed.

          3. Subject (or their legally authorized representative) provides written informed consent
             prior to any study-related procedure, using the form approved by the local Ethics
             Committee.

          4. Subject has:

               1. evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable angina [Canadian Cardiovascular
                  Society 1, 2, 3, or 4] or unstable angina [Braunwald Class 1-3, B-C], or silent
                  ischemia with supporting imaging studies [ETT, SPECT, stress echocardiography, or
                  Cardiac CT]), or

               2. low or intermediate risk NSTEMI, or

               3. evidence of myocardial ischemia in a coronary territory previously affected by
                  STEMI as long as the lesion fulfills the angiographic inclusion criteria and the
                  intervention performed ≥ 3 months following the STEMI.

          5. Subject is an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

          6. Patient agrees to complete all protocol required follow-up visits, including
             angiograms.

        Angiographic

          1. Patient indicated for elective stenting of up to two de novo native coronary artery
             lesions.

          2. If two lesions are to be treated, they must either be located in two separate
             epicardial vessels (side branches are considered separate vessels) or if located
             within a single epicardial vessel be separated by ≥ 15 mm of angiographically normal
             vessel.

          3. If an elective percutaneous intervention for two different lesions is planned, one of

                  lesions can be treated during the same procedure. In case a staging strategy is
                  chosen, no minimum period between the staged interventions is required. In either
                  strategy, the distal lesion must be intended to be treated first and before the
                  proximal lesion.

               2. If one lesion is intended to be treated with a litmus-based metallic DES and the
                  second lesion is a study lesion (e.g., suitable for stenting with the MAGNITUDE™
                  scaffold), the two lesions must be located in two different epicardial vessels
                  (side branches are considered separate vessels). Both lesions can be treated
                  during the same procedure. In case a staging strategy is chosen, no minimum
                  period between the staged interventions is required. However, all of the
                  following conditions must apply:

                       complications prior to treatment of the study lesion.

                       chronic total occlusion, or high thrombotic burden.

          4. Each study lesion (e.g., suitable for stenting with the MAGNITUDE™ scaffold) must
             measure ≤ 14 mm in length by on-line QCA.

             located in a native coronary artery with a diameter (average of distal and proximal to
             lesion by IVUS) of 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm.

          6. Each study lesion (e.g., suitable for stenting with the MAGNITUDE™ scaffold) must be
             in a major artery/branch with a visually estimated diameter stenosis of ≥ 50% and &lt;
             100% with a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥ 1.
