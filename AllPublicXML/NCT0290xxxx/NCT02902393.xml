  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Revascularisation using recombinant tPA is the reference treatment of stroke. However, the
      efficacy of fibrinolysis is about 50%. Several factors, including the size of thrombus, have
      been associated with revascularisation efficacy.

      The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate ex vivo the effect of tPA in patients with
      stroke with thromboelastography and to correlate results with the clinical outcome of
      patients. Results may predict revascularisation in patients with stroke.

        All patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the study .
        Patients will be recruited to emergencies CHU Caen and Saint Joseph Hospital. The goal is
        to recruit patients with neurological defect consistent with a neurovascular pathology
        eligible for thrombolysis with tPA.

        With the admission of patients, blood samples are routinely made . For this study, the
        investigators will add one citrated 5 mL tube. An information letter and consent form will
        be given to the patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient (&gt; 18 years) with a neurological deficit compatible with a neurovascular
             pathology eligible for fibrinolysis rtPA and having a proximal occlusion of the middle
             cerebral artery (segment M1 / M2) or basilar trunk objectified brain imaging (MRI
             angiography or angio CT).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with major comorbidity, a pathology of hemostasis or anticoagulant
             treatment (vitamin K antagonist (VKA), direct oral anticoagulant).
