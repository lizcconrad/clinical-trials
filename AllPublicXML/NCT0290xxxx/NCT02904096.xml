    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of Radiesse implantation for
      very severe volume loss in the dorsum of the hand at 6 months after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-year post approval safety (PAS) study evaluating the Adverse Event (AE) rate of
      Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS) baseline grade 4 hands (Group A) compared to the AE rate of
      MHGS baseline grade 2-3 hands (Group B).

      Subjects will be recruited at each site with the intention to have an equal number of
      subjects in Group A and Group B. All subjects will receive an initial Radiesse hand treatment
      in both hands, and up to 3 retreatments in the study. Hands will be assessed by evaluators on
      the MHGS who will be blinded to group, treatment details, time since last treatment, and
      number of retreatments.

    <description>&quot;Grade 4 Hands&quot; group will be subjects with hand grading of grade 4 (very severe loss of fatty tissue, marked visibility of veins and tendons in the dorsal hand). &quot;Grade 4 Hands&quot; group subjects will receive Radiesse injectable implant and 2% lidocaine HCL up to 3 cc (2 syringes) per hand per treatment.
