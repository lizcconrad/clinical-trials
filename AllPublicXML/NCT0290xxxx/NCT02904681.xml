      Spinal growth dystrophy (CRD), also called Scheuermann's disease, corresponding to impaired
      vertebral structure occurring in children and adolescents with involvement of the growth
      cartilage causing impaired growth and kyphosis.

      There are forms thoracolumbar and thoracic conventional forms of DRC with variable clinical
      expressions; the most important being kyphosis with spinal stiffness associated with painful
      elements.

      The radiographic definition according Sorenson is uniformisation 5 Â° affecting at least three
      adjacent vertebrae.

      Scheuermann's disease and three problems. First, the thoracic kyphosis generates back pain
      which may be thoracic or lumbar indirectly attributed to compensatory lordosis. Moreover
      disruption sagittal balance frequently causes a significant aesthetic discomfort. Finally,
      scalability because the curvature may increase the likelihood of degenerative lesions disc
      degeneration or lumbar spinal stenosis for example.

      When the disease is diagnosed early, treatment is most often associated with orthopedic
      physiotherapy. However, for patients with active deformation, despite an orthopedic brace
      treatment with chronic pain, neurological deficit or for aesthetic reasons, surgical decision
      can be taken.

      The goal of surgical treatment of DRC is a correction of the thoracic kyphosis. It goes
      through a spinal fusion must be released from his column stiffness in a bad position,
      changing the equilibrium profile and ensure that it remains in a good position.

      This surgery usually requires a prior operative time (thoracic surgery to remove the
      intervertebral discs) and a posterior surgical time (blockage of the vertebrae together with
      a bone graft and osteosynthesis). Currently different surgical strategies are practiced there
      is no real consensus between the teams.

      objectives:

        1. Evaluation of the rate and type of complications in different age categories and
           surgical strategies.

        2. Evaluation of clinical results based on surgical strategies.

        3. Evaluation of sagittal balance and correction obtained based surgical strategies

      Methodology and duration of the research

      This is a multicenter retrospective cohort on the assessment of surgical practices cited
      objectives. Also, this research is in Chapter X of the Data Protection Act and allows the
      collection of personal data for the purpose of evaluation of care and prevention practices
      with authorization request to the CNIL; the opinion of CCTIRS therefore not required in this
      case.

      This study concerns the data of patients operated with the techniques mentioned in addition
      with a decline of more than 20 years.

      Patients are aware of the potential use of their data in their files for medical research
      through oral information provided by the doctor at the signing by the patient's consent
      related to the surgery and most recently contained in the Home booklet setting for patients.

      Nature of the data collected

      The data is anonymous and not identifiable (for each subject a number of inclusion is given).
      The name of the surgeon is also anonymized.

      The data collected concern the characteristics of the patient, as well as its history, the
      operating data including technical, suites and possible post-operative complications and
      patient monitoring.

      Data collection will be done on the basis KEOPS https://www.keops-spine.fr
