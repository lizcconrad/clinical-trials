      To address the challenges of isolating and analyzing rare cells, this study aims to validate
      technical diagnostic instrumentation, tests, protocols and analysis to correlate the number
      of circulating tumor cells present in whole blood for predicting cancer prognosis and
      treatment efficacy. Investigators propose to enroll and follow cohorts of cancer patients.
      Blood samples will be collected from these patients at regular intervals as determined by
      their doctors. The patient's disease progression will be monitored over the lifetime of this
      study. The specific aims are to isolate, enumerate and analyze the number of circulating
      tumor cells (CTCs) in patient blood using chip-based sorting, filtration and imaging
      techniques. Investigators will also use this study to optimize diagnostic instrumentation,
      test protocols and downstream CTC analysis. Investigators may also correlate the results of
      these tests with the prognosis of the patients as well as any clinical evidence (e.g. from
      radiological imaging scans). While investigators focus on prognosis in this study, these
      correlated tests potentially may also be valuable in future studies for early diagnosis and
      monitoring of cancer.
