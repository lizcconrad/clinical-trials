  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not known whether different lentil varieties have the same efficacy in lowering blood
      glucose. Similarly, the carbohydrate component of lentils responsible for lowering blood
      glucose is not known, nor is the bioavailability of lentil metabolites and polyphenol
      bioactive.

      The overall aim of this work is to produce credible evidence for substantiating a food health
      claim for post prandial blood glucose lowering by lentil. Although several studies have shown
      that lentil consumption results in a lowering of post prandial blood glucose, it is not known
      whether different lentil varieties have the same efficacy. Similarly, the carbohydrate
      component of lentils responsible for lowering blood glucose is not known, nor is the
      bioavailability of lentil metabolites and polyphenol bioactive. The investigators hypothesize
      that the slowly digestible starch content of lentil is inversely related to in vivo glycemic
      response. The specific aims of this study are: (i) to identify the putative component(s) in
      lentil that might account for its blood glucose lowering effect, and (ii) to identify
      differences in blood glucose reduction among lentil varieties. These aims will be achieved in
      a three-step process. Firstly, in vitro studies will be pursued to determine the carbohydrate
      fractions of 20 new and emerging Canadian lentil varieties. Secondly, these results will be
      used to choose 8 lentil varieties with different slowly digestible starch content for a human
      Glycemic Index study. Thirdly, identification of lentil metabolites will be achieved by
      collecting extra capillary blood (200uL)and urine samples at fasting and 120min for
      measurement of polyphenols and metabolites using established HPLC and metabolomics
      techniques.
