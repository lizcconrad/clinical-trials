      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human
      endostatin（continuously-pumped）combined with chemoradiotherapy in patients with advanced
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The patients will be randomized to concurrent
      radiotherapy (CRT) arm and CRT + Endostar arm. All patients will receive one cycles of
      induction chemotherapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with weekly cisplatin
      and 3 cycles of chemotherapy after IMRT. Treatment cycles will be repeated every 21 days for
      a maximum of 4 cycles. In CRT + Endostar arm, Endostar will be continuously intravenous
      pumped (7.5 mg/m2) for 14 days (d1-d14) during chemotherapy and for 5 days/week (d-5-d-1,
      d3-d7, d10-d14, d17-d21) during IMRT.

      The patients will be randomized to CRT arm and CRT + Endostar arm. All patients will receive
      one cycles of induction chemotherapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with
      weekly cisplatin and 3 cycles of chemotherapy after IMRT. Treatment cycles will be repeated
      every 21 days for a maximum of 4 cycles. In CRT + Endostar arm, Endostar will be continuously
      intravenous pumped (7.5 mg/m2) for 14 days (d1-d14) during chemotherapy and for 5 days/week
      (d-5-d-1, d3-d7, d10-d14, d17-d21) during IMRT.

      Prior to enrollment in this study and while the patient is receiving the therapy, routine
      tests, ECG, head and neck CT scan and MRI will be performed to check the body's response to
      the treatment. Further more, before and after the treatment, the circulating endothelial
      cells (CECs), endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      Cancer embryo antigen (CEA), Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in blood and Microvessel density
      (MVD), hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), P53, VEGF, Survivin in pathological specimens
      will be tested.

      Patients with progressive disease or intolerable side effects will be removed from the study.
      Patients with stable disease or tumor response will continue therapy for a maximum of 4
      cycles.

      Primary outcome: The response rate (RR), the clinical benefit rate (CBR), time of tumor
      progression (TTP).

      Secondary outcomes: The quality of life (QOL)，Safety and Tolerability.
