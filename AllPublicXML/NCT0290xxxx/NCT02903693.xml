    <textblock>
      Given that cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women in french guiana
      the aim of the study was to determine the screening rate among women living in French Guiana.
      Cervical smears are read in 2 laboratories which allowed us to compute screening rates per
      100 women-years. overall the screening activity was 23.5-25.8 smears per 100 women-years.
      between 2006 and 2011 54% of women were screened. These baseline figures will allow to
      evaluate present efforts to increase the screening rate for this frequent cancer in French
      Guiana.
