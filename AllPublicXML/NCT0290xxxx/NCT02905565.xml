    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on to
      standard of care study of NBP softgel capsules for the treatment of mild to moderate AIS in
      adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on to standard-of-care study with
      a primary objective to assess the safety of NBP treatment in patients with mild to moderate
      acute ischemic stroke. The secondary objectives include determination of PK profile and
      exploratory evaluation for the efficacy of NBP treatment in stroke patients.

      All randomized subjects will also receive standard supportive medical care for treatment of
      AIS throughout the study. The overall duration of the study will be approximately 90 days,
      including 30 days of treatment and an additional 60 days for follow up assessments. Subjects
      will be hospitalized long enough to receive the first four doses of study drug. After
      discharge from the hospital, subjects will continue to take study treatment daily through Day
      30 and have scheduled assessments completed.

      To maintain the blind, all subjects will take 4 softgel capsules BID, which will contain
      either 100 mg NBP or matching placebo. The first dose must be taken within 12 hours of the
      onset of the AIS defined as the last known normal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Males or females aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years

          2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine HCG pregnancy test
             at Screening and be practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception with an
             annual failure rate of less than 1% until the completion of the trial or 60 days after
             discontinuation of study treatment. Women are considered not childbearing if they are
             &gt; 1 year postmenopausal or surgically sterile (ie, hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy tubal ligation). If serum bHCG is the
             standard of care, then this value can be used to determine eligibility.

          3. A clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate cortical or subcortical AIS

          4. Able to swallow the softgel capsules as defined by the investigator

          5. Completes screening procedures such that study treatment is first administered within
             12 hours of stroke onset. The stroke onset time will be defined as the last known
             normal

          6. In subjects receiving tPA, the first dose of NBP must be administered no sooner than 4
             hours after the end of the tPA infusion

          7. A standard NIHSS score of 4 to 17, inclusive. If patients receive tPA and/or EVT, the
             NIHSS score must be obtained after the procedure is completed. All subjects must meet
             a NIHSS consciousness score of 0-1 in order to meet eligibility

          8. Functionally independent, as defined by a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1
             before their present illness as determined by the subject or provided by a
             representative if the subject is unable to participate at the time of study entry
             (determined by retrospective assessment by the Investigator)

          9. Capable of understanding the purpose and risk of the study and has signed, in writing,
             the ICF. If the subject is not capable of this at the time of enrollment, a legally
             authorized representative (LAR) will provide written informed consent in accordance
             with all regulations

         10. Ability to comply with study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant, lactating/breast-feeding, or plan to become pregnant
             within the next 3 months

          2. Suspected diagnosis of stroke isolated to brainstem or brain areas other than cortical
             or subcortical AIS that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may have caused the
             present symptoms

          3. Rapidly improving or resolving symptoms, suggesting a possible transient ischemic
             attack (TIA) rather than a qualifying stroke

          4. Signs of acute hemorrhage or other cause of acute stroke symptoms (other than early
             ischemic findings) on cranial imaging at Screening

          5. History of intracranial hemorrhage

          6. Seizure at onset of stroke

          7. A previous clinical diagnosis of stroke will exclude the subject (however, the
             individual with a previously undiagnosed stroke evidenced on screening CT or MRI may
             be enrolled provided it does not affect neurological and functional assessments based
             in the opinion of the Investigator)

          8. Uncontrolled severe hypertension defined as a systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 220 mm Hg or
             diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg

          9. Treatment with intensive antihypertensive therapy, such as intravenous (IV) sodium
             nitroprusside (Nipride®) and/or more than 30 mg of IV labetalol, between the onset of
             the AIS and the randomization to study treatment

         10. SBP &lt; 100 mm Hg, temperature &gt; 38.0º C, or heart rate &lt; 40 beats/minute or &gt; 120

         11. A glucose level of &lt; 50 mg/dL at Screening

         12. An international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 1.5 if not being treated with anticoagulant
             therapy, or an INR ≥ 3.5 if being treated with an acceptable anticoagulant therapy

         13. A serum ALT or AST level &gt; 1.5 × ULN, or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN (except in setting of
             known Gilbert's disease) at Screening

         14. Clinically significant renal dysfunction (including serum creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL
             or 177 µmol/L) at Screening

         15. A hemoglobin level &lt; 10 g/dL at Screening

         16. Current or within the last 6 months prior to Screening, New York Heart Association

         20. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to celery or soybeans

         21. Received treatment with any other investigational drug within 30 days before Day 1,
             was previously treated with NBP, or is currently participating in another clinical
             study

         22. Known or suspected history of alcohol or drug dependence within the past 6 months, or
             is known to have abused alcohol (eg, been intoxicated) within the last 24 hours

         23. Known history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, or TB

         24. Any other reasons in the opinion of the investigator make the subject unsuitable for
