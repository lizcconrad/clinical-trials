    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single arm, traditional feasibility study to allow a preliminary
      assessment of the safety and effectiveness of BTM treatment. Patients with 10-70% TBSA burns
      will have BTM devices implanted in areas with deep partial or full thickness burns to treat
      at least 5% TBSA.

    <description>The Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix (BTM) (also known as BTM Dressing) comprises a completely synthetic, sterile, integrating dermal component (porous biodegradable polyurethane foam) and a temporary epidermal barrier component (a non-biodegradable polyurethane sealing membrane). These layers are adhered with a biodegradable polyurethane bonding layer. BTM will be implanted and fixed into position to close a debrided burn wound. After a period of integration, the sealing membrane is removed and a split skin graft is applied.</description>

             advanced malignancy.

          -  Presence of a medical condition that might interfere with treatment evaluation; or
             require a change in therapy including but not limited to, significant immune
             deficiency, or skin or vascular diseases in the area of the wound.

          -  Female with known or suspected pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or lactation.
