  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the topical application to cheek tissue of the
      combination of benzocaine and tetracaine has a longer duration of local anesthetic activity
      than benzocaine alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a blinded study, either benzocaine alone of the combination of benzocaine and tetracaine
      will be sprayed onto the cheek mucosal tissue. Onset and duration of local anesthesia will be
      evaluated over a one hour period using pin prick and QST heat stimulation. Subjects will
      receive both treatments in a cross-over design with each session separated by 5-7 days. A
      total of 76 subjects (normal volunteers) will be evaluated.
