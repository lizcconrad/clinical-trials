    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to asses the oncological safety of oncoplastic breast surgery, its
      impact on patient satisfaction and is it worthy for general breast surgeon to learn different
      oncoplastic techniques.

      This non randomized prospective trial was conducted on 70 female patients presented to our
      tertiary referral breast unit -Ain Shams University hospitals with non metastatic breast
      cancer during the period from September 2012 to September 2013. All of them signed an
      informed consent to share in this study that was approved in the ethical committee held on
      April 2012 - Ain Shams University. Our patients were divided into 2 equal groups: group A
      (35patients) who underwent standard quadrantectomy, group B (35 patients) who underwent
      oncoplastic surgery. In group A all quadrantectomies were done by general breast surgeons
      while in group B the oncoplastic procedures were done by well trained oncoplastic breast
      surgeons not assisted by plastic surgeons. The following data were reported in all cases
      including: age, family history, tumor size, volume and weight of the specimen, location of
      tumor, margin length, (primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis) staging, molecular subtype
      and patient satisfaction.
