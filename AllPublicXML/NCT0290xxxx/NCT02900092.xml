      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and nearly 70% of individuals with MDD do
      not respond to standard antidepressant therapies despite adequate dosing. An effective and
      well-tolerated antidepressant augmentation therapy would have important clinical and public
      health implications. Neuroactive steroid hormones are known to directly activate
      neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, and thus are potential candidates for augmentation
      therapies to enhance the effect of traditional antidepressants. The investigators hypothesize
      that administration of an allopregnanolone analog in women with treatment-resistant
      depression will improve depressive symptoms.

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and can have profoundly negative
      consequences on one's health, well-being and productivity. Women are twice as likely as men
      to experience depression during their lifetimes. In fact, it is reported that twelve million
      women in the U.S. each year will experience depression, and that one in eight women will
      experience a clinical depressive episode during their lifetimes. Additionally, nearly 70% of
      individuals with MDD do not respond to standard antidepressant therapies despite adequate
      dosing. Therefore, the identification of an effective and well tolerated antidepressant
      augmentation therapy would have important clinical and public health implications.
      Neuroactive steroid hormones are known to directly activate neurotransmitter receptors in the
      brain, and thus are potential candidates for augmentation therapies to enhance the effect of
      traditional antidepressants. Specifically, allopregnanolone, a steroid hormone derived from
      progesterone, is a potent positive modulator of GABA action at GABA-A receptors, which are
      known to have positive effects on mood symptoms. Data suggest that depression, chronic stress
      and posttraumatic stress disorder may be associated with low central nervous system
      allopregnanolone levels. The investigators propose to administer an oral allopregnanolone
      analog to 10 postmenopausal women with treatment-resistant depression as an add-on therapy to
      their current treatment for a period of 8 weeks followed by a 2-week taper. The investigators
      hypothesize that administration of the oral allopregnanolone analog in women with
      treatment-resistant depression will improve depressive symptoms.
