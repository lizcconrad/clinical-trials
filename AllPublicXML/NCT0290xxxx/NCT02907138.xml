      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Medical Yoga as a group treatment, to
      conventional treatment provided by a physical therapist, for people with perceived
      stress-related symptoms.

      Forty people are to be randomized to either:

        1. Intervention Group - Medical Yoga, group treatment for eight weeks, 60 minutes per week,
           with the guidance of a physical therapist.

           or

        2. Control - treatment as usual (TAU) in physical therapy.
