  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco, alcohol and opioid use disorders threaten the health of HIV-infected patients. What
      if evidence-based counseling and medication treatments for tobacco, alcohol and opioid use
      disorders (herein refered to as addiction treatments) were routinely provided in HIV clinics?
      Implementation Facilitation is an established strategy to increase the uptake of
      evidence-based treatments. Our goal is to evaluate the impact of Implementation Facilitation
      on the use of addiction treatments in four large HIV clinics.

      The purpose of the WHAT-IF study is:

      Aim 1. Among key stakeholders, to use quantitative and qualitative (mixed) methods to
      identify the site-specific evidence, context and facilitation-related barriers and
      facilitators to the integration of addiction treatments to help tailor an Implementation
      Facilitation for each clinic.

      Aim 2. To evaluate the impact of Implementation Facilitation on:

      2a: Organizational readiness to deliver addiction treatments 2b: Provider readiness to
      deliver addiction treatments 2c: Provision of addiction treatments 2d: Changes in
      organizational models of care used to deliver addiction treatments

      Aim 3. To evaluate the impact of Implementation Facilitation on antiretroviral therapy
      receipt, HIV viral suppression, VACS Index, and retention in HIV care among patients eligible
      for addiction treatment.

      The Working with HIV clinics to adopt Addiction Treatments using Implementation Facilitation
      (WHAT IF?) study will evaluate the impact of Implementation Facilitation on the adoption of
      addiction treatment services in four HIV clinics. We will use a stepped wedge design . The
      primary comparison is of the change that occurs from the pre-implementation period to two
      post-implementation periods, the initial six months (evaluation) and the following six months
      (maintenance). This proposal will consist of three main components in each of four clinics:
      1) formative evaluation with key stakeholders at each site to guide and refine the
      Implementation Facilitation, 2) conduct of the Implementation Facilitation and 3) an
      evaluation of the impact of the Implementation Facilitation on organization and
      provider-level readiness, provision of addiction treatments, and HIV outcomes.

    <description>The Veterans Aging Cohort Study Index (VACS Index) creates a score by summing pre-assigned points for age, routinely monitored indicators of HIV disease (CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA), and general indicators of organ system injury including hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate and alanine transaminase (AST and ALT), creatinine, and viral hepatitis C infection (HCV). This score is weighted to indicate increasing risk of all-cause mortality with increasing score. The score can be used to estimate risk of all-cause mortality using a conversion factor. The VACS Index will be evaluated based on most recent values at the time of data extraction. VACS Index score will be treated as a continuous variable.</description>

    <measure>Retention in HIV care</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retention in HIV care, per DHHS guidelines uses a 24-month measurement period. It is defined as at least one HIV medical care visit in each 6-month period, with a minimum of 60 days between the first medical visit in the prior 6-month period and the last medical visit in the subsequent 6-month period. This measure has good agreement with the Institute of Medicine indicator for retention in care and is an independent predictor of mortality. We will evaluate whether patients have had at least 1 visit in the 6-month period prior to time of data extraction.</description>

    <description>Investigators will use the ORCA to measure factors impacting the provision of addiction treatments. This 15-minute survey is based on the PARiHS framework and asks the respondent to rate local factors related to evidence, context and facilitation on a 5-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Facilitation questions will be omitted from the pre-implementation assessment since this part of the intervention and will not have taken place.</description>

    <description>Investigators will use change rulers, among appropriate providers, for each of the medications and counseling to assess readiness to provide each medication and counseling intervention.185 The change rulers will independently assess, on a 0-10 scale each provider's: 1) confidence to prescribe/provide the intervention, 2) readiness to prescribe/provide the intervention and 3) commitment to prescribe/provide the intervention. Stage of change assessments have been validated and have been used in the field of addiction and mental health to assess readiness to adopt evidence-based treatments.</description>
