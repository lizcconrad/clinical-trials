  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, and single-centre trial
      investigating the effect of liraglutide on body weight and pain in overweight or obese
      patients with knee osteoarthritis.

      Patients will be subjected to a run-in diet intervention phase (week -8 to 0) including a
      low-calorie diet and dietetic counselling. At week 0 patients will be randomised to receive
      either liraglutide 3 mg or liraglutide 3 mg placebo as an add-on to dietetic guidance on
      re-introducing regular foods and a focus on continued motivation to engage in a healthy
      lifestyle.
