  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre research study in patients seen within an NHS Improving Access to
      Psychological Interventions (IAPT) service with suspected generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).
      The study will involve 120 patients from the Leicestershire and Rutland area in England,
      United Kingdom.

      Participants will use the Alpha-Stim AID Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulations (CES) medical
      device, which is approved for use and proven to be safe and work for the treatment for
      anxiety, depression and insomnia.

      Participants will use the Alpha-Stim AID for 60 minutes every day for 6 or 12 weeks, either
      whilst on the waiting list for standard care treatment from IAPT, or in conjunction with
      standard care treatment from IAPT.

      The study will involve 6 study visits - one face-to-face at visit 1, followed by 5 visits via
      telephone at week 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24. At each visit, participants will be asked to complete
      questionnaires to assess anxiety, depression, sleep difficulty, quality of life and work and
      social functioning.

      The purpose of the study is to gather evidence for the clinical benefits and cost
      effectiveness of the Alpha-Stim AID when used in an NHS setting - how well does it work, and
      does it's use result in cost savings for the NHS.

      The study may show that the Alpha-Stim AID should be available on the NHS for patients with
      suspected GAD.

      Participants will have a baseline visit (day 1, visit 1) following identification as
      potentially eligible. The baseline visit will be face-to-face with a member of the research
      team, held at routine facilities used by the IAPT service. At the baseline visit, the
      participant will be consented for participation, have a urine pregnancy test first (if a
      female of child bearing potential) and the research team will administer the GAD-7 secondly,
      followed by EQ-5D-5L, WASA, PHQ-9, Athens, and CSRI surveys. Participants will then be
      instructed on how to use the Alpha-Stim AID device, and will have their first 60 minute,
      self-directed treatment session at home.

      All further visits will be facilitated via telephone, scheduled between the research team and
      participant, within a 5 calendar day window of each time point.

      At visit 2 (week 4), visit 3 (week 6), visit 4 (week 8), visit 5 (week 12) and visit 6 (week
      24), the research team will administer the GAD-7, EQ-5D-5L, WASA, PHQ-9 and Athens. The CSRI
      will be repeated only at visit 5 and 6. Compliance with the 60 minute daily treatment session
      will also be assessed during the 6 or 12 week treatment window, in addition to any adverse
      events.

      The 60-minute self-directed Alpha-Stim AID treatment sessions are undertaken at participant's
      home, on a daily basis for 6 weeks for all participants. During this 6-week period,
      participants will be on the waiting list for high intensity psychological therapy
      interventions.

      Following 6 weeks of Alpha-Stim AID CES treatment, participants have the option to receive a
      further 6 weeks of treatment, which is likely to coincide with start of high intensity
      psychological therapy interventions as clinically indicated.

      Following a maximum of 12 weeks' treatment with Alpha-Stim AID CES, all participants will
      cease to receive treatment on study.

      All participants will continue to receive standard care assessment, as undertaken by the NHS
      IAPT service, standard care high intensity psychological therapy interventions as clinically
      indicated and provided by the NHS IAPT service, and standard care pharmacological treatments
      as prescribed by the participant's GP. Participation in this study will not influence nor
      compromise standard care treatment - all study procedures are additional to standard care.
      Participation in the study will have no impact upon the duration of the waiting time for high
      intensity psychological therapy interventions.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of treatment with Alpha-Stim AID Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulations (CES) for participants with a primary working diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), as defined by the NHS IAPT service in terms of reliable improvement, clinically significant improvement, and recovery, from baseline to week 24, following previous treatment with low intensity psychological therapy intervention.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of treatment with Alpha-Stim AID Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulations (CES) for participants with a primary working diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), in terms of health and social care service cost, and patient cost, from baseline to week 24, following previous treatment with low intensity psychological therapy intervention. The health and social care service cost and patient cost will be aggregated to determine the QALY (quality adjusted life year) value of the intervention. QALYs are used by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom to determine the cost effectiveness of a treatment, and to determine whether it should be made available free at point of use in the National Health Service (NHS).</description>
