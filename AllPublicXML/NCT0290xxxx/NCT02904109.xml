  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the eNOS activating agent
      triflusal on episodic memory and cognitive functions in participants under chronic stress.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, cross-over design

      Primary study outcome is:

      Performance in a verbal memory task.

      Main secondary outcomes are: Performance in working memory and cognitive tasks and influence
      on mood, depression and anxiety and subjective memory impairment.

      Once daily oral administration of 600 mg triflusal and placebo mannitol for 8 days in a
      cross-over trial with a washout period of at least 14 days between the two periods. Each
      participant will take triflusal as well as placebo
