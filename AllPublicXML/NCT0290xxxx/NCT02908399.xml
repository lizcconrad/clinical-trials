    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of up to 250 participants, from birth to 18 months, who have
      already had a chest x-ray while a patient at the National Institute of Health (NICH) in
      Karachi, Pakistan. Participants will include both males and females as well as all races and
      ethnicities. Participants will have thermal pictures of their chest taken by trained study
      staff using a Smartphone and a FLIR ONE attachment. Thermal images will be read by trained
      radiologists to determine if bacterial pneumonia is present. Results of the thermal image
      will then be compared to the results of the chest x-ray. If additional images of the chest or
      other areas of suspected related infection are available, additional thermal images will be
      taken of the same location within 24 hours of the other image.

    <description>Pneumonia is defined as the presence of an airspace opacity, lobar consolidation, or interstitial opacities on a chest x-ray. This determination will be made by two independent radiologists blinded to each other's readings, clinical information and thermal images. If they agree that pneumonia is either present or absent, that will be the final diagnosis. If there is disagreement, a third independent, blinded radiologist will break the tie.</description>
