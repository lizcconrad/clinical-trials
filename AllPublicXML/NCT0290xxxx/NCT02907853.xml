  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will link findings from neuroscience with clinical outcomes using contingency
      management (CM) to identify changes in brain structure and function that emerge during purely
      behavioral therapy for methamphetamine (MA) use.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will correlate MA-abstinence outcomes from an 8-week program of voucher-based
      incentives using an escalating schedule for 30 treatment-seeking, MA-dependent individuals
      with scores on tasks of working memory and assessments of neuropsychological and demographic
      status. At the beginning and end of the CM program, participants will participate in MRI
      scans while performing a working memory task and will complete a battery of select
      neurocognitive and psychological assays to address two specific aims: (1) to determine
      whether changes in neural function within frontostriatal circuitry from baseline to end of
      the 8-week CM program are associated with parallel changes in measures of cognitive control
      and impulsivity and with MA abstinence outcomes and (2) to determine whether structural
      changes in frontostriatal circuitry over the 8-week CM intervention correspond with
      neurocognitive, psychological and MA abstinence measures.

    <ipd_description>Data will be shared with other investigators following publication of the main paper or 2 years after the last subject completes participation, whichever comes first. Shared data will be stripped of all PHI and potentially personally identifying variables.
Requests should briefly state the concept of interest, provide a brief timeline for analyzing the data and preparing a manuscript, and include a copy of the CV of the investigator making the request and documentation of proof of training in the ethical treatment of human subjects in research.
The concept proposal will be evaluated based on three criteria, including the potential impact or contribution to the research in advancing knowledge; the feasibility of the proposed research; and that the aim of the proposed research will not overlap with any of the aims or planned analyses.</ipd_description>
