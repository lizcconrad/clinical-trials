  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition accounts for nearly half of child deaths worldwide. Children who are
      well-nourished are better able to learn in school, grow into more physically capable adults,
      and require less health care during childhood and adulthood. Moreover, it is difficult to
      make up for poor childhood nutrition later in life. I present here the proposal for an
      intervention that builds on a larger study in Ethiopia and will generate insights into the
      importance of behavioral factors related to persistent malnutrition in low-income settings,
      allowing for more targeted, cost-effective interventions in the future.

      Existing data from the study region, Oromia, Ethiopia, suggest that many mothers know how to
      correctly respond to a hypothetical situation where a young child exhibits poor growth. On
      the other hand, however, mothers frequently appear unaware about their own children's growth
      deficiencies. Together, these facts suggest that false beliefs about the appropriateness of a
      child's physical size are a more likely contributor to malnutrition, rather than a weak
      understanding of how to help a malnourished child.

      The proposed intervention will provide evidence on the relationship between caregiver beliefs
      about child nutritional status and the caregiver's behavior, ultimately analyzing how this
      relationship influences important nutritional choices for young children in a setting with
      limited resources. The study uses a two-by-two randomized trial; the first treatment is a
      cash transfer labeled for child food consumption, and the second is the provision of
      personalized information about the quality of the child's height compared to other children
      like those of the same age and gender in East Africa. Together the two treatment arms will
      provide evidence about the relative importance of behavioral versus resource barriers to
      improved nutrition. Better understanding of the interaction between these key factors is
      essential in addressing one of the foremost health issues facing developing countries today.

    <description>During a prior study in June-July 2016, we collected anthropometric measures on the index children, including the children's height. Based on these data, for households assigned to the information treatment, enumerators provided personalized information to the children's primary caregiver about the index child's current height, during a baseline household visit. The enumerators carried a display card that visually showed where the child's height fell compared to &quot;healthy&quot; children of the same age and gender like those in East Africa. The enumerators emphasized to the caregivers that short stature is due to poor chronic malnutrition and is not just attributable to genetics or a recent illness. During this visit, the enumerators additionally pointed out that chronic malnutrition is not immediately life-threatening.</description>

    <description>Households received a cash transfer labeled for child food consumption and were told the money is designed to cover additional spending for food for the index child (and any other younger children in the household) over the next six weeks. Though it was given as a single, lump sum payment, the transfer was evenly split and handed to the household in six sealed envelopes, to help the households better allocate the money. To further encourage them not to spend the money all at once, each envelope was labeled with a number, the index child's name, and the dates for the week the money in the envelope should be spent. Enumerators clearly stated that this is a one-time money transfer.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Households for this study were selected from among those who were included in any of the
        three study groups from a larger study and for whom relevant data had been collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  inclusion in the larger study required the household to have a child who was 6-35
             months old for the main study's baseline survey in July-August 2015 (referred to as
             the index child) and for the household to have land for crop cultivation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Households that did not meet the inclusion restriction or those who did not have
             anthropometric data collected during the larger study.
