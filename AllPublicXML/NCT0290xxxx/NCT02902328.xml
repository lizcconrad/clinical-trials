  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SIS has developed a software technology, based on machine learning and image processing,
      designed to enhance standard clinical images for the visualization of anatomical structures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cohort of 30 subjects will be scanned on a clinical MRI scanner as well as on a 7 Tesla (T)
      scanner. Images acquired on the 7T allow to visualize anatomical structures that are not
      easily identified on standard clinical images.

      SIS software will be used to visualize selected anatomical features on the clinical image and
      the results will be compared with the images of the same subject obtained from the 7T MRI.
