  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational (12 centers planned, in Germany 9 centers and in France,
      the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK) 1 center in each country respectively),
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with moderate to severe Psoriasis compared to
      Placebo as assessed by the primary endpoint &quot;75% reduction of Psoriasis Area Severity Index&quot;
      (PASI 75 ) during a 16 week treatment phase. As secondary objectives the safety and efficacy
      of the optimized treatment schedule will be assessed using multiple methods (e.g. (Serious)
      Adverse Events ((S)AE) occurrence and questionnaires)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study was initiated to further increase the knowledge about the optimal dosing
      regimen and to thus optimize the efficacy and safety of MTX treatment for patients with
      moderate to severe psoriasis. In view of the described risk-benefit profile of MTX, an
      initial dose of at least 15 mg per week administered subcutaneously followed by 5 mg folic
      acid p.o. 24 hours after MTX application seems appropriate. Since 20 mg MTX per week has been
      proven to be beneficial in a considerable part of patients, who did not respond sufficiently
      to 15 mg MTX per week, in this study the dosing starts with a dose of 17.5 mg MTX per week,
      administered subcutaneously. At such a starting dose, it was expected to find the highest MTX
      efficacy possible, but with appropriate safety margins. If in a patient, a &quot;50% reduction of
      Psoriasis Area Severity Index&quot; PASI50 response is not achieved in week 8, the dose will be
      increased to 22.5 mg MTX per week. All dosages used in this study lay within the approved
      dosing range of MTX. The study will be conducted in a double-blind, placebo controlled
      manner. Placebo was chosen as control since only this comparator allows a reliable
      interpretation of safety and efficacy data.
