  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of adjuvanted R21 alone and in
      combination with a viral-vectored vaccine regimen (constituting adjuvanted R21 + ChAd63 and
      MVA encoding ME-TRAP) against malaria sporozoite challenge in healthy malaria-naive
      volunteers.

      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in London, Oxford and Southampton.

      All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. The study involves having either two,
      three or five vaccinations and then undergoing challenge infection with malaria, or receiving
      no vaccinations then undergoing challenge infection with malaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination phases and challenge procedures have been staggered over the trial period into 2
      parts, challenges A and B.

      Challenge A:

        -  Groups 1-3 consist of volunteers receiving either R21 alone or R21 + ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP
           followed by CHMI by sporozoite challenge (mosquito bite) at week 12. Twelve volunteers
           will be recruited to each group.

        -  Group 4a will serve as infectivity controls, these volunteers will not be vaccinated.

      Challenge B:

        -  Sterilely protected volunteers in groups 1 - 3 may be rechallenged to assess durability
           of efficacy, 5-12 months after the initial challenge.

        -  Groups 5-7 will also be enrolled to participate in challenge B.

        -  Group 5 (8 volunteers) will test the efficacy of standard dose R21 with a fractional
           third dose followed by CHMI at week 12.

        -  Group 6 will test the long-term efficacy of the standard dose R21 vaccination regimen
           (volunteers in this group will have already received their vaccinations whilst enrolled
           in the VAC053 malaria trial and will therefore not receive any additional vaccinations
           before undergoing challenge).

        -  Group 7 (8 volunteers) will test the efficacy of a two dose R21 vaccination regimen
           followed by CHMI at week 8.

        -  Group 4b will serve as infectivity controls for groups 5-7 and sterilely protected group
           1-3 volunteers. Group 4c volunteers will be used as infectivity controls if any
           volunteers from groups 5 and 7 are rechallenged.
