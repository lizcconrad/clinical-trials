      The goal of this study was to evaluate, in the hands of an inexperienced surgeon, the
      cochleostomy location of an endaural approach (MINV) compared to the conventional posterior
      tympanotomy (MPT) approach. Since 2010, the investigators use in the ENT department of Nice a
      new surgical endaural approach to perform cochlear implantation. In the hands of an
      inexperienced surgeon, the position of the cochleostomy has not yet been studied in detail
      for this technique. This is a prospective study of 24 human heads. Straight electrode arrays
      were implanted by an inexperienced surgeon: on one side using MPT and on the other side using
      MINV.
