    <measure>Effect of JNJ-54175446 Versus Placebo on Total Sleep Deprivation (TSD)-Induced Changes in Depressive Symptoms by HDRS17/IDS-C30 Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4 and 10: 2 to 8 hours post dose, Day 17</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 (HDRS17) contains 17 items pertaining to symptoms of depression experienced over the past week. Score range is from 0 to 52. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Clinician rated-30 (IDS-C30) is a standardized 30 item, clinician rated, scale to assess the severity of a participant's depressive symptoms. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum score of 84. The higher the score the more severe the symptoms of depression.</description>

    <measure>Effect of JNJ-54175446 Versus Placebo on Total Sleep Deprivation (TSD)-Induced Changes in Depressive Symptoms by QIDS-SR16/QIDS-SR10 Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3 and 10: 2 to 8 hours post dose, Day 17</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR16 (1 week recall period) is a participant reported measure designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 27 (none 1-5, mild 6-10, moderate 11-15, severe 16-20 and very severe 21-27). QIDS-SR10 is a version of the QIDS-SR16 with a shorter, 2-hour recall period and 10-item measure. Scoring for each domain will be the same as for the QIDS-SR16.</description>

    <description>The reward task was a probabilistic instrumental learning task involving monetary wins or losses. In order to maximize payoffs, participants should use the outcome feedback to gradually learn the symbol-outcome associations by trial and error over time, such that they consistently choose the symbol with the high-probability win and avoid the symbol with the high-probability loss. Outcome measures included overall total, total won and lost, choice frequency, percentage of choices identical to the preceding one (percentage consistency), reaction time and re-reaction time.</description>
