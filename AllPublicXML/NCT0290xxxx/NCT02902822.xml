  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the validity and utility of a tele-dermatology
      system in the midterm periodic screening of non-widespread skin lesions of recent onset or
      for which a specialized early classification is deemed to change the prognosis - including
      precancerous skin lesions as well as melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers - compared to
      control visits at fixed follow-up.

    <intervention_name>Screening</intervention_name>
    <description>The screening visit consists in a general dermatological examination of the subject, with special focus on the onset of the following skin diseases during the follow-up period:
bacterial skin infections - pyoderma - or viral (erysipelas, impetigo, herpes zoster, molluscum contagiosum, viral warts);
fungal skin infections (tinea corporis, cruris, pedis);
pigmented tumors (melanoma);
non-melanocytic tumors (actinic keratoses, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma).</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Tele-dermatology</intervention_name>
    <description>The system consists in a simple web-based/smartphone application through which subjects can send pictures of recently onset non-widespread skin lesions with special focus on the following diseases:
bacterial skin infections - pyoderma - or viral (erysipelas, impetigo, herpes zoster, molluscum contagiosum, viral warts);
fungal skin infections (tinea corporis, cruris, pedis);
pigmented tumors (melanoma);
non-melanocytic tumors (actinic keratoses, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma).
A dermatology will judge online pictures based on a standard scale. Each subject who will use the system will be also seen by routine clinical visit to confirm the online diagnosis. Subjects who will not send any picture will be seen for a dermatological examination at the end of each year.</description>
