  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this first-in-man study is to investigate whether AC-084 is safe and
      well-tolerated when orally administered at single- and multiple-ascending dose to healthy
      adults
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed in three parts, A, B and C

      Part A: single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose

      Part B: single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose

      Part C: single-center, open-label, single dose in CYP2C9 poor metabolizers
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study has been terminated due to difficulties in recruiting subjects into Part C. No safety
    concerns contributed to the termination of the study
