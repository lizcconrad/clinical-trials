  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deaf children showed deficits in speech processing and temporality. They badly apprehend
      temporal concepts and perceptions of deficit so the acoustic phenomena marking the time
      course linguistically. Their prediction capabilities and anticipation multisensory events are
      thereby affected, thus impacting their ability to adapt to multiple and complex interaction
      possibilities that arise during a conversation.The project aim it is to measure the impact of
      a musical rhythmic stimulation of neuronal activity and the temporal prediction capabilities
      of older deaf children 5 to 8 years and its impact on their language skills in a
      conversational task. A matched control group of age will be examined for each of the proposed
      tasks.

      We first measure the capacity to anticipate a situation of language interaction. For this
      purpose, we will use an alternate naming paradigm with a virtual partner, already developed
      and tested in children with normal hearing. This paradigm approaches the conversational
      situation while allowing control of the time parameter of speech (speed of trade) and by
      controlling the bias (temporal) inherent linguistic programming difficulties of children in a
      spontaneous conversation situations .

      Then we will couple behavioral measurements with measurements of eye movements and the
      electroencephalogram (EEG) in deaf children. For this, we use a dialog observation task
      already developed for normal hearing children. This task will allow us firstly to analyze the
      anticipation level of speaking turns by analyzing eye movements (which &quot;precedes&quot; the
      speaker). Secondly, it will allow us to study the effects of manipulation of the acoustic
      parameters of auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and the oscillatory activity of the motor
      system (EEG, mu rhythm and beta). The audiomoteur coupling would seem to be the key point of
      anticipatory processes and convergence in conversational interaction will also be studied
      using cortico-cortical coherence techniques to assess the dynamics of connectivity between
      remote networks (system here auditory and motor system).
