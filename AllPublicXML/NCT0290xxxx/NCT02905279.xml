  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of exposure therapy for fear of spiders as enhanced by the
      use of antagonistic or opposite actions during treatment. The goal of the study is to compare
      the efficacy threat-relevant opposite actions and threat-irrelevant opposite actions in
      extinguishing fear.

      This study tests whether exposure therapy for fear of spiders can be enhanced with the use of
      opposite actions, which are actions opposite to fear-related action tendencies. The
      investigators will test two sub-types of opposite actions (a) threat-relevant opposite
      actions, which are actions antagonistic to specific threats associated with spider phobia,
      and (b) threat-irrelevant opposite actions, which are actions antagonistic to the fear
      response, but unrelated to specific threats associated with spider phobia. This exposure
      therapy enhanced with opposite actions will be compared with two control groups: standard
      exposure therapy and non-specific anxiety treatment (biofeedback relaxation training).

      Individuals between the ages of 18-65 with elevated fear of spiders are randomly assigned to
      one of four treatment conditions (1) biofeedback relaxation training, (2) standard exposure
      therapy, (3) exposure therapy with threat-relevant opposite actions, and (4) exposure therapy
      with threat-irrelevant opposite actions. All participants undergo an online prescreen and a
      face-to-face screening assessment to determine eligibility and baseline (pre-treatment)
      symptom severity. Participants additionally complete assessments directly after treatment
      (post-treatment), and approximately two weeks after treatment (follow-up). The pre-treatment
      assessment occurs on the same day as treatment, the post-treatment assessment occurs during
      the treatment visit as soon as the treatment procedure is complete, and the follow-up
      assessment occurs within a window of 14-21 days after the completion of treatment.
      Participants complete two behavioral approach tests (in the treatment context and in the
      generalization context) at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up. Participants
      complete a battery of self-report questionnaires at pre-treatment and follow-up.
