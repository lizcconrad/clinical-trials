  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury is an independent factor of morbidity and
      mortality . Despite its delayed elevation, serum creatinine (Cr) remains the goal standard to
      diagnose AKI. Hyperphosphatemia is well-know in case of AKI because of its excretion
      decrease. Moreover, serum phosphorus (Ph) is daily measure d after cardiac surgery since its
      variation may lead to cardiac dysfunction. In case of AKI, Ph may reflect the decrease of
      renal function in this context. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      predictibility of Ph to detect both AKI induction and in a second time, renal recovery.

      It is a one-year prospective diagnostic validation study included all patients &gt; 18 years-odl
      admitted in our center after cardiac surgery. AKI is define according to KDIGO criteria and
      classified in the groups of severity according to the Cr elevation and the need of renal
      replacement therapy. Serum Cr and Ph are measured at baseline before surgery , at ICU
      admission, every 12 hours until ICU discharge and every 24 hours until hospital discharge. To
      evaluate the predictability of Of Ph to diagnose AKI, the postoperative Ph percentage of
      maximal elevation (%EPh) will be calculated. Then the diagnostic performance of %EPh wil be
      assessed by calculating the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to
      determine an optimal threshold with sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value and
      negative predictive value.
