      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Multi-LOC® peripheral stent
      system to treat de novo and restenotic lesions (no in-stent restenosis (ISR), no restenosis
      post drug coated balloon (DCB) after flow limiting plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA)
      and/or DCB dilatations in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal segments (P1, P2
      &amp; P3)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willingness to treat flow-limiting dissections/recoil after plain old balloon
             angioplasty (POBA)/drug coated balloon (DCB) interventions

          -  Patients in Rutherford classes 2 through 5

          -  Patients eligible for peripheral revascularization by means of percutaneous
             transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Patient with a life expectance of at least 12 months

          -  Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the study
             and to show sufficient compliance in the following study protocol

          -  Patients must agree to undergo at least the 6-month clinical follow-up

          -  Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks,
             benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of this trial, e.g.
             balloon angioplasty by means of other suitable stent devices. Patients, by providing
             their informed consent, agree to these risks and benefits as stated in the patient
             informed consent document.

          -  Lesions with unsatisfying angiographic results due to recoil and/or dissections after
             POBA/DCB interventions

          -  Infra-inguinal lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal segments
             (P1,P2 &amp; P3) reference vessel diameters between 4 and 7.0 mm, lesion length suitable
             for the release of at least 2 Stent (up to 6) segments implanted with a minimum
             inter-stent distance of 1 cm

          -  Diameter stenosis pre-procedure must be larger or equal to 70%

          -  Vessels must have adequate distal run-off with at least one vessel to the foot or with
             collaterals in the calf supplying sufficient flow to the foot.

        (Lesions separated by less than 2 cm are considered as one lesion)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient not suitable for revascularization by interventional means
