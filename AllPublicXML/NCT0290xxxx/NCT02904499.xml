  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Public health surveillance models, previously used for the ongoing detection of occurrence of
      rare events, could be used to reinforce existing pharmacovigilance systems. These models have
      not been previously used for Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) detection in medico-administrative
      databases. DABISURV research project focuses on a new anticoagulant therapy, dabigatran,
      launched recently on the French market for atrial fibrillation (AF). This drug is at high
      risk for severe ADR and requires thus careful pharmacovigilance monitoring.

      Primary objective is to compare the results of ongoing surveillance models to detect
      hemorrhages or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) associated with dabigatran, with the results
      obtained from the analysis of a cohort of patients with AF under the same treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DABISURV study consists in an analyze of a cohort of patients with AF who have received at
      least one prescription Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) - reference group - or of dabigatran in
      the French National Health Insurance System.

      The uptake of dabigatran is followed for detecting hemorrhagic events or AMI associated with
      this molecule among first users.

      The ability to detect quickly substantial ADR of new drugs is of critical importance to
      public health in order to facilitate timely public health response. If the public health
      surveillance models are found useful for this topic, then semi-automated procedures would be
      needed to detect ADR associated with new generation anticoagulants in medico-administrative
      databases. If the public health surveillance models are found not useful for the detection of
      ADR, the cohort study itself will provide essential data on the safety profile of dabigatran.

        Cohort of adult patients diagnosed with AF or atrial flutter and who received at least one
        prescription of VKA (warfarin /acenocoumarol /fluindion) or dabigatran between 2009 and
        2014. As opposed to other countries, in France, warfarin is not the most prescribed VKA for
        AF.
