      The main objective of this project is to assess the average cost of the treatment of bleeding
      postpartum with recombinant activated factor VII (NovoSeven®) and compare it to the reference
      strategy. Costs related to medicine NovoSeven® can generate surplus, but it also avoids in
      some cases very costly invasive procedures. It will be interesting to compare the average
      cost of the complete strategies supported.
