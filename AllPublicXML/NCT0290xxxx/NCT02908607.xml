  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When screening results for cervical premalignant lesions are positive, colposcopy is
      recommended. This is highly sensitive screening method. However, specificity of the test is
      of low.

      Thus, a technology that improves the accuracy of the colposcopic exam is needed.

      This is a feasibility study with the goal of examining the performance of a thermal imaging
      camera in the detection of cervical malignant and premalignant lesions.
