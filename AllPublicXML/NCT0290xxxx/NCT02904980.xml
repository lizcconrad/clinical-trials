  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to integrate a gaze training intervention (i.e., quiet eye
      training; QET) that has been shown to improve the throwing and catching skill of children
      with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), within an approach (i.e., group therapy) that
      might alleviate the psychosocial influence of these motor skill deficits.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with DCD will be randomly split into either QET group or a technical training (TT).
      The TT group will be given movement-related instructions via video, relating to the throw and
      catch phases, while the QET group will also be taught to fixate a target location on the wall
      prior to the throw (QE1) and to track the ball prior to the catch (QE2). Each group will take
      part in a 4- week, group therapy intervention and measurements of QE duration obtained from a
      mobile eye tracking system and catching performance are to be taken before and after
      training, and at a 6-week delayed retention test. Parental feedback on psychosocial and motor
      skill outcomes will also be collected at delayed retention.
