  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etonogestrel (ENG) subdermal contraceptive implant (ENG implant) is a highly effective
      method of preventing pregnancy, but it has bleeding side effects that make it unappealing for
      many women. The only study to demonstrate a sustained reduction in bleeding lasting for two
      months was the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen in users of the
      levonogestrel (LNG) contraceptive implant. Based on the investigators encouraging preliminary
      data of tamoxifen and ENG implant users, the investigators plan to perform additional studies
      on the impact of tamoxifen on the breakthrough bleeding experience by ENG implant users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a 2 phase trial for treatment of women experiencing frequent
      or prolonged bleeding while using the ENG contraceptive implant. The first phase will consist
      of a randomized, controlled, double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial over a 90-day
      reference period and the second phase will allow both study arms to receive open-label
      treatment over an additional 90-day reference period. The primary outcome of the study will
      be the total number of consecutive bleeding-free days in first 30 days from Day 1 of first
      treatment (TX1).
