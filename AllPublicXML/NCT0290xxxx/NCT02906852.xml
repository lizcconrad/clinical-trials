      The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of Inivata liquid biopsy analysis
      compared with standard tissue biopsy analysis for detection of genomic alterations in
      patients with advanced lung cancer. Once selected for the study and with full informed
      consent, patients will have a blood draw to allow the detection of cancer-related genomic
      alterations that are detectable within the blood sample. These results will be compared to
      results obtained from genomic profiling via standard tissue biopsy taken as part of routine
      care to help determine whether such 'liquid biopsies' can be used to guide treatments in
      future patients. The results of the liquid biopsy will not be used to guide treatment
      decisions in study participants.

      In addition there is data-collection of treatments received for non small cell lung cancer
      and the response to these treatments during the first 6 months post tissue and blood
      analysis, though no additional visits or procedures are required for the patient beyond the
      initial blood draw.

        Male and female patients aged 18 years and over diagnosed with stage IIIb/IV non-squamous
        NSCLC, who are intended to initiate first-line treatment according to standard guidelines,
        or having recently progressed on first-line EGFR or ALK directed therapy and being
        considered for further therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written, signed and dated informed consent to participate in the study must be given
             by the patient in accordance with 21 CFR Part 312, the International Conference on
             Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E6, and applicable
             regulations, before completing any study-related procedures.

          -  Male and female patients aged 18 years and over diagnosed with stage IIIb/IV
             non-squamous NSCLC.

          -  Arms A and B: Patients intended to initiate first-line treatment according to standard
             guidelines. Note, a patient is eligible to receive sterotactic radiosurgery (no
             whole-brain radiotherapy). Arm C: Patients who are at a second-line treatment setting
             or greater may participate. Note, a patient may be included if they have metastatic
             brain lesions. Arms A, B, C: If enrolled in a treatment clinical trial, patients may
             also enroll in this study if all eligibility criteria are met.

          -  Arm A only: Patients intended to initiate first-line treatment according to standard
             guidelines who plan to have or have had a recent tumor tissue biopsy taken for
             molecular profiling as part of their standard of care.

          -  Patient must understand and be able, willing and likely to fully comply with all study
             procedures and restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received any approved or experimental cancer therapy since their
             most recent NSCLC tissue biopsy (Arms A and B)

          -  Patients who have any other prior metastatic or current second primary cancer (Arms A
             and B)

          -  Patient who has a severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
