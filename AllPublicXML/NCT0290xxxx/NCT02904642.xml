  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to test the impact of short message service (SMS) reminders, with or
      without unconditionally provided mobile-money incentives, can improve measles vaccination
      coverage in rural western Kenyan infants.

      Primary Objective The primary objective is to determine if text message reminders, with or
      without unconditionally provided incentives, can increase the proportion of children who
      receive measles vaccination by 15% at age ten months as compared to control arm children.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To conduct a secondary analysis of the primary outcome using survival analysis and
           time-to-immunization curves.

        2. To determine if there is a differential effect on measles vaccine coverage based on
           mobile phone ownership and distance to the clinic.

        3. To examine the effect of the interventions on measles coverage measured at twelve months
           of age.

        4. To examine the completeness and costs of identifying children through a CHW approach
           versus the standard HDSS approach.

        5. To evaluate the effect of the interventions on coverage of second dose of measles
           vaccine at 24 months. This secondary objective is contingent on receiving additional
           funding.

    <description>As a secondary analysis of the primary outcome, time-to-measles immunization curves will be constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and study arms will be compared using the Cox model. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for time to immunization and the number of days delayed, in relation to the measles due date, will also be reported for each vaccine and by study arm.</description>

    <description>A priori we will conduct sub group analyses of the primary outcome for mobile phone ownership, birth order of the enrolled caregiver's child, and time to clinic. Additional variables for subgroup analyses will come from a risk factor analysis of not receiving measles vaccination in the control arm</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>All enrolled caregivers will receive a congratulatory text message at enrollment which indicates who is conducting the study and which also includes a general-health related saying, &quot;The greatest wealth is health&quot;. No additional text messages or travel subsidies will be sent to caregivers randomized to the control arm.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>SMS reminder</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>At enrollment, participants will be told to expect 2 SMS reminders for measles vaccine; first, at 3 days before and second, on the day before the scheduled measles vaccine at 9 months of age. At most, enrolled caregivers will receive three text messages (two for the measles vaccine and one for welcoming mother to the study). Text messages will be sent in English, Kiswahili or Dholuo language, according to the mother's preference. These reminders will have information about the child's scheduled immunization date.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>SMS reminder + Unconditional Incentive</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive SMS reminders as described in the SMS reminder arm. Additionally, participants will be sent a 150 Kenyan Shillings (KES) incentive to the mobile phone number they provided at enrollment. The incentive will be delivered three days before the child turns nine months (i.e. sent on the same day as the first SMS reminder). Caregivers will receive the mobile-money incentive unconditionally. The intent of the incentive is to help offset the costs associated with transportation to the clinic. The transaction costs associated with mobile-money transactions will be borne by the study such that mothers will receive the full 150 KES.</description>
