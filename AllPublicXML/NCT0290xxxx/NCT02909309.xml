      Evaluation of a Mandibular and Abdominal Motion Detection Sensor (JAWAC) to Prevent Apnea
      During Sedation With Propofol in TCI Mode

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2016 , monitoring of propofol sedation , currently recommended by the American Society of
      Anaesthesiology and European companies includes among others, a pulse oximeter (SpO2) and a
      continuous measurement of CO2 exhaled by an appropriate device (CapnoLine). This monitoring
      does not allow to anticipate the occurrence of obstructive apnea .

      The anticipation of the occurrence of apnea or airway obstruction using this type of
      monitoring could allow the anesthesiologist to act earlier on the titration of propofol and
      maintaining the airway. This would avoid the side effects associated with hypoxemia and
      hypercapnia and therefore further improve patient safety .

      This pilot study tests the JAWAC system to detect those apneas.

      This is an interventional diagnostic study on the JAWAC monitoring system validation in a
      prospective cohort of patients undergoing sedation in order to provoke sleep apnea. Indeed ,
      sedation technique is already used with propofol during snoring provocation tests in patients
      at risk for sleep apnea.

    <measure>Optimal JAWAC signal threshold detecting obstructive apnea</measure>
    <time_frame>at time of anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>The apnea is defined clinically by the anesthesiologist with the help of the capnoLine/Spo2. The purpose is to define the optimal signal detection during a continuous record of the system JAWAC associated with the occurrence of obstructive apnea.
The results will give a variation in centimeters for a certain amount of time. It is possible that the optimal signal detection will be a combination of different sensors.
The sensibility, specificity versus precocity of the signal will be studied.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time limit between the detection of each system and the episode of désaturation</measure>
    <time_frame>at time of anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>The assumption is that the signal JAWAC enable an earlier response of the anesthetist and a priori reduce the occurrence of desaturation at the onset of obstructive apnea compared to the capnoLine/spo2 system.</description>

Non invasive sensors are used to monitor and record data of those two systems in a synchron way ( JAWAC / Capnoline + Spo2).</description>
