    <textblock>
      Hot flashes and night sweats (i.e., vasomotor symptoms, VMS) affect 80% of women during the
      menopausal transition (MT). VMS are associated with decreased quality of life, increased
      depressive and anxiety symptoms, memory complaints, sleep disturbance, and reduced work
      productivity. Hormone therapy (HT) is highly effective in reducing VMS, but the use of HT
      declined 75% to 80% in the U.S. after the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) raised safety
      concerns about HT. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved paroxetine, a
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; 7.5 mg), as the first non-hormonal treatment
      for VMS. SSRIs are an important treatment option for many women, but their use in treating
      VMS is limited by lower effectiveness when compared to HT, side effects, and relapse of
      symptoms following treatment discontinuation. Identifying safe and effective non-hormonal
      treatments for VMS remains a priority in women's health research.

      Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB), used for decades in pain management, is a potential new
      approach to VMS treatment. Located in the cervical spine region, the stellate ganglia are
      part of the sympathetic nervous system. Although SGB is commonly performed to treat
      neuropathic pain, hyperhidrosis or vascular insufficiency, anatomic studies reveal
      connections between this ganglion and thermoregulatory regions of the brain, specifically the
      insular cortex.

      In this clinical trial, we aim to assess whether stellate ganglion block (SGB) with
      bupivacaine, a local anesthetic, is an effective and safe non-hormonal intervention for women
      seeking relief from vasomotor symptoms (VMS), and identify the physiologic mechanisms
      underlying SGB effects. Outcomes will include frequency and intensity of hot flashes,
      objectively-measured VMS, mood, quality of life, sleep, and memory performance in 220
      postmenopausal women with 28 or more moderate to very severe hot flashes per week as measured
      by self-report for six months. They will be reassessed at 3 and 6 months following the SGB or
      a sham intervention for objective hot flashes and quality of life measures. Mechanistic
      outcomes (neuroimaging) will be obtained at baseline and 3 months following the intervention.
      Ambulatory monitoring of sympathetic nervous system function (SKNA) will be performed at
      baseline before the procedure, during the procedure and 1 hour following the procedure. This
      will be repeated at 2 and four weeks following the SGB or sham procedure for 1 hour
      recordings.

      Scope:

      Post-menopausal women with moderate to very severe VMS will be enrolled as participants in
      this study.

      Hypotheses:

      We predict that compared to sham intervention, SGB will reduce the frequency of VMS, improve
      mood and anxiety, increase quality of life, and improve memory, normalize brain activity in
      thermoregulatory brain areas and reduce efferent sympathetic nerve activity but have no
      effect on sleep or other cognitive functions. By providing a more definitive understanding of
      the effectiveness of SGB, possible secondary benefits, and mechanisms of action, these
      findings will fill a critical gap in treatment options available to women.

      Specific Goals and Objectives:

      Aim 1: To determine the effect of SGB for reducing menopausal VMS. Hypothesis 1: The
      frequency and intensity of VMS will be lower in women randomized to active SGB compared to
      sham control.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of SGB on objective VMS, mood, memory, and sleep quality.

      Hypothesis 2a: The frequency of objectively measured VMS will be lower in women randomized to
      active SGB compared to sham control.

      Hypothesis 2b: Depressive symptoms and memory, but not sleep quality, will improve more in
      women randomized to active SGB compared to sham control. Hypothesis 2c: The magnitude of
      improvements in memory will relate to the magnitude of reduction in VMS, even after
      controlling for sleep.

      Aim 3: To probe the mechanisms by which SGB improves VMS. Hypothesis 3a: In a nested
      substudy, neuroimaging assessments will reveal that compared to sham control, active SGB is
      associated with a) decreased functional connectivity in the default mode network during the
      resting state, particularly for networks supporting the insula and hippocampus; b) reduced
      activation in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate during
      a verbal memory task; and c) reduced activation in the amygdala during an emotion processing
      task.

      Hypothesis 3b: Compared to sham control, SGB will immediately diminish ipsilateral stellate
      ganglion nerve activity and sympathetic tone.
