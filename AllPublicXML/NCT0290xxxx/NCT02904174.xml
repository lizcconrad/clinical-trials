  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition, risk of falls and medication incidents are commonly faced by the older adults.
      This study aimed to provide health education to community-dwelling older adults and to assess
      the effectiveness of a Healthy Living Program (HLP) to older adults in terms of fall
      prevention, drug management and healthy eating habits.

    <textblock>
      This was a single group pre-post trial. Participants aged 60 or above were recruited from the
      community elderly centres. A 6-week HLP, which included one 45 minutes weekly session, was
      offered to the participants.

      122 participants were recruited. This study shows that the 6-week HLP has a potential to
      improve the physical well-being of the participants, and to increase their knowledge in diet,
      drug management and fall prevention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective happiness level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS), which consisted of 4 statements answered on a 7-point Likert scale. Scores for each statement range from 1 to 7 and the scores from the four statements were added, thus the possible range of scores on the SHS is 4 to 28. Higher scores reflect higher levels of subjective happiness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in frailty status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the FRAIL scale, which includes five items: fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss of weight. The FRAIL scale ranges from 0-5, with a score of 0 regards as normal, 1-2 as pre-frail and 3-5 as frail.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the numerical rating scale, to assess the presence and intensity of pain among participants, which was presented with 0 referring to no pain and 10 referring to the worst pain imaginable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Generalized pain self-efficacy beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire. It consists of 10 statements, and participants were asked to rate their confidence in performing 10 activities or tasks despite experiencing pain, on a 7-point scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Timed Up and Go Test. The participants were required to walk a distance of three meters, turn, walk back to the chair and sit down.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hand grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using a dynamometer. Participants were seated with arms by the trunk, the elbow flexed to 90 and in a neutral position, and the wrist in slight extension. Participants were told to squeeze the dynamometer as hard as they could</description>
