  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the effectiveness, safety, and
      tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with BL-8040 when given to patients with
      advanced pancreatic cancer.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of melanoma and lung cancer; however, it is not FDA approved for pancreatic
      cancer. BL-8040 is not FDA approved or commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic
      cancer.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 15 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Cycle 1 is 14 days (2 weeks). Cycles 2 and beyond are 21 days (3 weeks).

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Days 1-5 and 8-12 of Cycle 1,
      you will receive BL-8040 as an injection under the skin. After Cycle 1, you will receive
      BL-0840 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each cycle. You will not receive BL-08040 during Days
      15-21.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30
      minutes. You will not receive pembrolizumab during Cycle 1.

      You will be given standard drugs (such as hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine) to help
      decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the
      drugs are given and their risks.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive pembrolizumab and BL-8040 for about 1 year. You will no longer be able to
      receive treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1 and 8 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Before each dose of BL-8040, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      One (1) time during Week 4 and every 3 weeks after that:

      Â°Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Days 1 and 4 of Week 1 and then one (1) time during Weeks 3 and 6, and if the disease
      appears to be responding to the study drugs, blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for
      biomarker and tumor marker testing.

      During Week 6, you will have a tumor biopsy to learn if the study drug has had any affect on
      the disease. The study doctor will discuss with you what type of biopsy you will have.

      Every 9 weeks, you will have an MRI or CT scan.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 1 week after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, tumor marker, and biomarker
           testing.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs, you will be called by a member of the study
      staff to ask how you are doing and if you have had any side effects. This call should last
      about 5-10 minutes.

      About every 10 weeks after your last dose of study drugs, you will have a CT scan or MRI and
      a physical exam. This will continue unless the disease gets worse or you start a new
      anti-cancer treatment.

      Every 12 weeks, you will be called by a member of the study staff to ask how you are doing.
      Each call should last about 5-10 minutes. You will continue to have these calls unless you
      withdraw from the study or the study ends, whichever happens first.
