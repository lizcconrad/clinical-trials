  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled with cross over study compares efficacy of burst stimulation, 1000
      hertz stimulation, and standard stimulation in an non-superiority trial. The study duration
      is approximately 24 weeks and each stimulation modes will last for approximately 3 weeks with
      approximately 4 days of wash off in between.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study will enroll 22 patients for the purpose of evaluation of efficacy of burst stimulation,
      1000 hertz frequency stimulation or standard stimulation in patients who have a spinal cord
      stimulators implanted. Each patients will be randomized to either group A or B, where each
      groups consists of Burst, standard, and 1000 hertz frequency stimulation or vice versa with
      wash off period in between. The duration for each stimulation modes will be approximately 3
      weeks, with approximately 4 days of wash off prior to starting the new stimulation mode and
      in between stimulation modes. Treatment duration for each groups will last about 3 months or
      less, and with cross over total duration of the study is about 6 months in total.

      During the trial there will be 13 visits. The first visit will consist of screening visit
      activities and once the eligibility of the subjects are confirmed, they will be randomized
      and they can start the study immediately and begin their wash off period. After the initial
      visit/ randomization visit, there will be 12 follow up visits. At each visit, patients will
      be assessed for their pain, disability index, and their perception of their painful
      condition, as well as any adverse events and changes of medication usage or lack there of. At
      the end of the study, the data will be pooled to look at the pain level, disability index,
      and patients perceived changes in their painful condition for each treatment groups (Burst
      stimulation, 1000 hertz stimulation and standard stimulation) to determine if subject
      experienced equivocal pain relief from all three stimulation modes.

    <description>Group A will consist of sequence of treatment with 3 stimulation modes. They are, in order, 1000 hertz, standard, and burst stimulation. Each stimulation modes will last 3 weeks, with 4 days of wash off between them. Each group treatments will take about 3 months, and subject will cross over into the other treatment group. Burst stimulation sends packets of electrical pulses, composed of pulse and packet frequency. 1000 hertz stimulation delivers tonic, sub perception stimulation. The standard stimulation mode, which will serve as the control, will be below 100 hertz, and its pulse strength will be above threshold, where patients will feel the tingling from the electrical pulses generated by the spinal cord stimulator.</description>
