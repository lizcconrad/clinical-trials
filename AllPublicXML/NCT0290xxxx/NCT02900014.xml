  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cell therapy appears to be an alternative to treat bone defects. Scientific advances have
      shown in animal models and in humans that mesenchymal stem cells were good candidates to
      support cellular bone regeneration after transplantation. However, their collection requires
      invasive sampling usually bone marrow. A new candidate stem cells able to stimulate bone
      regeneration has recently been identified in the nasal cavity, these cells are called
      &quot;ecto-mesenchymal&quot; cells. These stem cells have very similar biological characteristics of
      mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow. They exhibit a high mitogenic activity and hold great
      potential for differentiation into osteoblast lineage. Given their properties and their ease
      of access within the nasal cavity, ecto-mesenchymal stem cells offer new prospects for cell
      therapy targeting bone involvement. In this context, the ecto-mesenchymal stem cells
      represent a nasal bone reconstruction interesting alternative in particular in indication of
      the cleft. They are directly and easily accessible in these children when conventional
      surgical reconstruction. The investigators propose in this study to validate a production
      method of stem cell called &quot;ecto-mesenchymal&quot; isolated from a biopsy of the nasal cavity of
      children with cleft lip and palate to be able to soon propose cell therapy innovative in this
      indication.
