    <textblock>
      Many metabolic disturbances, such as protein-energy wasting, inulin resistance, and
      dyslipidemia are common features of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, to date, the
      underlying mechanisms of these disturbances remain elusive. Many in vitro studies have
      demonstrated that white adipose cells exhibit dysfunctions in conditions that mimics uremic
      environment. In good agreement, several animal experiments have reported that chronic kidney
      disease was associated with lipoatrophy, adipose tissue dysfunction and ectopic lipid
      redistribution. The goal of this protocol is to collect and study structural and metabolic
      properties of white adipose tissue in CKD stage V patients to evidence adipose tissue
      dysfunction associated with CKD. The primary outcome measure will be the cellularity of the
      adipose tissue (i.e. size of the adipose cells) and the secondary measure to study the gene
      expression profile using microarray and metabolic properties of adipose tissue (i.e.
      lipogenesis). To this end, 15 male adult volunteers and 15 non-diabetic and non-dialyzed CKD
      stage V patients, matched for age, gender and body mass index (BMI) will be recruited at the
      Departments of Nephrology or Urology of Lyon University Hospital (Lyon, France). The biopsies
      of abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (2-3 g) will be performed during elective
      urologic surgery (i.e. peritoneal dialysis catheter for CKD patients and radical
      prostatectomy for non CKD patients).

    <description>The biopsies of abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (2-3 g) will be performed during elective surgery (i.e. peritoneal dialysis catheter for CKD patients and radical prostatectomy for non CKD patients). 50-100 mg will be fixed in osmium tetroxide for cellularity measurement i.e. measurement of adipose cell size. Adipose cell size will be determined by a Beckman Coulter Multisizer IV (Beckman Coulter) with a 400 µm aperture. The range of cell sizes that can effectively be measured using this aperture is 20-240 µm. The instrument will be set to count 1,000 particles, and the fixed-cell suspension will be diluted so that coincident counting remains &lt;10%. Cell-size distributions will be drawn from measurement of at least 12,000 cell diameters for each patient. The mean fat cell volume will then be compared using Student t test or Mann &amp; Whitney U tests.</description>

    <description>The biopsies of abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (2-3 g) will be performed during elective surgery (i.e. peritoneal dialysis catheter) for CDK patients or during elective urologic surgery (e.g. radical prostatectomy) for Non-CDK patients. 50-100 mg will fixed in osmium tetroxide for cellularity measurement and 1g of fresh adipose tissue were used from adipocyte isolation. The remnant part of the biopsies will be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use (gene expression).</description>
