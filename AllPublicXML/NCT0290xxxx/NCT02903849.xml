      The investigators are interested in using personalized, self-motivating messages to motivate
      people to exercise more. Through a partnership with a university, the investigators are
      running a large-scale, randomized field controlled trial aimed at increasing exercise
      frequencies during a 100-day challenge. The primary purpose of this study is to test whether
      sending people motivating messages they wrote to themselves in the past can keep them engaged
      in the challenge and motivate them to exercise more frequently. One week into the challenge,
      employees who have signed up for the challenge will receive an email inviting them to
      participate in a short activity. Employees who click on the link will be directed to a
      survey. Once they finish reading the first introductory page and click &quot;next&quot;, they will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the control group, employees will be encouraged to
      write down what they think will motivate them to walk more after 20, 50, and 90 days into the
      Challenge. These employees will receive standard reminders on the 20th, 50th, and 90th day of
      the challenge. In the treatment group, employees will be encouraged to write down motivating
      messages that they will receive on the 20th, 50th, and 90th day of the Challenge.

      All employees who are exposed to either the control or the treatment condition will be
      included in the analysis.

      The investigators plan to explore moderators based on (a) employees' demographics (age,
      gender, ethnicity, position), (b) employees' participation in previous challenges, and (c)
      employees' health condition and fitness level prior to the challenge (such as how actively
      they have been participating in other wellness activities, their health statistics).
