      Use of genotyping for the optimization of treatment with biologics in chronic arthritis by
      looking for an association between certain alleles and response to treatment.

    <textblock>
      Chronic arthritis in children and in adults represent a public health problem in number and
      difficulty of treatment. 30% of patients are non-responders and / or relapse upon
      discontinuation of treatment. Some of these treatments are not always well tolerated,
      sometimes with infectious complications including tuberculosis limiting the use of biological
      therapies. This study will validate a battery of genetic markers to predict responders
      biotherapy, determine the prognosis of patients, these treatments are reserved for the most
      severe forms, and thus improve the care of patients.
