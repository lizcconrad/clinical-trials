    <textblock>
      The single implant overdenture (IOD) represent the simplest form of IODs compared to the 2
      IOD which is the traditional gold standard IOD treatment option. Mandibular single-implant
      overdentures are proven to be a successful treatment option for older edentulous adults but
      we need to know if the CM-LOC attachment will retain its superiority over the ball
      attachments intraorally regarding the prosthetic complications in single implant retained
      overdenture like in 2 IOD

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Completely edentulous male or female patients between the ages of 50 to 69.

          -  No contraindications for implantation.

          -  Each patient has to perform both a random blood sugar and Glycosylated Hemoglobin
             analysis. Patients with a Glycosylated hemoglobin test HbA1c up to 8% and a normal
             blood sugar level (79 to 110) or controlled diabetic patients (90-130 fasting
             according to American Association of Diabetes) will be included.

          -  Sufficient bone width (â‰¥ 6 mm) in the anterior region to place an implant. It could be
             either normally present or achieved by bone plateauing. This will be confirmed by cone
             beam computed tomographic (CBCT) scans.

          -  Residual bone height ranging from 11-20 mm with the lowest vertical height in the
             midline of the mandible not less than 13 mm (Class II or III according to McGarry et
             al[1] 1999). This will be confirmed by the CBCT.

          -  Patients seeking to install a single symphyseal implant and for whom new dentures will
             be constructed.

          -  Patients, who are dissatisfied with the retention and stability of their technically
             satisfactory dentures.

          -  Patients, who already have existing maxillary and mandibular complete dentures, and
             after examination of the mandibular dentures, it is found that there are technical
             problems with regard to denture design and/or occlusion; then new maxillary and
             mandibular dentures will be fabricated

          -  All patients should have adapted to their dentures for at least six weeks before being
             included in the trial.

          -  Patients providing written informed consents to participate in the trial and this will
             be done before the scheduled date for implant installation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a systemic or local contra-indication for implant placement.

          -  Satisfied patients with the retention of their mandibular denture as well as
             unsatisfied patients with their maxillary denture.

          -  Patient with a mandibular denture height less than 6 mm between the base of the
             denture and the incisal edge of the central incisors (as measured by a caliper) or
             with 12 mm crown height space as measured by a ruler from the incisal edge till the
             crest of the ridge. This will be done from a putty index of the diagnostic set up.

          -  Incompliant and not cooperative patients.

          -  Patients smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day
