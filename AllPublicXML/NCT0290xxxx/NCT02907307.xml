    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of LactiSal 1%vaginal gel and
      LactiSal 50 mg vaginal tablet with the standart treatment of clotrimazole 100 mg vaginal
      tablet in woman with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)

    <textblock>
      National multicenter,randomized, open-label, active-controlled with three parallel
      groups.Eligible patients are randomized to receive LactiSal 1% vaginal gel, LactiSal 50 mg
      vaginal tablet or clotrimazole 100 mg vaginal tablet for 6 days. Control examaminations are
      performed 10 after entry and 4 weeks after control visit 1.

      The study investigates the clinical efficacy and safety of Lactisal 1% vaginal gel and
      LactiSal 50mg vaginal tablets in the intended use, i.e. vaginal application, and the
      following intended claims:

        -  Treatment of vaginal yeast vaginitis

        -  Relieves vaginal itching, burning, redness and discharge in case of yeast vaginitis

        -  Inhibition of yeast colonization in the vagina in case of yeast vaginitis. The study is
           designed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of Lactisal 1% vaginal gel and
           LactiSal 50 mg vaginal tablets to a current standard drug therapy, i.e. clotrimazole 100
           mg vaginal tablets.

      While LactiSal is classified as medical device class IIa, the comparator is a medicinal
      (pharmaceutical) product. The study represents a &quot;mixed&quot; study, comparing the efficacy of a
      medical device with a pharmaceutical product.

    <description>Clinical cure is defined as patient having a Total Severity Score of less than 3. The Total Severity Score (TSC) is assessed by the Investigator, examining and interviewing the patient. The TSC is the sum score of the 5 individual signs symptoms - vaginal itching, vaginal burning or soreness, abnormal vaginal discharge, vulvovaginal erythema or oedema and vulval excoriation or fissure formation. Each sign and symptom is assessed with a score from 0 to 3, resulting in total score for TSC of 0 to 15.</description>
