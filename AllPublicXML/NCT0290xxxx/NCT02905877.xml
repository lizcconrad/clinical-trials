  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional disorders, also called psychogenic or psychosomatic are very common, disabling and
      their costs to society are immense.

      Functional movement disorders are abnormal, involuntary movements, that are illogical in
      terms of classic neurology. Intriguingly, they typically manifest when patients pay attention
      to them and disappear with distraction.

      The investigators aim to further the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms
      underlying functional neurological disorders in order to improve treatment. In particular
      they aim to understand the effect of attention on movement in general, on functional
      neurological mechanisms and on the sense of agency (of subjective control) over a movement.

      Patients with a functional neurological disorder, patients with an organic neurological
      disorder and healthy participants will perform simple tasks, such as reaching to a target,
      while additional tasks will manipulate their attention. The effects of these attentional
      manipulations will be analysed on several levels: movement performance, analysed by the
      kinematics and electromyography (EMG), psychophysical measures, such as the sense of agency,
      and the neural correlates with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      If the hypothesis turns out to be true, then changing the attentional focus could be used as
      a treatment in functional neurological disorders.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will recruit three groups of participants:

               1. functional neurological disorders, e.g. functional tremor: diagnosed by a
                  neurologist.

               2. organic counterpart of the functional neurological disorders, e.g. in the case of
                  functional tremor, the organic counterpart would be organic tremor: presence of
                  an organic tremor according to internationally recognised guidelines and
                  diagnosed by a neurologist.

               3. healthy age-matched controls.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Healthy Participants: Major neurological disorder.

        All groups:

          1. Age under 18 or over 80

          2. Significant impairment in ability to give informed consent for study procedures due to
             significant cognitive impairment and/or inability to understand study literature,

          3. very severe tremor

          4. moderate or severe cognitive impairment

        For the fMRI study only:

        1) Standard contraindications to MRI (see MRI safety questionnaire)
