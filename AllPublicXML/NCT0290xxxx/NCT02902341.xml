    <textblock>
      Background: Malnutrition is widespread among cardiac surgery patients and is independently
      related to an adverse postoperative evolution or outcome. The investigators aimed to assess
      whether nutrition therapy (NT) could alter caloric deficit, morbidity, and mortality in
      patients scheduled for non-emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or aortic valve
      surgery.

      Methods: 351 patients undergoing either elective CABG or aortic valve surgery were studied.
      Patients receiving NT were enrolled from January 2013 until December 2014. A historical
      control group consisted of 142 matched patients. Preoperative nutritional status was
      evaluated. Resting energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry or calculated.
      Caloric intake and caloric deficits were assessed. The primary endpoint was to evaluate
      whether NT could limit caloric deficit (Intake to Need Deviation). A secondary endpoint
      addressed the potential effect of NT on morbidity and mortality. Patients were followed for
      one year after surgery.

      Background: Malnutrition, often presenting as sarcopenic obesity, is widespread among cardiac
      surgery patients and is independently related to an adverse postoperative evolution or
      outcome. Nutritional status and energetic needs or deficits in cardiac surgery patients are
      poorly documented and undernutrition, though readily modifiable, is an often overlooked
      condition during hospitalization. The investigators aimed to assess whether nutrition therapy
      (NT) could alter caloric deficit, morbidity, and mortality in patients scheduled for
      non-emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or aortic valve surgery.

      Methods: 351 patients undergoing either elective CABG or aortic valve surgery were studied.
      Patients receiving NT were enrolled from January 2013 until December 2014. A historical
      control group consisted of 142 matched patients who underwent either type of surgery. In all
      patients, the NRS 2002 and MUST score were used for evaluating the preoperative nutritional
      status. Resting energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry or calculated. A
      dietician assessed daily caloric intake during the entire hospitalization. Caloric deficits
      were calculated. According to a predefined flow-chart protocol, nutritional interventions
      were launched on different time points. Interventions varied from nutritional modifications
      to oral supplementation, tube feeding, and parenteral nutrition. The primary endpoint was to
      evaluate whether NT could limit caloric deficit (Intake to Need Deviation). A secondary
      endpoint addressed the potential effect of NT on morbidity and mortality. Patients were
      followed for one year after surgery.
