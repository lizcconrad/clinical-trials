      This is a two cohort, open-label, pilot study to describe the efficacy of administration
      timing of tocilizumab on CART19 (CTL019) associated cytokine release syndrome safety events
      in pediatric patients with CD19 expressing relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia with high versus low pre-infusion tumor burden following redirected autologous T
      cells transduced with the anti-CD19 lentiviral vector (CART19/CTL019).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of active protocol intervention is approximately 12-15 months from the screening
      visit. The protocol will require approximately 12-18 months to complete
      enrollment.Approximately 39 enrolled patients to reach at least 35 infused patients, with the
      ultimate goal of 15 patients in the high tumor burden cohort (Cohort A). Inclusion criteria
      are designed to include pediatric patients aged 1-24 years with CD19 expressing
      relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Tocilizumab will be given once
      to high disease burden patients, and then the patients will be managed for CRS as per the
      standard algorithm (including subsequent tocilizumab, if needed).

      Two cohorts are defined based upon pre-infusion high versus low tumor burden; with the high
      tumor burden cohort (high risk of severe CRS) to receive earlier administration of
      tocilizumab for CRS management and the low tumor burden cohort (low risk of severe CRS) to
      receive standard timing of tocilizumab for CRS

             might increase the risk of CNS toxicity.
