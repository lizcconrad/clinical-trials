  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to investigate the clinical and patient centred outcomes of people
      with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) attending a podiatry led integrated care pathway,
      utilising advice on diet, activity and smoking cessation. The podiatry clinic will be
      delivered from the Move More centre (NCSEM) and participants will be encouraged to access
      these facilities as part of their activity programme which will be agreed with the physical
      activity team. Primary and secondary outcomes will be clinical - claudication pain, distance
      walked at 3 and 6 months, blood pressure and lipid monitoring, weight management, reduced
      BMI, and the success of any smoking cessation. Quality of life and patient satisfaction with
      the programme will also be assessed.
