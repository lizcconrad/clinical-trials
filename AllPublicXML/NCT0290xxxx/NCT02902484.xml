      The study will perform a clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of nintedanib
      when combined with standard chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel) for metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. It will utilize advanced imaging correlates including dynamic contrast
      enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) which correlates with tumor grade and
      microvessel density.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical data suggest nintedanib inhibits primary tumor growth in in vivo xenograft models
      of pancreatic cancer, as well as inhibiting metastasis in pancreatic cancer models. This
      effect appears primarily due to nintedanib anti-angiogenic properties. The study will perform
      a clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of nintedanib when combined with
      standard chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel) for metastatic pancreatic cancer. It
      will utilize advanced imaging correlates including dynamic contrast enhanced Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) which correlates with tumor grade and microvessel density.

      For each patient, treatment will have two phases: nintedanib monotherapy for a two week
      period (Days 1-14) followed by combination phase of nintedanib plus chemotherapy (Cycle 2+).

    <description>A standard 3+3 phase 1 trial design will be used for Nintedanib monotherapy for a two week period (Days 1-14) followed by combination phase of nintedanib plus chemotherapy. Two dose levels of nintedanib will be explored 150 mg IBD and 200 mg BID. The combination phase will include gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, and nintedanib. Patient treatment will consist of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m &amp; nab-paclitaxel 120 mg/m. Treatment will be administered intravenously on days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days.</description>

             adenocarcinoma of the pancreas;

             within 14 days prior to registration; (Note: contraception in patients with
             reproductive capacity will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless
             surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or
