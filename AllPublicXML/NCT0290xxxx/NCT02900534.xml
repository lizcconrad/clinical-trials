      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based self-help
      intervention for older adults with prolonged grief symptoms after spousal bereavement or
      separation/divorce. The study design is a randomized trial with a waiting control condition
      of 12 weeks and a follow-up after 6 months. The investigators will test the following main
      hypotheses:

        1. The intervention group shows a significant decrease in grief symptoms, psychological
           distress, depression symptoms and embitterment, and a significant increase in life
           satisfaction, as well as session related outcomes from baseline to 12 weeks post
           intervention assessment.

        2. The effects in the intervention group are larger than the effects in the waiting control
           group.

        3. These effects are stable from the post measure at 12 weeks to the 6-month follow-up.
