    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of MLT, a novel antibiotic lock therapy that combines minocycline with edetate
      disodium in 25% ethanol solution.

      Approximately 700 subjects who have been diagnosed with CRBSI/CLABSI and who meet all
      necessary criteria for the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  MLT Arm: MLT + SOC intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy; or

        -  Control Arm (subjects randomized to the Control Arm will receive treatment based on the
           type and virulence of the infecting organism as documented by the Investigator prior to
           randomization)

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of MLT, a novel antibiotic lock therapy that combines minocycline with edetate
      disodium in 25% ethanol solution.

      Mino-Lok Therapy is being developed as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of
      catheter-related or central line associated bloodstream infection (CRBSI/CLABSI) in
      combination with appropriate systemic antibiotic(s), to preserve central venous access and to
      avoid the complications and morbidities associated with catheter removal and reinsertion.

      Approximately 700 subjects who have been diagnosed with CRBSI/CLABSI and who meet all
      necessary criteria for the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  MLT Arm: MLT + SOC intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy; or

        -  Control Arm (subjects randomized to the Control Arm will receive treatment based on the
           type and virulence of the infecting organism as documented by the Investigator prior to
           randomization):

             1. Saline-heparin (placebo) lock + SOC IV antibiotics. (NOTE: The saline lock arm is
                reserved for coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, or other organisms
                deemed to be of low virulence per the Investigator); or

             2. Antibiotic lock + SOC IV antibiotics. The antibiotic lock will be comprised of
                heparin and the same antibiotic delivered systemically. (NOTE: The antibiotic lock
                arm may include subjects with S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus,
                vancomycin intermediate S. aureus, or vancomycin-resistant S. aureus; vancomycin
                resistant enterococci; Candida, Pseudomonas; other Gram negative organisms; or
                other organisms deemed to be of high virulence per the Investigator). At least 50
                subjects will be randomized to this arm. In the event that more than 1 organism is
                isolated, the Investigator will specify which single antibiotic should be used for
                the lock.

      Randomization will be stratified by type of CVC, presence of neutropenia, and by type and
      virulence of the infecting organism.

      The first 5 doses of lock therapy should be administered within the first 7 days following
      randomization (Visit T1 through Visit T5), with the first 3 doses administered consecutively
      once daily (QD) for the first 3 days following randomization (Visit T1 through Visit T3). The
      next 2 doses should be administered within the next 4 days. Subsequent doses will occur once
      weekly over the following 2 weeks (Visit T6 and Visit T7 [EOT]) for a total of 7 doses.

      All lock treatments will be administered for a dwell time of 2 hours QD on each day of
      treatment.

      All efforts will be made to ensure that lock therapy is performed between antibiotic doses
      and is scheduled to maximize the time between the lock therapy and administration of IV
      antibiotics.

      The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects in the ITT Population who have Overall
      Success at TOC (Week 8). Success is defined as any subject who demonstrates eradication of
      the pathogen, stabilization or improvement in signs and symptoms of the infection, catheter
      salvage, AND survival at termination of the study. Analysis for the primary endpoint will
      compare the overall success rate between the MLT Arm and the Control Arm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Inpatient or outpatient with presence of indwelling CVC (eg, totally implantable port,
             tunneled or non-tunneled catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter, or
             hemodialysis catheter) that has been in place for 14 days before the onset of a
             bloodstream infection that has been documented within 96 hours prior to enrollment and
             demonstrates the protocol definition of CRBSI/CLABSI as defined below:

             a. For subjects with no mucosal barrier injury (MBI), neutropenia, graft versus host
             disease (GVHD) involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or diarrhea, ONE of the
             following must be satisfied: i. A recognized single pathogen cultured from 1 or more
             blood cultures that is not related to an infection at another site; OR ii. A common
             skin contaminant cultured from 2 or more blood cultures drawn on the same or
             consecutive calendar days; b. For all other subjects (ie, subjects with MBI,
             neutropenia, GVHD involving the GI tract, or diarrhea) ONE of the following must be
             satisfied: i. A recognized single pathogen cultured from 1 or more blood cultures that
             is not related to an infection at another site; OR ii. A common skin contaminant
             cultured from 2 or more blood cultures drawn from the same or consecutive calendar
             days; AND ONE of the following should be present:

               1. Paired positive quantitative blood cultures, whereby quantitative blood cultures
                  are drawn through the CVC and peripheral vein and the blood cultures from the CVC
                  reveal at least 3-fold greater number of colonies of the same organism (species
                  and antibiogram) than the peripherally drawn quantitative blood culture; OR

               2. A differential period of CVC culture versus peripheral blood culture time to
                  positivity of at least 2 hours;

          2. Subject must demonstrate at least ONE of the following clinical criteria (a or b):

             a. Temperature 38.0°C or 36.0°C, with 1 of the following clinical signs and symptoms
             that are attributed to the CRBSI/CLABSI and not thought to be related to an infection
             at another site: i. White blood cell count 12,000/mm3 or 4000/mm3, or with a
             differential count showing 10% band forms; ii. Tachycardia: Heart rate 100 bpm; iii.
             Tachypnea: Respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute; or iv. Hypotension: Systolic blood
             pressure 90 mmHg; OR b. Neutropenic (ie, absolute neutrophil count 500/mm3); NOTE: A
             neutropenic subject without the above signs/symptoms may be considered for the study
             if they have at least 1 positive blood culture, no other apparent source of their
             bacteremia, and satisfy the protocol definition of CRBSI/CLABSI.);

          3. Subjects who refuse to have their catheter removed or subjects for whom, in the
             Investigator's opinion, catheter retention for the duration of the study is reasonable
             or required;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with hypersensitivity or allergy to tetracycline antibiotics or edetate
             disodium;

          2. Subjects with septic shock that requires inotropic support or is unresponsive to fluid
             resuscitation;

          3. Subjects taking disulfiram or disulfiram-like drugs;

          4. Subjects with prosthetic cardiac valves;

          5. Subjects with the presence of a deep-seated intravascular source of infection (eg,
             endocarditis [as evidenced by vegetations on an echocardiogram or clinical suspicion]
             or septic thrombosis) or bacteremia with documented microbiological evidence of
             another source of infection (eg, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, skin infection, urinary
             tract infection, joint infection, or abdominal infection) known to be due to the same
             organism cultured from the blood;

          6. Subjects with polymicrobial CRBSI/CLABSI caused by pathogens that would require
             multiple antibiotics to be used for adequate lock therapy treatment. For example, a
             subject with MRSA and Escherichia coli requiring treatment with vancomycin and
             meropenem would be excluded from the study. A subject with S. aureus and S.
             epidermidis, where both are identified as pathogens and where both could be treated
             with vancomycin, would be eligible.

             NOTE: If 1 organism is isolated, the Investigator should decide which of the organisms
             are pathogens and require therapy;

          7. Subjects with the presence of a tunnel or catheter exit site infection or an infusion
             port pocket abscess as manifested by purulence at the exit site, or inflammation with
             erythema, or induration of 1 cm in diameter;

          8. Subjects with persistent bacteremia despite 72 hours of antibiotic therapy to which
             the infecting organism is susceptible;

          9. Subjects with short-term CVCs indwelling 14 days;

         10. Subjects with a central line-related mycobacterial infection; or

         11. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have a high probability of death
             within 3 months of randomization due to a disease process other than the CRBSI/CLABSI.
