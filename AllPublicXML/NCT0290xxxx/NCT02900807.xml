  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oro-tracheal intubation is performed daily in anesthesia and in the ICU. When a patient is
      intubated, the endotracheal tube must be inserted into the trachea to the right depth. If the
      tube is not deep Inserted enough there is a risk of accidental extubation and trauma to the
      vocal cords by the balloon. If the tube is inserted too far there is a risk of selective
      intubation into the right or left mainstem bronchus, which can lead to contralateral lung
      atelectasis and hypoxemia.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a correlation between the
      measurement of the airway of an adult population and criteria that would be easily accessible
      in daily clinical practice: the height of the patient and the size of their feet.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             at least until the carina

          -  patient size between between 150 cm and 195 cm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  significant deformity of the cervical spine to accurately measure the size of patients
             (kyphoscoliosis...)

          -  impossibility of reliably know the size of the patient

          -  history of pharyngo-laryngeal surgery resulting in a significant deformity or a loss
             of anatomical landmarks incompatible with reliable measurements between dental arches
