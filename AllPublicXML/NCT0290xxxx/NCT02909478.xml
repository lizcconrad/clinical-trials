  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addition of aprepitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist to a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and
      dexamethasone regimen was shown to be effective for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea
      and vomiting (CINV) with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). Little is known about the
      efficacy of aprepitant when used without dexamethasone. Dexamethasone is widely used to
      prevent both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy. However,
      multi-period use of dexamethasone could be associated with side effect, such as
      hyperglycemia, dyspepsia and insomnia. This randomized phase III trial studies antiemetic
      therapy with aprepitant and tropisetron to see how well they work compared to dexamethasone
      plus tropisetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with
      colorectal cancer receiving FOLFOX(oxaliplatin, leuvovorin and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy.
