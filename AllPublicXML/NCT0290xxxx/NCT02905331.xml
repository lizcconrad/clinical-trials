    <measure>Number of Participants who Achieve an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling. The participant's psoriasis is assessed as cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants who Achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity and area of involvement of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4 and area of involvement from 0 to 6. Total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. PASI 90 response is defined as at least a 90 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) Domain Scores on the 3 Domains With Items Common to the SIAQ PRE- (Week 0) and POST- (Week 0 and Week 12) Self-Injection Modules</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SIAQ includes 6 domains: feelings about injections, self-image, self confidence, pain and skin reactions during or after the injection, ease of use of the self injection device, and satisfaction with self-injection. Each domain is derived from one or multiple items. The subject rates each item of the SIAQ on a 5 or 6-point semantic Likert-type scale. Item scores will be transformed to obtain a score ranging from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience) for each item. The domain score is the mean of the item scores included in the domain. Domain scores will be calculated only if at least half of the domain items are completed. The PRE-self-injection module of the SIAQ includes items assessing domains of feelings about injections, self-confidence, and satisfaction with self-injection, while the POST-self-injection module of the SIAQ includes items assessing all 6 domains.</description>
