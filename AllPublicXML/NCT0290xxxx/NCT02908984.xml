      In part 1 of the project clinical efficacy of specific neck rehabilitation will be compared
      with standard primary health care among patients with cervicogenic headache and study whether
      fear avoidance beliefs and self-efficacy predict long term neck function and headache
      frequency superior to active range of neck movement. Part 2 will investigate whether patients
      with cervicogenic headache have changes in cerebral grey and white matter and in connectivity
      of the resting state state network, whether these are reversed after effective neck
      rehabilitation, and correlate to symptom severity and degree of disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project includes two parts:

      Part 1: With a longitudinal semicross-over randomized control design (n: 42) the
      investigators will compare the clinical efficacy of a 6 month specific neck rehabilitation
      with standard primary health care on patients with cervicogenic headache. The patients will
      either receive a specific neck rehabilitation program, or 6 month standard primary health
      care before they cross over to neck rehabilitation.

      Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics will be collected before each treatment session
      and 6 and 12 months later. Whether self-efficacy and fear avoidance beliefs predict 12 month
      self-reported neck function and headache frequency superior to the active range of neck
      movement will further be studied.

      Part 2: With a non-randomized comparative design the investigators will explore whether there
      are changes in the cerebral grey and white matter volume and structure measured by volumetric
      MRi and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and whether cerebral connectivity within the default
      mode network (DMN) are significantly different between patients with cervicogenic headache
      and healthy controls. Cerebral connectivity will be measured by resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI).
      Whether the anticipated cerebral changes in volume, structure and connectivity are reversed
      after specific neck rehabilitation will be tested, and whether these changes correlate to
      symptom severity and degree of disability

      Analyses of MRI scans and clinical characteristics will be performed before each treatment
      session and 6 months later. Baseline data will be compared with corresponding data from 25
      healthy controls not receiving any treatment.

      Those who are performing the analyses are blinded to group assignment.

      Statistics: Power calculations based on a previous studies and pilot data indicate that a
      number of 21 patients within each treatment group and 25 health controls would be sufficient
      to obtain a statistical power of 80% with a p-value of 5% for both part 1 and 2. Baseline and
      6 month data will be used for &quot;between group&quot; comparisons while 12 months data wil also be
      included for for &quot;within-group&quot; comparisons. Statistical predictor analyses will be performed
      by regression analyses.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A linear regression analysis will be performed where the voxel based volumetric measure of cerebral grey matter (VBM) is the dependent variable, and four week baseline headache intensity is independent variable. Baseline headache intensity is based on daily measures during the last 4 weeks and is reported by an electronic diary and numeric rating scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst imaginable pain. It is thus considered a continuous measure. Age and gender are included as covariates.</description>

In multivariate general linear models, the investigators will use DMN and other major cerebral Networks, identified by independent component analysis (ICA), as dependent variables and test whether there are differences in cerebral connectivity between patients and controls. All RS-fMRI analyses will be performed with the GIFT software http://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift/index.html. An ICA procedure in GIFT will be used to identify functional networks.
