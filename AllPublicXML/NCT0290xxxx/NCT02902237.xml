  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I clinical trial cancer patients suffering from solid tumors or lymphomas,
      recurring after and/or refractory against standard treatment are treated intravenously (iv)
      with increasing doses of tTF-NGR(tTF= truncated tissue factor; NGR=Asn-Gly-Arg). The
      objectives of this trial are to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of intravenously (iv) infused daily applications of tTF-NGR for
      5 days every 3 weeks in patients with cancer, who had obtained all standard treatment known
      for their disease entity prior to entry on study. Further objectives are to determine the
      perfusion and vascular volume fraction of measurable tumor lesions versus normal reference
      tissue before and after tTF-NGR application by MRI as a biological surrogate parameter for
      biological activity of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), tTF-NGR, and to obtain
      pharmacokinetic data.
