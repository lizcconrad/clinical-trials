  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify changes in salivary micro ribosomal nucleic acid
      (miRNA) expression that are predictive of symptom duration and severity following mild
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in children.

      The purpose of this study is to characterize alterations in miRNA expression in 100 children
      with mTBI compared with 50 age-and gender-matched controls and identify differentially
      expressed miRNAs in 100 children with mTBI that predict length and severity of concussive
      symptoms.

      Hypothesis: Specific miRNAs will be differentially regulated in children with mTBI and
      expression levels will be associated with medical and demographic characteristics such as
      age, gender, previous mTBI, symptom type, and mechanism of injury. The investigators predict
      that a set of miRNAs with differential expression in children with mTBI will be statistically
      associated with functional measures of mTBI symptoms as well as the duration of concussive
      symptoms.

      Rationale: Preliminary studies show that miRNA is altered in adults with varying degrees of
      TBI and that salivary miRNA is altered by disorders of the CNS. These studies indicate that
      serum-based miRNA may be used as an accurate biomarker for differentiating adults with and
      without TBI. Whether similar patterns can seen in the saliva of children following mTBI
      remains to be seen. Furthermore, the influence of confounding variables such as gender,
      mechanism of injury, and previous mTBIs on miRNA profiles has not been explored. The
      investigators propose to investigate these questions by examining salivary miRNA from 100
      children (ages five to twenty-one years) with a clinical diagnosis of mTBI and 50 age-and
      gender-matched controls, recruited from the Penn State Pediatric Concussion Clinic and the
      affiliated primary care clinic (35 Hope Drive). The investigators plan to prospectively
      follow 100 children with mTBI for eight weeks post-concussion, tracking symptoms with the
      Child Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-3) via phone interview at two time-points (4
      and 8 weeks after the date of initial mTBI). Expression of salivary miRNA taken at initial
      presentation will be compared against symptom duration (acute &lt; 4 weeks, versus chronic &gt; 4
      weeks) and severity (as measured numerically by SCAT-3 self-report). The investigators plan
      to identify a set of salivary miRNAs that can easily be used to predict clinical course for
      pediatric patients following a diagnosis of mTBI.
