      In an effort to further preserve residual acoustic hearing after cochlear implantation, it
      may be beneficial to incorporate anti-inflammatory agents into the electrode array for
      passive elution over a time course after implantation. This study aims to assess the ease and
      effectiveness of such an electrode design, and to assess the preliminary safety of use of
      such a device in the post-operative period. This study is a first-time-in-human study of the
      investigational device.

      In the first instance, the aim of the current investigation is to obtain first experience in
      use of a Combined Device in the adult clinical population, and to assess tools and techniques
      that may be considered in future clinical studies of similar devices.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Duration severe to profound hearing impairment in implanted ear of less than or equal
             to 30 years

          2. Post-lingual hearing impairment defined as onset of hearing loss at greater than two
             years of age

          3. Evidence of Pneumovax vaccination within three years of implantation date (for
             subjects to be implanted with the investigational device)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ossification or any other cochlear anomaly that might prevent complete insertion of
             the electrode array or increased risk of infection (i.e. dysplastic cochlea), as
             confirmed by medical examination and imaging including MRI

          2. Current use of grommets or evidence of tympanic membrane perforation

          3. Known allergic reaction to dexamethasone or similar medicine

          4. Diagnosis of Auditory Neuropathy

          5. Active middle ear infection or history of middle ear infection within past two years

          6. Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject regarding the possible benefits,
             risks, and limitations that are inherent to the surgical procedure and use of the
             prosthetic device

          7. Unwillingness or inability of the candidate to comply with all investigational
             requirements

          8. Additional disabilities that would prevent or restrict participation in the
             audiological and medical evaluations required of the clinical investigation
