  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the cardio-metabolic health effects of consuming
      almond nuts in place of habitual (usual) snack products in adults at moderate risk of
      developing cardiovascular disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tree nuts are recommended in the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      largely based on their LDL (low density lipoprotein) lowering effects, but the CVD risk
      reduction observed with tree nut consumption is greater than that predicted by their
      hypocholesterolemic effects alone. Other health benefits have also been noted by our group,
      such as moderation of postprandial lipemia , as well as by others such as modified
      postprandial glycemia , decreased blood pressure (BP) , improvement in oxidant status and
      weight loss. Robust evidence for the protective cardio-metabolic effects of nuts from the
      PREDIMED study has highlighted the association between nut consumption and decreased risk of
      cardiovascular events, obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, there
      is a paucity of evidence on the effects of almonds on vascular function in humans (BP and
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV)), although there is evidence that almonds promote
      nitric oxide (NO) release in animals consuming high-fat diets. Fundamental to vascular health
      is a well-functioning liver and there is increasing evidence to demonstrate that the
      accumulation of liver fat is a causative factor in the development of cardio-metabolic
      disorders. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now considered the hepatic
      manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (MetS); recent data has shown that it is linked to
      increased CVD risk via direct effects on vascular function (and EDV) independently of obesity
      and MetS . NAFLD is thought to affect 30% of the population in developed countries, and up to
      two-thirds of people with obesity and 50% of people with hyperlipidemia. Development of fatty
      liver, mainly attributable to obesity and elevated postprandial lipemia, is associated with
      increased inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and impaired EDV,
      and predicts risk of CVD and T2DM .

      Therefore, the long-term goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms underpinning
      how dietary change can drive favourable modification of CVD disease risk and to identify
      patterns in population food choices, specifically almond consumption, that tend to correlate
      with reduced CVD disease risk. The primary aim of this proposal is to investigate, in a
      randomised controlled, parallel arm, 6-wk dietary intervention (n=100) whether replacing
      snacks based on refined carbohydrates and poor in micronutrients/non-nutrient bioactives
      (NNB) with nutrient/NNB-dense, whole almond snacks can influence liver fat content (a key
      metabolic driver of insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction, and a hallmark of metabolic
      syndrome) and EDV (brachial FMD being an independent predictor of CVD events, in addition to
      related biomarkers of cardio-metabolic disease risk. The snacks products provide participants
      with 20% of their energy requirements via either whole almonds or as muffins/crackers that
      have been designed to mimic the average UK snack.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be male or female, aged between 30-70 years who regularly consume ≥2 snack
        products a day. A principal aim is to identify and recruit subjects with increased risk of
        CVD, in order to increase the sensitivity of the study subjects to dietary change. Subjects
        who are at above average risk for developing CVD (relative risk &gt;1.5) will be selected
        using a metabolic scoring system (scoring ≥2 points), adapted from the Framingham risk
        score system, as used previously by Chong et al. 2012. Subjects will give their own written
        informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-snack consumers (assessed as subjects consuming &lt;2 snack products per day by a
             specific FFQ (food frequency questionnaire) at screening, adapted from the short
             Health Survey for England (2007) Eating Habits Questionnaire).

          2. A reported history of myocardial infarction or cancer.

          3. Being fitted with a heart pacemaker.

          4. Presence of metal inside the body (implants, devices, shrapnel, metal particles in
             eyes from welding etc.). History of black-outs/epilepsy.

          5. Diabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose &gt;7 mmol/L).

          6. Chronic coronary, renal or bowel disease or history of cholestatic liver disease or
             pancreatitis.

          7. Presence of gastrointestinal disorder or use of a drug, which is likely to alter
             gastrointestinal motility or nutrient absorption.

          8. History of substance abuse or alcoholism (past history of alcohol intake &gt;60 units/men
             or 50 units/women).

          9. Currently pregnant, planning pregnancy, breastfeeding or having had a baby in the last
             12 months.

         10. Allergy or intolerance to nuts.

         11. Unwilling to follow the protocol and/or give informed consent.

         12. Weight change of &gt; 3 kg in preceding 2 months. BMI &lt;18 kg/m2 (underweight) or &gt;40
             kg/m2 (morbidly obese due to potential technical difficulties making FMD and
             ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurements).

         13. Current smokers or individuals who quit smoking within the last 6 months.

         14. Participation in other research trials involving dietary or drug intervention and/ or
             blood collection in the past 3 months.

         15. Unable or unwilling to comply with study protocol.

         16. The above criteria will be measured using the screening questionnaires and from
             physical (blood pressure, weight, height) and biochemical measurements (full lipid
             count, liver function test, full blood count, glucose and insulin) made during the
             screening visit. Participant eligibility will be assessed against the
             inclusion/exclusion criteria and 'fitness' to participate will be assessed and signed
             off by a clinician.
