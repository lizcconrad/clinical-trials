    <textblock>
      Substantial progress has been made in the treatment of cancer through the use of targeted
      therapies, but what works for one patient might not work for another patient. Certain drugs
      are now being developed that target specific molecules in the body that are believed to be
      part of the disease.

      Biomarkers are specific characteristics of the cancer that may help provide prognostic
      information (e.g. how well patients will be regardless of the treatments given) or help
      predict sensitivity or resistance to a specific treatment.

      The study will collect archival tumor samples (previously collected biopsy or surgical tumor
      samples) to provide biomarker data about a patient's cancer, which may help their physicians
      to identify which clinical trials of new drug treatments may be most appropriate for the
      patient in the future and may also guide the use of approved treatments that may potentially
      benefit the patient.

      Another goal of this study is to develop a province-wide registry of targeted gene sequencing
      testing results that will be made available to cancer researchers. Additional tumour tissue
      and blood samples collected from all study participants will also be stored in a biobank at
      the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research for future research.

      The study will also look at linking data from this study to other health care databases to
      further collect information about the health care the patients received, including medical
      tests, clinic visits, or procedures both before and after participating in this study. Having
      more information about patient health to relate to the DNA sequences may provide new insights
      into cancer and its treatment.

      A recent survey of clinical genetic testing laboratories for cancer diagnostics by the
      Molecular Oncology Advisory Committee for Cancer Care Ontario identified disparities in
      access and use patterns for next generation sequencing (NGS) across the province of Ontario.
      All fourteen responding laboratories indicated that NGS instruments were either currently
      being used for clinical testing, were in the validation stage, or that they were planning to
      purchase NGS instruments within the near future. Respondents were uncertain about what tests
      should be performed, how costing and reimbursement would be addressed by the provincial
      funding agency (e.g. individual tests vs. panels), and how to deal with informatics issues
      from NGS testing, such as storage, variant interpretation, and utilization over the long
      term.

      Given the increasing use of multi-gene somatic mutation testing in routine clinical cancer
      care (e.g. KRAS, NRAS, BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer, EGFR mutation and ALK
      translocation in non-small cell lung cancer, and BRAF, NRAS, and cKIT mutations in malignant
      melanoma), there is a need to expand the infrastructure for NGS panel testing in clinical
      laboratories. With a single payer provincial health care system, there is also an opportunity
      to develop a provincial-wide registry of NGS panel-based testing results and repository of
      genomically-characterized and clinically-annotated tumor tissues and blood samples to
      accelerate the development of additional &quot;omic&quot;-based tests for clinical use.

      This study will enroll patients with advanced, incurable solid tumors at selected Ontario
      hospitals receiving standard palliative treatment(s). Archival formalin-fixed paraffin
      embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue will be requested and undergo targeted panel sequencing. An
      additional FFPE tissue sample will be requested at the same time for future research
      purposes. Patients will also be asked to provide blood samples for future research. A
      selected number of genes will be annotated in a research report provided to their treating
      oncologist. In addition to the clinically reported variants, targeted NGS testing results for
      all tested genes will be captured in a clinical research database that can be accessed by the
      treating oncologist in a secure web-based portal.

      Following the reporting of targeted DNA sequencing results into the web-portal, remaining
      tumor DNA will be stored in the clinical testing laboratories. Blood samples collected at the
      time of consent and additional FFPE research blocks or slides collected for research will be
      transferred to a centralized biorepository maintained by the Ontario Tumour Bank (OTB) for
      more comprehensive analysis at the Princess Margaret (PM)-Ontario Institute for Cancer
      Research (OICR) Translational Genomics Laboratory (TGL). Blood will undergo standard germline
      DNA extraction and plasma processing for future circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and RNA (ctRNA)
      isolation at the PM-OICR TGL. Selected patient samples will be further characterized at the
      PM-OICR TGL for test development, additional sequencing, or discovery research.

      All patients will be asked to provide permission for data-sharing with other cancer
      researchers. The consent will also include a provision for review of patient health records
      through review of patient charts or administrative databases (i.e. Cancer Care Ontario New
      Drug Funding Program, Provincial Cancer Registry, etc.) to obtain addition information about
      time on drug treatments and survival.

Data from this study can be shared through two types of databases: open-access or controlled-access. An open-access database is publicly accessible and contains limited clinical information and analyses of samples. A controlled-access database contains more detailed clinical information, such as relevant past medical history and the results of prior and ongoing cancer treatments, and analyses of samples, but is only accessible to researchers who sign agreements defining how data may be used.
