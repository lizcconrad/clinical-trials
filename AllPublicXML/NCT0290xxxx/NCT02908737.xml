      The clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of recipient
      controlled Bass and Treble.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bass and Treble controls provide the CI recipient with access to the adjustment of low and
      high frequency sound balance, known as Bass and Treble respectively. The clinical study is
      designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of recipient controlled Bass and Treble.

      Subjects will have access to the Bass and Treble controls during a 4 week take-home period,
      and will complete questionnaires and diaries to provide descriptive data on the Bass and
      Treble adjustments made during take home use, and the success of these adjustments.

      Pre and post intervention speech test results will be used to evaluate the effect of access
      to Bass and Treble controls on speech perception. The post intervention questionnaire will
      provide information on the overall ratings of the Bass and Treble controls.

    <measure>Non-inferior speech perception with preferred Bass and Treble settings compared to the baseline Bass and Treble settings</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Co-primary endpoint #1: This endpoint is to test that speech perception scores in noise with preferred Bass and Treble settings are non-inferior to the baseline settings. Subjects will be tested at visit one with their own settings (Baseline), and then again after four weeks use of the Bass and Treble feature. The speech signal will arrive from zero degrees azimuth at a level of 65 dB SPL, the noise will also arrive from zero degrees azimuth, however the noise will adapt according to subject responses.
o-primary endpoint #2: This endpoint is to test that speech perception scores in quiet with preferred Bass and Treble settings are non-inferior to the baseline settings. Subjects will be tested at visit one with their own settings (Baseline), and then again after four weeks use of the Bass and Treble feature. The speech signal will arrive from zero degrees azimuth at a level of 50 dB SPL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-inferior sentence recognition in four-talker babble noise with Bass and Treble values set to the minimum (-6 Bass, - 6 Treble) compared to the baseline condition when the speech and noise are from the front</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoint #1: This endpoint is to test that speech perception scores in noise with Bass and Treble settings set to minimum (-6, -6) are non-inferior to the baseline settings. Subjects will be tested at visit one. The speech signal will arrive from zero degrees azimuth at a level of 65 dB SPL, the noise will also arrive from zero degrees azimuth, however the noise will adapt according to subject responses.</description>
