      This is a single blind, randomized, wait-list controlled, phase II exploratory pilot study
      utilizing an after-trial embedded mixed methods approach that will examine the efficacy of
      therapeutic yoga as a rehabilitation strategy for individuals with PD to improve balance and
      reduce fear of falling (FoF). Potential participants will have a FoF in order to enter the
      study. An after-trial embedded mixed methods design will be employed in this study and will
      include the collection of qualitative data to assist in the overall interpretation of the
      more heavily weighted quantitative trial data. Adding qualitative methods will serve as a
      post-hoc analysis capturing participant perceptions of the relationships between the yoga
      intervention and various outcomes. More specifically, the qualitative data will aide in
      explaining the link between the various yoga techniques and mechanisms that participants
      attribute to improved balance, reduced FoF, and other bio-psychosocial outcomes and
      experiences. Qualitative data will be collected using focus group interviews with
      participants in the yoga group at the end of the class in week 8.
