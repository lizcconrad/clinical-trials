  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid
      compound found in marijuana, on responses to emotional stimuli. Both preclinical and clinical
      studies indicate that CBD may act to reduce anxiety without excessive sedative side-effects.
      Thus the investigators hypothesize that CBD may reduce responses specifically to negative
      emotional and social stimuli, including pictures and emotional faces, without altering
      responses to positive stimuli. To examine this, the investigators will administer placebo,
      300mg, 600mg, and 900mg CBD to healthy normal adults in a double-blind within-subjects study.
      The investigators will measure subjective and subtle physical responses to positive and
      negative stimuli using measures that have been characterized with classic anxiety-reducing
      drugs and drugs of abuse. Further, the investigators will examine whether CBD-induced changes
      in these measures of emotional response relate to changes in actual behavior in a controlled
      social interaction. These results will allow the investigators to examine the potential
      usefulness of CBD as an anxiety-reducing drug, and suggest mechanisms by which CBD may reduce
      anxiety.

    <description>Using the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al. 1999), participants viewed standardized positive, negative and neutral pictures from the IAPS. The negative and positive images were matched on degree of valence and arousal. An Evaluative Space Grid rating followed each picture to collect subjective reactions.</description>

    <description>Participants completed the Dynamic Emotional Identification Task, or DEIT (Wardle et al. 2012) following CBD or placebo administration during which they identified emotional facial expressions presented on the screen. Participants completed this task once during each of the sessions.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-35 years of age.

          -  38 healthy volunteers (19 male, 19 female; age range 18-35 years)

          -  All participants recruited without regard to race, religion or ethnicity through
             posters, advertisements and word-of-mouth referrals.

          -  Candidates screened in accordance with our general screening protocol, approved by the
             IRB under Protocol #13681B, which includes a physical, EKG, psychiatric screening
             interview and detailed drug use history questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with a medical condition contraindicating study participation, as
             determined by the study site physician.

          -  Individuals regularly using any medications aside from hormonal contraception in
             women.

          -  Individuals with a current (active in the past year) DSM-IV Axis I mood, anxiety,
             eating, or substance dependence disorder or a lifetime history of a psychotic disorder
             or mania.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant in the next 3 months

          -  Participants reporting a known or suspected allergy to cannabinoids.

          -  The self-report questionnaires the investigators use require fluency in English, and
             have not been translated and validated in other languages, thus individuals with less
             than a high-school education or those not fluent in English were excluded, as lack of
             English familiarity at a high school level may compromise our ability to interpret
             their self-reports.

          -  Individuals with a BMI below 19 or above 30, as this would change dosing requirements.

          -  Individuals who report using marijuana &gt;100 times in their lifetime, to reduce
             variation in possible developed tolerance to CBD.
