  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypercalcemia, whether chronic or acute, exposes the patient to potentially serious
      complications (arrhythmias, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, ...). Prevention relies
      primarily on effective etiological necessary for taking matched load. Under the French
      reference center for rare disorders of calcium and phosphorus, the investigators looked for
      mutations in the coding sequence of the CYP24A1 gene (encoding the enzyme responsible for the
      breakdown of vitamin D), among patients with hypercalcemia without hyperparathyroidism with
      hypersensitivity to vitamin D. However, only 25% of these patients have a genetic anomaly
      suggesting the involvement of other genes (Molin et al. 2015). Recently our team, combined
      with Kaufmann et al. (2014 JCEM) validated the interest of the determination of metabolites
      of vitamin D by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS / MS), as biological
      pre-screening stage for patients with hypercalcemia.

      The objective of this project is to complement the molecular and biochemical studies of
      patients without mutation of the coding sequence of CYP24A1, in a gene candidate approach
      using massively parallel sequencing (MPS) which allows to study a panel of gene potentially
      involved in disorder of metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. Highlighted variations will be
      tested in silico, and if possible in vitro. The investigators will also use LC-MS / MS to
      evaluate in vivo the effects of these variations on the metabolism of vitamin D, to develop a
      genotype / phenotype correlation.

      The work carried out within the Genetics Department Caen University Hospital in collaboration
      with physicians of the rare disease reference center of the metabolism of calcium and
      phosphorus should identify new genetic mechanisms underlying hypercalcemia. At the time of
      development of personalized medicine, it will adapt the therapy in patients at risk for
      metabolic complications and / or kidney following administration of vitamin D and finally to
      offer genetic counseling.
