    <textblock>
      This study is designed for patients with a cancer of the oropharynx (tonsils or base of
      tongue) caused by the HPV virus. Traditional treatment involves surgery followed by six weeks
      of daily radiation therapy. This study investigates a less intense radiation treatment
      following surgery that uses half the dose of radiation given over two weeks rather than six
      weeks. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive the less intense treatment versus the
      traditional treatment by coin flip. Patients are twice as likely to receive the less intense
      treatment during randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that tumors in the oropharynx (tonsils or base of tongue) caused by
      the HPV virus are much more sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy. Standard treatment for
      HPV associated oropharynx tumor after surgery involves six weeks of radiation therapy and has
      many long term side effects and complications.

      Mayo Clinic recently piloted a study investigating whether patients with HPV-associated
      oropharynx tumors can receive less radiation and chemotherapy after surgery when compared
      with the standard treatment. The investigators current study will compare the new, shorter
      treatment course (2 weeks of treatment) with the standard course of treatment (six weeks).
      Patients will be randomized to either the less intense or standard treatment arm. Patients
      will be twice as likely to receive the less intense treatment during randomization.
