      sexual dysfunctions.

      Methods: This is a descriptive observational study involving 24 men with a mean age of 32.62
      (CI 28.65 to 36.60), with spinal cord injury, recruited in reference services in spinal cord
      injury Recife (PE). The subjects underwent neurological evaluation in accordance with the
      guidelines of the International Standards for Neurological Examination and Functional
      classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), the American Spinal Injury Association
      (ASIA), assessment of sexual function through the Erectile Function of International Index
      (IIEF) and answered a semi-structured form to identify therapeutic strategies used in sexual
      function. To collect information about medicinal plants, a search was made in the
      surroundings of public markets located in the Metropolitan Region of Recife (PE).

        The study involving 24 men with spinal cord injury, recruited in reference services in
        spinal cord injury Recife (PE). Aged between 18 and 60 years with a clinical diagnosis of
        traumatic spinal cord injury, injury time less than six months, heterosexual and sexually
        active. The study excluded patients who had erectile dysfunction attributed to endocrine or
        metabolic disease order, those who underwent surgery in the genital area, such as radical
        prostatectomy or penile implant and cognitive impairment.
