  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among the
      population of pregnant women receiving prenatal care and giving birth at the investigators'
      clinic. The further purposes are to identify the population at risk for vitamin D deficiency
      and to analyse whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with pregnancy complications.
