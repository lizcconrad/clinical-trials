  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is analyze the relationship between the density of visceral and
      subcutaneous fat and cellulite with the lumbar lordosis degree.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two types of abdominal fat: subcutaneous adipose tissue which is more superficial,
      lying above the abdominal muscle wall and visceral adipose tissue, corresponding to the
      intra-abdominal fat witch is more harmful to health.

      The accumulation of fat tissue differs between genders and age. Men have a huge propensity
      for developing central fat and women accumulate more subcutaneous fat tissue on the
      gluteal-femoral region. Some authors suggest that the accumulation of fat tissue increases
      with age.

      Several studies have concluded that there is a relationship between the abdominal fat storage
      and the degree of lumbar curvature.

      In addition, some authors also suggest that there is a relationship between the degree of
      lumbar lordosis and cellulite, which is related to circulatory changes.

      However these relationships are not yet clarified in the literature.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Lumbar Lordosis by analysing photos of the lateral right side of the participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>We used photogrammetry for this evaluation. We marked the anatomical points (T11, L1, S2 and Antero-superior Iliac Spine) with isopod balls. We took a picture of the right lateral view of the participant. Finally we used the SAPo software to measure free angles to determinate lumbar lordosis degree.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The height was measured by a tape-measure. We used the bioimpedance balance to determinate the body mass of the participants. BMI was calculated by using the body weight divided by height squared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perimeters measurements using a tape-measure at waist level and at trochanters level at the end of expiration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The perimeters measurements were done at the end of expiration, at waist level and at trochanters level. The waist-hip ratio was calculated by using the waist level perimeter divided by trochanters level perimeter and the waist-to-height ratio was calculated by using the waist level perimeter divided by height</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skinfold measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Subscapular, tricipital, chest, axillar, suprailiac, abdominal, thick skinfolds were performed three times in right hemibody, by caliper according to the model 7-site-skinfold Equation, by Jackson and Pollock. Siri equation was used to determinate the percentage of total body fat.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bioimpedance Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument was used to determine the weight, the percentage of body and abdominal fat, the visceral index and the percentage of body and abdominal lean mass.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ecograph</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>It was used for distinguishing of abdominal thickness fat (differentiate the fat in visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue) and in order to obtain the thickness of the subcutaneous adipose tissue at the points of maximum and minimum temperature on the gluteal region.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thermography</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of skin temperature in the gluteal region to obtain the average, the minimum and the maximum temperature on this area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cellulite Grading Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>6 Photos were taken in the posterior and lateral (right and left) views, 3 in relaxation and 3 in gluteal isometric contraction.</description>
