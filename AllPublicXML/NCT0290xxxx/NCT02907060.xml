  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pregnancy is considered ''prolonged'' from 41 weeks of gestation. Prolonged Pregnancies
      (PP) are associated with increased maternal morbidity: emergency caesarean, 3rd and 4th
      degree perineal lesions and postpartum haemorrhage. Foetuses are at increased risk of
      oligohydramnios, meconium-staining and Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) anomalies. Around 15% of all
      pregnancies are prolonged.

      A Cochrane review on induction of labour showed that a policy of labour induction at or
      beyond 41 weeks was associated with significantly fewer perinatal deaths. Thus the French
      College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stated, &quot;induction of labour can be proposed to
      patients between 41+0 and 41+6 weeks of gestation&quot;. In cases where labour is induced and
      cervix is unfavourable, cervical ripening is advised. Methods of cervical ripening include
      pharmacological (prostaglandins) and mechanical (Foley catheter or trans-cervical double
      balloon) methods. Those two methods were compared in the PROBAAT trial among women with term
      pregnancies (beyond 37+0). The rates of caesarean section with these two strategies were
      identical, however uterine hyper stimulation with FHR anomalies occurred less when cervical
      ripening was mechanical.

      Considering pharmacological cervical ripening is associated with more uterine hyper
      stimulation and more FHR anomalies, it may not be the most appropriate in cases of fragile
      foetuses that include cases of prolonged pregnancies. Considering prolonged pregnancies are
      associated with a risk of FHR anomalies and that cervical ripening with a pharmacological
      method is another factor which increases this risk: women with prolonged pregnancies could
      benefit from a more &quot;gentle&quot; cervical ripening.

      At present, no particular method is recommended in cases of cervical ripening and prolonged
      pregnancies. We hypothesise that, in cases of prolonged pregnancies, mechanical cervical
      ripening, with less uterine hyperstimulation and fewer FHR anomalies, could be more
      appropriate and could reduce the rate of caesarean section for suspicion of fetal distress.
