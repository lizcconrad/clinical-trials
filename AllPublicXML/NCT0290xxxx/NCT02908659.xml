  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ICU setting, a large number of medical devices are attached to patients, generating
      numerous alarm signals. Several studies have demonstrated that most of these alarms are not
      clinically relevant and tend to lower the attentiveness of healthcare professional and, in
      turn, lower patient safety.The aim of the study is to assess the relevance of respiratory
      rate alarm on a monitoring device in non-ventilated ICU patients.

      The investigator primary hypothesis is that this alarm is potentially useless. If this
      hypothesis is confirmed, a second interventional trial will be conducted on the impact of
      this alarm removal.
