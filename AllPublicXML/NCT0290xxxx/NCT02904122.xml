      In this study we want to compare a dental diagnose during face to face consultation vs remote
      consultation with telemedicine device.

    <textblock>
      Using Soprocare® camera, videos of patients' oral cavity are recorded and analysed remotely.
      200 patients have been included: 100 in Montpellier (France) and 100 in Kitakyushu (Japan).

      A classical face-to-face oral consultation is realized using ICDAS II classification. Then a
      student recorded 6 videos of patients' mouth: one video by sector, showing each face of
      molars and premolars in cario fluorescence mode of Soprocare® and one video of the maxillary
      and mandibular incisor-canine block in perio mode.

      In a third step, a remote dentist analysed videos and made a telediagnosis using the same
      classification. Dental hygiene and missing teeth are also noted in classical and tele
      diagnostic.

      The direct and the tele diagnostic are compared.
