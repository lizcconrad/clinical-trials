  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study shall determine whether XAPPORT - a mobile device app based on different
      guidelines, the summary of product characteristics of rivaroxaban, and clinical facts and
      practice - provides adequate guidance to physicians attending patients undergoing elective
      surgery, who have to interrupt treatment with rivaroxaban for surgery, in deciding how to
      approach the pre- and postoperative management of anticoagulation.

        At least 100 evaluable female or male inpatients shall be enrolled after having been
        discharged from hospital and provide data for analyses. Patients meeting all inclusion
        criteria and no exclusion criterion are suitable for this study. Enrolment will continue
        until at least 100 patients with complete data for analysis are available (i.e. 100
        evaluable patients). An adequate representation of every bleeding and thromboembolism risk
        category per indication in the matrix will be taken into account.
