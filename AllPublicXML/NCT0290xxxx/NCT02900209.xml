      The aim of this study is to determine responses of the immune system to the annual flu
      vaccination in people with COPD who experience frequent or infrequent exacerbations and
      healthy participants. We will collect blood and saliva immediately before and one month after
      flu vaccination at GP surgeries in the Autumn/Winter period. By measuring how quickly
      antibodies (that provide protection against infection) develop in the blood after vaccination
      we can provide important new information to help confirm whether those prone to COPD flare
      ups have weaker immune systems.

      Venous blood samples will be collected in K3EDTA and serum vacutainer tubes. Saliva samples
      will be obtained while participant is seated with the head tilted slightly forward and
      passively dribbling into a pre-weighed sterile tube (keeping orofacial movement to a
      minimum).

      Whole blood samples will be used on the day of collection and analysed before being
      appropriately disposed of on the same day. Blood samples will be centrifuged with plasma and
      serum frozen at -80c for later analysis. Saliva samples will also be centrifuged with
      supernatant frozen at -80c for later analysis.
