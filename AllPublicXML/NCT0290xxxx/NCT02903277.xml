  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The median age of onset of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase PC is about 60
      years. However CML affects all age groups including 18-25 year olds, called adult-young
      adolescents (AJA). In France, there is no record of CML and especially not for this
      particular population, only a European Register of CML in children up to 18 years has been
      set up under the coordination of Professor &quot;Frederic Millot&quot;, pediatrics, CHU Poitiers.
      Malignancies diagnosed in this population usually have characteristics, evolution,
      therapeutic strategies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a real therapeutic
      revolution with an overall survival very significantly augmented but at present only a
      minority of patients may one day consider a final judgment of treatment. AJA are the most
      exposed patients to the complications, the socio-economic repercussions, professional and
      personal of a very long-term treatment. But there is little data in the literature concerning
      this population. Two studies show that diagnosis of CML presents with poor prognostic factors
      (high skoal), the observed responses are poorer compared to older patients but it is
      accompanied difference in survival in all cases with a decline of about 70 mois. However,
      these studies have focused solely on the patients included in the study receiving optimized
      treatment is not the standard treatment at the time. It is clearly demonstrated that the
      inclusion in a study brings a benefit to the patient. However, the majority of AJA are not
      included in a study. The investigators therefore want to describe the AYA population of CML
      in France and compare the evolution of patients included or not in a protocol. The
      investigators also want to investigate specific issues of the age of these patients as the
      reproductive desire. Indeed, while it does not seem to be any risk of teratogenicity for men
      treated with ITK, this risk is clearly established for women and requires specific supported.
      Another important point is that of the quality of life. The state of physical and mental
      health and his feelings, physical activity and its limitations and well-being was assessed by
      the SF-3612 questionnaire. The results of this analysis were compared with those already
      obtained for the general population (not representative of Italian adults with cancer sample)
      and adjusted for sex, age, geographic region, marital status and education level . There
      seems to be young people and women who express a feeling more pejorative. This does not only
      covers the frequency of side effects but also on physical activity and well-being. the
      affected population will be noted that that is particularly involved in the social,
      professional and in the development of his personal life. The impact of treatment on quality
      of life must be considered under penalty of seeing the difficulties of compliance. But
      several studies have demonstrated the negative impact of poor adherence in response to
      treatments .

        All patients aged 18 to 30 years diagnosed with CML treated with a frontline ITK will be
        included in the observatory after collecting their non-opposition.

        In the retrospective part of the study, we will collect data from dead or lost to patients.
