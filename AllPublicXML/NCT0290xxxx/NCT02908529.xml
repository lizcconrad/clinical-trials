    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common and has major health implications but treatment
      options are limited. OSA patients show a marked reduction in upper airway (UA) dilator muscle
      activity at sleep onset and this phenomenon leads to increased collapsibility of UA compared
      to normal subjects. Until recently, the search for medicines to activate pharyngeal muscles
      in sleeping humans has been discouraging. However, exciting new animal research has shown
      that drugs with noradrenergic and antimuscarinic effects can restore pharyngeal muscle
      activity to waking levels. In this protocol the investigators will test the effect of
      atomoxetine (a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and oxybutynin (an antimuscarinic drug)
      administered together on OSA phenotype traits and OSA severity during sleep.

    <measure>Apnea hypopnea Index (AHI, events/hour of sleep)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 night</time_frame>
    <description>Based on previous studies the investigators anticipate that Atomoxetine and Oxybutynin will reduce AHI more effectively in subjects with moderate sleep apnea, mildly obese (BMI&lt;32), V0 passive &gt; 50% of Veupnea (ventilation during eupneic ventilatory drive), low muscle compensation (V0active - V0passive &lt;1 L/min)</description>

    <measure>Collapsibility of the upper airway: Passive and Active V0 (L/min) genioglossus muscle responsiveness to increased ventilatory drive (GG%max/cmH2O).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 night</time_frame>
    <description>For genioglossus muscle responsiveness, data will be expressed as change in electromyography of genioglossus (GG EMG) for cmH2O change in esophageal pressure. Passive V0: ventilation at a nasal pressure of 0 cmH2O when pharyngeal muscles are passive and the ventilatory drive (estimated via esophageal pressure) is low. Active V0: ventilation at a nasal pressure of 0 cmH2O when pharyngeal muscles are active</description>
