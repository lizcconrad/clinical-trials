  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PhytoSpherix (Phx) is an all-natural, edible polysaccharide extracted from sweet corn. This
      carbohydrate is the major muscle fuel for intense exercise and its stores are quite small
      such that one can run out of it during a single exercise bout. Therefore, Phx should provide
      significant exercise fuel if consumed during exercise. As a result its intake could enhance
      intense exercise performance by providing additional fuel. This experiment Will investigate
      the effects of 4 different dosages of Phx consumed throughout a prolonged exercise bout on
      carbohydrate and fat utilization as well as its oxidation rate and perception of effort
      during prolonged intense exercise in trained cyclists. Muscle and liver carbohydrate stores
      will be examined using a non-invasive ultrasound technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrate (CHO) is one of the main substrate oxidized during moderate-to-high intensity,
      endurance-type exercise. It's been shown that CHO feeding during exercise enhances endurance
      performance and capacity, attributed mainly to the facilitation of greater rates of exogenous
      CHO oxidation, prevention of hypoglycaemia and sparing of muscle glycogen. Previous studies
      based on supplementation of glucose during 180 min. of cycling exercise have reported a
      maximal rate of exogenous CHO oxidation to be about 1 g/min. Other studies have shown that
      CHO oxidation rates can reach peak values of about 1.3 g/min when a combination of fructose
      and glucose is ingested at a rate of 1.8 g/min. The limitation in uptake and oxidation of a
      single CHO source is attributed to its intestinal transporter saturation such that when
      multiple CHO source is used the uptake and oxidation rate is increased to a greater extent.
      Currently there is no information regarding Phx uptake or oxidation rate as a CHO source
      during exercise. Also, it is important to investigate whether Phx as a CHO sport drink can
      increase performance by sparing muscle and liver glycogen during exercise. Therefore, the
      objective of this experiment is to measure dose response of Phx oxidation rate during
      prolonged cycling exercise and its effect on muscle and liver glycogen levels.

    <measure>Noninvasive ultrasound measure of glycogen in Vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and liver</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min before and 10 min after the 150 min exercise session</time_frame>
    <description>Change in muscle and liver glycogen will be measured 10 min before and 10 min after exercise session. When muscle and liver glycogen content is high, the ultrasound image is hypoechoic (dark), and with glycogen depletion and water loss, the image is hyperchoic (brighter).Three ultrasound measurements at each site will be made by a trained technician using a 12 MHz linear transducer and a standard diagnostic high resolution GE LOGIQ-e ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). After calculating statistics on the color bar to determine the general brightness settings of the machine, images will be pre-processed and segmented to isolate the muscle area under analysis using a center crop within the muscle section 25 mm from the top muscle sheath. Comparing these results will help better understand the effect of supplementation of Phx at different rates on any changes in glycogen stores of muscle and liver.</description>

    <time_frame>At 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min from the beginning of the exercise session</time_frame>
    <description>every athlete will be asked at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min from the beginning of the exercise session to fill in a questionnaire to rate possible gastrointestinal (GI) problems including stomach problems, GI cramping, bloated feeling, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, headache, belching, vomiting, and urge to urinate and defecate. While cyclists are on the bike and continue their exercise, each question will be answered by simply ticking a box on the questionnaire that corresponds to the severity of the GI problem addressed. The items will be scored on a 10-point scale (1 not at all, 10 very, very much).</description>
