    <description>As soon as the two scleral flaps: deep and superficial -similar to deep sclerectomy are dissected, the phacoemulsification with PCIOL insertion is performed. After excision of the deep flap the descemets window and ostia of Schlemm canal are created, the microcatheter is placed in the canal and guided for 360 degrees within the canal. Surgeon observes the location of beacon tip through sclera and injects the Healon GV. Then a suture is tied to the distal tip and the microcatheter is withdrawn. As it appears at the other ostium of canal the microcatheter it separated from the suture.Then suture loop is tightened to tension the trabecular meshwork. The superficial flap is sutured watertight to prevent bleb formation</description>

    <description>This variant of canaloplasty spares conjunctival surface. First phacoemulsification and PCIOL placement is performed. The Schlemm's canal is reached through goniotomy through anterior chamber. Similarly microcatheter is inserted and viscodilatator applicated. The key difference, is that no tensioning suture is left after the catheter is withdrawn. phacoemulsification is performed.</description>

    <description>The dissected conjunctival flap is of minimal size. The scleral flaps are sized: superficial flap 3x1mm, and deep flap: 1x1 mm- with no removal of the deep flap. Afterwards phacoemulsification part is performed. The microcatheterization and viscodilatation are conducted as in the traditional procedure.The conjunctiva is closed with one suture or coagulation</description>
