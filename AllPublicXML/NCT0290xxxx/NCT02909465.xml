  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is the cornerstone of procedural sedation in emergency department but ketamine
      induced agitation has limited its usage by many physicians. As a solution, some propose using
      midazolam or haloperidol before ketamine injection. In this randomized double blind clinical
      trial, patients who are eligible for sedation by ketamine are allocated in 3 groups. In first
      group, the patients will receive 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, in second group 5 mg of haloperidol
      and in 3rd group a placebo five minutes before receiving the sedative dose of ketamine (1
      mg/kg). The patients are assessed for agitation during and after the procedure the
      clinician's satisfaction with sedation instrument is evaluated after the procedure.
