  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Captisol Enabled Melphalan, is a new formulation of the standard of care melphalan
      chemotherapy that in packaged in an inactive substance that is believed to help the
      chemotherapy be more stable (meaning that it doesn't lose its effect or need to be
      administered quickly after being mixed). It may also have fewer side effects such as problems
      with important levels of body electrolytes such as potassium, phosphorous and magnesium; and
      cause less kidney and heart damage] than standard formulation melphalan.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the investigators can achieve a certain level of
      Captisol Enabled Melphalan that would be best to use in treating Multiple Myeloma and AL
      Amyloidosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 and ≤ 75

          -  Patients must have either:

               -  Symptomatic multiple myeloma who have responded to prior induction or salvage
                  chemotherapy (i.e. chemosensitive disease): Patients who are receiving high-dose
                  melphalan and AHCT as part of their initial therapy require at least a partial
                  response (PR) as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group uniform
                  response criteria for MM.

        Patients who are receiving high-dose melphalan and AHCT as part of salvage therapy require
        at least a minor response to their last line of therapy to document chemosensitive disease.
        There is no limit on the number of prior regimens received by the patient.

        OR

          -  Light chain (AL) amyloidosis who may be newly diagnosed or previously treated

               -  Histologic and serologic findings, reviewed at MSKCC, confirming the diagnosis of
                  multiple myeloma or AL amyloidosis. Standard diagnostic criteria for multiple
                  myeloma will be used, as per the International Myeloma Foundation consensus
                  guidelines

               -  Patients must have at least 3 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg frozen.
