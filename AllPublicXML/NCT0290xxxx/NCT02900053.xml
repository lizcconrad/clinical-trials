  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure
      to a terrifying event or ordeal in which there was the potential for or actual occurrence of
      grave physical harm. Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal
      assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, and military combat. People with PTSD
      have persistent frightening thoughts and memories of their ordeal, may experience sleep
      problems, feel detached or numb, or be easily startled. Its lifetime prevalence is quite
      high, with 7-8% in various studies and 4% in french studies.

      The current PTSD treatment usually involves antidepressants as serotonin-specific reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapies, such as exposure therapy to
      trauma-linked elements (memories, feelings and thoughts) so the fear associated to the
      traumatic event can decrease. But the therapeutic response stays partial, even combining
      these treatments.

      To improve the PTSD treatment efficiency, innovative approaches are being explored like new
      drugs or cerebral stimulation. This project aims to assess the efficacy of a less known but
      promising therapeutic strategy for PTSD : the use of transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation
      (tDCS) to enhance the trauma-focused therapy results.
