    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, observational and multicentric study of safety of sulfamethoxazole +
      trimethoprim + guaifenesin (Balsamic Bactrim) in adult participants with acute bronchitis.
      Adult participants with acute bronchitis eligible for treatment with Balsamic Bactrim will be
      enrolled. Administration of Balsamic Bactrim will be according to physician's recommendation
      under local labeling.
