  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is a common skin disease characterized by itchy
      lesions. The prevalence of AD has increased over the past few decades, with 15-30% of
      children and 2-10% of adults being affected. The lesions of atopic dermatitis patients are
      very inflamed, with an increased number of inflammatory cells in the skin. The first line
      treatment for AD is steroids, which reduce inflammation in the skin. There are several ways
      to measure if the treatment is effective, including clinical and cellular. We are proposing
      that a controlled skin allergen challenge will be an effective way to measure the effect of
      steroid at a cellular level through the measurement of inflammatory cells in the late
      cutaneous response. This will be examined using a placebo-controlled trial.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial to evaluate if
      steroid can block the late cutaneous response after intradermal allergen challenge.
      Individuals with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that are develop late cutaneous
      response to intradermal allergen challenge will be eligible for enrollment. The study is
      divided into 2 parts.

      Part 1: Screening

      Subjects who meet all entry criteria will be screened with a medical history and physical
      examination. If they continue to meet entry criteria, their atopic status will be documented
      by skin testing against common airborne allergens (including cat, dust mite, grass, pollen)
      and an intradermal allergen challenge will be performed with a select allergen extract. Only
      subjects with a documented late cutaneous response to intradermal allergen challenge will be
      eligible for entry into Part 2 of the study.

      Part 2: Dosing and Follow-up

      Subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either prednisone or placebo treatment.
      Prednisone treatment will be 5 days of 0.75 mg/kg, 5 days of 0.5 mg/kg and 5 days of 0.25
      mg/kg. Before dosing and on Day 9 of dosing an intradermal allergen challenge will be
      performed and a skin biopsy of the late cutaneous response will be evaluated 24 hours after
      each intradermal allergen challenge. A sample of blood and skin from a lesion will be
      obtained before and on Day 9 of treatment. Patients will return for a follow up visit on Day
      16 for safety.
