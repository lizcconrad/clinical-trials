  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine to what extend a treatment with the iron compounds
      Iron Isomaltoside 1000 or Ferric Carboxymaltose is leading to hypophosphatemia and to study
      the potential clinical impact of hypophosphatemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggested that intravenous iron preparations for anemia treatment may have
      adverse effects on phosphorus regulation, as they may induce an increase in the phosphaturic
      hormone Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF-23) and a subsequent fall in plasma phosphorus
      levels.

      So far it is unknown if these effects are class- or substance-specific.

      This study will address the question whether among female participants with iron deficiency
      anemia the application of ferric-(III)-derisomaltose and ferric carboxymaltose will cause
      episodes of hypophosphatemia to same extend. The investigators will additionally compare the
      effects of the two iron preparations on other parameters of calcium-phosphate metabolism, and
      decipher potential consequences of hypophosphatemia by analysing cardiac function,
      immunological parameters and quality of life.

      In order to investigate these outcomes, 60 women with iron deficient anemia will be
      randomised to receive either ferric-(III)-derisomaltose or ferric carboxymaltose.

      The monocentric study will be conducted at Saarland University Medical Center. For each
      participating woman, the study comprises five visits to the study center during a period of
      five weeks.
