  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial Diseases are rare, progressive, multi-system, often-early fatal disorders
      affecting both children and adults. KH176 is a novel chemical entity currently under
      development for the treatment of inherited mitochondrial diseases, including MELAS
      (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes), MIDD
      (Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness), Leigh's Disease and LHON (Leber's Hereditary
      Optic Neuropathy). The current Proof of Concept study aims to explore the effects of
      treatment with KH176 for 4 weeks on clinical signs and symptoms and biomarkers of
      mitochondrial disease and to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of KH176 in patients
      with m.3242A&gt;G related mitochondrial disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centre, two-way
      cross-over trial. Twenty patients, with a confirmed mitochondrial DNA tRNALeu(UUR) m.3243A&gt;G
      mutation and with clinical signs of mitochondrial disease, will be randomized over 2 groups
      (active or placebo first). After a screening period and a training session, each group will
      have 2 dosing periods of 28 days, with a washout period of at least 28 days in between. On
      these occasions, patients will receive 100 mg KH176 twice daily (treatment A) or a matching
      placebo (treatment B) twice daily for 28 days.

      Clinical assessments will be performed once in a training session prior to baseline, at
      baseline and in week 4 post dosing during each treatment phase (A and B). Testing conditions
      and circumstances, with respect to timing of the assessments, hospitalization and meals, will
      be standardized for each assessement period. Furthermore, assessments of biomarkers for
      mitochondrial functioning, pharmacokinetics and specific safety assessments will be performed
      weekly.
