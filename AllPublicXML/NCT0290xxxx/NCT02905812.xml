      Methodology: Pilot randomized controlled trial with 1 intervention and 1 parallel standard
      care group to assess the feasibility and treatment effect of a multimodal integrative
      intervention for delirium prevention and associated detrimental effects.

      Duration: 2 years, two months. Study Center(s): Multi-center (2 sites) Aim: To assess
      feasibility and measures of effect of a multimodal intervention consisting of relaxation with
      guided imagery (RGI), and moderate pressure massage on physiological and psychological
      outcomes of critically ill patients.

      Objectives: a) assess clinical trial feasibility with pre-defined goals (enrollment,
      randomization, adherence, timing of intervention, workload), b) calculate estimates and
      variance of treatment effect across outcome measures, c) calculate confidence intervals (CI)
      of incidence proportions, means and standard deviation (SD) of outcome measures in study
      groups., d) explore underlying physiological mechanisms of efficacy Number of Subjects: 60
      participants per arm. Total: 120 participants Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Critical
      illness Inclusion criteria: a) Age over 18 years, b) ICDSC:0-3. Exclusion Criteria: Patients:
      a) with expected ICU LOS&lt; 72 hours, b) with acute neurological illness/ trauma, persistent
      sedation or coma, c) with current history of severe mental health problems and dementia, as
      per history and psychiatrist assessment, c) with hearing impairment or conditions not
      permitting use of headphones, e) on neuro-muscular blockers, f) with substance/ alcohol
      withdrawal, g) enrolled in trials of sedatives, antipsychotics.

      Intervention: REPOSE intervention (a multimodal relaxation intervention) It includes: a)
      relaxation and guided imagery (RGI) (40 min, headphones), b) a brief moderate pressure
      massage session (massage: 15 min). RGI involves: a) guided relaxation, b) a structured guided
      imagery script and c) music for 15 min (Mozart piano sonata KV283, G major (2 3) II Andante).
      Duration of administration: Up to 5 days while participants still in the ICU.

      Reference therapy: Standard care plus placebo to maintain blinding. Statistical Methodology:
      Outcomes will be analyzed longitudinally over 5 days by logistic regression model based on
      generalized estimating equations (GEE) with AR(1) correlation structure. Confidence intervals
      will be presented with estimated effects. Primary analysis will be based on all available
      data utilizing data from all assessments.

      1. Background 1.1 Risk/Benefits Risks: Anticipated risks from participation in this study
           are minimal. This and similar relaxation interventions have been tested before and no
           inconveniences or side-effects have been reported. Adverse events, irrespective of
           causal relationship, will be collected for all participants Benefits: The direct
           benefits to participants include the opportunity to receive a relaxation intervention
           that has been shown helpful in terms of decreasing pain ratings and anxiety and
           improving quality of sleep in similar settings before.

           1.2 Treatment/ Dose Rationale The evidence-based multimodal intervention (duration:
           55min) is based on a literature review and the recommendations of the American Holistic
           Nurses Association (31) and a successful pilot (10). Multimodal integrative
           interventions demonstrate superior efficacy compared to uni-dimensional ones (32). It
           includes: a) relaxation and guided imagery (RGI) (40 min, headphones), b) a brief
           moderate pressure massage session (massage: 15 min). RGI involves: a) guided relaxation,
           b) a structured guided imagery script and c) music for 15 min (Mozart piano sonata
           KV283, G major (2 3) II Andante). Moderate pressure, low velocity (4 N, 1-5cm/s) massage
           consists of squeezing movements with wide area of contact will be applied in the
           following order and then reverse order, for 2-3 min at each site: over trapezius
           muscles, lateral arms, forearms, feet and then over the temple and forehead area.
           Moderate pressure massage is used as it elicits parasympathetic activation, as opposed
           to light pressure (33). The intervention will be administered once daily (10-11am) for
           up to 5 consecutive days by trained intervention nurses not involved in patient care.
           The intervention will start as soon as possible after ICU admission, and will be
           terminated upon a patient's transfer or discharge from the ICU. Selection of timing of
           the interventions is based on the daily schedule of the unit, to minimize interference
           with routine care. A 5-day intervention was selected as most patients develop delirium
           within the first 5 days of ICU admission (28).

           1.3 Trial Conduct This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol approved
           by the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board (HREB), and according to Good
           Clinical Practice standards. No deviation from the protocol will be implemented without
           the prior review and approval of the HREB.

           Participants: Adult critically ill patients meeting the eligibility criteria.

           Recruitment: Consecutive patients admitted into 2 academic teaching ICUs with Intensive
           Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC): 0-3 will be screened by research assistants
           for admission to the protocol and will be recruited by a research nurse.

        2. Trial Objectives Goal: to assess clinical trial feasibility and treatment effect
           estimates of a multimodal intervention incorporating RGI and moderate pressure massage
           for prevention of ICU delirium and for improvement of physiological and psychological
           outcomes in critical illness.

        3. Trial Design 3.1 Primary Study Endpoints/Secondary Endpoints Please see below 3.2 Study
           Design/Type Design: Pilot feasibility, randomized, controlled, double-blinded
           (clinicians, outcome assessors) trial with 2 parallel groups (intervention and standard
           care group). Accounting for major risk factors of delirium (28), stratified
           randomization according to age (&lt;65, ≥65) and surgical or injury trauma (Trauma/
           Surgery, non-Trauma/ surgery) with blocking and 1:1 allocation to assure balance in
           numbers per group will be employed.

           3.3 Randomization Allocation-sequence generation and concealment: Participants will be
           randomly assigned to either control or intervention (1:1 allocation) as per a computer
           generated randomization schedule, generated by the Epidemiology Coordinating Research
           Centre (EPICORE), University of Alberta (UoA), stratified by site, age (&lt;65, ≥65), and
           presence of surgical or injury trauma using permuted blocks of random sizes.

           Blinding: Clinicians, outcome assessors, research assistants, nurses and laboratory
           technicians will be blinded to group allocation. Participants cannot be blinded. A sham
           intervention with silent headphones to mask the audio component, and then presence of an
           intervention nurse at the bedside with drawn curtains will be used. Blood samples will
           be in code-identified vials to maintain blinding. Assessments regarding outcomes will be
           conducted by assessors blinded to treatment allocation.

           3.4 Duration Duration of participation: The total duration of participation is
           approximately 14 weeks. Duration of participating will vary depending on the length of a
           patients' stay in the ICU and hospital. Time points include: baseline measurements,
           follow-up while in the ICU for up to 5 days, follow up 48-96 h after ICU discharge,
           follow-up 3 months after hospital discharge.

           Participant timeline: Based on patient population characteristics in the participating
           ICUs, eligibility rate is expected to be 40% and the recruitment rate 30% of eligible
           patients, yielding an estimated recruitment period 6-8 months.

           3.5 Discontinuation Intervention discontinuation: For a given participant the
           intervention may be discontinued (or a session may be cancelled) if a participant or
           legal surrogate so wishes. If a participant skips one or more sessions but remains in
           the protocol, the remaining sessions will be administered as per study protocol. Reasons
           for missed sessions will be reported and analyzed.

           Sessions may be cancelled or the intervention discontinued in case of reported harms,
           such as abrupt worsening of delirium and/ or patient anxiety. Adverse events,
           irrespective of possibility of causal relationship, will be collected for all
           participants after recruitment and for as long as a participant remains in the protocol,
           and will be reported.

        4. Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects 4.1 Inclusion Criteria Please see below 4.2
           Exclusion Criteria Please see below

      4.3 Subject Withdrawal

      Criteria for subject withdrawal:

      1) Active withdrawal by the study participant. 2) Loss of contact. 3) Evidence of
      trial-related harms. 4) Assessment that premature termination of the trial related
      intervention is indicated, e.g. because of a belatedly identified violation of the criteria
      for inclusion and/or exclusion that imply the premature termination of the therapy 5)
      Non-compliance of the subject which indicates the premature termination of the trial related
      intervention.

        1. Documentation of the clinical trial will continue even if the trial related therapy is
           terminated prematurely, expect if the participants specifies that documentation should
           be terminated.

        2. Subjects will be replaced if the duration of participation was less than 24 hrs.

        3. Adverse events will be observed, irrespective of a withdrawal of a trial.

           4.4 Medication No restrictions with regard to concomitant medication. Standard care will
           be continued concomitantly for all participants as per unit protocols and clinicians'
           decisions. Pain will be treated when present and sedatives will be titrated to maintain
           a lightly sedated state (RASS= -1- -3).

           4.5 Monitoring for subject compliance To assure adherence, interventions will be
           administered by trained research nurses, not involved in participants' care, who will be
           randomly audited by the TSC to ensure protocol compliance, especially with respect to
           touch massage procedure. Deviation from the intervention will be recorded in detail by
           intervention nurses immediately after each intervention session.

           5 Assessment of Safety 5.1 Safety Parameters Any physiological/ behavioral alteration
           during interventions will be recorded and analysed. Adverse events, irrespective of
           causal relationship, will be collected for all participants.

           5.2 Adverse Event Reporting &amp; Follow-up The time period for adverse event (AE) and
           serious AE (SAE) reporting will begin with each beginning of intervention, continue
           throughout the intervention, and end 30 min after the end of each intervention session.
           All adverse events occurring during the reporting period will be recorded on an AE/SAE
           Report Form, and categorized as to the degree of expectedness, relatedness and
           severity..

           The clinical course of each adverse event will be followed until resolution,
           stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation
           is not the cause.

           6 Statistical Plan 6.1 Statistical Methods Statistical methods: Demographic/ clinical
           characteristics of patients and all outcomes will be presented by treatment group using
           descriptive statistics— mean (SD), median (IQR) or proportion. Outcomes will be analyzed
           longitudinally over 5 days by logistic regression model based on generalized estimating
           equations (GEE) with AR(1) correlation structure. ANCOVA, t-test or Mann-Whitney test,
           as appropriate, will be conducted for the continuous outcomes that are not longitudinal.
           Chi-square or exact test, as appropriate, will be used for categorical outcomes.
           Confidence intervals will be presented with estimated effects. \A significance level
           alpha=0.05 will be employed.

           6.2 Subject Population(s) for Analysis 60 subjects per arm/ 60 subjects per site. Total
           120 subjects.

           Sampling of consecutive ICU patients according to inclusion/ exclusion criteria. This
           pilot is not powered to determine a difference in a primary outcome, since the aim is to
           assess estimates of effect. Participants will include 120 patients (60 per site) to
           attain high probability of equivalence at baseline, precision of estimates, to be able
           to employ appropriate repeated measurement procedures for estimation of effects and to
           accrue experience for the larger clinical trial (34).

           6.3 Termination Criteria

             1. Alterations in current clinical practice that make trial procedures no longer
                feasible.

             2. Reaching a positive or negative statistical end point earlier than anticipated.

             3. Clear statistical evidence of superiority of treatment that raises ethical concerns
                with regard to randomization to a control group.

             4. Evidence that the risks outweigh the potential benefits of the trial.+ 6.4
                Accountability Procedure Reasons for missing data will be analyzed. Primary
                analysis will be based on all available data. A sensitivity analysis will be
                conducted based on inverse probability weighted GEE (IPWGEE) (36).

           6.5 Deviation Reporting To account for noncompliance, protocol deviations and missing
           outcomes intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be employed. Additionally, per protocol
           analysis will also be employed.

           7 Direct Access to Source Data/Documentation The investigators and participating
           institutions will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, Institutional review (IHREB)
           and regulatory inspections by providing direct access to source data/documentation.

           8 Quality Control and Quality Assurance This pilot will be supervised by an independent
           trial steering committee (TSC). Study personnel will be trained for standardized
           processes. Clinical data will be retrieved from the quality-controlled clinical
           information system of the units. Detailed electronic data collection forms with embedded
           quality controls will be used. Day-to-day running of the trial will be overseen by a
           trial monitoring group (TMG).

           9 Ethical Considerations This study will be conducted according to Canadian and
           international standards of Good Clinical Practice for all studies. Applicable government
           regulations and University of Alberta research policies and procedures will also be
           followed. This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the University of
           Alberta HREB for formal approval to conduct the study. The decision of the HREB
           concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator.
