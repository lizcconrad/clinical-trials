  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the number of patients having either permanent or temporary stomas placed is
      increasing each year. Yet, patients with ostomy pouches often struggle with predicting when
      stool output will occur and how to plan around dynamic changes in intestinal activity.
      Ostom-I provides a real-time assessment of the volume in the ostomy bag, it does not predict
      when and how fast such output will occur. In this pilot study the investigators aim to gather
      normative AbStats and Ostom-I data in participants with an ostomy to improve prediction of
      stool output.

      Aim 1: To gather normative AbStats and Ostom-I data in subjects with an ostomy to improve
      prediction of stool output.

      Aim 2: Correlate the data from both wearable biosensors and test the predictive validity of
      AbStats in determining ostomy bag filling as measured by Ostom-I.

      The Ostom-I device is a wireless, wearable biosensor that is approved by the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA). The device is discrete, lightweight, and can be applied to an
      ostomy pouch in order to monitor the filling of the bag. It uses Bluetooth technology to send
      a signal to the participants smartphone and alerts the user when the ostomy bag is filling up
      so they can decide if and when to empty them.

      The second wearable biosensor is called &quot;AbStats&quot; and it provides an objective, real-time
      marker of intestinal motility, and is also FDA approved. It allows for continuous and
      automated analysis of intestinal vibrations.

      The study team will recruit consecutive inpatients undergoing colorectal surgery with ostomy
      placement. The surgeon will apply AbStats and Ostom-I upon completion of the operation.
      Device recordings will continue until discharge, or until the participant opts to remove the
      sensors as requested.

      Members of the research team who are blinded to sensor results will monitor and record
      clinical information including age, gender, race, and body mass index (BMI). The study team
      will also record the type of ostomy, indications for surgery, type of surgery performed,
      surgical approach, and any documented operative complications. The study team will
      prospectively monitor daily clinical assessments, including symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and
      abdominal pain), flatus, bowel movements, diet, ambulation, medication use, and length of
      hospitalization.

      All patients will receive a standardized feeding protocol as part of usual care. For
      Cedars-Sinai, the standard protocol initiates clear liquids on postoperative day (POD) zero,
      and rapid progression to a regular diet by the morning of POD#1 in patients without early
      clinical evidence of post-operative ileus (POI). Patients intolerant of the feeding protocol,
      including nausea or vomiting precluding advancement, or those that develop significant
      abdominal distension, will discontinue the feeding protocol. The surgical teams that make the
      decisions regarding diet changes will be blinded to device data.
