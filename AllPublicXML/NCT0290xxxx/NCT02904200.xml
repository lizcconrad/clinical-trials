      The primary objective of this investigation is to evaluate changes on Peri-Wound skin from
      baseline to termination when using two different wound dressings

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate:

      •pain before and during and after dressing removal from baseline to termination

      A prospective randomized clinical investigation will be conducted at two sites in Sweden.

      Male or female, 18 years or older with following wound types:

        -  traumatic, surgical or dehisced wounds,

        -  venous leg ulcer or pressure ulcer will be included into the clinical investigation.

           32 evaluated subjects (i:e 16 subjects per arm) will be followed during maximum three
           weeks. The treatment arm (either silicon adhesive dressing or acrylic adhesive
           dressing). Patients will be randomized using optimal allocation (minimization) balancing
           for the following baseline variables type of skin (normal/dry/flaky/oily/moist) and age.
           Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either silicon adhesive dressing or
           acrylic adhesive dressing in a ratio of 1:1 provided.
