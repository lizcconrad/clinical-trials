  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this multi-site clinical trial are to pilot test weekly SMS sent to
      parents/caregivers of infants to improve feeding practices and decrease excessive weight gain
      in infants who are participants of the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program in Puerto
      Rico and Hawaii. The intervention consists of weekly SMS for 4 months to reinforce the
      feeding messages provided by WIC.

      The goals of this multi-site clinical trial are to pilot test weekly SMS sent to
      parents/caregivers of infants to improve feeding practices and decrease excessive weight gain
      in infants who are participants of the WIC program in two distinct locations, Puerto Rico and
      Hawaii; to assess acceptability and practicality of the intervention; and to assess
      acceptability of collecting blood spots in future studies. The investigators will recruit a
      convenience sample of parent/caregivers of infants 0-2 months participating in the WIC
      program in Puerto Rico and Hawaii to send weekly SMS for 4 months. The weekly messages will
      focus on reinforcing the breastfeeding messages provided by WIC, preventing overfeeding,
      delaying introduction of solid foods, and delaying and reducing baby juice consumption, which
      are key issues in low-income populations. Participants will complete validated questionnaires
      and anthropometry before and after the trial and results will be compared to the control
      group (no messages). Participants will also answer short questions by SMS at different points
      and an interview at the end of the trial to assess the SMS. The investigators will assess how
      many participants agree to collect blood spots in their infants in future studies.

    <description>When recruiting participants, the investigators will ask if they agree to participate in collecting a blood spot sample in their infants. This will be done through a short questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the intervention - from short SMS</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>At different points of the trial, participants will be asked to answer short quantitative and qualitative questions sent by SMS about acceptability of the intervention. All answers to these questions will be summed and assign as &quot;acceptable&quot; if answers were positive 80% or greater of the times.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the intervention - from exit interview</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a short semi-structured qualitative interview at the end of the trial to provide the opportunity to make open comments about the acceptability of the SMS. Answers from the interviews will be loaded into a qualitative data analysis software. Recordings will be transcribed verbatim for content analysis and the team will develop a coding scheme. Similar codes will be grouped into broader concepts to facilitate the analysis. Analysis will involve identifying recurring themes based.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant food frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes 52 food items with a brief description on how these were prepared and/or their source (e.g., raw, canned, etc.). It also includes different portion sizes and information on supplements use. Using frequency of intake of each food and amount reported for each food, a total amount of each food per day will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General infant feeding practices</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes questions about type of infant feeding (breast or bottle-feeding), type of milk used, age of stopping breastfeeding (exclusive and partial), age of introduction of juices and solid foods, use of the bottle to sleep baby, methods of feeding babies (i.e. using spoon, adding solids to bottle, etc).</description>

    <description>The intervention will focus on reinforcing the WIC breastfeeding messages, preventing overfeeding (i.e. using spoon to feed baby, not adding baby food or cereal to bottle, not placing their babies to sleep with a bottle, feeding their babies without distractions, etc), delaying introduction of solid foods, and delaying and reducing baby juice consumption. Constructs in the transtheoretical model such as self-efficacy and decisional balance will be used to address key determinants of behavior change to ensure relevance to the audience, and will target individuals both at the earlier and later stages of change. The messages are written at a grade 5 level in Spanish (PR site) and English (Hawaii site) and will be sent on different days and times of the week.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive weekly SMS about general infant's health issues, such as placing the infant on his/her back to sleep, the timeline for immunizations, the proper use of car seats, asthma and other respiratory conditions common among small children, and other health information relevant to infants. The investigators will follow the same protocol (schedule, length, language, etc.) as for the intervention messages.</description>
