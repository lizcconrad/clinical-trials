  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the proposed research are to determine whether repeated exposure to a low sodium
      food will result in reduced preference for salt in that food among children; and to determine
      whether such reductions in preference are related to dietary intake of salt, taste receptor
      genotype, and anthropometric and physiological measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a within- and between-subjects randomized controlled trial on children consuming
      either a low sodium or a higher sodium cereal over a 2-month period to determine if repeated
      exposure to the low sodium cereal is effective for reducing preference for salt in that food.
      Children will be genotyped for markers related to salty taste, dietary intake will be
      recorded, and anthropometric and physiological measures will be collected to determine if an
      association between any observed shift in salt preference and these measures exists.

    <time_frame>Baseline (time 0) and at end of intervention (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in most preferred level of salt taste . Concentration of salt most preferred will be measured by using a forced-choice psychophysical methods two times; immediately before the intervention (time 0) and then immediately after the intervention (12 weeks).</description>

    <description>Blood pressure will be measured twice by using an automatic blood pressure machine with pediatric cuff. Blood pressure will be measured at baseline (time 0) and then immediately after the intervention (12 weeks) to examine associations between this measure and cereal preference.</description>
