  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza vaccine is recommended as routine care for all individuals who are at least 6
      months of age and older. Recently, questions about vaccine safety and concerns for side
      effects have increased, contributing to both influenza vaccine hesitancy and refusal. In an
      effort to educate patients, public health entities and physicians give informational handouts
      in various forms.

      However, recent publications have found that pro-vaccine messages can have paradoxical
      effects on vaccine intentions, therefore further studies on vaccine related public health
      communication is needed. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of
      pro-vaccine messages of local data, pro-vaccine messages of national data, and no educational
      message on patient's receipt of the influenza vaccine. These results will help to understand
      the relationship between patient education and the intent to vaccinate and receipt of the
      influenza vaccine as well as to optimize educational information given to patients regarding
      the influenza vaccine.
