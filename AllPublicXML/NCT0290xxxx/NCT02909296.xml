    <textblock>
      The pancreatic surgery causing some pancreatic collections. And in a number of case, this
      surgery can require a surgical resumption, a percutaneous drainage or an endoscopic drainage.

      The endoscopic care of the treatment of pancreatic collections post-surgery is not yet
      standardized.

      After failure of the medical treatment, the drainage of collections by echo-endoscopy was
      described.

      There are not much series on this specific subject. Only 2 series contain more than 20
      patients with 31 patients for the most important.

      The timing and the technical choice of the endoscopic treatment as well as the long-term
      follow-up are not clear.

      The purpose of this study is to estimate the success and the complications of the endoscopic
      drainage by echo-endoscopy according to the techniques of drainage and the timing of the
      endoscopic treatment.

      The not estimated long-term follow-up will be also considered.
