  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensorineural complications of stapes surgery are rare but potentially serious. Imaging is
      usually performed to identify an underlying cause, such as excessive intravestibular
      penetration of the prosthesis or pneumolabyrinth suggesting perilymphatic fistula.

      Unfortunately, there is very little data in an unselected series of uneventful patients.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the depth of prosthesis penetration within the vestibule
      and the rate of pneumolabyrinth the day or the day after the procedure by performing a Cone
      Beam CT (CBCT) of the temporal bone in a cohort of unselected patients, and to correlate
      imaging findings to clinical outcome. This prospective monocentric study is conducted in a
      tertiary referral medical center. A CBCT is performed in 80 consecutive patients having
      undergone stapes surgery for otosclerosis, the day or the day after the procedure.
      Penetration length and location of the prosthesis within the vestibule, as well as presence
      or absence of a pneumolabyrinth are recorded, and compared to clinical data (vertigo,
      nystagmus, hearing measurement).
