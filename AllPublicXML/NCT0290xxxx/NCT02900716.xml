  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, antitumor activity and preliminary pharmacokinetics of
      an investigational drug product, DTRMWXHS-12, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      or other B-cell lymphomas. DTRMWXHS-12 will be evaluated as a single agent, and in
      combination.

      This study will be conducted in two parts: phase Ia and Ib. Both parts will explore
      escalating doses of DTRMWXHS-12. The phase Ia study will evaluate DTRMWXHS-12 monotherapy.
      The phase Ib study will evaluate DTRMWXHS-12 combinations.
