  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel gum health formulation, when
      used in an intra-oral device or on a toothbrush, for teeth whitening and clinical
      improvements in periodontal diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over half of the American population suffers from some form of periodontal disease, while
      millions of Americans are electing for teeth whitening procedures every year. The study is
      designed to assess the efficacy of a novel gum health formulation on teeth whitening in the
      context of gingival inflammation. Further, the study aims to assess the efficacy of the novel
      gum health formulation as an adjunct to the current standard of care in the treatment of
      gingivitis and periodontitis, depending on the severity of disease. As the dental
      professional community is whitening teeth in an environment of gingival inflammation, a
      single product that whitens teeth and controls inflammation is a novel treatment approach and
      highly desirable among patients and consumers.
