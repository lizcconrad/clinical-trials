  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess and compare the esthetic outcome and clinical performance of anterior maxillary all
      ceramic implant single crowns based either on prefabricated zirconia abutment veneered with
      pressed ceramics or on a CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing)
      CARES® abutment veneered with hand build-up technique.

      Participants will be recruited from the patient population who has previously received dental
      implant treatment, received a provisional restoration and met the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria according to the study protocol. After final impression, patients will be randomised
      into Group A (prefabricated anatomic abutments ): one-piece screw retained single crown using
      a press technique (fluorapatite glass-ceramic, e.max ZirPress) with cut-back technique or
      Group B (CAD/CAM CARES® abutments): one- piece screw retained single crown with a hand
      build-up technique (fluorapatite veneering ceramic, e.max Ceram). One week after final
      restoration (base line visit) the primary and secondary outcome parameters will be assessed.
      The patients will be followed up to 5 years after final restoration.
