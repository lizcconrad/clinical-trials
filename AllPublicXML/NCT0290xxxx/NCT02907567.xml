    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of
      two doses of CT1812 in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of oral CT1812, administered for 28 days. This trial may include up
      to 8 qualified investigator sites in Australia.

      Screening procedures will occur up to 42 days. Eligible subjects will randomized at the
      clinic on Day 1 and receive the first dose of study drug. Dosing for 28 days thereafter
      off-site and a total of 5 clinic visits over the treatment period for safety and lab
      assessments. Then a 7 day post-treatment completion follow-up visit (Day 35) and End of Study
      for last safety assessments (Day 49).

             acceptable method of contraception.

          3. Previous decline in cognition for more than six months.

          4. Neuroimaging (MRI) obtained within the previous 6 months or during screening,
             consistent with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

          5. MMSE 18-26 inclusive.

          6. No active depression and a Geriatric Depression Score (GDS) of &lt; 6.

             provide written informed consent to participate.

         10. Concurrent use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine must be stable for 90
