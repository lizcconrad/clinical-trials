  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim and objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Non- surgical
      periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota and biochemical parameters in patients with
      chronic kidney disease and chronic periodontitis.

      The study was designed as a Non randomized prospective, interventional clinical trial. The
      sample size for the study was 40 individuals aged between 35-75 years, equally divided into
      two groups.

      Group I--- Patients with Chronic kidney disease and chronic periodontitis (Test) Group II---
      Patients with Chronic periodontitis only (Controls) At baseline both the groups were analyzed
      for clinical, microbiological and also biochemical parameters and underwent Non-surgical
      Periodontal treatment (i.e. scaling and root planning). All parameters were reassessed again
      after 3 months.

      A total of 20 patients attending the outpatient wing of Hyderabad Kidney Centre ,
      Malakpet,Hyderabad who were diagnosed clinically with Chronic Kidney disease and willing to
      participate in the study were included in the study.

      Another 20 patients attending the outpatient wing of Department of periodontics, Panineeya
      Mahavidyalaya Institute of Dental Sciences &amp; Hospital, Hyderabad, diagnosed with Chronic
      Periodontitis and willing to participate in the study were taken.

      Biochemical parameters considered included -serum creatin &amp; urinary albumin: creatin ratio.

      Microbiological assay was done by Polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) i.e., pooled plaque
      samples were taken from both predialysis as well as chronic periodontitis patients.

    <description>Microbiological assay was done by PCR test i.e., pooled plaque samples were taken from both predialysis as well as chronic periodontitis patients at baseline and 3 months after scaling and root planing.
Supragingival plaque was removed carefully with a sterile scaler to prevent the contamination of the samples.Sample was harvested from the same site with a sterile Gracey curet 5-6 with one single vertical stroke on the root surface.
Biochemical assay was done by Modified Jaffe's reaction to assess the levels of Serum Creatinine and urine samples were taken to assess the Albumin:Creatinine ratio</description>

    <description>20 patients with renal insufficiency chronic and chronic periodontitis underwent scaling and root planing.
