      The aim of this study is to assess the suitability and user-friendliness of an information
      leaflet for parents on management of fever and febrile illness in children. The purpose of
      the leaflet is to provide evidence-based information for parents regarding fever and febrile
      illness in children. The potential benefit of the leaflet is empowerment parents to take
      responsibility for monitoring their child's illness, thereby enabling parents to take
      effective and informed action when required.

      The investigators hypothesise that provision of a user friendly information leaflet for
      parents increases knowledge and provides decision support to guide parents fever management.

      This study will investigate the ability of an information leaflet to increase parental
      knowledge regarding the management of fever and febrile illness in children. Three leaflets
      were designed. Stakeholders were consulted to select the most appropriate leaflet prior to
      the beginning of the trial. One leaflet will be used in the trial.

      A prospective, multi-centre, randomized, two-parallel arm, controlled trial with blinded
      outcome ascertainment will be conducted. Three information leaflets were designed based on a
      previous survey with parents in Ireland. One leaflet was selected for use as the intervention
      following consultation with stakeholders.

      The Primary Objective of the project is to quantify if reading and understanding a leaflet on
      fever and febrile illness management increases parental knowledge on the subject.
