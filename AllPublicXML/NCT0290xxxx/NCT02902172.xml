      Women who have the diagnosis of hypertension (pre-pregnancy and pregnancy induced) and
      deliver an infant via vaginal delivery will be placed into two groups in the postpartum
      period. One group will receive Ibuprofen for pain control and the other group will be given
      Tylenol. Blood pressures during the postpartum period will then be collected and compared in
      order to see if NSAIDs use increases blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who have a vaginal delivery and have the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy
      will be randomized to either Ibuprofen use or acetaminophen use during the postpartum period.
      Standard blood pressure monitoring in the postpartum period will be followed to help
      determine if there is a significant rise in the women who use NSAIDS in the postpartum period
      versus those that use acetaminophen.

      Groups will be divided into women with chronic hypertension, women with chronic hypertension
      with superimposed preeclampsia, women with preeclampsia without severe features, women with
      preeclampsia with severe features, women with gestational hypertension without severe range
      blood pressures, and women with gestational hypertension with severe range blood pressures.

      Recruitment will last 36 months. Patients will be monitored during their postpartum stay
      (typical 2 days) and then again at 1 week and 6 weeks (standard practice of care) with blood
      pressure measurements. An additional 12 months will be needed for data analysis and
      publication.
