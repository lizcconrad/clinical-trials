  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence is a significant potential source of morbidity after radical
      prostatectomy or radiation therapy for prostate cancer. At present, artificial urinary
      sphincter remains the preferred therapeutic option. However, this technique is not free from
      complications. In an attempt to avoid such complications, male sling has been suggested for
      use in patients with mild degrees of stress incontinence.

      This is a prospective collection of pre-defined parameters on the treatment of male stress
      urinary incontinence by male sling or artificial urinary sphincter.

      This registry includes:

        1. Pre-operative urodynamic assessment, cystoscopy and other preoperative clinical
           parameters (i.e. age, body mass index, bladder neck contracture treated, urgency,
           24h-PW, cystometry and pressure/flow, repositioning test)

        2. Description of surgical technique

        3. Continence is evaluated 3 months after surgery, avoiding the potential confounding
           impact of the initial tissue edema (Cure was defined as no pad use, and all other cases
           were defined as failures)

        4. Evaluation of long term functional outcome (efficacy, late complications and the loss of
           continence)

      Surgery is performed with:

      Device: Virtue® Device: Advance® and AdvanceXP® Device: Artificial urinary sphincter AMS-800®
      Device: Invance® Male Incontinence Sling

      A prospective functional follow-up, with 24h-Pad Weight test and ICIQ-UI SF, is carried out
      3-monthly for the first year and 6-monthly thereafter, parallel to the oncological follow-up.
