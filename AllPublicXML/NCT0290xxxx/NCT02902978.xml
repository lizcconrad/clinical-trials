      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of E6130 in Japanese healthy adult male participants.

      This study consists of 8 cohorts, Cohorts 1 to 8. Cohorts 1 to 7 are designed as a
      single-center, single dose, placebo-controlled, randomized, ascending dose, double-blind
      study. Cohort 8 is designed as a single-center, single dose, randomized, open-label,
      two-group, two-period crossover study. Cohort 8 will be initiated after Cohorts 1 to 7 are
      completed.
