    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a new paracetamol 1000
      mg/codeine 30 mg formulation vs. the marketed reference Co-efferalgan® 500 mg/30 mg in terms
      of rate and extent of absorption, when administered as single oral dose (one tablet of the
      new A.C.R.A.F. formulation vs. two tablets of the reference formulation Co-efferalgan®) to
      healthy male and female volunteers, under fasting conditions, in two consecutive study
      periods.
