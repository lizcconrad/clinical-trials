    <textblock>
      Neck pain is a complex biopsychosocial disorder often precipitated or aggravated by neck
      movements or sustained neck postures. The onset and course of this pain is influenced by
      environmental and personal factors.Many studies report that participants preferred self-care
      measures for the management of neck pain and they sought professional help only when those
      measures fail

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide causing an enormous impact on
      individuals and their families, communities and healthcare systems.While neck pain can be
      severely disabling and costly, treatment options have shown moderate evidence of
      effectiveness. No previous study has used foam roller in patients with neck pain. In
      addition, it has been suggested that neurodynamic interventions provide a peripheral
      stimulus, reducing the pressure existing within the nerve, improving blood flow, axonal
      transport and nerve conduction. It was hypothesized that a self-administered intervention
      focused on myofascial release of main muscles related to neck pain and upper-limb active
      neurodynamics could reduce the presence of active trigger points and pain, improving
      functionality and active mobility.

    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline pain at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. It measures the degree of interference of pain with various aspects of life, including mobility and social activities (reactive pain) and pain severity (sensory pain).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline functionality at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functionality will be assessed by the Neck Outcome Score. This is a reliable, valid and responsive measure of self-reported disability for patients with neck pain. It includes 34 items divided into 5 subscales: Mobility, symptoms, sleep disturbance, every day activity and pain and participation in everyday life.</description>

    <measure>Cervical range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline cervical range of motion at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical range of motion will be measured using a cervical goniometer. Subjects perform neck movements to the fullest extent of their mobility of flexion, extension, right and left lateroflexion, and right and left rotation.</description>

    <description>Patients allocated to the experimental group were included in a self-administered program combining self-myofascial release using foam rollers and roller balls and active upper limb neurodynamic exercises. It consisted of three sessions of 50-60 minutes per week for 4 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>Those patients allocated to the control group received a booklet with information regarding neck pain and explaining basic exercises for active mobilization and stretching with pictures and a short text.</description>

    <description>One session was a session supervised by a physical therapist in the Faculty of Health Sciences. This session took place in groups of three or four people. All participants had to follow the physiotherapist instructions about the correct way to do the exercises with the foam roller or ball and nerve mobilizations of upper limbs.The other two weekly sessions were performed at home, following the instructions given by the physiotherapist in session.</description>
