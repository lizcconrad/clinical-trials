  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the value of a dedicated knowledge questionnaire, filled by the patient prior
      consultation. Indeed, it could allow to target specific shortcomings of patients first, and
      help the cardiologist to prioritize the other therapeutic education, targeting specifically
      the information provided.

      The main objective is to study the impact of a pre-consultation questionnaire on the
      knowledge gained by the patient on anticoagulant treatment at the exit of cardiology
      consultation.

      The assumption is that this questionnaire would help educate patients about their
      shortcomings and educate cardiologists lack of knowledge of his patient.

      The secondary objectives are :

        -  Target specific areas in which patients have the greatest lack of information

        -  Assess the impact of educational level on information

        -  Assess the impact of age on information

        -  Evaluate the satisfaction of the information delivered

        -  Assess patient anxiety vis-Ã -vis their treatment

        -  Evaluate the failure rate of the questionnaire to know the number of patients refusing
           to participate in the study
