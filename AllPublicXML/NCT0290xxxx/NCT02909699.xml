  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how resveratrol (phenol present in red grapes, wine and peanuts)
      can improve heart muscle function and ability of arteries to dilate in response to an
      increase in blood flow in adults 65 years of age and older. Additionally, investigators will
      look at how resveratrol can improve functioning of cells (cellular house-keeping) which can
      be related to cardiovascular function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related declines in left ventricular function and endothelium-dependent vasodilation
      increase the risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease and premature death in older adults.
      Structural changes to the arterial wall and cardiac muscle are indicated as a cause and
      appear to be induced by age-related oxidative stress and inflammation and reduced levels of
      autophagy, the cellular &quot;house-keeping system&quot;. Pre-clinical studies indicate that
      resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol present mostly in grapes and red wine, may improve left
      ventricular cardiac muscle and endothelial vasodilator function. Although, RSV has been shown
      to induce autophagy and improve CV function in animals, evidence for its effects on the CV
      system in humans is lacking, and there is a need for clinical trials to better understand the
      effects of RSV on CV function in humans. Because older adults are most likely to have
      impairments in the central and peripheral CV systems, they represent an ideal population to
      test the effects of RSV on CV function. Therefore, the central hypothesis is that RSV
      supplementation will improve age-related left ventricular cardiac muscle function and
      arterial vasodilation in older adults (&gt; 65 years). The participants will undergo 90 days of
      RSV treatment (n=12) (1,000mg/day), or (n=12) (1,500mg/day) or placebo (n=12). Before and
      after the intervention, investigators will non-invasively investigate left ventricular and
      arterial vasodilator function. Additionally, investigators will examine cardiac muscle damage
      and inflammatory biomarkers in blood and autophagy and endothelial function protein levels
      and in skeletal muscle to better understand molecular mechanisms that may underlie the
      hypothesized beneficial effects of RSV on cardiovascular health in older adults.

    <description>Speckle tracking analyses will be performed using advanced quantification software version. Short axis and long axis images will be automatically divided into six segments. Automated tracking of myocardial speckles will be reviewed and manually adjusted as minimally as possible. The tracking quality of each segment will be visually evaluated and if tracking is felt to be inaccurate, strain analysis of that segment will not be included. Speckle tracking analysis provides peak and time to peak measures of circumferential, radial and longitudinal strain and strain rate in 18 left ventricle (LV) segments.</description>
