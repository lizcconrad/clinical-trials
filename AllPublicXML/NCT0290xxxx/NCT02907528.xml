      Objective: To clinically evaluate mandibular furcation treated with Beta tricalcium
      phosphate/hydroxyapatite (βTCP/HA) isolated or combined with enamel matrix derivative (EMD +
      βTCP/HA) and EMD alone.

      Material and Methods: 39 patients, presenting at least one mandibular class II furcation
      defect, probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥ 4 mm and bleeding on probing, were included. The defects
      were assigned to the βTCP/HA group 1 (n = 13); open-flap debridement (OFD) + βTCP/HA filling;
      βTCP/HA + EMD group 2 (n = 13); OFD + βTCP/HA + EMD filling; and EMD group 3 (n = 13) OFD +
      EMD filling. Plaque (PI) and gingival index (GI), PPD, relative gingival margin position
      (RGMP), vertical and horizontal attachment level (RVCAL and RHCAL), and furcation diagnosis
      were evaluated at baseline, 6 and 12 months.

      Although enamel matrix derivative (EMD) has been used to promote periodontal regeneration,
      little is known of its effect on the microbiome. Therefore, this investigation aimed to
      identify the changes in periodontal microbiome following treatment with EMD using a
      deep-sequencing approach. Thirty-nine patients having mandibular class II buccal furcation
      defects were randomized to beta-tricalcium-phosphate/hydroxyapatite graft (BONE group),
      EMD+BONE or EMD alone. Plaque was collected from furcation defects at baseline, 3 and 6
      months post-treatment. Bacterial DNA was analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length
      polymorphism (t-RFLP) and 16S pyrotag sequencing. 169,000 classifiable sequences were
      compared to HOMD using the QIIME and PhyloToAST pipelines. Statistical comparisons were made
      using parametric tests. At baseline, a total of 422 species were identified from the 39
      defects, belonging to Fusobacterium, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Filifactor and Parvimonas.
      All three regenerative procedures predictably altered the disease-associated microbiome, with
      a restitution of health-compatible species. However, EMD and BONE+EMD groups demonstrated
      more long-term reductions in higher number of species than in BONE group (p&lt;0.05), especially
      disease-associated species e.g. Selenomonas noxia, F.alocis, and Fusobacterium. EMD may
      promote periodontal regeneration by predictably altering a dysbiotic subgingival microbiome,
      decreasing pathogen richness and increasing commensal abundance.

    <description>Subgingival microbial plaque samples will be collected at baseline and at the 3 and 6-month re-evaluation visits. Bacterial samples will be removed from the paper points by adding 200µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and vortexing for 1 minute. The paper points were then removed, and DNA isolated using a Qiagen MiniAmp kit (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Multiplexed bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing will be performed using the Titanium platform. High quality, classifiable sequences (quality score &gt;25, &gt;200bp length) were clustered into species-level operational taxonomic units (s-OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity and assigned a taxonomic identity by alignment to the HOMD database using the Blastn algorithm. Primary outcome measures will be changes in diversity, equitability and levels of pathogens.</description>
