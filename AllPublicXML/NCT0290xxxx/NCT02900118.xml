  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancers are among the cancers that metastasize the most to the skeleton. The
      appearance of bone metastasis, whether they are initials or during a relapse, is a turning
      point of the disease, due to the additional morbidity they imply (pain, pathologic fractures,
      hypercalcaemia, neurological compression, etc.). A specific treatment of these metastasis is
      often undertaken, usually a chemotherapy or hormone therapy. It is important to evaluate the
      efficacy of this treatment in order to know whether to continue or change it depending on the
      response observed. But there is no consensus at this time on paraclinical examinations
      enabling this monitoring. Also, if some criteria for assessing bone metastasis in imaging and
      nuclear medicine (MDA, PERCIST, EORTC) have been published in the literature, none is
      formally validated and evaluation in routine practice remains subjective.

      The main objective of our study is to determine if the PET-CT and the whole-body MRI are in
      agreement on the status of bone metastasis (stability, progression, partial response,
      complete response).

      The oncologist includes patients responding to criteria and not opposing the collection of
      their data. He submits a request for whole-body MRI and PET-CT to the Medical Imaging and
      Nuclear Medicine departments of the Oscar Lambret Centre. If the patient has benefited within
      the previous 15 days of any of these examinations, it is not performed again : it will serve
      as an initial examination. Following these examinations, the oncologist completes the reading
      grid. A clinical examination and a questioning with the main stages of the disease is
      performed and data are reported in the dedicated sheet. A prescription of tumor markers and
      of bone remodeling is performed (in the absence of recent results), and the results are
      reported on the same sheet.

      After 3 cycles (of intravenous chemotherapy) or 3 months of hormone therapy, the oncologist
      submits a new request for whole-body MRI and PET-CT. The MRI and PET-CT should conclude to a
      status : progression, stability, partial response, complete response. The reading grid is
      completed again. MDA criteria (MRI and PET-CT), PERCIST and EORTC (PET-CT only) are
      determined. Target lesions (1 to 3) are defined for each examination and a measure of the ADC
      and the SUV is performed for each lesion on the initial and follow-up examinations.

      After these examinations, the patient is reviewed by his oncologist for a new clinical
      examination, the announcement of the status of bone metastasis and the possible adaptation of
      the treatment.
