  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 16-week single-blind, split-face, randomized study. Each patient served as their own
      control, receiving onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA randomized to either the left or
      right side of the face. Patients received intradermal BTXA injections at week 0 and
      intramuscular BTXA injections at week 2. The objective is to examine the effectiveness of
      intradermal botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) injection in improving skin texture and midface
      lift while reducing pore size and sebum production, as well as investigate the differences in
      effectiveness between onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA using intradermal and
      intramuscular injection methods.

    <measure>Blinded Assessment: Overall Change in Facial Wrinkles From Baseline to Week 2 as Assessed by a Numeric Rating Scale Based on Pre- and Post-treatment Photographs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blinded assessments of overall change in facial wrinkles from baseline to week 2 based on pre and post treatment photographs. Measured on a 5 point scale which is a static assessment of wrinkle severity. 0=wrinkles absent (minimum), 1=shallow but visible wrinkles, 2=fine lines slight indentation, 3=clear indentation 0-1mm deep, 4=moderate indentation 1-2mm deep, 5=deep indentation &gt;2mm deep (maximum). A higher value = a worse outcome (more severe wrinkles). Includes 9 subscales measured on the same scale described above. Subscales measure wrinkle severity in the left and right forehead region, left and right cheek region, left and right crow's feet region, left and right upper lip region, and glabellar region. All scores were computed by averaging subscale ratings.</description>

    <description>The first treatment group received onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) on the right side of their face and abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport) on the left side of their face. Baseline treatment at Week 0 included the intradermal injection of onabotulinumtoxinA on one side of the face and abobotulinumtoxinA on the other. Patients were treated at Week 2 with traditional intramuscular injections consisting of onabotulinumtoxinA on the same side of their face as at Week 0 and abobotulinumtoxinA on the other side. Patients were treated based on individual need, and thus the treatment volumes were not controlled or standardized.</description>

        <title>Blinded Assessment: Overall Change in Facial Wrinkles From Baseline to Week 2 as Assessed by a Numeric Rating Scale Based on Pre- and Post-treatment Photographs</title>
        <description>Blinded assessments of overall change in facial wrinkles from baseline to week 2 based on pre and post treatment photographs. Measured on a 5 point scale which is a static assessment of wrinkle severity. 0=wrinkles absent (minimum), 1=shallow but visible wrinkles, 2=fine lines slight indentation, 3=clear indentation 0-1mm deep, 4=moderate indentation 1-2mm deep, 5=deep indentation &gt;2mm deep (maximum). A higher value = a worse outcome (more severe wrinkles). Includes 9 subscales measured on the same scale described above. Subscales measure wrinkle severity in the left and right forehead region, left and right cheek region, left and right crow's feet region, left and right upper lip region, and glabellar region. All scores were computed by averaging subscale ratings.</description>

Baseline treatment at Week 0 included the intradermal injection of onabotulinumtoxinA on one side of the face and abobotulinumtoxinA on the other. Patients were treated at Week 2 with traditional intramuscular injections consisting of onabotulinumtoxinA on the same side of their face as at Week 0 and abobotulinumtoxinA on the other side. Patients were treated based on individual need, and thus the treatment volumes were not controlled or standardized.
onabotulinumtoxinA: OnabotulinumtoxinA was approved by the FDA in 2002. Intervention administered by study nurse. Administered in a regular 1 cm2 grid across the cheeks and forehead.
abobotulinumtoxinA: AbobotulinumtoxinA was approved by the FDA in 2009. Intervention administered by study nurse. Administered in a regular 1 cm2 grid across the cheeks and forehead.</description>
