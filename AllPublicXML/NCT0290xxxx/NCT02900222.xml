  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation is
      safe in adult patients with communicating hydrocephalus and risk factors for complications
      from the standard surgical treatment. It may also help determine whether the endoscopic
      choroid plexus coagulation is effective in treating your communicating hydrocephalus. The
      Investigators hope that this research will allow us to place fewer shunts in patients with
      conditions similar to yours, avoiding complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient will undergo endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation surgery to treat communicating
      hydrocephalus. Before the surgery, the patient will be examined by his/her doctors and
      undergo brain MRI, as part of routine clinical care. For the surgery, he/she will be placed
      under general anesthesia. An incision will be made on the top of the head, and a small
      opening made in the bone of the skull. An endoscope, which is a long, thin metal tube with an
      attached video camera and channels for passing small instruments, will be passed into the
      ventricles of the brain through the opening. After the surgeon identifies the choroid plexus
      on one side of the brain using the endoscope, an electrical current will be used to destroy
      as much of the choroid plexus on that side as possible. A balloon or other instrument will be
      used to open the membrane that separates the right and left halves of the brain. The
      endoscope will then be used to identify the choroid plexus on the opposite side of the brain,
      and the electrical current will be used to destroy as much of the choroid plexus on that
      side, as possible. The ventricles of the brain will be washed with a saline solution to
      remove blood and debris, and the endoscope will be removed from the brain. A temporary
      drainage tube may be left in place to monitor fluid pressures after surgery. The openings in
      the skull and scalp will be closed. The patient will be awakened from anesthesia and brought
      to either the recovery room or intensive care unit. The patient will be observed in the
      hospital for at least one night, and will undergo MRI of the brain after surgery as part of
      routine clinical care.

      The patient will have follow up visits after surgery, as part of routine clinical care.
      During hospitalization for the procedure, and during follow up clinic visits, the treating
      doctors will examine and interview the patient as part of routine clinical care. The
      researchers will collect information from these examinations, interviews, and, when
      appropriate, brain imaging studies in order to determine whether the surgery caused any
      complications, and whether it prevented the patient from requiring a ventricular shunt.

    <description>A burr hole will be made over the frontal lobe of the brain. An endoscope will be introduced into the ventricle of the brain and the choroid plexus coagulated with an electrocautery device. The septum pellucidum separating the right and left lateral ventricles will be opened, and the choroid plexus on the opposite side coagulated as well.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (age 18 or older) with communicating hydrocephalus, who have risk
             factors for complications following shunt surgery. Risk factors include loculated
             hydrocephalus (i.e., imaging evidence that the ventricles of the brain do not
             communicate with each other, in the setting of known communicating hydrocephalus);
             prior episodes of ventriculitis and/or shunt infection; subdural hematoma associated
             with shunt placement; inability to place a distal catheter in the peritoneal cavity
             due to scarring or prior infection; and multiple prior episodes of shunt failure.

          -  In patients with communicating hydrocephalus who have significantly increased lateral
             and third ventricular size and normal fourth ventricular size, an endoscopic third
             ventriculostomy will be performed in conjunction with the choroid plexus
             cauterization, provided that communicating hydrocephalus is thought to be present,
             based on either the history (for example, past meningitis or other infectious or
             inflammatory disease, or history of communicating hydrocephalus without disproportion
             of the ventricles in the past; or imaging findings, such as patency of the foramina of
             Magendie and Luschka).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include patients who have non-communicating hydrocephalus; patients
             who are undergoing emergency surgery because of rapid decline in neurologic condition;
             and patients with medical conditions such as coagulopathy or severe cardiac
             conditions, that preclude neurosurgical intervention.

          -  In the case of adults unable to consent, informed consent will be obtained from
             appointed health care proxies. Minors, pregnant women, and prisoners will be excluded
             from the study.
