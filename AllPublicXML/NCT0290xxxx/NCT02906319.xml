      The purpose of this study is to determine the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      and HbA1c levels in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. The investigators
      hypothesized that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were negatively correlated with HbA1c
      levels.

      This was a cross sectional study using consecutive sampling methodology for participant
      recruitment. It was carried out at the specialized diabetic, renal, and general outpatient
      clinics in the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

      Serum 25(OH)D levels were determined by using direct chemiluminesent immunoassay (ADVIA
      Centaur XP; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, New York, USA). Serum HbA1c levels
      were determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography (Variant™ II Turbo; Bio-Rad,
      Hercules, California, USA).

      Data collected will be analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS version
      23.0 for Windows, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA).
