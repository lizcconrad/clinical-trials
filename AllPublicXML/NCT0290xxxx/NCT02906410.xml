  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to select a hypothetical lunch from a menu that features entrees,
      sides, and drinks. Participants will be able to select a maximum of 1 item from each
      category. Following this meal selection, participants will complete a short survey about
      their demographics, their estimates of information about the meal and about recommended
      eating habits.

      The presence or absence of calorie labels on the hypothetical lunch menu will be randomly
      assigned to participants. Participants will first be randomly assigned to either the numeric
      label survey or the light label survey, and then within that survey, participants will be
      randomly assigned to either a control (no label), an item-level label, or an item-level and
      meal-level label condition.
