  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      (PET/CT) scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest can assess changes in the
      thymus size and function. The researchers would like to monitor the thymus with a PET/CT scan
      and a MRI before and after the participants transplantation.

    <measure>change in thymic size</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A clinically meaningful change is defined as increase in thymic size (&gt; 0.2cm increase in uni-dimensional diameter), functional volume (&gt;10%) or uptake (≥25%). We will report proportion of patients with each component of clinically meaningful change, as well as the proportion with at least one component, along 95% exact confidence intervals.</description>

    <description>Eligible patients will be enrolled onto the study, and will undergo 3 limited field of view (FOV) FDG-PET/CT scans and MRI of the chest: at baseline (within 4 weeks prior to transplantation), and approximately 3 months (+/-2 weeks) and 6 months (+/-2 weeks) after transplant. PET/CT and MR imaging can be completed on the same day. We will also offer the exams on other days if this is easier for the patient. The PET/CT and MR should be performed within 2 weeks of each other.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient's age is ≥18 or ≤65 years old.

          -  Patients must have a plan to receive a CD34-selected peripheral blood stem cell graft.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is not able to undergo MR imaging due to any contraindication to MRI based on
             departmental MR questionnaire (e.g. past gadolinium allergies, failure of metallic
             screening, claustrophobia, inability to lay flat for duration of the study, inability
             to hold breath, etc.)

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.
