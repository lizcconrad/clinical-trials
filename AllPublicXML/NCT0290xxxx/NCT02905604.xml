  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate if repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      with theta burst frequency over dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) is an effective
      treatment for negative symptoms (anhedonia and avolition) in schizophrenia or depression.
      Other objectives are to increase the understanding of the underlying neurobiology of negative
      symptoms and the mechanisms for the treatment effect of rTMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind parallel randomized sham controlled trial. The intervention is
      intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), which is rTMS with theta burst frequency with
      2400 pulses/day in two sessions at 90% of resting motor threshold intensity over the DMPFC,
      given in ten days on week days (10 treatment days must be completed within a maximum of 21
      days). Stratified (depression and schizophrenia diagnosis) block randomization will be used
      for treatment allocation to active or sham side of the stimulation coil.

      Patients will be referred from their regular psychiatric care facilities. At the screening
      visit the patient will be assessed if fulfilling all inclusion and none of the exclusion
      criteria. At the baseline visit thorough psychiatric, cognitive and neurophysiological
      examination will be performed. The latter include investigation of cortical excitability with
      paired-pulse TMS, mismatch negativity (MMN, a measure of aberrant stimulus detection),
      startle-response, habituation, electrodermal activity (EDA), near-infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS), 24 hour actigraphy and heart rate registration.

      During 10 week days the participants will receive a daily rTMS (or sham) treatment. On the
      day after last rTMS treatment the examinations performed at the baseline visit will be
      repeated. Four weeks after baseline there is a shorter visit to follow-up symptoms and
      functioning. At the end of this visit the blinding is unmasked and patients who have received
      sham rTMS will be offered active treatment in an open-phase. After the four weeks follow-up
      there are two additional and identical visits at 10 and 26 weeks after start of treatment.

    <description>Repetitive transcranial magnet stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortices at 90% of the resting motor threshold of the foot flexors. The rTMS is given in 20 trains to the left and right dmPFC, respectively. Each train consists of 10 bursts at 5 Hz (theta-frequency), and each burst consists of 3 pulses at 50 Hz. The stimulation is intermittent with 2 seconds of stimulation, 8 seconds off. After a 15 minute break the whole protocol i applied again, resulting in 2400 pulses/day. Treatment is delivered daily at 10 week days.</description>

    <description>A sham treatment protocol by using a sham coil with two identical sides where one side give active treatment as described above while on the other side the coil is insulated so very little magnetic energy is delivered. The coil has a built in positioning sensors and a software handling the randomization codes prompts the operator which side of the coil that should be directed towards the patient. Superficial transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is applied over the stimulation site of the dmPFC synchronous wiht the TMS pulses to further mimic the sensation of the active stimulation.</description>
