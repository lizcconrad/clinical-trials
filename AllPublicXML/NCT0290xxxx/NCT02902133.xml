      Transsphenoidal resection of sellar and parasellar tumors is associated with a significant
      risk of intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (up to 25% for pituitary adenomas, and
      nearly 100% for craniopharyngiomas and other complex tumors). Postoperative CSF leaks are
      dangerous complications that can result in infectious meningitis. In patients with
      intraoperative CSF leaks, various types of intraoperative repair can minimize the risk of
      postoperative CSF leak to a range of 8-10% (Gaynor et al., 2013). The risk of postoperative
      CSF leak is further increased by high flow CSF leak and by patient factors, in particular
      obesity (Dlouhy et al., 2012). The risk of postoperative leak can be decreased further by
      prophylactic placement of an invasive lumbar spinal drain after surgery (Patel et al., 2013),
      but lumbar drains are associated with various disadvantages including discomfort, prolonged
      hospital stay, and risk of infection, bleeding and other serious complications. Less risky
      strategies for minimizing the risk of postoperative CSF leak in this patient population are
      needed.

      Acetazolamide (Diamox) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that decreases production of CSF by
      reducing sodium transport across the choroid plexus epithelium in the ventricles of the
      brain. Acetazolamide can be given orally or by IV, and is widely used clinically for
      decreasing CSF production in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor
      cerebri) and active CSF leak after surgery or head trauma. In one small pilot study,
      Acetazolamide was used successfully in lieu of lumbar spinal drainage in patients undergoing
      elective thoracic aortic aneurysm repair. Acetazolamide has a well- established safety
      profile and rapid onset of action (4 hours when given IV, 12 hours when given orally). We
      plan a prospective pilot study of Diamox intended to assess the safety and possible
      effectiveness of Acetazolamide for the prevention of postoperative CSF leak in high-risk
      patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for removal of sellar and parasellar tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Elective transsphenoidal resection of a tumor expected to result in an intraoperative
             high flow CSF leak; such tumors include craniopharyngioma, meningioma, and Rathke
             cleft cyst.

          -  Elective transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary adenoma, with BMI &gt;25, or with
             observed low or high flow CSF leak during surgery, conferring an elevated risk of
             postoperative CSF leak.

          -  Patients who voluntarily sign Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults unable to consent

          -  Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Prisoners

          -  Patients with prior adverse reactions to acetazolamide or who are taking aspirin
             concomitantly (which may increase the risk of adverse reactions to acetazolamide)

          -  Patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which may
             increase the risk of adverse effects of acetazolamide)
