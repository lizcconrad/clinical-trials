      The purpose of this study is to conduct a parallel group, randomized trial of primary care
      clinic-based and community-based programs to educate and support low-income, Hispanic
      patients with chronic pain to adopt evidence-based pain self-care behaviors and activities.

      Background and Significance

      Over the past two decades, opioid analgesic (OA) drugs have been increasingly prescribed for
      chronic pain despite little to no effectiveness for treatment &gt;6 months. In prospective
      cohorts, OA therapy can worsen pain and disability by promoting a sedentary lifestyle. Yet
      some type of intervention is necessary because chronic pain is not &quot;curable&quot; in a
      conventional sense so the patient must learn and maintain a lifestyle to increase function,
      mobility, and cognition despite their pain. The safety threat of OAs galvanized the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop its National Pain Strategy that uses
      non-pharmacologic approaches to manage pain as the first line management. Unfortunately,
      there are few patient-centered programs to improve function and pain through proactive and
      daily self-care behaviors that are available to low income, minority patients who are most
      likely to receive poor quality pain care.

      For low income, predominantly Hispanic patients with chronic pain, investigators will conduct
      a trial of a non-pharmacologic pain management program delivered in clinic- versus
      community-based settings. The program in both settings will offer similar educational content
      such as: pain physiology and goal setting as well as training in stretching, strengthening,
      massage, and mindfulness techniques. This program incorporates elements of evidence-based
      approaches that have been demonstrated to improve outcomes of chronic back and lower
      extremity musculoskeletal pain. However, little is known about how to engage persons with
      chronic pain in self-care management. Therefore, the program tests delivery of this
      intervention in two different settings: individually in clinic or as a group in a convenient
      community-based location.

      Objective:

      For this study, investigators will randomize primary care patients treated for chronic lower
      extremity or back pain with OAs to a 6-month multimodality non-pharmacologic pain care
      program that will differ by setting, educator, and individual versus group education. In one
      arm, subjects will receive the pain care program individually by health educator in clinic
      and, in the second arm, subjects will be taught in groups by experts in a nearby public
      library.

      Study Design:

      The investigators will conduct a parallel group, randomized trial of clinic- and community-
      structured programs to educate and promote pain self-care among low-income, predominantly
      Hispanic patients aged 35-70 who have received at least two months of OA therapy for chronic
      non-cancer back and lower extremity pain. A total of 90 subjects will be randomized to: 1) a
      clinic-based self-care program led by a health educator who offers evidence-based pain and
      self-care education onsite, or 2) a community-based program organized by a community health
      worker (CHW) assisted by students in physical therapy but with self-care education and
      training delivered by content experts. A low literacy PowerPoint educational program in
      Spanish or English will be delivered by a trained health educator in clinic for six monthly
      sessions lasting 30-45 minutes. In the community setting, there will be nine, one hour
      sessions delivered by content experts every 2 weeks for the first three months and then once
      a month for the last three months. To increase availability in the community, the same group
      session is offered twice a week. Sessions include: 1) Orientation to the pain program; 2)
      Pain physiology exercises/stretching; 3) Stress management and mindfulness; 4) Massage
      therapy approaches; 5) Nutrition; 6) Sleep hygiene; 7) Relapse prevention; 8) Health literacy
      (Internet resources); 9) Review and long-term pain self-care strategies. In the community
      setting, participants are able to practice stretching, strengthening, self-massage, and
      mindfulness techniques with experts. In the clinic, sessions are condensed to be delivered in
      6 meetings.

      All subjects will be given information to work on personally selected goals through home
      activities and receive phone/texting support from a health educator (clinic arm) or CHW
      (community arm). Patient progress will be monitored by self-reported logs of activity
      measures as well as measures taken at baseline, 3- and 6- months assessing physical and
      mental function, pain and quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that patients in
      both arms of the study will show improvement in the primary outcome of the 5 times
      sit-to-stand test, which reflects improvement in the critical skill of rising from chairs,
      cars, and toilets and is associated with improvements in gait speed and overall psychosocial
      function, as described below. These are all validated physical and mental function measures
      (see below). In addition, patient adherence to meetings will be collected to compare
      implementation of the two programs. This trial will offer a valuable foundation for
      subsequent studies on the effect of multimodality pain self-care programs in helping patients
      reduce or even avoid reliance on risky OA therapy while achieving desirable functional goals.

      Impact:

      If either or both of these patient-centered self-care programs improve patient functional
      outcomes, they can be sustained and expanded through preexisting partnerships with the
      primary care clinic and library system for future studies targeting reduced reliance on OAs
      and decreased long-term OA use as the lynchpin of chronic pain management.

    <measure>Five times sit-to-stand (5XSTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline sit-to-stand at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are instructed to sit and stand up five times as fast as they can from a standard armless chair while the researcher times how long it takes them to complete the task. After a brief rest, they repeat the test a second time and the average of two tests is calculated.</description>

    <description>For this test, participants walk as far as they can for six minutes, and the total distance measured with a surveyor's wheel pushed by a research assistant walking behind the subject. Participants can pause or stop as necessary. In addition to distance covered, intensity and perceived effort are measured after the test using two 0-10 Likert-type scales. Anchor words for the pain and effort scales are &quot;no pain&quot; or &quot;most intense pain imaginable&quot; or &quot;no effort&quot; and &quot;most intense effort imaginable&quot;, respectively</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline 50-foot speed walk at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test requires participants to walk along a 25-foot walkway turn around and return to the starting point. They are instructed to safely walk as fast as they can and the time taken to complete the test is measured and gait velocity m/sec calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Borg Perceived Effort</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Completed in conjunction with the 6-minute walk, this measures intensity and perceived effort after the test using two 0-10 Likert-type scales.

    <measure>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is brief and uses simple 0-10 rating scales to measure pain intensity and impact on specific daily activities, where zero is no pain and ten is most intense pain imaginable.. Cronbach's alpha reliability ranges from 0.82-0.97</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, self-administered questionnaire that assesses somatic symptom severity. Participants rate the severity of 15 somatic symptoms as 0 (not bothered at all), 1 (bothered a little) or 2 (bothered a lot).</description>
