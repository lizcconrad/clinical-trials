  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the periodontal condition of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
      patients and a healthy non-pregnant control group. For the GDM group all medical data were
      recorded, including obesity/insulin resistance indicators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated to a worse periodontal condition. Many patients
      with these two diseases are also obese. After delivery, some patients maintain the
      pre-pregnancy obesity status and this condition is also associated to periodontal disease.
      The mechanisms involved in the relationship of all these medical and periodontal conditions
      are not clear.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) measured by a periodontal probe and classified according to severity</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Severe periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with CAL ≥ 6mm and ≥1 interproximal site with PPD ≥5mm. Moderate periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with CAL ≥ 4mm or ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with PPD ≥5mm. Mild periodontitis was defined as ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 3 mm CAL and ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 4 mm PPD or at least 1 site with PPD ≥ 5 mm (20,21). Gingivitis was determined as follows: Subjects were considered healthy if presented PPD ≤3mm/BOP extent scores &lt; 10% and with gingivitis if presented PPD ≤3mm/ BOP extent scores &gt;10%. Prevalence of periodontal disease was the sum of gingivitis, mild, moderate and severe periodontitis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria for GDM group was pregnant women with diagnosis of GDM based on
             glucose determination described in a previous study (19) and under medical treatment
             of an endocrinologist and the presence of at least one tooth per sextant.

          -  Inclusion criteria for control group were absence of periodontal disease, mean age
             similar to test group and presence of at least one tooth per sextant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria for GDM group were pregnant women without diagnosis of
             diabetes, age below 18 years or higher than 42 years, and the presence of other
             systemic diseases.

          -  In control group, women were excluded if they were pregnant, had diabetes or other
             systemic disease and age below 18 years or higher than 42 years.
