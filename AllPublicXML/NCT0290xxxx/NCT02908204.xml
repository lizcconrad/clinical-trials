  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor is the primary public health problem and the incidence of esophageal cancer showed the
      increasing trend in the past thirty years. According to the statistics in 2015, the new onset
      of esophageal cancer is about 477,900 yearly. The mainly pathologic type of esophageal cancer
      in China is esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, which accounts for more than 90% of patients
      in China. With the development of endoscopic technics, more and more patients choose to
      receive the endoscopic procedure rather than traditional surgery. However, the long-term
      efficacy and outcomes of patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      received different interventions remained unclear. Thus, investigators aim to conduct a
      multi-center retrospective study to investigate the long term outcomes of superficial
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients receiving endoscopic treatment and surgery.
