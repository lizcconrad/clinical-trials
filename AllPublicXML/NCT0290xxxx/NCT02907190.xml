  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the glycemic and insulinemic response elicited by ½
      cup servings of 6 beans to those elicited by ½ cup servings of mashed potato, macaroni, rice
      and corn.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order for a food to be able to claim a reduced glycemic response, it must be shown that a
      typical serving of the food elicits a significantly lower blood glucose responses compared to
      a serving of an appropriate control food. While many studies have examined the GI of beans,
      few studies have compared the glycemic impact of a typical serving of beans to a typical
      serving of other starchy foods. Therefore, there are insufficient data to allow for a claim
      that beans have a low glycemic response. In addition, in order to make a claim of a reduced
      glycemic response, regulatory agencies also require that the insulinemic response to a food
      is not disproportionately increased.
