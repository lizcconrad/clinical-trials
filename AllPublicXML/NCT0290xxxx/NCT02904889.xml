  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most older adults want to stay at home for as long as possible. To reach this aim it is
      important to maintain their mobility and self-care abilities. However, many older adults are
      at risk to lose their abilities, as they have an inactive lifestyle. In this study, homecare
      professionals learn to motivate their clients to be more active in daily and physical
      activities. Examples of these activities are washing and dressing, household chores or going
      for a walk.

      The primary aim of this exploratory study is to evaluate the implementation of the 'Stay
      Active at Home' program (process evaluation). The secondary aim is to get insight into the
      potential effectiveness of the program with regard to several primary and secondary outcomes
      measures (effect evaluation). The tertiary aim is to test the feasibility of the proposed
      study design.

    <description>Stay Active at Home' aims to change the behaviour of community nurses and domestic support workers by offering them an intensive training programme. Subsequently, professionals are expected to deliver goal-oriented, holistic and person-centred services focusing on supporting older adults to maintain, gain or restore their competences to engage in physical and daily activities so that they can manage their everyday life as independently as possible.</description>
