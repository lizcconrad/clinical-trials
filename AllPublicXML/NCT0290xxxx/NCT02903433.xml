  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avocados are an excellent source of fiber, potassium, magnesium, and poly- and
      mono-unsaturated fats. They can be a nutrient dense component of healthful dietary patterns
      and have the potential to improve the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles of families
      in the United States (US). The proposed research plan will focus on the contribution of
      avocado intake to the reduction in CVD risk of US families, by examining the effects of
      avocado intake on the overall nutritional status of families. Of particular interest is
      establishing these effects in ethnic populations such as Hispanics/Latinos. On average,
      Hispanic/Latinos are at increased risk for metabolic diseases that predispose to CVD. This
      6-month cluster randomized trial in Hispanic/Latino Americans aims to accurately determine
      the impact of avocados on the overall dietary pattern of their families. Future research will
      extend the results of the current trial to a larger sample of ethnically diverse families in
      order to evaluate whether sustained changes occur in nutritional, cardiovascular and
      metabolic health status.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine how avocados are incorporated into the family's dietary pattern
      and impact selected measures of nutritional status:

        1. To determine if avocado intake substitutes for, or adds to, other sources of calories in
           the family diet.

        2. To determine if avocado intake helps reduce between-meal snacking of family members.

        3. To determine if avocados help families meet US Dietary Guidelines for recommended intake
           of: poly- and monounsaturated fats; vegetables; fiber; selected nutrients (vitamins C, D
           and E, Folate, Calcium, Magnesium, potassium, iron); lutein and other carotenoids.

      Specific aim 2: To determine if increased avocado intake affects cardio-metabolic risk
      factors to include lipids, glucose, insulin, and HbA1c.

    <description>Throughout the entire study, this group will be provided with 14 avocados per week and will receive 12 bi-weekly home visits over a 6-month period during which they will receive specific brochures offering &quot;diet tips&quot;. This group will be given specific advice on avocado consumption. Each month throughout the study, we will provide opportunities for families to visit the study kitchen at the SYHC to observe the staff preparing recipes with avocado, participate in preparing recipes, and taste recipes.</description>

    <description>This group will receive 3 avocados per week, as well as 12 bi-weekly home visits over a 6-month period during which they will be provided with the same educational materials (i.e., &quot;Diet Tips&quot;) as those assigned to the &quot;High intake&quot; group. Participants in this group will be encouraged to improve the quality of their diets, but will not be given specific advice on avocado consumption. However, each month throughout the study, we will provide opportunities for families to visit the study kitchen at the SYHC to observe the staff preparing recipes with avocado, participate in preparing recipes, and taste recipes.</description>
