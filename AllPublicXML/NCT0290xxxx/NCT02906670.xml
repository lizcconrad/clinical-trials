  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study to test Sym013 (Pan-HER) in humans. The primary purpose of this study
      is to see if Sym013 is safe and effective for patients with advanced epithelial malignancies
      without available therapeutic options.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter trial composed of 2 parts in which Sym013 will be
      evaluated when administered by intravenous infusion in patients with advanced epithelial
      malignancies without available therapeutic options.

      Part 1 is a Phase 1a dose-escalation designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). Patients entered to Dose Level 1, 2, and 3 were treated every week (Q1W). As of April
      2017, the dosing schedule in this trial has been changed to every second week (Q2W). Patients
      entered to the trial prior to implementation of this amendment will continue to be treated
      Q1W.

      Once the RP2D is selected, an expansion cohort of patients with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid
      tumors will undergo pre- and post-dosing fluorine-18 radiolabeled FDG (18F-FDG) positron
      emission tomography (PET) imaging to evaluate the effects on tumor metabolism of Sym013 when
      administered at this dose. Imaging to be paired with computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) conducted for Disease Status Evaluation. Accrual to this cohort may
      occur concurrent with accrual to Part 2 of the study.

      Part 2 is a Phase 2a dose-expansion at the RP2D. Four tumor types to be evaluated in this
      part of the trial will be selected based upon findings from Part 1, additional preclinical
      data, and additional clinical data available at that time from other agents inhibiting these
      targets. Patients will be entered, depending upon their underlying malignancy, to 1 of 4
      corresponding expansion cohorts: Cohort A, Cohort B, Cohort C, or Cohort D.
