      An oral teleconsultation was proposed to the 461 residents of the public hospital of Uzès. A
      specifically trained nurse recorded 4 videos (1 per quadrant) per mouth with an intra-oral
      camera using fluorescent light (Soprocare®) and keyed in information about the resident
      (general state, identification,…). These data were recorded and sent onto a central secured
      server, through a specific piece of software (e-DENT®). The dentists from the University
      Hospital of Montpellier were then able to analyse the videos remotely, make a diagnosis and
      organise each resident's oral care.
