  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a novel drug called CUDC-907 as a possible treatment for
      resistant (refractory) pediatric solid tumors (including neuroblastoma), lymphoma, or brain
      tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an
      investigational intervention and also tries to find the best dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved CUDC-907 as a treatment
      option for any disease.

      This is the first time that CUDC-907 will be given to children.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating a new drug, CUDC-907, as a potential
      new treatment for children with solid tumors, lymphomas and brain tumors. CUDC-907 is an oral
      drug that blocks certain proteins in tumor cells. These proteins may be important in the
      growth of some cancers. Laboratory experiments and results from adult studies demonstrate
      that CUDC-907 may stop tumor growth and, in some cases, cause tumor cells to die. CUDC-907
      has been tested in adults with cancer to find out about side effects and dosing in adults.
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate side effects of CUDC-907 and find the best dose
      of CUDC-907 when used in children. Other goals of this study are to determine whether this
      drug may have benefits against the types of cancer seen in children and to measure the
      effects of CUDC-907 in the blood.

             area of at least 0.5 m2

          -  For patients with CNS tumors (primary or metastatic), any baseline neurologic deficits
             (including seizure) must be stable for at least one week prior to study enrollment.

          -  Ability to understand and/or the willingness of the patient (or parent or legally
             authorized representative, if minor) to provide informed consent, using an
             institutionally approved informed consent procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not be receiving any of the following concomitant medications:

          -  Pharmacologic doses of systemic corticosteroids unless for CNS metastatic or primary
             disease. For patients with CNS metastatic or primary tumors receiving corticosteroids,
             they should be on a stable or decreasing dose over the 7 days prior to registration
             and meet criteria.

          -  For all patients, receipt of systemic physiologic replacement steroids, topical and/or
             inhaled corticosteroids is acceptable.

          -  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants, and therapeutic heparins.

          -  Pregnant participants will not be entered on this study given that the effects of
             CUDC-907 on the developing human fetus are unknown.

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with CUDC-907, breastfeeding mothers are not
             eligible.

          -  Participants of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal birth control; intrauterine device; double barrier method; or
             total abstinence) throughout their participation, including up until 30 days after
             last dose of CUDC-907.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to CUDC-907.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Note that patients who have had prior allogeneic transplantation
             are required to have CMV PCR testing performed during screening. A positive screen
             would be evidence of an active infection and would render the patient ineligible.

          -  Patients with a known history of HIV, hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C (testing not
             required as part of screening).

          -  Patients with a known history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

          -  Patients with gastrointestinal disease or disorder that could interfere with
             absorption of CUDC-907, such as bowel obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease.
