  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to explore different dosing levels and schedules of
      entinostat in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors, in terms
      of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), impact on immune correlatives, and efficacy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single center, randomized study to assess the safety and
      tolerability of 3 different dose regimens of entinostat in combination with pembrolizumab in
      patients with advanced solid tumors who previously completed Study SNDX-275-0140
      (NCT02897778). Up to 30 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three arms.
      In the event that greater than or equal to 2 out of the first 6 patients randomized
      experience a dose-limiting toxicity, the next patient randomized to that Arm will receive
      treatment at a reduced starting dose as outlined in the protocol.
