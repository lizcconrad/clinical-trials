      This research study is studying a combination of drugs called abiraterone acetate and
      Apalutamide as a possible treatment for new diagnosed Prostate Cancer.

      The following interventions will be use in this study :

        -  Abiraterone Acetate

        -  Prednisone

        -  Apalutamide

        -  Leuprolide Acetate

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Abiraterone acetate with
      prednisone as a treatment option for prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the
      body (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer).However, in this study it is being
      investigated for the treatment of localized prostate cancer prior to surgical removal of the
      prostate (prostatectomy).

      Abiraterone acetate works by decreasing the production of androgens (male sex hormones),
      which promote prostate cancer growth. Some steroids produced by the adrenal glands can turn
      into testosterone, and prostate cancer cells feed on testosterone. Testosterone is suppressed
      by an FDA approved drug called leuprolide or Lupron.

      The FDA has not approved Apalutamide as a treatment for any disease. In this study,
      Apalutamide is being investigated for the treatment of prostate cancer. Apalutamide also
      works by blocking the effects of male sex hormones.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the effectiveness of one combination
      of drugs (abiraterone acetate + prednisone + leuprolide) compared to another combination of
      drugs (abiraterone acetate + prednisone + leuprolide + Apalutamide) before surgery to see if
      this will improve surgical outcomes and reduce or eliminate Prostate Cancer.

             eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the
             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy, or 2) individuals
             with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5

             the skin.

         15. Major surgery or radiation therapy within 30 days of screening visit. Participants who
             have had a major surgery within 30 days of screening visit may be eligible provided
