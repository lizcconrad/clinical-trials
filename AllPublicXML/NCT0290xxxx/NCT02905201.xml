  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the rate of compliance to abiraterone
      acetate and prednisone (AA + P) treatment in Colombian Castration-resistant metastatic
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) participants experiencing adequate response to treatment, in a
      real-world clinical setting.
