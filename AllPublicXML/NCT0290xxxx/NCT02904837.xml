  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the impairments associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), gait disturbance is one of
      the most injurious to the independence in daily living activities and the quality of life of
      people living with Parkinson's disease (PPD). Despite a considerable amount of research,
      there is no consensus about the most efficient physiotherapeutic approach to improve gait
      disturbance. Mental practice (MP) is considered an efficient strategy to improve the motor
      performance of healthy individuals and people with stroke. However, there is little evidence
      about its therapeutic results as a tool to improve gait performance in PPD. Thus, the aim of
      this study is to investigate the effects of mental gait practice associated with physical
      practice (PP) to improve the gait performance of PPD.

      Background: Among the impairments associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), gait disturbance
      is one of the most injurious to the independence in daily living activities and the quality
      of life of people living with Parkinson's disease (PPD). Despite a considerable amount of
      research, there is no consensus about the most efficient physiotherapeutic approach to
      improve gait disturbance. Mental practice (MP) is considered an efficient strategy to improve
      the motor performance of healthy individuals and people with stroke. However, there is little
      evidence about its therapeutic results as a tool to improve gait performance in PPD.

      Objectives: To investigate the effects of mental gait practice associated with physical
      practice to improve the gait performance of people living with Parkinson's disease.

      Design: Parallel, prospective, double-blind, multicentre randomized clinical trial.

      Setting: Brazilian Parkinson Association.

      Participants: One hundred and fifty people living with Parkinson's disease in stages 2-3 of
      disease evolution according to Hoehn and Yahr Classification.

      Interventions: The participants will be randomly allocated in an experimental group (EG), and
      a control group (CG). Both groups will perform 10 individual training sessions, two
      individual sessions per week, for five weeks. Every session will be guided by a
      physiotherapist. The training sessions consist of four blocks of MP intercalated with four
      blocks of PP of gait in single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. The only difference
      between the groups will be the content of mental practice blocks: the EG will perform mental
      practice of gait (GMP) while the CG will perform non-gait mental practice (nGMP).

      Randomization: Participants will be randomized by ClinStat software into one of two groups:
      Experimental Group (EG), which will perform the GMP; and Control Group (CG), which will
      perform the nGMP.

      Statistical analysis: The training effects for each primary and secondary outcome measure
      will be analyzed for the two training conditions (i.e., control and experimental) at the four
      assessment time points (i.e., 7 days pre-intervention and post-completion, and at 30 and
      60-day follow-up) using a mixed-design ANOVA with training as the between-group factor and
      the assessment time point as the within-group factor. The effect sizes (ES) will be
      calculated for all comparisons at alpha = 0.05. A Tukey HSD post-hoc test will be used for
      multiple comparisons and p-values below 5 % will be considered as statistically significant.

    <measure>Postural Instability and Gait Difficulty Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Postural Instability and Gait Difficulty Score (PIGD) is a recommended rating scale for evaluation of gait alterations in PD based on 5 Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) items relevant to gait and postural instability (items 13-15, 29, and 30). The 13-15 items are based on gait performance according to PPD perspective, while 29 and 30 items are based on the motor test.</description>

    <measure>Six-minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up tp 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test (6-MWT) is a timed recommended clinically based test in which participants are asked to walk for 6 minutes, in their habitual speed, as much distance as possible. Interruptions for resting are permitted if necessary. The 6-MWT has demonstrated adequate test-retest and interrater reliability and minimal detectable change of 82 meters in PD. It may be a good predictor of the ability to independently walk outside safely.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a test that assess gait balance. It has demonstrated good feasibility, test-retest, interrater reliability and minimal detectable change of 3-point reduction in PD. Furthermore, it is considerable as a supportive test for identifying the fall risk in people with PD. The balance during the eight gait related activities is scored in this test. These include quality of walking speed change, going around and over obstacles and stair walking, as well as the number of steps required for a pivot turn. The performance is scored from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating the lowest and 24 the highest level of functioning.</description>

    <measure>30 seconds DT gait</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 seconds DT gait (30sDTG) is a test in which measures the maximal walking distance reached in 30 seconds under single and dual taks. The cognitive task consists of speaking as many words as possible, starting with a specific character (F, S or A), presented at the beginning of test. This cognitive task showed to be more sensitive for dual task impairment and less prone to education level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test (TMT) is s a well-established test constituted for two timed parts: Part A, which involves a visual-scanning task where the participant is required to draw lines sequentially connecting consecutively numbered circles (1-25) randomly arranged on a page as fast as possible. Part B, which measures of cognitive flexibility, where the participant is asked to connect the same number of circles in an alternating sequence of numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). In order to avoid the effect of motor speed on the test performance, the time difference between parts (Part B - Part A) is usually used as the more accurate measure of executive function than the performance in one of the parts alone. The time difference between Part B and Part A has showed high correlation with obstacle course gait speed, and with the ability to appropriately adapt gait to environmental challenges in older individuals, and with poor balance and gait performance in people with PD.</description>

    <measure>39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ 39) is a scale that assesses the health-related quality of life. It evaluates 39 parameters in eight groups of issues (mobility, daily living activities, emotional well-being, stigma of the disease, back in the next, cognitive, communication and bodily discomfort). Each group is constituted from 3 to 10 parameters with five possible answers.</description>
