      Purpose is to compare introduction of NIPPV (Nasal Intermittent Positive-Pressure
      Ventilation) and nBiPAP (Nasal Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) in terms of mechanical
      ventilation (MV) need (non-invasive respiratory support failure) and surfactant need within
      the first 72 hours of life in preterm infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) at
      26-30 weeks of gestation.

      Purpose is to compare introduction of NIPPV and nBiPAP in terms of mechanical ventilation
      (MV) need (non-invasive respiratory support failure) and surfactant need within the first 72
      hours of life in preterm infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) at 26-30 weeks of
      gestation.

      Method

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      In NIPPV and BIPAP groups, comparison of mechanical ventilation (MV) need (non-invasive
      respiratory support failure) and surfactant need within the first 72 hours of life

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Compare patients' need of total duration of invasive and non-invasive respiratory
           support and the duration of free oxygen

        -  Compare oxygen need in postnatal day 28 and week 36

        -  Compare the presence and severity of BPD (Bronchopulmonary dysplasia)

        -  Compare premature morbidities such as PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), IVH
           (intraventricular haemorrhage), NEC (necrotizing enterocolitis), ROP (retinopathy of
           prematurity)

        -  Compare feeding intolerance, reaching birth weight and transition to full oral feeding
           time, hospitalization period

        -  Compare their neurodevelopment in postnatal age 2

      Study Design In NIPPV group; non-synchronous mode will be used, and they will be titrated
      between FiO2: 021-0.50 in a respiratory rate of 20-40 / min, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP):
      15-20 end-expiratory pressure (PEEP):5-6 cm H2O and target oxygen saturation: 90-95 %. In
      nBiPAP group; they will be titrated between 021-0.50, in non-synchronized PEEP:6 H2O,
      pressure amplitude: 3 cm H2O, FiO2 target oxygen saturation of 90-95 %.

      Under non-invasive respiratory support, in case of FiO2 is ≥ 0.40, surfactant will be given
      as early rescue therapy by means of non-invasive method (by using a thin catheter - take care
      method- while spontaneous breathing continues) in order to keep target oxygen saturation
      between 90-95 %. The second dose of surfactant will be given 6 hours after the first dose by
      means on non-invasive method in order to keep target oxygen saturation between 90-95 % in
      case of FiO2 need is ≥ 0.30.

      Non-invasive respiratory support failure is set as follows:

        -  FiO2 of ≥ 0.50 in order to keep oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry above 90 %
           and higher,

        -  Apnea requiring more than 6 alerts in a 24 -hour period in 6 consecutive hours or more
           than 1 apnea requiring positive pressure ventilation,

        -  Persistent acidosis; presence of pH &lt; 7.20 and PCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg in two different blood
           gases drawn with an interval of at least 30 minutes or treatment-resistant metabolic
           acidosis,

        -  Severe respiratory distress,

        -  Pulmonary haemorrhage and cardiopulmonary arrest.
