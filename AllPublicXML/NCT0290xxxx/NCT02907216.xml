  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the diphtheria,
      tetanus, pertussis and inactivated poliovirus (DPT-IPV) vaccine Squarekids administered with
      or without the GSK Biologicals' liquid Rotarix (HRV) vaccine, in healthy Japanese infants
      aged 6 - 12 weeks. GSK Biologicals' liquid HRV vaccine Rotarix is licensed in Japan since
      2011. Although the concomitant administration of GSK Biologicals' DTP-IPV vaccine has been
      evaluated during the clinical development of the HRV vaccine, the vaccine differed in
      composition and route of administration from the DPT-IPV vaccine Squarekids manufactured in
      Japan. Hence, as requested by the Japanese regulatory authorities, this post-licensure study
      will evaluate the immunogenicity of the DPT-IPV vaccine manufactured in Japan when
      co-administered with the liquid HRV vaccine

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IV, open-label, randomised, controlled, multi-centric, single-country
      study with two parallel groups. Subjects in the co-administration group will be administered
      the DPT-IPV vaccine according to a 3, 4, 6 month schedule and the liquid HRV vaccine
      according to a 2, 3 month schedule. Subjects in the staggered group will be administered the
      DPT-IPV vaccine according to a 3, 4.5, 6 month schedule and the liquid HRV vaccine according
      to a 2, 3.5 month schedule. The intended duration of the study, per subject, is 5 months.

      A sub-cohort of subjects (HRV Immunogenicity sub-cohort) from both the study groups will
      include the first 73 subjects enrolled into the study to assess the serum anti-RV IgA
      seropositivity and Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMC).
