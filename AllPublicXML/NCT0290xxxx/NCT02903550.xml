  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholesteatoma is a destructive and expanding pathologic condition consisting of keratin pearl
      arising from a squamous epithelium in the middle ear and/or mastoid process. Evolution
      consists in a destruction of the ossicles as well as their possible spread through the base
      of the skull into the brain. Surgical treatment is required to prevent infectious or
      functional complications. A recurrence after surgery occurs in approximately 10% of patients
      and rarely affects initial site. Surgical treatment is the only care option for recurrent
      cholesteatoma. Various locations such as surgical approach cavity, mastoid, hypotympanum are
      seen. Temporal bone CT is performed prior to surgery for added information on bone erosions
      especially of ossicules, tegmen tympani, facial nerve canal of internal ear. Due high
      anatomical resolution and complex anatomy, temporal bone CT is usually displayed with
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in operating room to help surgical guidance .

      Imaging especially using MRI is the cornerstone for diagnosis in asymptomatic patients. Since
      2006, non echo planar imaging (EPI) Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) (sequences has shown high accuracy to depict recurrent cholesteatoma. If EPI
      sequences had a high rate of diffeomorphic atefacts whereas non EPI sequences using either
      HAlf-Fourier acquisition Single-shot Turbo spin-Echo (HASTE) or Fast-spin-echo demonstrates
      less magnetic susceptibility artifacts. Multimodality fusion between NonEPI-DWI-MRI and
      computerized tomography (CT) is a rational promising tool to rise the performance for
      cholesteatomas delineation. The performances of NonEPI-DWI-MRI in assessing lesion spread and
      volume are still unknown and needs further investigations. The aim of the study is to assess
      the DWI-MRI/CT fusion feasibility, reproducibility and the accuracy prior to surgery
      propectively compared to surgical findings.
