    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a new formulation of
      ibuprofen 200 mg/5 mL oral suspension vs. the marketed reference product MOMENT 200 mg coated
      tablet, when administered under fasting conditions as single oral dose to healthy male and
      female volunteers, in two consecutive study periods.
