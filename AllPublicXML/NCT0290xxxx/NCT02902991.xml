  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through this prospective clinical trial,the investigators will focus on the relationship
      between circulating tumor biomarkers (i.e. circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and
      other biomarkers) and the status of primary tumor to discuss its application for assessing
      prognosis and individualized therapeutic direction. Moreover, the relationship between the
      circulating tumor cell subpopulations based on epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
      molecular pathological classification of breast cancer will be determined, which may enable
      the determination of the value of its application in therapeutic decision making.
