  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) display postural and functional asymmetry
      that interferes with their development. The use of the Perception-Action Approach (P-AA)
      intervention in infants with CMT is supported by a single case report and needs to be
      researched further to determine its efficacy. This study will investigate the immediate
      effects of the P-AA intervention on habitual head deviation from midline, active head
      rotation range of motion, and functional use of both sides of the body in infants with CMT.

      The participants will be 3 infants with CMT, aged birth to 9 months. A randomized,
      nonconcurrent A-B multiple baseline design across subjects will be used. The intervention
      phase will include 5 daily PT sessions, with outcome data collected at the end of each
      session.

      It is hypothesized that improvements on all outcome measures will be documented upon the
      initiation of the P-A Approach intervention, with the most substantial change expected in
      habitual head deviation from midline measured by still photography.

      This study will have a randomized, nonconcurrent A-B multiple baseline design across
      subjects. The purpose of this study will be to investigate the immediate effects of the P-AA
      intervention on habitual head deviation from midline, active head rotation range of motion
      (ROM), and functional use of both sides of the body in infants with CMT.

      The participants will be 3 infants with CMT, aged birth to 9 months, recruited from a private
      pediatric physical therapy (PT) practice. Baseline and intervention data will be collected 5
      days per week, Monday through Friday, until the study is completed. The length of the
      baseline phase will be randomly assigned to each consecutively enrolled participant. The
      appropriate measurements will be taken at every baseline phase session but no intervention
      will be provided until the intervention phase is initiated. The intervention phase will
      include 5 daily PT sessions during which the P-AA intervention will be used, with outcome
      data collected at the end of each session. Additionally, the participants' therapy-related
      behavior during intervention sessions will be documented.

      Measurements of still photos and scoring of video recordings to evaluate the participants'
      habitual head deviation from midline and functional use of both sides of the body for
      movement and play will be performed by an assessor blind to the timing of when the photos and
      videos are obtained within the study. The active head rotation ROM measurements and
      assessment of therapy-related behavior will be performed by the treating therapists.

      Prior to initiating this research, a pilot reliability study will be conducted for all
      outcome measures. A total of 3 to 5 infants will be recruited for the pilot project.

      Fidelity of intervention will be evaluated during the pilot study using a checklist. During
      the main study, intervention adherence will be assessed by tracking attendance, session
      duration, and intervention frequency.

    <description>Perception-Action Approach (P-AA) intervention components include environmental set-up for activity and participation in play, manual guidance in the form of light pressure applied to the infant's body in developmentally appropriate positions, and caregiver education in modifications to everyday activities consistent with the P-AA. All components are designed to promote spontaneous exploration of the environment by the infant by suggesting small, incremental changes in his/her perceptual-motor orientation and contact with the support surface. Intervention is progressed by gradually removing the environmental supports and therapist's hands to allow for spontaneous exploration of a newly found contact with the support surface or new body configuration.</description>
