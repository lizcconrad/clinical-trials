  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the hypothesis that those with non-traditional work
      schedules (e.g. shift workers) have a higher cardio-metabolic risk than those with
      traditional work schedules (e.g. day workers), and that both accumulated sleep debt and the
      degree of circadian disruption predict the elevated cardio-metabolic risk. The findings of
      this research are expected to increase our understanding of physiologic tolerance to
      non-traditional work schedules and provide the basis for the development of methods for the
      early detection of adverse health effects and determine coping strategies for the millions of
      workers with non-traditional work schedules.

    <description>At home session: 2-weeks of wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries; a food diary for the three days preceding the lab session; 24-h period of ambulatory blood pressure on a non-work day for participant. Work schedules over a 4-week period will be collected and participants identified as traditional or non-traditional workers.
Subjects will begin the stay in the research unit in the evening and will remain for about 16-20 hr. Saliva samples will be taken every 30 min from admission until bedtime. Bedtime with polysomnography will be from 11:00pm to 7:00am. Questionnaires will be administered; height, weight and waist/hip circumference and bioimpedance measurement; standard 3-h oral glucose tolerance test and blood tests (CBC, electrolytes, renal, liver and thyroid function , hemoglobin A1c, SHBG levels). For individuals with diabetes only fasting blood samples will be taken.</description>
