  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this community-based randomized controlled trial is to test whether the
      mCARE-II intervention package, delivered by the existing Government of Bangladesh community
      health workforce, will improve neonatal and perinatal survival in a rural setting in
      northwestern Bangladesh. mCARE-II is a digital health intervention, which incorporates
      automated workload scheduling, client prioritization and risk stratification, overdue service
      reminders and demand generation through client side reminder messaging. The intervention
      package focuses on the pregnancy and early postpartum period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to implement and evaluate the mCARE-II intervention package using a
      randomized controlled trial design. This package, supported by an mHealth application,
      provides workflow scheduling for guided household registration, census, pregnancy
      surveillance, and antenatal, postnatal, and essential newborn care visit reminders. Workflow
      scheduling is sorted and prioritized based on assessment of basic risk. Furthermore, the
      system integrates client-directed reminder SMS messages and demand-side birth notifications
      to schedule postnatal services immediately after birth. This will be operated by the
      Government of Bangladesh (GoB) community health workers, called Family Welfare Assistants
      (FWAs), in 18 unions of one northern district of Bangladesh who will use the system to
      support their routine health service delivery functions. Based on lessons learned from phase
      I implementation under the pilot study, additional features will be added to the intervention
      package, including a priority sorting algorithm to identify pregnant women and newborns with
      known risk factors for adverse outcomes to prioritize them for scheduled visits, a birth
      preparedness module to help pregnant women and their families plan for safe delivery and
      childbirth, and targeted newborn care counseling during late antenatal encounters. These
      features will be built on a scalable platform compatible with national data systems and
      aligned with a new global standard being advocated by WHO - the Open Smart Register Platform
      or OpenSRP (smartregister.org).

      Based on randomization to mCARE-II or control arms by FWA catchment area, participants living
      in each area will receive services from their FWA, either supported by OpenSRP or according
      to the standard of care procedures currently in place. Performance of the FWAs and the health
      status of enrolled women and newborns will be monitored and evaluated by a rigorous research
      layer supported by a cadre of research workers who will verify services received by
      participants to assess exposure to and interactions with FWAs and OpenSRP. This study
      combines a robust RCT methodology with principles of implementation science - actual
      government health workers using OpenSRP to support their routine work while a cadre of
      highly-trained research workers collects 'gold-standard' denominator data against which to
      measure performance. This study is an effort to rigorously evaluate the set of mCARE-II
      interventions on the OpenSRP platform.

    <description>mCARE-II is a package of interventions that provides guided client enumeration and follow-up support to community health workers, automated workflow scheduling, risk assessment, client prioritization and stratification and client-based demand generation messaging. These features are incorporated into a platform called OpenSRP, which integrates text message reminders, scheduling, and form submissions on the server side, and displays schedules and client lists on a tablet-based application for community health workers.</description>
