      This research study explores the effects of a progressive, multi-component intervention
      following a stay in the hospital or rehabilitation facility. The purpose of this research
      study is to compare a multi-component intervention (higher intensity exercise, nutritional
      supplementation, and greater emphasis on functionally enhanced care transitions) with usual
      care physical therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Declines in physical function as a result of acute illness are strongly and independently
      associated with a number of adverse health events for older adults. Home Health (HH) physical
      therapy may be the ideal venue for addressing these declines in physical function because
      around 3 million older adults receive HH services following discharge from acute or
      post-acute facilities. However, as currently structured, HH care does not appear to
      adequately restore function, as evidenced by poor long-term outcomes and high rates of
      hospital readmission. Diminished physical function has been particularly implicated as a risk
      factor for re-hospitalization --older adults with lower levels of ambulatory activity are 6
      times more likely to be re-hospitalized than those with greater ambulatory activity. A more
      intensive approach to HH physical therapy for older adults has great potential to maximize
      physical function and reduce hospital readmissions. Therefore, the investigators have
      developed a high intensity home-based, progressive, interdisciplinary, multi-component (PMC)
      intervention that directly addresses the functional deficits seen after hospitalization. This
      intervention will include intensive rehabilitation, a care transitions program, and daily
      protein supplementation. The investigators will conduct a two-arm, randomized clinical trial
      (RCT) of 200 participants admitted to HH from an acute or post-acute facility. Participants
      will receive either 1) an intensive, PMC intervention using resistance exercise and
      evidenced-based motor control training to improve physical function, along with nutritional
      supplementation and emphasis on functionally enhanced care transitions or 2) usual care (UC)
      physical therapy. The primary goal of this investigation is to determine if PMC intervention,
      initiated upon admission to HH, improves physical function, as measured by performance and
      self-report assessments, more than UC physical therapy. The investigators will also examine
      the effects on fatigue, balance confidence, and activities of daily living. In an exploratory
      analysis, the effects of the PMC intervention on re-hospitalization rates, nursing home
      placement, emergency room visits, and falls after discharge from the acute care hospital will
      also be examined. All outcomes will be examined at baseline, 30, 60 (primary endpoint), 90
      and 180 days. If successful in improving patient function and decreasing re-hospitalization
      rates, PMC intervention holds potential for future health care cost savings.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in SPPB from baseline to 60 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>SPPB is a well-accepted global measure of lower extremity function which consists of walking speed, chair stands, and balance. It is a well-studied composite measure and a strong predictor of disability, institutionalization, and morbidity in older adults. SPPB will also be assessed at 30, 90, 180 days post-randomization.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Physical Performance Test (mPPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in mPPT from baseline to 60 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>mPPT assesses 7 tasks. Based on the time it takes to complete each task, a score from 0 (unable to complete) to 4 (performed quickly and easily) is given for each item. The maximal score is 28 and includes tasks that involve upper and lower extremity function. Test-retest reliability for the modified PPT score is 0.96. The instrument is sensitive to change and has been used in exercise trials with frail elders. mPPT will also be assessed at 30, 90, 180 days post-randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fast walking speed (4MW)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in 4MW from baseline to 60 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed at the fastest, safe speed for each participant over 4 meters. Fastest walking assesses capacity for performance of certain activities (e.g. crossing a street before the light changes). Fast walking speed will also be assessed at 30, 90, 180 days post-randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ActivPAL</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in physical activity from baseline to 60 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Accelerometer-based physical activity examines volume and intensity of physical activity in which participants engage. Participants will wear a thigh-mounted activPAL physical activity monitoring device for up to 10 days to determine mean steps and activity counts per day (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, Scotland). Physical activity will also be defined as daily time spent in sitting, standing, and stepping. The activPAL has been found to be reliable (ICC≥0.99), valid (% Error =0.94% compared to video analysis; gold standard), and suitably sensitive to detect difference/change is similar populations. Physical activity will also be assessed at 30, 90, 180 days post-randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls Efficacy Scale-International</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Falls Efficacy Scale-International from baseline to 60 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire assesses concern about falling during performance of activities of daily living. Participants rate 16 individual activities on a scale from 1 (not at all concerned) to 4 (very concerned). Falls Efficacy Scale-International will also be assessed at 30, 90, 180 days post-randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in FSS from baseline to 60 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>A nine item questionnaire that quantifies the degree of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on activities of daily living in clinical populations. Participants score each of 9 components on a scale of 1 to 7. The aggregate score ranges from 9 (no impact) to 64 (profound impact of fatigue on activities of daily living). A total score of less than 36 suggests that a participant is not suffering from fatigue. The FSS is reliable (r=0.56-0.89), valid (α=0.97), and sensitive to change. FSS will also be assessed at 30, 90, 180 days post-randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Activation Measure (PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in PAM from baseline to 60 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Identifies patient motivation levels regarding their healthcare. Reliably predicts future ER visits, hospital admissions, and medication/ therapy adherence. The survey classifies patient activation levels on a scale from 1 (low activation/motivation) to 4 (high activation/motivation). Patients who score higher on the PAM survey tend to be hospitalized less and adhere to medication and therapy schedules more.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Grip Strength from baseline to 60 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength is a simple and reliable surrogate of overall muscle strength and a valid predictor of physical disability and mobility limitation. Grip strength will also be assessed at 30, 90, 180 days post-randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Falls, Emergency Department visits, nursing home days, hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>Quantification of falls, ED visits, nursing home days, and hospitalizations at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given a log to record any falls, ED visits, hospitalizations or nursing home stays. Falls will be defined as an unintentional change in position resulting in coming to rest on the ground or other lower level.</description>
