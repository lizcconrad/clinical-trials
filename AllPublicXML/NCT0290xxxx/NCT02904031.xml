  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Few data are available about the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
           elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy. Up today, most
           of the available data are from retrospective/post-hoc analyses, making them difficult to
           translate to everyday clinical practice.

        -  FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line therapy option for RAS wild-type
           untreated mCRC patients. Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in
           routinary practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been
           prospectively tested.

        -  In elderly patients, a reasonable upfront treatment is a fluoropyrimidine-based
           monotherapy plus bevacizumab, irrespectively of the molecular status of RAS.

        -  BRAF mutation is a strong negative prognostic factor associated to advanced age, poor
           performance status (PS), extended and aggressive disease and is associated to a lack of
           benefit from anti-EGFR moAb.

        -  Clinical definition of elderly (over 70 years old) CRC patients that may deserve a more
           or less intensive combination therapy is still debated. The cut-off of 75 years old
           combined with ECOG PS assessment is a reasonable approach for clearly defining
           candidates to different approaches31.

        -  Several geriatric screening tools have been used to identify patients with a geriatric
           profile potentially predicting for overall survival and risk of toxicity. The G8
           screening tool has been validated in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic
           value for overall survival; the CRASH score is able to stratify patients according an
           estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities.

      On the basis of these considerations, the investigators designed the present randomized phase
      II trial of first-line therapy panitumumab in combination with simplified FOLFOX or with
      5-fluorouracil, in previously untreated elderly patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type
      unresectable mCRC.
