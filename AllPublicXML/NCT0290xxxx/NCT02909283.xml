  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate determinants of cerebral oxygenation and perfusion at
      the microcirculatory level in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) using combined novel
      investigational tools: Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) perfusion MR (Magnetic Resonnance)
      imaging, brain Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) and red blood cell (RBC) rheological
      properties.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that brain perfusion and/or oxygenation modifications may be
      evidenced in SCA children who have no microarteriopathy and may correlate with
      hemorheological abnormalities and impaired vasomotion. A multimodal approach designed to
      study a. cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, b. flow motion properties and c. blood
      rheological parameters might help to describe the different processes involved in cerebral
      ischemia.

    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>ASL sequence (duration 4 min) : Regional brain tissue perfusion (expressed in mL/min/100g of tissue) will be measured in different lobes in both hemispheres and in the cerebellum. Pattern of perfusion will be analysed and measured.</description>

    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Bifrontal cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation monitored by NIRS (15 min). Spectral analyses (Fourrier transform) will be used to analyze the brain microvascular oxygen variability and calculate the flowmotion and vasomotion activities.</description>

    <measure>Description of the global assessment of RBC deformability</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The description of the global assessment of RBC deformability will be done via a global association of several biological parameters : RBC deformability at several shear stresses by ektacytometry, RBC aggregation properties by syllectometry and blood viscosity by cone-plate viscosimetry. Measurements will be made according to the international guidelines for standardisation in hemorheology and within 4/5 hrs of sampling</description>
