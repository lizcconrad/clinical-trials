    <textblock>
      This study plans to compare the efficacy of the nicotine patch / lorcaserin combination
      treatment vs. the nicotine patch alone in terms of leading to a reduction in smoking behavior
      and withdrawal symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to investigate the potential efficacy of a combination of two
      FDA-approved agents, nicotine patch and lorcaserin, for smoking cessation treatment. The
      nicotine patch which provides a sustained low dose of nicotine is a nicotine receptor
      agonist. Lorcaserin, a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (5-HT2C) agonist, is a drug
      that is FDA-approved for weight loss, and has also recently been shown to be efficacious for
      smoking cessation. Given that these drugs act through distinct mechanisms it is hoped that
      the combination will prove more efficacious than either drug alone. It is also hypothesized
      that the combination will reduce weight gain commonly seen after smoking cessation.

    <measure>Time-to-lapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 pre quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Two weeks after treatment is initiated, with nicotine patch + lorcaserin or nicotine patch alone, but still two weeks prior to the quit day, subjects will be evaluated in a modified version of the McKee Smoking Lapse Task. In this task smokers, who have been abstinent for 2 hours will be provided with the option to smoke at any time, but paid by the minute for remaining abstinent with progressively decreasing payments over an hour.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 pre quit day</time_frame>
    <description>At the study visit above (two week post treatment initiation but 2 weeks prior to quit day), withdrawal symptoms will be assessed after 2 hours of smoking abstinence using the Shiffman-Jarvik questionnaire, which consists of 33-items rated from 1 to 7, where 1= not at all, 2= very little, 3= a little, 4= moderately, 5= a lot, 6= quite a lot, and 7= extremely. The 33 items are grouped into 8 subscales: Craving, Negative Affect, Appetite, Arousal, Somatic - Anxiety, Somatic - G.I., Somatic - Respiratory Tract, and Habit Withdrawal. The range of scores for each subscale will be 1-7, with higher scores indicating more of the withdrawal symptom having been experienced.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 7-10 post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who reported continuous four-week abstinence from smoking (weeks 7-10 post target quit date), confirmed by expired air carbon monoxide (CO).</description>

    <measure>Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1-10 post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability of the lorcaserin + nicotine patch treatment will be assessed by tabulating the number of participants rating side effects &gt; &quot;moderate&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight Gain</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10 post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Among smoking-abstinent participants, weight gain relative to baseline will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-month Smoking Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who reported not smoking for the previous seven days when called for 6-month follow-up, confirmed by expired air carbon monoxide (CO).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Change in Ad libitum Smoking at End of Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 pre quit day</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effects of lorcaserin on ad libitum (ad lib) smoking, the percent decrease in reported number of cigarettes smoked from baseline to the end of week 2 (the day prior to the 2nd study visit) will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1-10 post quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability of the lorcaserin + nicotine patch treatment will be assessed by calculating adherence scores based on the number of days on which the study drugs were taken as directed between visits as reported by participants on diaries.</description>
