      The study aims to assess the impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on
      brain imaging and neurophysiological measures of cognitive control in patients with
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With a prevalence of nearly 3%, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most common
      psychiatric disorders in the US. The first line of treatment for OCD comprises
      pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT). Although adherence to these therapies has been shown to improve symptoms in at least
      half of patients, some have residual symptoms and a small percentage are refractory to
      standard therapies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may offer an alternate,
      less-invasive therapy.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, as confirmed by the Structured
             Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th
             Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (SCID).

          -  Subjects should have at least a moderate level of OCD severity as defined by a
             Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Scale (YBOCS) score of â‰¥ 20.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals diagnosed by the investigators with the following conditions: Bipolar
             Disorder (lifetime), any Psychotic Disorder (lifetime), history of substance abuse or
             dependence within the past year (expect nicotine and caffeine).

          -  An Axis II Personality Disorder, which in the judgment of the investigator may hinder
             the patient in completing the procedures required by the study protocol.

          -  Individuals with a clinically defined neurological disorder including, but not limited
             to: stroke, tics, space occupying brain lesion, any history of seizures except those
             therapeutically induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), history of cerebrovascular
             accident, transient ischemic attack within two years, cerebral aneurysm, dementia,
             Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Chorea, Multiple Sclerosis.

          -  Increased risk of seizure for any reason, including prior diagnosis of increased
             intracranial pressure (such as after large infarctions or trauma), or history of
             significant head trauma with loss of consciousness for &gt;5 minutes.

          -  History of treatment with rTMS therapy for any disorder.

          -  History of treatment with Deep Brain Stimulation.

          -  Cardiac pacemakers, implanted medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute, unstable
             cardiac disease.

          -  Intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants, or
             electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head, excluding the mouth,
             that cannot be safely removed.

          -  Current illicit drug use.
