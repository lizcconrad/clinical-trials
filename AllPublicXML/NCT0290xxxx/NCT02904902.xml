  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in Japanese
      subjects with moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to initiation of this study, global Phase 2b study and pivotal Phase III studies were
      completed in the Western countries and market authorization of adalimumab was approved in US
      and European Union (EU) for the treatment of subjects with HS. The differences between this
      study and global studies include sample size, study design, duration, and race.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants achieving Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HiSCR is defined as at least a 50% reduction in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count (AN count) with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to Baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants achieving AN count of 0, 1, or 2 at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with AN counts lowered to 0, 1, or 2 at Week 12 among participants with AN counts &gt;=3 at Baseline</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants achieving at least 30% reduction and at least 1 unit reduction from Baseline in Patient's Global Assessment of Skin Pain (NRS30) - at worst at Week 2 among participants with Baseline NRS &gt;=3</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's Global Assessment of Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale was used to assess the worst skin and average skin pain due to HS. Ratings for the 2 items range from 0 (no skin pain) to 10 (skin pain as bad as you can imagine). The assessments were completed on a daily diary by participants before they went to bed and responded to the items based on a recall period of the &quot;last 24 hours&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in modified Sartorius scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Sartorius Scale is used to quantify the severity of HS. Points are awarded for 12 body areas (left and right axillae, left and right sub/inframammary areas, intermammary area, left and right buttocks, left and right inguino-crural folds, perianal area, perineal area, and other): points were awarded for nodule (2 points for each); abscesses (4 points); fistulas (4 points); scar (1 point); and longest distance between two lesions (2-6 points, 0 if no lesions); and if lesions are separated buy normal skin (yes-0 point; no-6 points) The total Sartorius Scale is the sum of the 12 regional scores. Scale range will be 0 to infinite and larger scale represents higher severity of HS.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have a diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS);

          -  Participant must have any HS symptom at least 6 months prior to Baseline;

          -  HS lesions must be present in at least 2 distinct anatomic areas, one of which must be
             Hurley Stage II or Hurley Stage III;

          -  Participant must have stable HS for at least 2 months (60 days) prior to Screening and
             also at the Baseline visit;

          -  Participant must have a total AN count of greater than or equal to 3 at the Baseline
             visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with adalimumab or other anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy or
             participation in adalimumab trial;

          -  Any other active skin lesion or condition that may interfere with assessment of HS;

          -  Participants received antibiotic treatment for HS within 28 days prior to the Baseline
             visit other than those allowed per protocol. Participant on permitted oral antibiotic
             treatment (doxycycline or minocycline only) for HS who have not been on a stable dose
             for at least 28 days prior to the Baseline visit;

          -  Participants received prescription topical therapies for the treatment for HS within
             14 days prior to the Baseline visit;

          -  Participants received systemic non-biologic therapies with potential therapeutic
             impact for HS less than 28 days prior to the Baseline visit;

          -  Participants received oral concomitant analgesics (non-opioids and opioids) for
             HS-related pain within 14 days prior to the Baseline visit.
