  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) medical space, a relatively small number of patients
      follow through with elective surgeries to fix ailments like a deviated septum or occluded
      sinus passage. Patient understanding of their diagnosis and treatment plan is integral to
      compliance, which ultimately yields improved medical outcomes and better quality of life.
      Here the investigators report the usage of advanced inkjet 3D printing methods to develop a
      multimaterial replica of the patient's nasal sinus anatomy, derived from clinical X-ray
      Computed Tomography (CT) data. The final patient education model was developed over several
      iterations to optimize material properties, anatomical accuracy and overall display. A two
      arm, single center, randomized, prospective study was then performed in which 50 ENT surgical
      candidates (and an associated control group, n = 50) were given an explanation of their
      anatomy, disease state, and treatment options using the education model as an aid. Each
      patient was then surveyed for their self-rated understanding of their anatomy, disease, and
      treatment options.
