      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 5-FU infusion (Microinfusion of Medicine
      Percutaneously - MMP) is effective for Idiopathic Guttate Hypomelanosis (IGH) repigmentation
      compared to conventional Microneedling. MMP is a procedure done with tattoo devices using
      medication in place of ink.
