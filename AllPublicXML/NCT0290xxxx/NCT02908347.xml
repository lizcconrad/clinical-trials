  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IIa study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of oral MP1032 in
      patients with moderate to severe psoriasis over a period of 6 weeks. Secondary endpoints to
      evaluate clinical parameters for psoriasis during the 6 week treatment period and a 4-week
      follow up will provide an opportunity to perform a first assessment of oral MP1032's clinical
      efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.

      The study population will consist of 44 enrolled (40 completed) patients with moderate to
      severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients must be able to provide written consent and meet
      all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled exploratory pilot
      study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of systemic oral (po) administration
      of 100 mg MP1032 bid in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

      The study design consists of a 28-day screening/run-in period, a 42-day treatment period, 1
      day for the End of Treatment visit, and a 28-day follow-up period. Forty-four patients who
      meet the entry criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 100 mg
      MP1032 or placebo orally twice daily for 42 days. The goal is to have 40 patients (20 in each
      treatment group) complete the study.

      Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur on 3 designated study days. Safety will be monitored from
      the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the last follow-up visit on Day 71.

      Efficacy will be assessed on 6 designated study days using the following assessments: PASI,
      PGA, DLQI, mNAPSI, and EQ-5D 5L (VAS).

    <description>Incidence of patients with AEs will be determined by treatment group, where applicable.
Furthermore, the absolute and relative frequencies for patients with a given AE, as well as the number of events of the individual AEs that have occurred, will be determined within each treatment group and system organ class.
AEs will be collected throughout the study. Abnormal values received from Clinical Laboratory Safety Testing (hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis on Study Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57 and 71), Vital Signs (Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, tympanic body temperature and respiration rate on Study Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57 and 71), ECG (Study Days 1, 43 and 71) and Physical Examination (Study Days 1, 43 and 71) will also be handled as AE.</description>
