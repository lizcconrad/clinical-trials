  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor. This is the immunosuppression of reference for
      patients undergoing a first liver transplant. This treatment can prevent graft rejection, but
      can cause side effects including kidney failure (in 25% after the first year).

      Everolimus is an immunosuppressive that effectively prevents acute rejection in heart and
      kidney transplant recipients. It preserves renal function when it is started soon after the
      transplant, i.e. before a severe dysfunction is installed.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the liver transplant, early interruption of calcineurin inhibitors with a quick relay
      everolimus monotherapy preserves renal function and is associated with a lower acute
      rejection rate.

      We wish to assess whether the introduction of a de novo immunosuppression everolimus under
      protection of basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil and then low doses of
      corticosteroids, reduces the nephrotoxicity of immunosuppressive therapy in liver transplant
      patients, compared to a standard protocol with tacrolimus associated with mycophenolate
      mofetil and low dose corticosteroids.

    <description>The main objective of the study is to evaluate, in liver transplanted patients, the benefit in terms of prevention of renal failure, a regimen that includes a de novo introduction of everolimus instead of tacrolimus, in combination with mycophenolate mofetil and low doses of corticosteroids, to the extent that this benefit is not accompanied by an increased risk of graft loss or hepatic artery thrombosis.
Insofar as the objective of the study is to assess a risk / benefit ratio, the study has two main criteria.
Worsening renal function is validated before the prolonged decline (found on at least 3 assays carried out at least 3 months apart) over 30% of the creatinine clearance compared to the value at baseline . The date of the first evidence of this worsening of renal function is the date used to calculate the distribution of censored criterion.</description>
