  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a multi-component exercise program on
      physical function, physical activity and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older
      people recently discharged from hospital. The intervention consists of 32 group-based
      exercise sessions, performed twice a week. In addition the participants in the intervention
      group will be encouraged to perform an exercise program on their own, at least once weekly.
      The participants in the control group will be encouraged to exercise on their own, according
      to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on physical activity for adults aged
      65 and above.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older people who have been hospitalized often experience loss of function, increased risk of
      falls and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the post-discharge period. The
      reason for this is the cumulative effect of illness, bedrest during hospital stay and
      inactivity after discharge. Previous research indicates that exercise therapy should be an
      integrated part of the post-hospital treatment to prevent or postpone this functional decline
      and improve HRQOL. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      investigate the effect of a multi-component exercise program consisting of high intensity
      exercises on physical function, physical activity and HRQOL among older people living at home
      after discharge from hospital after treatment of an acute medical event.

    <description>Changes in physical function will be measured with The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). This test evaluates balance, mobility and muscle strength by examining an individual`s ability to stand with feet together side-by side, semitandem and tandem positions, time to walk 8ft and time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position five times. Each of the three tests is scored, based on performance between 0 and 4, leaving a maximum score of 12 for those individuals performing at the highest levels.</description>

    <description>This group will perform a multi-component exercise program twice a week for 16 weeks. The multi-component exercise program consists of endurance training, progressive strength exercises and balance exercises. The intervention will be individualised, but performed in groups of four to ten patients. The participants are also expected to do exercises on their own, at least once weekly.</description>
