  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic activity monitoring (EAM) devices are wearable electronic devices that monitor
      functional activity and provide personal feedback on activity progression. This study aims to
      determine if EAM can provide an objective, assessment of patient functional activity. The
      study will also examine the change in functional activity experienced by patients during the
      first cycle of chemotherapy. Another objective of the study will be to see if baseline
      functional activity and the change in functional activity that occurs during the first cycle
      of chemotherapy can be used to predict patient tolerability of subsequent cycles of
      chemotherapy.

    <description>This is a prospective, observational study. The study aims to examine the role of EAM as an objective, assessment of patient fitness in patients receiving chemotherapy for gastrointestinal malignancy. Physical activity level measured by EAM will be compared with standard measurement tools used by the oncology community to predict chemotherapy tolerability.</description>

    <description>All registered patients will receive a wearable EAM device that will measure their physical activity. Patients will wear this device around their wrist for the designated period of assessment. The EAM device has the potential to measure active minutes, number of steps, distance walked and number of floors climbed. For the purpose of this study the EAM data captured will focus on daily step count.</description>

    <intervention_name>Daily Questionnaire</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete this self-administered, paper-based questionnaire each day that they are expected to wear the EAM device. The questionnaire was designed specifically for the purpose of this study. It consists of 5 items that ask about the patient's perceived level of physical activity and fatigue in each 24 hour period that they have worn the EAM device. The daily questionnaires will be optional; however each participant will be encouraged to complete them.</description>
