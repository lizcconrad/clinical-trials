    <textblock>
      French Guiana is the French territory where the prevalence of HIV is highest. in order to
      determine the knowledge attitudes, beliefs, and practices among the target group of teenagers
      attending the public school system a survey was conducted in 2011. schools and classrooms
      were randomly selected, and a structured questionnaire was administered. Descriptive
      statistics were obtained and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine
      predictors of main outcomes such as age at first sex.

      the results will be used to guide prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections
      though the school system.
