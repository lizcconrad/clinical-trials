  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-principle research study designed to determine whether fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) can eliminate highly drug-resistant bacteria from the intestinal tract
      of renal transplant patients. The primary goal of this study is to test whether oral gut
      decontamination followed by FMT by enema delivery will result in decolonization of the
      intestinal tract of renal transplant patients shortly after solid organ transplantation,
      thereby preventing difficult to treat post-transplant infections.
