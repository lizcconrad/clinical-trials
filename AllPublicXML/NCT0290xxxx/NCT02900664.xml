    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to combine the PDR001 checkpoint inhibitor with each of four
      agents with immunomodulatory activity to identify the doses and schedule for combination
      therapy and to preliminarily assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacological and clinical
      activity of these combinations.
