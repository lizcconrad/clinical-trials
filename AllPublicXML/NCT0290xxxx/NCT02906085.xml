  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One third of migraine patients experience aura, i.e. dramatic, transient neurological
      symptoms, most often in the form of visual disturbances, that usually appear before the onset
      of migraine headache. The likely underlying mechanism of aura is known as cortical spreading
      depression, a wave of changes in electrical activity that slowly spreads in the outermost
      layer of the brain. It is currently not known what causes the aura to initiate in patients or
      what the relationship is between aura and migraine headache, e.g. if treatment targeted at
      aura mechanisms will prevent subsequent headache. Due to the short-lasting and unpredictable
      nature of aura, the only possible approach for systematic investigations is to experimentally
      trigger aura, but currently no method for aura-triggering is available.

      The overall goal of the proposed project is to reveal the earliest mechanisms of the migraine
      attack by investigating the initiating factors of aura in the migraine brain.

      Current animal evidence indicates that infusion of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a naturally occurring
      signaling molecule released from blood vessels, is safe and very likely to trigger migraine
      aura in patients.

      In this project the investigators aim to study the effects of ET-1 on the human brain, to
      investigate aura-inducing effects of ET-1 in patients and to develop a safe and reliable
      method for the experimental induction of migraine aura using ET-1.
