  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic bile duct stone (BDS) removal is a well-established treatment; however, the
      preference for basket or balloon catheters for extraction is operator-dependent It is
      reported that complete endoscopic treatment with a single catheter is more likely when
      choosing a balloon catheter over a basket catheter for extraction of BDSs≤10mm. However, a
      study comparing the two catheter types in patients with periampullary diverticulum has not
      been performed, and there is no strong basis on which to recommend the balloon catheter as a
      first-line stone removal device. The investigators therefore conducted a multicenter
      prospective randomized trial to compare catheter performance in patients with periampullary
      diverticulum.

      A prospective, multi-center, investigator sponsored, randomized controlled trial, 80 subjects
      will be randomly assigned to groups that were treated with basket or balloon catheters.

      A descriptive analysis will be performed on primary endpoint, containing frequency of number
      and percentage of patients. A two proportion equality test will be conducted to explore
      whether incidence rates are different.Descriptive statistics including number (N), mean,
      median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, will be produced for all continuous
      variables. Frequency tables of number (N) and percentage of subjects will be produced for all
      categorical variables.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is the rate of complete clearance of the duct in two groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary end point was the rate of complete removals of stones within 10 min.</time_frame>
    <description>It has a contrast-injection hole above the balloon for the performance of balloon occlusion cholangiography (BOC). For balloon stone extraction, clearance was confirmed if no residual stones remained after the final BOC and balloon sweep. For basket stone extraction, duct clearance by the basket catheter was judged to have been completed when no filling defect was found. Complete clearance of the duct by the basket catheter was defined as no filling defect (other than air) on BOC after a balloon sweep.</description>

    <measure>Secondary endpoints is the rate of adverse events such as perforation, pancreatitis,cholangitis,hyperamylasemia and bleeding.</measure>

    <description>If the serum amylase of patients elevation and 3 times higher than the normal values after ERCP 24 hours in patients, who also have clinical symptoms, without other acute abdominal diseases,such as gastrointestinal perforation,acute cholecystitia and acute cholangitis and etc. In this condition, it will be defined PEP(post-ERCP pancreatitis). Hyperamylasemia will be defined as the serum amylase 3 times more than the upper normal values, without clinical symptoms. During the study, any unexpected medical issue will be called adverse event.</description>
