      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, dose escalation study to document the
      effects of adventitial delivery of temsirolimus (Torisel) after revascularization of lesions
      below the knee in symptomatic patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Up to 60 patients
      (20 low-dose, 20 high-dose and 20 control) at up to 15 sites in the United States. This study
      will assess the safety and effectiveness of Bullfrog Micro-Infusion Device adventitial
      deposition of temsirolimus in reducing intimal hyperplasia, inflammatory markers and
      composite safety endpoints in patients with clinical evidence of chronic critical limb
      ischemia after revascularization of one or more angiographically significant lesion(s) in
      below-knee popliteal or tibial vessels.

          -  Hemodynamically significant inflow lesion (â‰¥50% DS) or occlusion in the ipsilateral
             iliac, SFA, or popliteal arteries (P1 and P2) in which there is failure to
             successfully treat and obtain a &lt;30% residual stenosis post-revascularization, with
             bailout stenting as needed (in-flow lesions should be treated prior to treating the
             target lesion)

          -  Target lesion length is &gt;30 cm as measured from proximal normal vessel to distal
             normal vessel

          -  Total length of lesions treated during the case (including target lesion, inflow
             lesions, and other non-target lesions) &gt;30 cm

          -  Use of alternative therapy, e.g. radiation therapy, drug-eluting stents (DES) or
             drug-eluting balloon/drug-coated balloons (DEB/DCB) as part of the target lesion
             treatment or during the previous 2 months within the target lesion

          -  Aneurysm in the target vessel

          -  Acute thrombus in the target limb

             allowed

          -  Heavy eccentric or concentric calcification at target lesion, which in the judgment of
