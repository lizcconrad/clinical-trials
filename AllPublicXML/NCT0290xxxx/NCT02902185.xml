  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV replication can be effectively suppressed and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS)
      can be prevented with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, HIV-infected
      people must remain on treatment continuously to avoid viral rebound and progression to AIDS.
      HIV persistence is thought to stem primarily from the presence of integrated copies of the
      proviral genome within long-lived cells. Because active viral gene expression causes cell
      death due to viral cytopathic effects and the immune response, long-lived cells likely harbor
      transcriptionally silent, latent provirus. HIV-1 persistence in long-lived cellular
      reservoirs remains a major barrier to a cure. HDACi have the potential to activate (&quot;Kick&quot;)
      these latently infected cells. This will make the HIV infected cells visible to the immune
      system; the immune response and antiretrovirals(ARVs) will be able to attack and eliminate
      (&quot;Kill&quot;) the infected cells. This study is subsequent to our NCT02513901. The purpose of this
      study is to verify the efficacy of multi-dose Chidamide in combination with antiretroviral
      therapy in HIV-infected adults with suppressed viral load in a randomized controlled clinical
      trial.

      Sixty participants will be recruited and stratified by their CD4 cell count(30 for &lt;500
      cells/μL and 30 for ≥500 cells/μL). Each layer was 1:1 randomly divided into Chidamide group
      or Placebo-controlled group.Chidamide and Placebo will be administrated 10mg each time, twice
      a week, interval not less than 3 days. Chidamide and Placebo intervention will last 12
      consecutive weeks. All participants will keep their antiretroviral therapy during this study.

      This study will last for 96 weeks, involving 16 study visits(Screening, Week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12,
      14, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96) for every participant. At the screening visit,
      participants will give a medical history and will undergo a physical exam; blood samples will
      be collected. If participants agree, their blood samples may be stored for future research.
