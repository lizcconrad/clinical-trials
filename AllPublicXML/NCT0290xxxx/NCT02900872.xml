        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  acute cervical tenderness or neck pain fulfilling the characteristics of an idiopathic
             neck pain syndrome as defined by the International Headache Society in 1988

          -  the performing of a diagnostic imaging like MRI, CT or US of the cervical area with a
             dedicated vessel analysis

          -  unilateral or bilateral abnormalities of common carotid, carotid bifurcation or
             internal carotid arteries on dedicated vessel imaging.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients without imaging, or without dedicated vessel analysis

          -  patients presenting with pain caused by a clearly identified vascular disease on
             dedicated vessel analysis imaging such as carotid occlusion, carotid dissection,
             vasculitis like giant cell arteritis.

          -  patients with no abnormality on cervical or vessel imaging
