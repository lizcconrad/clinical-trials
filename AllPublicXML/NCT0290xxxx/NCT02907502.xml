      To assess growth of children (enrolled between 11.5 and 13.5 months) fed with two
      iso-energetic, young-child formulas with different protein content during the second year of
      life

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate in a randomized double-blind parallel-group trial the
      growth and metabolic effects of different contributions of protein to total energy intakes in
      healthy children during the second year of life
