  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREMEDIC is a prospective, observational study. Patients hospitalized for Systolic Heart
      Failure will be enrolled and health data will be collected at hospital admission and during
      hospital stay. No data will be collected before detailed information is given to the patient
      and a non-opposition is obtained.

      The aim of this observational and prospective study is to evaluate the concordance actual
      patient management during the in hospital treatment of heart failure and the therapeutic
      proposals from a medical algorithmic decision support software.

      Main Objective:

      The aim of this observational and prospective study is to evaluate retrospectively the
      concordance between the actual systolic heart failure patient management during the
      inhospital treatment of heart failure (as recorded from the usual healthcare data collected)
      and the therapeutic proposals from a medical algorithmic decision support software.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To study the evolution of biological, hepatic and cardiopulmonary ultrasound usual markers in
      hospitalization, in connection with the duration of hospitalization and drug administered.
