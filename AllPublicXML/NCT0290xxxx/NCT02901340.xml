      The purpose of the study is to investigate third trimester fetal renal artery doppler indices
      in borderline idiopathic isolated oligohydramnios and relationship between neonatal outcomes.

      During a routine pregnancy examination at 34-37 weeks gestation, the fetus was evaluated
      using ultrasound with the Toshiba Xario 200 3.5-megahertz probe. Fetal biometric measurements
      were obtained and placental structure and the amniotic fluid amount were evaluated in four
      quadrants. After detailed ultrasonography of the fetus, eligible pregnant women were included
      in the study.

      Borderline idiopathic isolated oligohydramnios was defined according to the four quadrants
      technical with ultrasound examination and diagnosed with amniotic fluid index &gt;5.0 and
      ≤8.0cm. After first ultrasound examination all patients in borderline isolated
      oligohydramnios group were hydrated with one to two liters of water daily. All patients
      monitored with non stress test and amniotic fluid index twice weekly until delivery after
      treatment with hydration.

      For evaluating renal artery blood flow, an axial image of the fetal abdomen was obtained at
      the level of the fetal kidneys. Using color flow Doppler, the renal arteries were evaluated
      at the level of their origin from the abdominal aorta. The Doppler gate was placed within the
      lumen in a straight segment of the vessel. A minimum of three consecutive waveforms was used
      to calculate the PI. The umbilical artery Doppler measurements were studied in a free loop of
      cord, far from the fetus and placenta. pulsatile index and resistance index values were
      recorded.

      The study consisted of two groups. The first group was formed of the patients who had normal
      amniotic volume and meets the inclusion criteria. In second group the investigators included
      patients who diagnosed borderline idiopathic isolated oligohydramnios. After delivery the
      investigators compared fetal renal artery doppler indices and neonatal outcomes between
      groups.

        The study population was consisted of 2 groups and included pregnant women in between 34
        and 37. weeks of gestation for both groups. The normal pregnancy group was consisted of 100
        healthy pregnant women whom excluded borderline idiopathic isolated oligohydramniosis , the
        main group was consisted of 40 pregnant women with diagnosed borderline idiopathic isolated
        oligohydramniosis.
