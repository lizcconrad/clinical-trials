      This investigation assessed the effects of asymptomatic BV on daily genital tract shedding of
      HSV-2 by determining shedding frequency before and after treatment of asymptomatic BV.

    <textblock>
      An important contributor to the epidemic spread of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is its
      high frequency of asymptomatic shedding in the genital tract, as transmission usually occurs
      during these periods of subclinical reactivation of the virus. Therefore, an improved
      understanding of the risk factors associated with HSV-2 shedding is needed.

      Preliminary data suggests that bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be associated with increased
      genital tract shedding of HSV-2. As BV is the most common cause of vaginal symptoms in
      reproductive age women, even modest associations with genital tract shedding of HSV-2 would
      result in substantial attributable risks for transmission of the virus.

      This study assessed the effects of asymptomatic BV on daily genital tract shedding of HSV-2
      by determining shedding frequency before and after treatment of asymptomatic BV. Twelve HSV-2
      seropositive women with asymptomatic BV were enrolled. These women were instructed to
      self-collect daily swab specimens for HSV-2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) analysis from the lower genital tract for one month. At the end of the one
      month follow-up visit, each participant completed a one week course of oral metronidazole for
      treatment of BV. This was followed by daily home collection of genital tract swab specimens
      for an additional one month.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women 18-26 years old of age

          -  Only those women who deny symptoms of vaginal discharge and odor but who meet Amsel
             and Gram stain criteria for the diagnosis of BV will be eligible

          -  Amsel criteria (3 of the following 4 conditions) (10):

          -  Homogenous vaginal discharge

          -  Vaginal pH &gt; 4.5

          -  Positive amine (sniff) test

          -  Presence of clue cells in the vaginal fluid

          -  Gram stain criteria (11):
