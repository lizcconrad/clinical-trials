  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to improve the primary care treatment of veterans with
      alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is a common behavioral health problem among veterans
      treated in VA primary care clinics. However, assessment and treatment of alcohol dependence
      in primary care remains problematic. Assessment of veterans with positive alcohol use screens
      may not always be completed and referrals to specialty care may not always be made. Moreover,
      the use of medications for alcohol dependence among veterans is rare, despite VA treatment
      guidelines that recommend such use. Finally, when medications are prescribed, patients may
      have difficulties with adherence.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of long-acting injectable
      naltrexone provided through primary care (LAN/PC) versus long-acting injectable naltrexone in
      the specialized chemical dependence clinic (LAN/CDC). The secondary aim is to obtain
      preliminary assessments of the relative effectiveness of long-acting injectable naltrexone in
      primary care versus in the chemical dependence clinic.
