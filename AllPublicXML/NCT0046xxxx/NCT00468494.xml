  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery performed during general anesthesia induces a stress effect on the body. Our plan is
      to identify population at risk of hyperglycemia during perioperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to define the relationship between time profile of glucose
      control before, during and after surgery with patient variables, surgical variables and
      anesthetic variables. Serum glucose levels will be measured preoperatively and then at 30
      minute intervals during surgery. Pain score, pain medication and glucose levels will be
      measured in the post anesthesia recovery room. Subjects will be contacted 2 weeks following
      the date of surgery to determine the incidence of postoperative complications.
