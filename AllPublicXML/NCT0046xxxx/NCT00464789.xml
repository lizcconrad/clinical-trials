    <textblock>
      Bazedoxifene/Conjugated Estrogens (BZA/CE) is an investigational drug that is being developed
      for treatment of menopause. The purpose of this trial is to compare a new manufacturing
      process for making BZA/CE to the current process by assessing the way it is absorbed into the
      blood.
