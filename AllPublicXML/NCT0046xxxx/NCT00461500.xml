    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over Weeks 5-12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 5-12</time_frame>
    <description>Mini Wright Peak Flow Meter used to allow patients to monitor their asthma - Peak Flow (or PEF - peak expiratory flow) is a measurement of how fast you can blow out. When someone is well, their PEF is higher - when the airways are narrow (as in asthma), PEF is lower. Readings based on age, height and gender.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pre-dose FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second) Through Week 12 (Using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Approach)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air (in liters) you can blow out within one second. A spirometer is the device used to measure FEV1. With normal lungs and airways you can normally blow out most of the air from your lungs within one second. Age, height and gender is used to determine what is normal. Change from baseline could have been measured at any time during the study (up to Week 12), using the LOCF. In the LOCF approach, for each individual, missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that variable.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pre-dose (Percent Predicted) FEV1 Through Week 12 (Using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Approach)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percent predicted is based on tables of normal values that use variables such as age, gender, and weight as a method of standardization. Spirometry results are expressed as a percentage, and are generally considered abnormal if less than 80 percent of the normal predicted value. Change from baseline could have been measured at any time during the study (up to Week 12), using the LOCF. In the LOCF approach, for each individual, missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that variable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in FEV1 Reversibility Through Week 12 (Using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Approach)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Reversibility is calculated as the percentage improvement of FEV1 from baseline. Change from baseline could have been measured at any time during the study (up to Week 12), using the LOCF. In the LOCF approach, for each individual, missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that variable. Percent reversibility of FEV1 was calculated as follows: (Post-bronchodilator FEV1 - pre-bronchodilator FEV1)/pre-bronchodilator FEV1 x 100. A negative difference indicates less reversibility.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pre-dose Forced Expiratory Vital Capacity (FVC) Through Week 12 (Using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Approach)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FVC is the total amount of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration, measured in liters. A spirometer is the device used to measure FVC. Age, height and gender is used to determine what is normal. Change from baseline could have been measured at any time during the study (up to Week 12), using the LOCF. In the LOCF approach, for each individual, missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that variable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Pre-dose FEF 25-75% (Forced Expiratory Flow) Through Week 12 (Using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Approach)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Forced Expiratory Flow 25-75% (measured by a spirometer) is the average flow (or speed) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of the expiration. Age, height, and gender is used to determine what is normal. Change from BL could have been measured at any time during the study (up to Week 12), using the LOCF (for each individual, missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that variable). Change from BL is measured as percentage of predicted value, with height, gender, age, and race as variables (percentage of predicted value at endpoint minus value at BL).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Exacerbation During 12-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>12-Week Treatment Period (Week 1 through Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will record exacerbations (defined as temporary PEF decrease, increase in salbutamol use) in a Daily Record Card (DRC). The number of events are categorized as those that showed a deterioration in asthma requiring administration of oral corticosteroids and/or a deterioration in asthma requiring emergency room visit and/or hospitalization (hosp.).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pre-dose FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second) Through Week 12 (Using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Approach)</title>
        <description>FEV1 is the amount of air (in liters) you can blow out within one second. A spirometer is the device used to measure FEV1. With normal lungs and airways you can normally blow out most of the air from your lungs within one second. Age, height and gender is used to determine what is normal. Change from baseline could have been measured at any time during the study (up to Week 12), using the LOCF. In the LOCF approach, for each individual, missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that variable.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FEV1 Reversibility Through Week 12 (Using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Approach)</title>
        <description>Reversibility is calculated as the percentage improvement of FEV1 from baseline. Change from baseline could have been measured at any time during the study (up to Week 12), using the LOCF. In the LOCF approach, for each individual, missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that variable. Percent reversibility of FEV1 was calculated as follows: (Post-bronchodilator FEV1 – pre-bronchodilator FEV1)/pre-bronchodilator FEV1 x 100. A negative difference indicates less reversibility.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Pre-dose FEF 25-75% (Forced Expiratory Flow) Through Week 12 (Using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Approach)</title>
        <description>Forced Expiratory Flow 25-75% (measured by a spirometer) is the average flow (or speed) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of the expiration. Age, height, and gender is used to determine what is normal. Change from BL could have been measured at any time during the study (up to Week 12), using the LOCF (for each individual, missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that variable). Change from BL is measured as percentage of predicted value, with height, gender, age, and race as variables (percentage of predicted value at endpoint minus value at BL).</description>

        <description>7-point scale where 1=total impairment and 7=no impairment. Questions contain 32 items in four domains. Domains include Activity Limitation (11 items), Symptoms (12 items), Emotional Function (5 items), and Environmental Stimuli (4 items). 32 items produce one overall quality of life score. The 7 points scoring are different and depend on the item : they are the translation in French of the original questionnaire from Juniper. Possible AQLQ scores range from 1 to 7 (the mean of all the questions).</description>
