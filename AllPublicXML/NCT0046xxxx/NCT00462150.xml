  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is threefold: 1) to develop a home-based emotional disclosure
      intervention inducing core elements of change (emotional engagement, cognitive restructuring,
      and positive future directedness); 2) to examine in a randomized controlled trial in patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis the induction of the core elements and the feasibility of the
      intervention for home application; and, 3) to examine the psychological, clinical, and
      physiological effects of the adapted emotional disclosure intervention and the modulating
      role of cognitive-emotional change and individual differences in emotion regulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional disclosure has been suggested to alleviate psychological and physical stress in
      chronically ill people. Emotional engagement, cognitive restructuring, and positive future
      directedness are considered core elements to induce change in emotional disclosure
      interventions. The aim of our randomized controlled trial in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis is to examine the psychological, clinical, and physiological effects of an
      emotional disclosure intervention adapted for home application and the modulating role of
      cognitive-emotional change and individual differences in emotion regulation.
