      Group of 100 patients with CHF, NYHA II-IY will be followed for 1 years in outpatient clinic
      of our hospital for hospitalization, death, 6 min walking protocol, number of decompensation
      as a primary end point. 50 patients will be treated according usual practice in outpatient
      clinics and in 50 patients will be additionally used level of NT Pro BNP as additional
      parameter.If level NT Pro BNP will be goes down will not be changes in treatment regiment. If
      level of NT Pro BNP will be increased treatment will be intensified.At the end of 1 year
      follow up we will compare the result of two strategies.
