  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of burn injury on the human immune system
      with a focus on cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and the immunologic correlates of latent
      viral reactivation.

      Subjects will be patients admitted to the North Carolina Jaycee Burn Center with burn injury.

      Blood samples will be collected over time and will be evaluated for CMV reactivation and
      immune cell phenotype.

      The purpose of this research study is to learn about infections and the immune system in
      people who suffer from burn injuries. The immune system changes after burn injury and
      infection is one of the most common complications. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that most
      people are exposed to early in life; once you are exposed it lays inactive in your body
      forever. When the immune system is suppressed, this virus can reactivate. We would like to
      measure how this virus makes copies of itself in the blood stream in people with a burn
      injury and to look at cell markers of the immune system.

      This study involves baseline and weekly blood draws for approximately 8 weeks. If blood tests
      show CMV infection, further monitoring of blood work may be needed after eight weeks.
