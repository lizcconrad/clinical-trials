      This study is evaluating possible non-intraocular pressure (IOP) related effects of the
      alpha-1 agonist brimonidine in human subjects affected by a progressive glaucomatous optic
      neuropathy. Brimonidine was proven as neuroprotective in several pre-clinical animal studies.

    <textblock>
      Patients with open angle glaucoma and a history of relative stability of the visual field are
      followed for 18 months. A visual field is measured every 3 months for a total number of n = 6
      eligible fields at the end of this phase. Then, those eyes showing progression of the field
      (i.e. deterioration of th eexisting glaucoma), are randomized to receive either 0.2%
      brimonidine tartrate eyedrops b.i.d. or 360° argon laser trabeculoplasty in one session.
      Either treatment will be put &quot;on top&quot; of the pre-existing anti-glaucoma therapy. Then, a
      further 18-month phase is planned, with a sequnece of field taken at the same pace as the
      previous phase. Progression is detected (and measured) acording to a trend-analysis (i.e.
      regression vs time of single points and of clusters of adjacent points).
