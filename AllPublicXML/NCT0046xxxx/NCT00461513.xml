      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a patient-centered disease management intervention
      for VA patients with heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background/Rationale: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality in the VA. Disease management is a promising strategy to improve care and outcomes,
      but evidence supporting CHF disease management is inconsistent and open questions remain.
      Prior studies have not evaluated a multi-modal intervention combining multidisciplinary
      collaborative care, telemonitoring, promotion of patient self-care, and an explicit
      intervention for comorbid depression, which is a barrier to optimal CHF care and outcomes.
      Moreover, the effectiveness of CHF disease management has not been evaluated in the VA.

      Objective(s): We propose to evaluate a Patient-Centered Disease Management (PCDM)
      intervention that includes case finding, collaborative care management for both CHF and
      comorbid depression, and home telemonitoring. The primary aim will be to ascertain whether
      the PCDM intervention results in better patient health status (i.e. symptom burden,
      functional status, and quality of life) than usual care. Secondary aims will include
      assessment of whether the intervention will reduce hospitalizations or mortality, result in
      more guideline-concordant care, and reduce depression while increasing patient medication
      adherence, self-efficacy and satisfaction with treatment.

      Methods: We propose a 3-year, multi-site randomized study. VA patients with CHF from 4 VA
      Medical Centers (Denver, Palo Alto, Richmond, and Seattle) and their affiliated clinics who
      have diminished CHF-specific health status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
      scores&lt;50) will be eligible. We will randomize enrolled patients to a 12-month PCDM
      intervention versus usual care (target 300 patients in each arm). The PCDM intervention will
      include collaborative care management for CHF and comorbid depression and daily
      telemonitoring. Patient self-care will be promoted through the telemonitoring intervention
      and the depression intervention. The primary analysis will be a comparison of change in
      health status (KCCQ scores) between enrollment and 12 months for the intervention versus
      usual care groups. Secondary analyses will include comparison of rates of hospitalization and
      death, depressive symptoms, the proportion of patients with guideline concordant CHF care,
      medication adherence, 6-minute walk test, self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction. In
      addition, cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. All analyses will be intention to
      treat.

      Impact: If successful, the proposed intervention will improve the quality of care and
      outcomes of veterans with CHF and be cost effective. The intervention has the potential to
      serve as model for other disease management interventions in the VA, and is designed as an
      'effectiveness' trial to enhance implementation. This study will be a joint effort of the CHF
      and IHD QUERI groups, Patient Care Services, and Office of Care Coordination. The study
      directly addresses several aims of the recently published 'QUERI: A New Direction' position
      statement, including: a) partnership between QUERI groups; b) explicit collaborative ties
      between QUERI and 'operational' components of the VA (i.e. Patient Care Services and Office
      of Care Coordination); c) focus beyond a single disease entity (i.e. CHF and depression); and
      d) clinical studies of interventions that might be candidates for national VA implementation.
      Moreover, this study specifically engages patients in their care and emphasizes quality of
      life outcomes, both of central import to the VA health care mission.

    <measure>Change in Chronic Heart Failure Health Status Between Baseline and 12 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was average change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score. This is reported for each group (Intervention and Usual Care). The average for each group and standard deviation are reported. A positive score change represents an improvment in overall patient health status for the group of patients with congestive heart failure. A negative score change represents a worsening in overall patient health status for the group of patients with congestive heart failure.</description>

    <description>The PCDM intervention will include evaluation of CHF care by the collaborative care team, with diagnostic and therapeutic treatment recommendations based on current ACC/AHA national clinical practice guidelines, daily telemonitoring and patient self-care support utilizing the VA telemonitoring system, and screening and treatment for comorbid depression. The Collaborative Care (CC) team at each site will consist of a primary care provider, cardiologist, and psychiatrist, who are local opinion leaders, as well as a nurse site coordinator and pharmacist. For a given intervention patient, there will be an initial assessment of care by the CC team following the enrollment visit. Each intervention patient will be re-reviewed by the CC team a minimum of 2 additional times (at 6-weeks and 6 months). In addition, patients will have daily telemonitoring, and their care will be reviewed by the CC team if the telemonitoring data suggests clinical deterioration.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the usual care arm will continue to receive care at the discretion of their regular VA providers (for a given patient, this could include cardiology specialty care in addition to PCP care, participation in site-specific CHF programs such as CHF patient education classes, etc.), in direct continuity with the care they were receiving prior to enrollment. Patients in the usual care group will also be given information sheets that outline self-care for CHF, and will be provided with a scale, if needed, at the enrollment visit. Patients in the usual care group will have the same amount of interaction with the study team as the intervention patients (i.e. complete questionnaires at the same frequency; have the same study visits). PCPs of usual care patients will be notified of the results of all screening studies (patient survey results, lab tests) as we have done in previous studies.</description>

    <description>Disease management has emerged as a promising strategy to improve the outcomes of patients with CHF. Disease management in this study will use a multidisciplinary collaborative care, leveraging health information technology, and focusing on patient self-care.Collaborative care is the use of multidisciplinary teams to deliver evidence-based treatment to a defined population of patients with chronic illness.</description>

          <title>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Overall Score</title>
          <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score ranges from 0-100, where higher scores represent better overall patient health status among patients with congestive heart failure. Here we report the mean and standard deviation of the baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score for the Intervention and Usual Care groups.</description>

        <title>Change in Chronic Heart Failure Health Status Between Baseline and 12 Months.</title>
        <description>The primary outcome was average change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score. This is reported for each group (Intervention and Usual Care). The average for each group and standard deviation are reported. A positive score change represents an improvment in overall patient health status for the group of patients with congestive heart failure. A negative score change represents a worsening in overall patient health status for the group of patients with congestive heart failure.</description>
