  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain sufficient continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data in
      a manner that provides clinical information that is not available using conventional
      self-monitored blood glucose. Currently, a formal method does not exist for evaluating CGM
      data except for looking at each glucose reading across the days a CGM system has been worn
      and evaluating it based on clinical practice experience. The hope is that a mathematical
      model can be developed that will enable health care providers to quickly and easily determine
      what changes in diabetes treatment need to be made after CGM data is obtained.

      There are two purposes to the study. First, to use an investigational device, the FreeStyle
      Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System (Abbott Diabetes Care) to obtain
      sufficient longitudinal data in order to develop a method for reporting CGM data in a manner
      that provides clinical information that is not available using conventional SMBG. The
      long-term goad is to determine the manner and degree to which CGM contributes to clinical
      decision-making. Because of the evidence that glucose regulation may be indirectly related to
      blood pressure levels, a second purpose of the study is to monitor variation in BP control by
      means of self-monitored BP.
