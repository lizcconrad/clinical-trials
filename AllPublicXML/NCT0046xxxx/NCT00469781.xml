  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if twice-daily dosing of prednisolone (Pred
      Forte) is as effective as four-times-daily dosing of prednisolone for the prevention of
      retinal thickening and cystoid macular edema (CME) when either regimen is used concomitantly
      with twice-daily bromfenac.
