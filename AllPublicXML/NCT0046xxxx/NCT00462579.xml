  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that panresistant strains of Acinetobacter species may be selected
      by antibiotic use [4], may be transmitted from person to person [5], and may be passed via
      environmental contamination [6]. Surveillance for panresistant Acinetobacter species should
      be a priority, given the lack of antibiotic options for the treatment of these infections.
      There are currently no data on the antibiotic susceptibility of Acinetobacter species or on
      the rates of panresistant organisms. The elucidation of potential risk factors for resistant
      strains of Acinetobacter is therefore an important task, and the use of alternative
      antibiotics should be considered in ICUs where these strains are endemic.

      The elucidation of potential risk factors for resistant strains of Acinetobacter is therefore
      an important task, and the use of alternative antibiotics should be considered in ICUs where
      these strains are endemic.he following information will be collected: age, sex, occupation,
      hospital location at the time of positive culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), date of
      positive culture, prior hospitalization, receipt of outpatient dialysis, home care or other
      regular medical care (eg, outpatient chemotherapy), presence of invasive devices, receipt of
      antibiotics, including their type and whether they were adequate for the resistance profile
      of the organism, prior positive microbiologic cultures, time and location of positive
      cultures, underlying diseases and severity of illness, presence of urinary or intravascular
      devices, recent immunomodulative therapies or radiation therapy, physical exam findings,
      laboratory and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage within 30 days of onset of the
      infection, microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism
      identified, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information,
      medications, clinical outcome,gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and past medical history. We
      will collect information retrospectively.
