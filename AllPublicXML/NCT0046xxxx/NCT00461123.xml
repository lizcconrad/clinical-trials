  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The greenlight laser has an absorption maximum which is exactly the same as for hemoglobin.
      In the presence of hemoglobin, its application causes vaporization of the tissue and this
      effect depends on the concentration of hemoglobin in the respective tissue. Therefore,
      increase of blood-flow in the tissue (here: prostate gland) should exert better efficacy of
      the laser application and consequently shortening of the required duration of laser
      application.
