  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of maximal support of community
      pharmacies to implement a pharmaceutical care model for establishing and - if necessary -
      improving adherence to antihypertensive medication in patients with medication-resistant
      hypertension.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in large parts of the world. Hypertension
      is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although hypertension treatment has
      improved in the last decade, the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy still needs
      attention. Adherence to medication appears to play an important role in that.

      Pharmacists can support the general practitioners in their efforts to optimize
      antihypertensive therapy, by establishing adherence to medication of patients with
      hypertension in spite of the use of one or more antihypertensive drugs. This is performed
      with the electronic Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS®). Registered adherence and
      accompanying blood pressure are discussed with the patient by the GP.

      Implementation of the above-mentioned intervention is studied in two randomized groups of
      pharmacies. One group receives minimal support in the intervention, the other group also
      receives interactive educational meetings, reminders and feedback, and support of
      multiprofessional cooperation.

    <description>experimental pharmacists follow an extensive implementation programme. They attend two interactive half a day educational meetings tailored to individual needs: one at start of the intervention, and one in May or September 2007. Special attention is given to multiprofessional cooperation with general practitioners and nurse practitioners. Additionally, guided by their own project planning pharmacists receive three or more telephone calls, both as a reminder, feedback, and in order to investigate whether they need any more help.</description>
