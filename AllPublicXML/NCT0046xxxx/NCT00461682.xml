    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Pain Score to Rectal Distensions at Pre-dose and up to 6 Hours (h) Post-dose of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-dose) and up to 6 hours post-dose of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>This analysis was performed at 12, 24, 36 and 48 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) which was above the baseline operating pressure threshold. Participants assessed the cough severity and urge to cough using VAS immediately prior to capsaicin challenge. No results were reported since the study objectives were not met due to the early study termination and withdrawal of participant. Average of Day -1 and pre-dose was planned as Baseline for VAs assessment. The VAS score was planned to be analyzed on Day-1, Day 1, 2 hours, and 24 hours. Average daily pain scores as captured in participant diary cards were planned to be summarized descriptively and planned to be analyzed. The 11 point pain intensity numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Worst pain imaginable&quot; was planned to be used for the subjective assessment of the pain.</description>

    <measure>Rectal Sensory Thresholds to Thermal Stimulation (Contact Heat Device, Values Reported as in Study) at Pre-dose and 6h Post-dose of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose) and 6h post-dose of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Visceral hypersensitivity is defined as reduced pain and discomfort threshold to rectal stimuli. Rectal hypersensitivity was correlated with the degree of rectal hypersensitivity (up-regulation of TRPV-1 receptors) as measured by rectal thermal stimulation. Ongoing rectal pain intensity scale is 11-point numeric rating scale, where 0=Unnoticeable/No Pain, 10=Unbearable/Worst Pain. An average of daily scores over 1 week pre-dose and 1 week post-dose was recorded. Single measurements pre-dose and at hourly intervals within 6 hours post-dose were also recorded. Participants were planned to stay in the hospital for 6h post-dose and were planned to be discharged when physician was satisfied with their medical condition. No results were reported since the study objectives were not met due to the early study termination and withdrawal of participant. Participants assessed the cough severity and urge to cough using VAS immediately prior to capsaicin challenge.</description>

    <measure>Somatic Heat Pain Thresholds (Hand and Foot) Assessed Pre-dose and 6h Post-dose of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose) and upto 0-6h post-dose for each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Evoked potentials were to be recorded from midline electrodes by placing a ground electrode on temporal lobe region. A low cut off filter with a time constant of 1.06103 and a frequency of 0.15 hertz (Hz) and a high cut off filter of 100Hz was to be applied. The impedance from all electrodes was maintained below 5 ohms (Ω) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, digitized at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. Responses from ten stimuli were to be recorded from each participant with the thermode placed over foot and one hand (non-dominant side). The thermode heating rate was set at 70 degree Celsius per second (°C/s) and the cooling rate at 40°C/s. The baseline temperature was 32 °C, destination temperature 51 °C, and stimulus interval approximately of 7 seconds. The participants were allowed to withdraw any time. No results were reported since the study objectives were not met due to the early study termination and withdrawal of participant.</description>

    <measure>Contact Heat-evoked Potentials (CHEPs) - Optional, Assessed Pre-dose and 6h Post-dose of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose) and 6h post-dose of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>For heat pain threshold measurement, temperature of the thermode was gradually increased from the baseline (32°C) at a rate of 1°C/s. The ramp was stopped and the temperature of the thermode was returned to the Baseline. This was repeated three times. The threshold temperatures and the average value were recorded by the computer. If the thermode temperature reached 50°C without the participant responding, the ramp was stopped and the temperature was returned to baseline automatically to prevent skin injury. This test was performed within two minutes. The respective cut-off temperature is then recorded for that trial. No results were reported since the study objectives were not met due to the early study termination and withdrawal of participant.</description>

        <title>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Pain Score to Rectal Distensions at Pre-dose and up to 6 Hours (h) Post-dose of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>This analysis was performed at 12, 24, 36 and 48 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) which was above the baseline operating pressure threshold. Participants assessed the cough severity and urge to cough using VAS immediately prior to capsaicin challenge. No results were reported since the study objectives were not met due to the early study termination and withdrawal of participant. Average of Day -1 and pre-dose was planned as Baseline for VAs assessment. The VAS score was planned to be analyzed on Day-1, Day 1, 2 hours, and 24 hours. Average daily pain scores as captured in participant diary cards were planned to be summarized descriptively and planned to be analyzed. The 11 point pain intensity numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents “No pain&quot; and 10 represents “Worst pain imaginable” was planned to be used for the subjective assessment of the pain.</description>

          <title>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Pain Score to Rectal Distensions at Pre-dose and up to 6 Hours (h) Post-dose of Each Treatment Period</title>
          <description>This analysis was performed at 12, 24, 36 and 48 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) which was above the baseline operating pressure threshold. Participants assessed the cough severity and urge to cough using VAS immediately prior to capsaicin challenge. No results were reported since the study objectives were not met due to the early study termination and withdrawal of participant. Average of Day -1 and pre-dose was planned as Baseline for VAs assessment. The VAS score was planned to be analyzed on Day-1, Day 1, 2 hours, and 24 hours. Average daily pain scores as captured in participant diary cards were planned to be summarized descriptively and planned to be analyzed. The 11 point pain intensity numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents “No pain&quot; and 10 represents “Worst pain imaginable” was planned to be used for the subjective assessment of the pain.</description>

The ramp was stopped and the temperature of the thermode was returned to the Baseline. This was repeated three times. The threshold temperatures and the average value were recorded by the computer. If the thermode temperature reached 50°C without the participant responding, the ramp was stopped and the temperature was returned to baseline automatically to prevent skin injury. This test was performed within two minutes. The respective cut-off temperature is then recorded for that trial.

        <description>Participants were rated on a scale based on following parameters - Onset associated with change in the frequency and change in the appearance of stools, abnormal stool frequency (&gt;3/day or &lt; 3/week); abnormal stool form (lumpy/hard or loose/watery stool), abnormal stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete evacuation); passage of mucus, and bloating were analyzed over period. No results were reported since the study objectives were not met due to the early study termination and withdrawal of participant.</description>

        <description>Individual pain scores were collected at screening and pre and post dose during the anorectal physiological assessments. Average daily pain scores as captured in participants' diary cards were summarized descriptively and analyzed. The 11 point pain intensity numerical rating scale ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents “No pain&quot; and 10 represents “Worst pain imaginable”. This was used for the subjective assessment of the pain over period. No results were reported since the study objectives were not met due to the early study termination and withdrawal of participant.</description>
