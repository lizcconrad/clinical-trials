  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a rare disease that causes inflammation of blood vessels, or
      vasculitis. It may involve many different parts of the body, but typically affects the upper
      and lower respiratory tract and kidneys. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety
      and effectiveness of the medication abatacept in treating adults with mild relapsing WG.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current standard treatment for WG involves various medications and is based on disease
      severity. Unfortunately, more than 50% of people experience a relapse after remission,
      placing them at risk for additional organ damage and medication toxicity. To prevent this,
      safer and more effective treatments for mild relapses are needed. Several studies have shown
      that activated T cells, a type of white blood cell important in regulating immune responses,
      play a role in WG. Abatacept, an immunoglobulin-based medication approved by the FDA to treat
      rheumatoid arthritis, acts by preventing T-cell activation and may be useful in treating mild
      relapses of WG. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of
      abatacept in treating adults with mild relapsing WG.

      Participants will receive abatacept intravenously at study visits on Days 1, 15, and 29, and
      then once a month thereafter. A participant's abatacept dose is based on body weight and will
      remain the same throughout the study. Participants who are receiving maintenance
      immunosuppressive medications consisting of methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate
      mofetil at the time of enrollment will remain on these medications without dosage increase or
      reduction. Eligible participants may be on up to prednisone 15mg daily at the time of
      relapse. Following the development of relapse, participants may be treated with up to
      prednisone 30mg daily if necessary, but must to be back to the same dose that they had been
      on prior to relapse by Month 2. All study visits include medication review, physical exam,
      blood and urine collection, and questionnaires. A chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan
      of the chest and sinuses, and lung function testing will occur at some study visits.
      Participants whose symptoms did not improved by Month 2 will be taken off abatacept. Any
      participants undergoing early termination or, after common closing, will undergo three
      follow-up study visits at 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of treatment.

        <title>Safety of Abatacept - Number of Participants With Adverse Events</title>
        <description>This study examined the safety profile of this agent when used in Wegener's granulomatosis. Information was gathered on all adverse events with specific events being identified in the protocol for analysis that included the following:
Infection
Infusion reactions
Cytopenias
Transaminase elevation
Skin reactions
GI side effects
Malignancy
All adverse events were reportable for this study.</description>
        <time_frame>Measured continuously from the screening visit through to the 6 month post-treatment study visit, up to 3 years and 4 months.</time_frame>
        <population>This study intended to examine safety and to explore preliminary signal for efficacy of abatacept in Wegener's granulomatosis. The sample size of 20 was based upon a sufficient number of subjects to begin such pilot explorations.</population>

            <title>Open-label Abatacept</title>
            <description>Participants received abatacept intravenously at study visits on Days 1, 15, and 29, and then once a month thereafter until common closing or early termination.
Abatacept : A participant's abatacept dose was based on body weight and remained the same throughout the study:
500 mg of abatacept for body weight less than 60 kg
750 mg of abatacept for body weight between 60 and 100 kg
1000 mg of abatacept for body weight greater than 100 kg
Abatacept was administered in a 30-minute intravenous infusion.</description>

          <title>Disease Improvement</title>
          <description>Disease improvement was measured by a reduction in the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener’s Granulomatosis (BVAS/WG).
The BVAS/WG is a validated disease activity index. The BVAS/WG is designed to document new or worsening clinically active vasculitis and consists of a set of items divided into nine organ based systems. BVAS/WG scores range from 0 to 63.</description>
