        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy male subjects, defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant
        illness or disease as determined by their medical history (including family), physical
        examination, laboratory studies, and other tests.

          -  Aged 25-55 years inclusive, at screening visit.

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 19.0 - 29.0 kg/m2 inclusive.

          -  Capable of giving informed consent and can comply with the study requirements and
             timetable.

          -  Self-administered Beck Depression Inventory II scale total score no greater than 9,
             and suicide question score of zero.

          -  Able to read, comprehend and record information.

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The physician responsible considers the subject unfit for the study based upon medical
             history, physical examination and psychiatric history and evaluation.

          -  History of a drug or other allergy which in the opinion of the physician responsible
             contraindicates their participation in the study.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new chemical entity
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of any
             drug(whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  A screening ECG outside of ranges specified in the protocol

          -  Pulse rate &lt;55 or &gt;100 bpm OR a systolic blood pressure &gt;140 and &lt;100 OR a diastolic
             blood pressure &gt;90 and &lt;60.

          -  History of long QT syndrome (personal or family) or other cardiac conduction disorder,
             or other clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  An electrolyte value outside the normal range at pre-study screening. Subjects who do
             not fall within the normal reference ranges may be included within the study if in the
             opinion of the Principal Investigator and Medical Monitor this will not compromise the
             subject.

          -  Liver function tests (LFT) elevated above the reference range at pre-study screening
             that remain elevated with a repeat LFT.

          -  Any other clinically significant laboratory abnormality.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John'sWort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor the
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption averaging &gt;14 drinks/week for men. One drink is
             equivalent to(12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer

             lactating women from the time of administration of study medication (GSK598809) until
             90 days following administration of study medication or an unwillingness of the male
             subject to use a condom/spermicide in addition to having their female partner use
             another form of contraception if the woman could become pregnant from the time of
             administration of study medication until 90 days following administration of study

             radiation burden being defined as ICRP category IIb or above: No more than 10 mSv in
             addition to natural background radiation, in the previous 3 years including the dose
             from this study).
