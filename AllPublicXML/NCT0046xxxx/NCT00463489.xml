      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the addition of a 2 year,
      centrally delivered individualized, telephone-based lifestyle intervention focusing on weight
      management to a mailed educational intervention on Disease Free Survival in post-menopausal
      women with early stage breast cancer (hormone receptor positive), BMI ≥24-&lt;40 kg/m2, who are
      receiving standard letrozole adjuvant therapy.

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the addition of a 2 year,
      centrally delivered individualized, telephone-based lifestyle intervention focusing on weight
      management to a mailed educational intervention on Disease Free Survival in post-menopausal
      women with early stage breast cancer (hormone receptor positive), BMI ≥24-&lt;40 kg/m2, who are
      receiving standard letrozole adjuvant therapy. The telephone intervention will involve 19
      phone calls, as well as mailings and a participant manual; women will be asked to lose up to
      10% of their weight by reducing their caloric and fat intake (by 500-1000 kcal/day, 20%
      calories fat) and increasing their moderate physical activity (to 150-200 minutes/week).
      Secondary outcomes include overall survival, distant disease-free survival, weight change,
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL), selected non-cancer medical events and biologic
      factors (notably insulin). Approximately 2,150 women will be enrolled; follow-up will
      continue until target event rates have been met (anticipated 4-6 years after completion of
      the intervention). This sample size will provide 80% power (type 1 error 0.05 2-tailed) to
      detect a hazard ratio (HR) for DFS of 0.74-0.76 in the weight loss intervention arm.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Post-menopausal woman with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (T1-3,pN0-2,M0) for
             which definitive surgery was performed during the previous 36 months.

          -  On adjuvant hormonal therapy with letrozole at time of randomization (either as
             initial adjuvant hormonal therapy or after a switch from tamoxifen or other hormonal
             therapy).

          -  BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2.

          -  Medical, surgical or radiation oncologist agrees to subject participation in a diet
             and physical activity program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy less than five years.

          -  Self-reported inability to walk at least 2 blocks (at any pace).

          -  Insulin requiring diabetes (telephone directed diet and physical activity changes
             would be difficult in this population without close coordination with the treating
             physician). Non-insulin requiring diabetics are eligible for the study.

          -  Serious digestive and/or absorptive problems, including inflammatory bowel disease and
             chronic diarrhea that preclude adherence to the study diet.

          -  Cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude
             moderate physical activity. Moderate arthritis that does not preclude physical
             activity is not a reason for ineligibility.

          -  Psychiatric disorders or conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             preclude participation in the study intervention (e.g. untreated major depression or
             psychosis, substance abuse, severe personality disorder).

          -  Patients on aromatase inhibitors other than letrozole at study entry.

          -  Known recurrence of breast cancer (local, regional or distant) at any time prior to
             study entry.

          -  History of other malignancies except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             curatively treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively
             treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years. Prior in situ cancer of the breast
             is not a reason for exclusion.

          -  Patients not fluent in either English or French (spoken and written).

          -  Patient unwilling or unable to provide informed consent.
