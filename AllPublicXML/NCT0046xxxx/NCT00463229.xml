  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population ages and the number of stroke survivors increases, information is needed to
      determine the best way of providing home care services for rehabilitation to stroke survivors
      and their caregivers while containing health care costs. This project will address this area
      by developing and testing the effects and costs of a collaborative and specialized team
      approach to stroke rehabilitation by health professionals, in a home care setting, compared
      to usual home care services. The overall goal of this way of providing home care services is
      to improve the quality of life and function of stroke survivors and their caregivers and
      prevent future strokes, which will reduce the overall cost to the health care system.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death in Canada, and is considered to be the most common
      disabling chronic condition. Approximately 40,000 to 50,000 people in Canada experience a
      stroke each year and about 80% of these people survive. Many of these people who survive a
      stroke never fully recover and are left with significant impairments and disabilities, and
      12% to 25% will have another stroke within the first year. This results in a significant
      burden to individuals, families, and society as a whole. Of every 100 people who are
      hospitalized for a stroke, 15-40 return home and require home care services for
      rehabilitation. Stroke rehabilitation is one of the key components of stroke care. The goal
      of rehabilitation is to assist stroke survivors to reach his or her optimal level of
      physical, social, and emotional function.

      Information gained from this study will be used to inform home care practice, policy
      decisions and the allocation of home care resources and make a national contribution to
      health care delivery reform.

    <measure>SF-36 Physical Function Score to Measure the Change in Health-related Quality of Life and Function From Baseline (Pre-randomization)to 12 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization) and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure of effect was the change in health-related quality of life and functioning from baseline to 12-months as measured by the SF-36 physical functioning score. The range of possible scores for this subscale is 0-100, with a higher score indicating a more favourable health status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale - 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization) and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS-16 assesses several aspects of health-related quality of life that are important to stroke survivors, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. The SIS-16 consists of 16 items which cover the physical aspects of stroke including: strength, hand function, mobility, and activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living. Each item is assigned a score ranging from 1 (could not do at all) to 5 (not difficult at all). The individual items sum to provide a total score, with higher scores indicating higher levels of health-related quality of life and function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reintegration to Normal Living Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization) and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RNLI assesses global functional status and measures both the stroke survivors' perceptions of their own capabilities and objective indicators of physical, social, and psychological performance. The RNLI consists of 11 items which cover the domains of mobility, self-care abilities, daily activities, recreational and social activities, family roles, and personal relationships, presentation of self and general coping skills. Each item is scored as 0 to 2. The individual items sum to provide a total score, with 22 indicating the highest degree of reintegration.</description>

    <measure>Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization) and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) is used for the screening, diagnosis and assessment of cognition. The SPMSQ is short, easily administered and has been designed, tested, standardized and validated in a variety of populations, including stroke. The SPMSQ consists of 10 items. The individual items sum to provide a total score; with greater than 4 errors indicating some degree of intellectual impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Reaction Assessment Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization) and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Reaction Assessment Scale is a multidimensional, 5-factor measure designed to assess the negative and positive aspects of caregiving. Each item is scored from 1 to 5 from strongly disagree to strongly agree. There are five subscales: (a) esteem, (b) family support, (c) finances, (d) impact on schedule, and (e) impact on health.</description>

    <measure>Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ85-Part Two)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization) and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PRQ85-Part Two is a 25-item scale that measures perceived social support along five dimensions: provision for attachment/intimacy; social integration; opportunity for nurturing behaviour; reassurance of worth as an individual and in role accomplishments; and the availability of informational, emotional, and material help. The maximum score is 175; a higher score indicates a greater perception of social support.</description>

    <measure>Health and Social Services Utilization Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization) and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The costs of use of all types of health services from baseline to 12 months were determined using the Health and Social Services Utilization Inventory (HSSUI), which assesses costs from a societal perspective. The HSSUI consists of questions about the respondent's use of six categories of direct health care services: (1) primary care; (2) emergency department and specialists; (3) hospital days; (4) seven types of other health and social professionals; (5) medications; and (6) lab services. The product of the number of units of service (quantity) and unit cost (price) is total cost.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kessler - 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization) and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Kessler-10 assesses level of anxiety and depressive symptoms a person may have experienced in the most recent four-week period. Its main strength is a superior ability to screen for anxiety and affective disorders. Each item is assigned a score ranging from 5 (all of the time) to 1 (none of the time). These 10 items are summed to give scores ranging from 10-50, where 50 indicates high risk of anxiety or depressive disorder. Previous studies have established a cut-off score of 16-29/50 for medium risk, and 30-50/50 as high risk for anxiety and depressive disorders.</description>

        <title>Stroke Impact Scale - 16</title>
        <description>The SIS-16 assesses several aspects of health-related quality of life that are important to stroke survivors, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. The SIS-16 consists of 16 items which cover the physical aspects of stroke including: strength, hand function, mobility, and activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living. Each item is assigned a score ranging from 1 (could not do at all) to 5 (not difficult at all). The individual items sum to provide a total score, with higher scores indicating higher levels of health-related quality of life and function.</description>

        <description>The costs of use of all types of health services from baseline to 12 months were determined using the Health and Social Services Utilization Inventory (HSSUI), which assesses costs from a societal perspective. The HSSUI consists of questions about the respondent’s use of six categories of direct health care services: (1) primary care; (2) emergency department and specialists; (3) hospital days; (4) seven types of other health and social professionals; (5) medications; and (6) lab services. The product of the number of units of service (quantity) and unit cost (price) is total cost.</description>

        <title>Kessler - 10</title>
        <description>The Kessler-10 assesses level of anxiety and depressive symptoms a person may have experienced in the most recent four-week period. Its main strength is a superior ability to screen for anxiety and affective disorders. Each item is assigned a score ranging from 5 (all of the time) to 1 (none of the time). These 10 items are summed to give scores ranging from 10-50, where 50 indicates high risk of anxiety or depressive disorder. Previous studies have established a cut-off score of 16-29/50 for medium risk, and 30-50/50 as high risk for anxiety and depressive disorders.</description>
