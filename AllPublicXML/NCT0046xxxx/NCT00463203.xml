  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irinotecan has demonstrated activity in malignant gliomas in multiple phase II studies. The
      activity is limited, with an approximately 15 % response rate and a progression-free survival
      of 3-5 months. Given the synergy between irinotecan and bevacizumab in colorectal cancer, and
      the high-level expression of vascular endothelial growth factor on malignant gliomas, one
      would expect synergy between bevacizumab and irinotecan against gliomas.

      Recent data form a small study of 32 patients from Duke University have achieved a response
      rate of 62% in patients with malignant gliomas. Most included patients had glioblastomas, but
      this regimen may also have activity in more rare primary malignant brain tumors. The
      investigators therefore plan to include other primary malignant brain tumors in this study,
      and the clinical activity will be correlated with biomarkers and PET results of metabolic
      activity and blood flow. This may result in information that can be used to individualize
      therapy in the future.
