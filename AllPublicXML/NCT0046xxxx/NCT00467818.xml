  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Published studies on omega 3 fatty acids in the treatment of bipolar disorder and
      schizophrenia have shown reductions in time to recurrence, a decrease in the positive and
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and improvements in CGI, YMRS, and HAM-D scores. The
      following are the hypotheses:

        -  Omega 3 fatty acids will be superior to placebo in the acute treatment of global autism.

        -  Omega 3 fatty acids will be superior to placebo in improving aggression and irritability
           associated with autism.

        -  Omega 3 fatty acids will be superior to placebo in improving functional ability.

      This study is an innovative treatment approach to autism. It adapts a promising adjunct
      therapy for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia to a new population, that of children and
      adolescents with autism. It will analyze the possible relationship between dosage of omega 3
      fatty acids and treatment outcomes. Finally, it will attempt to identify which specific
      subgroups of subjects will respond to this intervention, which components and associated
      features are most responsive and whether this impacts subjects' quality of life. The data
      generated by this study is intended to support the rationale for a full scale, large
      multi-site clinical trial.
