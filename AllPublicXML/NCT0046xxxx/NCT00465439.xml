  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will examine the impact of local anesthetic on the frequency
      of vasovagal reactions and the patients perception of pain during femoral arterial sheath
      removal after percutaneous coronary intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) will be randomized to receive
      subcutaneous local anesthetic (Lidocaine 2% without epinephrine)or no local prior to removal
      of femoral arterial sheath. They will be assessed for vasovagal reactions and pain intensity
      during the sheath removal.The incidence of vasovagal reactions and pain intensity scores will
      be compared between the groups. 200 patients will be enrolled over the course of 2 months.
