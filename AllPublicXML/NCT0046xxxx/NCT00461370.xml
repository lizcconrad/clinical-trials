      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of SRX251 when given orally. The amount
      of SRX251 in the blood will also be measured. Healthy women, ages 18-50 years who have been
      surgically sterilized by tubal ligation, will be enrolled in this study.

      Vasopressin appears to be a key mediating factor in menstrual pain. This position stems from
      findings that the hormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP), causes constriction of uterine blood
      vessels which in turn produces congestion of the uterus resulting in dysmenorrhea. Prior to
      menses, blood vessels in the uterine wall become engorged with blood. Elevated concentrations
      of vasopressin acting through V1a receptors cause constriction of both uterine and vascular
      smooth muscle, contributing to the discomfort and pain of primary dysmenorrhea. Consequently,
      blockade of these receptors with a selective V1a receptor antagonist would be expected to
      provide therapeutic benefits to women with primary dysmenorrhea.

      SRX251 is a new chemical entity with potent V1a receptor antagonist properties, and an
      acceptable safety profile as demonstrated in preclinical studies. This study is intended to
      evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of a single oral dose of SRX251 in healthy
      human female volunteers in preparation for further studies of the safety and pharmacological
      activity in the amelioration of pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females of ≥18 and ≤50 years of age who have a regular menstrual cycle between 24-35
             days duration.

          2. Have a body mass index (BMI) of ≥18.5 and ≤30.

          3. In good health as determined by medical history, a baseline physical examination,
             vital signs, clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement.

          4. Subject has undergone surgical sterilization by tubal ligation.

          5. Subject is willing and able to sign written informed consent prior to receipt of any
             study medication or beginning study procedures.

          6. Subject is willing and able to follow instructions, comply with the protocol
             requirements and make all required study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is pregnant or nursing.

          2. Subject has undergone surgical sterilization by any method other than tubal ligation
             (e.g., hysterectomy).

          3. Positive results for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody tests at
             screening.

          4. Positive urine test for drugs of abuse at screening.

          5. Any out-of range laboratory value at screening that has not been reviewed, approved
             and documented as not clinically significant by the Principal Investigator.

          6. Supine blood pressure, after resting for 5-10 minutes, outside a systolic blood
             pressure range of 90-140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure outside a range of 50-90
             mmHg on two consecutive measurements taken 5 minutes apart.

          7. Supine pulse rate, after resting for 5-10 minutes, greater than 100 bpm or lower than
             50 bpm on two consecutive measurements taken 5-10 minutes apart.

          8. Has taken any alcohol within 48 hours of ANY study-related activities AND cannot
             abstain from drinking alcohol during the entire duration of the subject's study
             participation.

          9. Has used any tobacco products in the past 12 months.

         10. A history of significant drug allergy or systemic allergic disease (e.g., urticaria,
             atopic dermatitis).

         11. A general medical or psychological condition or behavior, including current substance
             dependence or abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, might not permit the
             subject to complete the study or sign the informed consent.

         12. Any clinically significant abnormality on screening 12-lead ECG (e.g., heart block,
             conduction disorders, ventricular and/or atrial arrhythmias).

         13. Any other condition or clinically significant abnormal findings on the physical
             examination, medical history, or clinical laboratory results during screening that, in
             the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the Physician Sub-Investigator, would
             make the subject unsuitable for the study or put them at additional risk.

         14. Routine or PRN consumption of medications or herbal supplements that the subject is
             unable or unwilling to discontinue during the study. Multivitamins may be consumed
             during the study.

             components.
