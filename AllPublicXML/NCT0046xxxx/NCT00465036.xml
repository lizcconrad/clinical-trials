    <textblock>
      Randomized multiple crossover trial in 18 healthy males aged 18 to 40 years each are required
      to complete a total of five iso-caloric meal tests lasting approximately 8½ hours. Test meals
      will be given as breakfast meals, in which different fractions of flaxseeds are incorporated
      into baked products. Appetite will be registered using visual analogue scales during 7 hours
      after the test meal and a total of 10 blood samples will be drawn to evaluate TAG in
      chylomicrons, plasma LDL, HDL and total cholesterol, plasma TAG, insulin, glucose and
      appetite hormone levels. At the end of the test day an ad libitum meal will be served and
      food intake registered.
