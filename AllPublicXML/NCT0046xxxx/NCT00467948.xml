      Patients who need major head &amp; neck surgery are at risk of post operative wound infection. In
      spite of role of antibiotics in prophylaxis of clean contaminated head and neck surgery has
      been well documented, controversy exists in the optimal antibiotic regimen

      Patients undergoing laryngeal oncologic surgery are at relatively high risk of developing
      complication.

      Efficacy of cefazolin as a prophylactic antibiotic in head and neck surgery was reviewed in
      many researches [6] but considering the costs and morbidities of prolonged antibiotic regimen
      we have presented a prospective and randomized study in 90 patients comparing the efficacy of
      2 day over 5 day protocols.

        Inclusion Criteria:e.

          -  Patients eligible to be included in this trial were those who histologically confirmed
             squamous cell carcinoma of larynx and hypopharynx and they were candidate of total or
             partial laryngectomy with or without neck dissection and with negative history of neck
             or laryngeal radiation were included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having recurrences or another primary tumor, and those who underwent
             reconstruction with a flap were excluded from the study, because they had been
             submitted to prolonged antibiotic administration. Also cases with Diabet mellitus and
             Immune suppression or tumor types other than squamous cell carcinoma were excluded
             from the study.

          -  In addition, the following exclusion criteria were taken into account: pregnancy,
             hypersensitivity to penicillins or cephalosporins, patients who received a systemic
             antibiotic drug within one week prior to the planned procedure, those who had clinical
             or laboratory evidence of a preexisting infection or had serious systemic renal
             disease.
