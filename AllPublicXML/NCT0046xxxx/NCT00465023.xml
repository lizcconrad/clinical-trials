  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine if high doses of radiation using proton beam
      can be given safely with low and acceptable side effects. We will also gather information to
      determine the ability of proton beam to destroy cancer cells in the liver. There are two
      types of external radiation treatments (proton beam and photon beam). Proton beam radiation
      is a very accurate kind of treatment that has been shown to affect less normal tissue than a
      regular radiation beam. The accuracy allows us to more safely increase the amount of
      radiation delivered to eliminate cancer and may potentially reduce the side effects normally
      experienced with standard radiation therapy.

      -  Participants will receive treatment as an outpatient at the Northeast Proton Treatment
           Center located at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

        -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of proton beam radiation that can be given to
           people safely, not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same
           amount of radiation. Small groups of people will be enrolled and given a certain dose of
           radiation. If they tolerate it well, the next small group of people enrolled will
           receive a higher dose. This will continue until we find the highest dose that can be
           given without causing serious or unmanageable side effects.

        -  Radiation treatment to the liver will be given once a day, 5 days a week
           (Monday-Friday), for 3 weeks. Each treatment takes about 10-20 minutes.

        -  A physical examination, medical history, and blood tests will be taken once a week for 3
           weeks during radiation therapy. Follow-up visits will occur every 3 months for 2 years,
           and every 6 months thereafter for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
