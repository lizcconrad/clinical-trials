  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the effects of alternate-day reductions
      in calorie intake or daily calorie restriction on the risk for cardiovascular disease and
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight individuals are at greater risk for certain chronic diseases such as
      cardiovascular disease and cancer when compared to those who are normal weight. Dietary
      restriction has been shown to lower the risk of these chronic diseases in overweight human
      subjects as well as in normal weight rodents. The majority of studies examining dietary
      restriction protocols in rodents or humans implement daily calorie restriction (CR), i.e.
      where the amount of energy consumed is decreased by a certain percentage every day. Another
      dietary restriction regimen employed, although less commonly, is intermittent caloric
      restriction, or alternate-day fasting (ADF), i.e. where food is available ad-librium every
      other day, alternating with a partial or complete caloric restriction day. Recent findings
      suggest that ADF may modulate certain indices of disease risk to a similar extent as daily CR
      in animal models. The effect of ADF regimens in comparison with CR regimens on disease risk
      has yet to be performed in human subjects, however. ADF protocols need not result in weight
      loss, and would therefore be appropriate for non-obese individuals. Accumulating evidence
      suggest that adipose tissue may play a role in modulating chronic disease risk by releasing
      substrates, such as fatty acids, or a variety of hormones, including adiponectin and leptin.
      The effect of ADF and CR on adipose tissue metabolism and hormone release remains unclear.
      Accordingly, the aim of the present study is to compare ADF regimes to CR for their effects
      on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer and their effects on adipose tissue
      metabolism and hormone secretion, in normal weight to modestly overweight (BMI 22-27 kg/m2)
      human subjects.
