      This study evaluates the effect of smoking reduction vs usual care (quitting advice only) for
      individuals with peripheral arterial disease who smoke.

    <textblock>
      This study randomly assigns smokers who do not have a quit date set to either a smoking
      reduction grop or usual care group. The smoking reduction group receives behavioral
      counseling on smoking reduction and nicotine patch and/or gum to reduce the number of
      cigarettes smoked per day by at least 50%. The usual care group is given brief advice to quit
      smoking and referral to local cessation services. To be included in the study, participants
      must have peripheral arterial disease (defined as ankle Brachial Index equal to or less than
      0.85 or history of prior revascularization) and they must be daily smokers (defined as at
      least 1 cigarette, cigar, or tobacco pipe daily). Participants complete questionnaires that
      measure mood, functional ability, smoking history, and motivation to quit smoking.
      Participants will be followed in this study for up to 24 months.
