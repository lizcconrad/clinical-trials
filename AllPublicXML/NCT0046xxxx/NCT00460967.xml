      SUMMARY

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of late onset visual impairment
      and legal blindness in people 65 years of age or older in the United States. It is a
      heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal degeneration occurs predominantly in the
      macula in the context of aging and leads to impairment primarily of central visual acuity.
      The degenerative retinal eye disease occurs in two forms - a non-exudative &quot;dry&quot; form and an
      exudative &quot;wet&quot; form which in an individual patient may also represent stages of the disease.
      Non-exudative AMD accounts for 80-90% of AMD cases and it involves a constellation of
      clinical features that can include drusen, pigment clumping and/or retinal pigment epithelium
      (RPE) dropout, and geographic atrophy. Because of the overwhelming numbers of &quot;dry&quot; AMD
      subjects, the cumulative impact of this vision loss is significant.

      There is no effective therapy for maintaining or improving vision associated with dry AMD.
      The only therapy for persons with dry AMD is an oral supplement containing high doses of
      antioxidants and zinc, which was tested by the National Eye Institute in a large,
      multi-center, double-masked, sham-controlled clinical trial1. This antioxidant therapy was
      shown to modestly retard the progression of dry AMD from an intermediate stage to the
      advanced stages and confirmed the benefit of antioxidant therapy in this disease. There is
      currently no FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of subjects with dry AMD.

      Recently, the MIRA-1 modified per protocol population showed the effectiveness of
      Rheopheresis which is an application of selective therapeutic apheresis, namely double
      filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) using a specifically designed filter for plasma filtration
      in subjects with non-exudative AMD. At one year the study reported with statistical
      significance (1) approximately a one line vision improvement in the Rheopheresis group versus
      no change in the Sham group and (2) 28% of subjects randomized to the active treatment
      gaining at least one line vision versus only 9% of subjects randomized to the sham treatment.

      With a total of 300 subjects with dry AMD and visual acuity of 20/40-20/100 inclusive, the
      current investigation plans to prove the effectiveness of the Rheopheresis treatment on a
      larger scale. Each subject will receive a series of 8 treatments (either active treatment or
      sham treatment in a 2:1 ratio) for a period of approximately 2.5 months. In addition, a
      post-treatment ophthalmic evaluation will be performed 2 weeks after the 8th treatment
      (approximately 3 months after the baseline visit) and at the 6, 9 and 12 month visits.
      Comparing the one-year proportions of at least a 10-letter gain in ETDRS LogMar BCVA from
      baseline, the current investigation will show the effectiveness of Rheopheresis treatment
      (compared to sham treatment) for treating dry AMD subjects. Other secondary effectiveness
      endpoints, including mean changes and proportions of BCVA better than 20/40 at one year, will
      be analyzed to support the main investigation.
