      Primary: To determine the pathological remission following the chemotherapy combination
      docetaxel and doxorubicin in large breast cancer

      Secondary:

        -  Clinical response rate

        -  To investigate the safety of docetaxel doxorubicin combination in the treatment for
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer
