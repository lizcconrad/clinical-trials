      The primary aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of a form of supported
      employment, Individual Placement and Support (IPS) compared to existing good quality
      rehabilitation and vocational services for people with psychotic illnesses in terms of ‘open’
      employment outcomes (in the competitive labour market), and to examine its relative
      effectiveness in the context of different European welfare systems and labour markets. The
      primary hypothesis was that IPS patients would be more likely to obtain open employment than
      control service patients. Secondary hypotheses were that they would be in open employment for
      longer than the control patients, and that they would not spend more time in hospital.

      An RCT was conducted in six European centres: London (UK), Ulm-Guenzburg (Germany), Rimini
      (Italy), Zurich (Switzerland), Groningen (the Netherlands) and Sofia (Bulgaria). Patients
      were included if they had a diagnosis of SMI (psychotic illness including bipolar disorder),
      were aged 18 to retirement age, had been ill and had major role dysfunction for at least two
      years, were living in the community at baseline, had not been in competitive employment in
      the preceding year and expressed the desire to enter competitive employment. They were
      randomly allocated to receive either IPS or the ‘Vocational Service’ (control service). Given
      the need to consider the impact of gender and work history on vocational outcomes (20),
      service allocation was stratified by centre, gender and work history (more or less than a
      month’s competitive employment in the five years prior to baseline). Randomisation was
      conducted centrally using MINIM Version 1.5. A researcher at each centre recruited the
      patients, submitted them to the statistician for randomisation and received the allocation by
      email. The allocation sequence was concealed until the services had been assigned, but it was
      not possible for patients, professionals or researchers to be blind to service allocation
      thereafter.
