        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe melasma

          -  Subjects willing to undergo biopsy four times throughout the study, two biopsies at
             baseline (one in a melasma involved area and one in a non-involved area). The third
             and fourth biopsies will be performed at 3 months and 6 months, respectively; in order
             to avoid variability in histopathological findings,

          -  Subjects must have substantial melasma involvement of the cheeks and be willing to
             have the same general site biopsied at the baseline, month 3 and month 6 visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with diagnosis of dermal melasma

          -  Subjects who foresee intensive UV exposure during the study (mountain sports, UV
             radiation, sunbathing, etc.)

          -  Subjects who have used retinoids, steroids, and/or skin lightening products 4 weeks
             prior to study entry

          -  Subjects who show signs of Poikiloderma of Civatte (mandibular hyperpigmentation)

          -  Subjects with a history of hypertrophic scarring or a history of keloids

          -  Subjects who are unable to avoid the use of a class 1 steroid during their
             participation in the study
