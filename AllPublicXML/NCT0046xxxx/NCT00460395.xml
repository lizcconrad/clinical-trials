    <textblock>
      Study Objectives:

        -  To compare the survival (overall, systemic, and neurological) of patients with single
           cerebral metastases treated with either conventional surgical resection or stereotactic
           radiosurgery.

        -  To compare their rates of recurrence, complications, and their cognitive ability,
           functional status, and quality of life.

      Although surgical resection is a proven and effective treatment for brain metastases in
      patients with systemic cancer, stereotactic radiosurgery has been suggested to be equally
      effective and less morbid. Nonrandomized retrospective comparisons have been unable to
      resolve whether stereotactic radiosurgery is as effective as conventional surgery because of
      the complexity and variability of the population of patients with cancer and brain
      metastases. This controversy can only be resolved by a prospective randomized trial comparing
      these treatment modalities. Patients not randomized will be analyzed as a separate group.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to either conventional surgery or stereotactic
      radiosurgery, or participate as a separate group of the study, if they refuse randomization.
      At the time of diagnosis, patients may be given dexamethasone which will be continued
      throughout treatment then discontinued in a tapered fashion. Patients with supratentorial
      tumors and a history of seizures may be treated with anticonvulsants. For patients in the
      surgical group, surgery will be performed using standard techniques and any necessary
      intraoperative adjuncts. For patients in the stereotactic radiosurgery group, stereotactic
      radiosurgery will be delivered using the modified linear accelerator and multiple
      non-coplanar converging arcs. The dose prescribed will be dependent on the volume treated.
      Changes in patients' clinical courses will be treated as medically necessary. Should
      metastases recur or progress at the primary intracerebral site or at a distant intracerebral
      site, patients who received radiosurgery remain eligible for surgical resection and patients
      who received conventional surgery may undergo repeat resection or radiosurgery. Whole brain
      radiotherapy may be given to patients who demonstrate local or distant recurrence and can be
      given as the primary therapy or as adjunctive therapy. The WBRT dose will be 30 Gy delivered
      in ten fractions.
