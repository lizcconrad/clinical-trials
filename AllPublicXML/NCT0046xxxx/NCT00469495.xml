  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the efficacy of early, empiric anti-helminthic
      therapy combined with standard pentavalent antimony in the treatment of subjects co-infected
      with helminths and cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. brasiliensis. The study hypothesis is
      that early intervention with antihelminthic therapy will improve response rates to antimony
      in subjects with cutaneous leishmaniasis.

    <textblock>
      Leishmaniases are a group of diseases caused by a parasite and transmitted by the sand fly.
      There are a number of diseases associated with infection ranging from simple skin lesions to
      a severe, fatal form. The standard treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a 20 day
      course of antimony which, although fairly effective, has multiple side effects and is
      difficult to administer. The populations that are affected by leishmaniasis are usually also
      affected by intestinal helminths (worms). It is unknown what effect these two diseases have
      on each other and the immune system. As pathology in CL is mediated by an inflammatory
      reaction and helminths down regulate inflammation, helminthic infection may be beneficial for
      leishmaniasis. However, a recent study by our research group suggested that subjects infected
      with both leishmania and helminths have longer healing times and are less likely to respond
      to antimony. Since failure of initial therapy often results in repeat courses of the drug or
      development of more severe disease, we propose a study to investigate the role of early
      treatment for co-existing helminth infections in improving response rates to antimony in
      subjects with CL.
