      The BIS monitor is a tool which assists anesthesiologists in monitoring the depth of
      anesthesia or level of anesthesia. The study doctors would like to see if it is useful tool
      for patients who are mentally challenged and require anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General endotracheal tube anesthesia (GETA) is administered for mentally retarded patients
      that need dental rehabilitation. GETA is done, in all patients, with routine monitoring of
      electrocardiography, blood pressure recording, pulse oximetry and end-tidal capnography.
      These measurements are also used indirectly to determine the depth of anesthesia and the
      anesthetic is titrated to prevent awareness during surgery and any subsequent recall (1). In
      addition, a recently introduced functional electroencephalography (EEG)-based awareness
      monitor directly analyzes the brain wave pattern during anesthetic delivery and aids the
      anesthesiologist in maintaining the ideal depth of anesthesia. The EEG based monitor serves
      to prevent awareness and recall due to light anesthesia or prolonged recovery following deep
      anesthesia (2). This instrument, named the Bispectral Index Scale (BIS) monitor, is
      non-invasive and is approved by the Food &amp; Drug Administration. However, the BIS monitor is
      not being used routinely during the anesthetic management of mentally retarded patients due
      to a belief that such monitoring would be inaccurate in this cohort of patients (3). This
      assumption lacks scientific validation. Our trial will investigate the usefulness of BIS
      monitoring in mentally retarded patients and document any correlation between the severity of
      mental retardation and BIS scoring during various phases of anesthesia, such as awake status
      and sedation prior to anesthesia, induction and maintenance of anesthesia, and emergence and
      recovery from anesthesia. The anesthetic protocol will be standardized and the anesthetic
      management will not deviate from routine practice. The adjuvant therapies for infection
      prophylaxis and pain control will be administered in the usual fashion.
