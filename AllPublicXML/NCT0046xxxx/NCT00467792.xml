    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how long the skin lesions usually last and what
      kind of symptoms and signs children with urticaria pigmentosa may develop over the years.
      This information will allow physicians to better care for patients who have been diagnosed
      with this disease and to provide their parents with more complete information regarding what
      to expect for the future of their child. This research is being done because many unanswered
      questions remain regarding children with urticaria pigmentosa and its course.

      This study involves children, of age 0-18 years old who are diagnosed with urticaria
      pigmentosa during their visit at the Pediatric Dermatology Clinic. Parents and child will be
      interviewed to gain medical and family history, in addition, the doctor will perform a
      physical exam and take a photograph. Children older than 4 years of age will complete the
      &quot;Children Dermatology Life Quality Index.&quot; Children less than 4 years of age with an active
      disease will have laboratory tests requiring a sample of blood (1 teaspoon).

      Patients will receive $50 for their first office visit as financial reimbursement for
      participating in the study.
