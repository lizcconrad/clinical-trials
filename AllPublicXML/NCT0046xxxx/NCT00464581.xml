      Cystoid macular edema (CME) is the most common cause of suboptimal post-operative visual
      acuity in uncomplicated cataract extractions. Over two million cataract extractions are
      performed each year, with a reported incidence ranging from 1.5 to 6.9%, resulting in an
      estimated 20,000-130,000 new cases of CME annually. Clinical CME historically was associated
      with visual acuity of 20/40 or worse with fluorescein angiographic evidence of macular edema
      in a classic petaloid pattern. Angiographic CME physiologically signals an inflammatory
      process causing distortion of the outer plexiform layer, which if not resolved quickly could
      result in non-repairable visual loss. Topical, periocular, or intravitreal corticosteroids,
      despite their associated side effects, are the mainstay for pharmacologic treatment for
      patients with CME. Their efficacy has never been demonstrated in a randomized, controlled and
      blinded study.

      This is an open-label, Phase II study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in subjects
      with cystoid macular edema secondary to non-ischemic retinopathy, as seen following cataract
      surgery with intraocular lens implantation.

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be induced by hypoxia and has been
      implicated in the development of iris and retinal vascularization. VEGF, however, is also
      known to be a potent mediator of vascular permeability in other tissues and may perform this
      function in retina.

      Immunohistochemical VEGF staining has been identified in patients with disorders such as
      aphakic and pseudophakic cystoid macular edema, ocular inflammatory disease and infection.
      VEGF was primarily localized within retinal neurons and within the retinal pigment epithelium
      in these cases. In addition or in association with its role of inducing neovascularization
      (Wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, VEGF may contribute to the breakdown of the blood-retinal
      barrier in a variety of disorders.

      Ranibizumab is a pan-VEGF A blocker that has been proven highly effective for the treatment
      of wet macular degeneration. The underlying pathophysiology of both cystoid macular edema and
      wet AMD is VEGF overproduction.

      To date ranibizumab has been approved only for treating wet ARMD. In this study we will
      explore ranibizumab for the treatment of cystoid macular edema It is hypothesized that this
      population will show dramatic improvement as the initial cause of VEGF production can be
      isolated to the surgical procedure and due to the fact that the retinal pigment epithelium is
      healthier in this population as compared to the macular degeneration counterparts.
