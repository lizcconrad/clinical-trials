  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is known to cause hearing loss and mental retardation. The
      purpose of this study is to compare a 6-week course to a 6-month course of the drug
      valganciclovir in babies born with CMV to assess the safety and efficacy of this treatment.
      Participants will include 104 infants (30 days old or younger) born with CMV disease. All
      infants will take valganciclovir by mouth for 6 weeks. At the end of the 6 week period,
      subjects will be assigned by chance to receive either valganciclovir or placebo (inactive
      substance) to complete the 6 months of antiviral treatment. Patients will be followed for the
      study related evaluations of safety, changes to hearing, and developmental milestones for up
      to 2 years. Patients will be followed by telephone contact for an additional 3 years. Thus,
      participants may be involved in study related procedures for approximately 5 years.

      This study is a multi-center, prospective, international, Phase III, randomized and blinded
      investigation of 6 weeks versus 6 months of oral valganciclovir therapy in babies with
      symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. Following enrollment, study subjects
      will receive 6 weeks of oral valganciclovir. Near the end of the 6-week course, subjects will
      be randomized in a 1:1 fashion either to continue on valganciclovir to complete 6 months of
      therapy or to begin a matching placebo to complete the 6 months. Study subjects will be
      stratified according to whether or not there is central nervous system (CNS) involvement at
      study entry. During the 6-month treatment period and the 1 month thereafter, study subjects
      will be followed weekly for 4 weeks, then every other week for 8 weeks, then every month for
      4 months. At each of these visits, safety labs will be checked, growth parameters recorded,
      and adverse events assessed. The dose of study medication will be adjusted for weight gain at
      each of these study visits. Dose adjustments may also occur as indicated per protocol for
      neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or renal impairment. Whole blood will be obtained for CMV
      viral load at each of these visits as well. Hearing outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6
      months, 12 months and 24 months. Developmental outcomes will be assessed at 12 months and 24
      months. Changes in whole blood viral load measurements will be correlated with both hearing
      and neurologic outcomes. In study subjects with increasing whole blood viral loads during the
      course of treatment, assessment for antiviral resistance may be undertaken.Safety assessments
      include: hematology labs, chemistry labs, physical examinations, and adverse event data
      performed/collected serially. Development of neutropenia will be confirmed by repeat blood
      testing within one week, and study drug will be held until it resolves. Efficacy assessments
      include: hearing assessments at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months; and
      neurodevelopmental assessments at 12 months and 24 months. Study objectives are: to compare
      the impact on hearing outcomes of 6 weeks versus 6 months of antiviral treatment with
      valganciclovir oral solution in infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease; to compare
      the safety profile of 6 weeks versus 6 months of antiviral therapy with valganciclovir oral
      solution in infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease; to compare the impact on
      neurologic outcomes of 6 weeks versus 6 months of antiviral treatment with valganciclovir
      oral solution in infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease; and to correlate change in
      whole blood viral load with hearing and neurologic outcomes. Participants will include 104
      male and female neonates (less than or equal to 30 days) with symptomatic congenital CMV.

    <measure>Change in Best Ear Hearing Assessments at 6 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Between baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hearing assessment was evaluated by an independent audiologist. At baseline, a brainstem evoked response (BSER) assessment and autoacoustic emissions (OAEs) hearing assessments were obtained. At 6 months, BSER and /or Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) and OAEs were obtained. A single, independent study audiologist who was blinded to treatment assignment assessed the audiology test battery for each subject and assigned the classifications of normal hearing, mild hearing loss, moderate hearing loss, or severe hearing loss based upon their hearing thresholds (in decibels). The classifications were assigned by ear (one for the left ear and one for the right ear), giving &quot;total ear&quot; classifications. Following this, the study audiologist assigned the &quot;best ear&quot; classification for the subject at that study visit; for example, if a subject had mild hearing loss in their left ear and severe hearing loss in their right ear, then the &quot;best ear&quot; classification was mild hearing loss.</description>

        <title>Change in Best Ear Hearing Assessments at 6 Months.</title>
        <description>Hearing assessment was evaluated by an independent audiologist. At baseline, a brainstem evoked response (BSER) assessment and autoacoustic emissions (OAEs) hearing assessments were obtained. At 6 months, BSER and /or Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) and OAEs were obtained. A single, independent study audiologist who was blinded to treatment assignment assessed the audiology test battery for each subject and assigned the classifications of normal hearing, mild hearing loss, moderate hearing loss, or severe hearing loss based upon their hearing thresholds (in decibels). The classifications were assigned by ear (one for the left ear and one for the right ear), giving “total ear” classifications. Following this, the study audiologist assigned the “best ear” classification for the subject at that study visit; for example, if a subject had mild hearing loss in their left ear and severe hearing loss in their right ear, then the “best ear” classification was mild hearing loss.</description>
        <time_frame>Between baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
        <population>Only subjects randomized and subjects that had both baseline and 6 month hearing exams were analyzed for the primary endpoint. Some subjects failed to have the one or both of the two hearing exams (baseline and/or 6 months).

        <title>Change in Best Ear Hearing Assessments at 24 Months.</title>
        <description>Hearing assessment was evaluated by an independent audiologist. At baseline, a brainstem evoked response (BSER) assessment and autoacoustic emissions (OAEs) hearing assessments were obtained. At 24 months, BSER and /or Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) and OAEs were obtained. A single, independent study audiologist who was blinded to treatment assignment assessed the audiology test battery for each subject and assigned the classifications of normal hearing, mild hearing loss, moderate hearing loss, or severe hearing loss based upon their hearing thresholds (in decibels). The classifications were assigned by ear (one for the left ear and one for the right ear), giving “total ear” classifications. Following this, the study audiologist assigned the “best ear” classification for the subject at that study visit; for example, if a subject had mild hearing loss in their left ear and severe hearing loss in their right ear, then the “best ear” classification was mild hearing loss.</description>

          <title>Number of Ears With Improvement or Protected Hearing Assessments Over Left and Right Ears at 24 Months.(Based on 58 Ears From 31 Placebo Subjects and 70 Ears From 37 Valganciclovir Subjects)</title>
          <description>Hearing assessment was evaluated by an independent audiologist. At baseline, a brainstem evoked response (BSER) assessment and autoacoustic emissions (OAEs) hearing assessments were obtained. At 24 months, BSER and /or Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) and OAEs were obtained. A single, independent study audiologist who was blinded to treatment assignment assessed the audiology test battery for each subject and assigned the classifications of normal hearing, mild hearing loss, moderate hearing loss, or severe hearing loss based upon their hearing thresholds (in decibels). The classifications were assigned by ear (one for the left ear and one for the right ear), giving “total ear” classifications. Following this, the study audiologist assigned the “best ear” classification for the subject at that study visit; for example, if a subject had mild hearing loss in their left ear and severe hearing loss in their right ear, then the “best ear” classification was mild hearing loss.</description>
          <population>Only subjects randomized and subjects that had both baseline and 24 month hearing exams were analyzed for the primary endpoint. Some subjects failed to have the one or both of the two hearing exams (baseline and/or 24 months). There were 31 placebo subjects and 37 active drug subjects reported results for both time periods.</population>
