  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 1.6 million patients sustain a hip fracture every year, about half of these are
      intracapsular femoral neck fractures. A femoral neck fracture is a life changing event for
      any patient, and the risk of disability, increased dependence and death is substantial. The
      main treatment options for displaced femoral neck fractures are internal fixation and
      arthroplasty. It is established that there are more complications and reoperations after
      internal fixation, but there is no consensus about which procedure that gives best functional
      results.

      We plan to include patients with displaced intracapsular femoral neck fractures. The patients
      will be randomized by means of closed numbered envelopes to operation groups:

        1. Two parallel screws (Olmed).

        2. Hemiarthroplasty with Charnley/ Hastings prosthesis. A priori one would expect that
           there would be less morbidity and mortality with the less extensive and quicker
           operation with parallel screw and that a faster and better rehabilitation would be
           achieved with hemiarthroplasty.
