  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the lungs.

      There is evidence that cigarette smoking can make asthma symptoms worse and that smokers with
      asthma do not respond as well to standard therapies as non-smokers.

      Statins are drugs which are already used to lower cholesterol. They have also been shown to
      have some anti-inflammatory properties.

      In this trial the investigators will give a randomised group of smokers Atorvastatin and the
      remaining group a placebo or blank tablet. The investigators will then monitor patients'
      responses in terms of peak flow data, symptom diaries, questionnaires and breathing tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite several studies, which have shown that smokers with asthma have more severe symptoms,
      accelerated decline in lung function and diminished response to treatment with inhaled and
      oral corticosteroids, more than 25% of asthmatics continue to smoke. Smoking cessation advice
      is often ineffective.

      Statins are used as cholesterol lowering agents, however, there is now also evidence that
      they have additional anti-inflammatory effects which may be useful in treatment of smokers
      with asthma.

      This is a randomised placebo controlled double-blind parallel group study.

      Following screening to assess suitability for the study, patients will be randomised to
      treatment with either Atorvastatin 40mg or placebo (blank tablet)for 8 weeks.

      After 4 weeks of treatment, all patients will be commenced on a low dose inhaled
      corticosteroid for the remainder of the study to assess whether treatment with statins can
      overcome steroid resistance in smokers with asthma.
