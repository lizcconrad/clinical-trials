      The aim of this research will be to perform a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a
      new diabetes educational intervention that teaches self-management skills that compensate for
      poor numeracy skills among a sample of primary care patients with type 2 diabetes and low
      literacy and/or numeracy.

      Results of the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) suggest that over 90 million adult
      Americans have poor quantitative skills. Numeracy, the ability to understand and use numbers
      and math skills in daily life, may be particularly important to patients with diabetes
      because caring for diabetes often requires self-management skills that rely on the daily
      application of math skills, such as counting carbohydrates, interpreting blood glucose
      monitoring, applying sliding scale insulin regimens, and calculating insulin to carbohydrate
      ratios. Presumably diabetes patients with poor numeracy have more difficulty with
      self-management and are at risk for poorer clinical outcomes, but to date, there are no
      published studies that rigorously examine the role of numeracy in diabetes. We have recently
      completed the initial development of a new scale to measure numeracy in patients with
      diabetes: the Diabetes Numeracy Test (DNT).

      The aim of this research will be to perform a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a
      new diabetes educational intervention that teaches self-management skills that compensate for
      poor literacy and numeracy skills among a sample of patients with type 2 diabetes and low
      numeracy or literacy skills. We hypothesize that a group of patients with poor literacy
      and/or numeracy who are taught self-management skills that accommodate their poor numeracy
      will have: (1) improved treatment satisfaction and perceived self-efficacy, (2) improved
      performance in self-management tasks, and (3) improved glycemic control compared to a control
      group that receives usual education and care.
