      Vardenafil (Levitra) and Sildenafil (Viagra) are drugs that are marketed for use in patients
      with erectile dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to find out if there are any changes
      in the eye after taking at least 15 doses of Vardenafil and after two doses of Sildenafil.
      This is a double-blind study, which means that neither you nor the study doctor will know
      which treatment you are receiving. If you qualify for the study, you will receive:-
      Vardenafil 20 mg twice per week (Monday and Thursday) for a maximum of 8 weeks. There will be
      two times when this occurs during the study.- Sildenafil 200 mg/day for two days. There will
      be two times when this occurs during the study. - Placebo (a pill that looks like vardenafil
      or sildenafil but has no active ingredient).
