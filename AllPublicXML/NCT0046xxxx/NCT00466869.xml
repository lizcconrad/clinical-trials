  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-to three center study. The study
      will consist of 2 treatment groups (Betahistine 48 mg/day or matching placebo). Approximately
      30 subjects (15 per treatment group) will be randomized into this 6-week study.

      A single blinded placebo treated period of up to 14 days will be used to determine subjects
      suitability for inclusion in the trial.

      In order that a patient will be defined as valid for inclusion in the study, patients should
      be able to present consistent LDL-C values, taken prior to randomization (at screening visit
      1 and screening visit 2), without deviation of more than 12% of each value from their mean.

      Within one week from the second screening visit, subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and
      none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatment
      groups:

        -  Betahistine 24 mg BID (48 mg/day total), or

        -  Matching placebo BID.

      Double-blind treatment will continue for 4 weeks. Study medication (betahistine and/or
      matching placebo) will be administered BID (before lunch and before dinner).

      During the study, subjects will undergo dietary assessment.

      The primary efficacy parameter is change in LDL-C from baseline (randomization) to Week 4 and
      the percentage of patients that reduce their LDL-C by 10% or more.
