      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Vicinium when
      administered as a monotherapy intravesical instillation in patients with non-invasive
      urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS) who failed previous treatment with Bacille Calmette Guérin
      (BCG).

      A phase II study was performed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of intravesical
      Vicinium in patients with urothelial carcinoma in situ of the bladder. Bacillus
      Calmette-Guérin treatment had previously failed in all patients. A total of 46 patients were
      treated with Vicinium with half being administered 30mg/dose once per week for 6 weeks
      (cohort 1) and the other half (cohort 2) the same dose but administered once per week for 12
      consecutive weeks. Vicinium was well tolerated in both cohorts as all patients completed
      treatment on schedule. A complete response to Vicinium was seen in 9 of 22 patients (41%) in
      cohort 1 and 9 of 23 (39%) in cohort 2 at the 3-month evaluation. A total of 20 patients
      (44%) achieved a complete response. Two other patients without carcinoma in situ who achieved
      a complete response were not included in the study due to the development of non-invasive
      papillary (Ta) disease. Median time to recurrence in patients who achieved a complete
      response was 274 and 408 days in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Overall 7 patients (16%)
      remained disease free. Post-study assessment demonstrated that these patients were still
      disease free at last follow-up (18 to 25 months). The most common adverse events were mild to
      moderate reversible bladder symptoms.

    <description>Induction Phase is a single intravesical dose of Vicinium at 30 mg in 40 mL PBS once per week for 6 weeks. If free of disease at 12 weeks after the first instillation, the subject enters Maintenance dosing in which 30 mg of Vicinium is administered once per week for 3 weeks followed by 9 weeks of no therapy.
If the subject had histologically confirmed disease that is stage &lt;T2, they repeat the Induction phase dosing. If the subject is free of disease, the subject enters the maintenance dosing phase of every 12 weeks (3 weeks of therapy followed by 9 weeks of no therapy until disease recurrence is confirmed by positive biopsy or up to a maximum of Week 51 (end-of-study [EOS]).</description>

If 13 weeks after the first instillation of Vicinium the subject is free of disease, they have a break from therapy before entering Maintenance dosing in which 30 mg of Vicinium is administered once weekly for 3 weeks followed by 9 weeks of no therapy.

             the bladder.

          -  The patient must have histologically-confirmed carcinoma in situ (CIS), with or
             without non-invasive papillary disease

          -  The patient must have immunohistochemically-confirmed EpCAM positive disease.

          -  The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 12 months.

             treatment.

          -  The patient must have had a transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT)
             mapping the location of tumour and quantifying the area of bladder affected.

             of all the pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment and is willing and able
             to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study
