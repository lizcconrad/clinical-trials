      Cross-sectional study of prevalence and intensity of schistosome infection in pregnant women,
      follow-up into postpartum, and the association of schistosome infection with haemoglobin
      concentration, compared to a group of non-pregnant women.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of schistosomiasis and anaemia
      among pregnant and non-pregnant women in Burkina Faso and explore the implications for the
      national schistosomiasis control programme and future studies.

      Specific objectives are:

        -  to determine the prevalence and intensity of schistosome infection in pregnant women
           attending for antenatal care and in non-pregnant women of reproductive age in an area
           which is hyperendemic for S.haematobium infection and in which there is little or no
           S.mansoni infection

        -  to determine the prevalence and intensity of schistosome infection in pregnant women
           attending for antenatal care and in non-pregnant women of reproductive age in an area in
           which S.mansoni infection is common

        -  to determine Haemoglobin concentration in pregnant women attending for antenatal care
           and in non-pregnant women of reproductive age in the regions described above

        -  to investigate the association between infection and haemoglobin concentration in
           pregnant and non-pregnant women

        -  to determine the prevalence of other parasitic infections in pregnant women and
           non-pregnant women including hookworms, ascaris, trichuris and malaria

        -  to demonstrate the research team's ability to follow-up pregnant women recruited at
           antenatal care clinics onto the postpartum period
