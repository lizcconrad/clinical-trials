  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, is the
      fourth most common cause of death and the second leading cause of disability in the United
      States. COPD is estimated to be responsible for more than 13.4 million physician visits and
      13% of hospitalizations nationally. These hospitalizations are usually caused by acute
      exacerbations characterized by an increase in symptoms including dyspnea or shortness of
      breath (SOB), cough, wheezing, and sputum production. The significant disability for people
      with COPD is primarily due to the symptom of dyspnea (shortness of breath) that affects an
      individual's quality of life more than does the physiological impairment. Despite optimal
      medical and pharmacological therapy, most people with COPD continue to suffer from chronic
      and progressive dyspnea and other symptoms of cough and fatigue.

      We have previously shown that an individualized face-to-face dyspnea self-management program
      was effective in improving dyspnea with activities of daily living (ADL), physical
      functioning, and self-efficacy for managing dyspnea. Using an experimental longitudinal
      design, the i-DSMP will be compared to the Face-to-Face Dyspnea Self-Management Program
      (f-DSMP) and to an Attention Control (AC) intervention

      At the present time, education about symptom management for patients and treatments,
      including exercise, are primarily provided within structured and episodic pulmonary
      rehabilitation (PR) programs. These PR programs are of short duration, are available for only
      a small percentage of people because they are expensive and not covered by all third party
      payers, and often require travel by patients who are disabled. Given estimates of 10 to 24
      million U.S. adults with COPD,most of who would benefit from PR, only less than 0.1% can be
      accommodated at any given time. In the US the maintenance or exercise programs following PR
      are not reimbursed and, therefore, not available for most patients.

      A number of self-management programs have been tested in multiple chronic diseases,but there
      has been less study of self-management programs for patients with COPD. The few
      self-management programs for COPD that include only education and limited skills training
      have not significantly improved symptoms. Home-based PR and self-management programs with
      nurse home visits have been studied and provide a less costly and accessible alternative.
      Clearly there is a growing need for more accessible and alternative avenues for providing
      ongoing support and therapy for COPD patients.

      The Internet provides a new exciting delivery channel that offers patients with disabilities
      an opportunity for greater involvement in health care decision-making and unparalleled
      opportunities to learn, inform, and communicate with one another and for health care
      providers to support patients' self-management efforts. Several Internet-based studies for
      other chronic illnesses have increased self-efficacy for symptom management, perception of
      available support, and patients' involvement in health care decision making, while reducing
      symptoms and health care costs. The only published study evaluating the use of the internet
      to support self-management in COPD patients was our pilot study for this proposal. Our study
      demonstrated an improvement in both self-efficacy and dyspnea with daily activities measures.
      This study will expand on the findings of our pilot study.
