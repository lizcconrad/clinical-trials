  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls and osteoporosis-related fractures cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the
      elderly, and are an increasingly important public health concern. A comprehensive
      multidisciplinary and integrated community-based approach is needed to identify and manage
      the population at highest risk of these complications. Unfortunately, current gaps in
      continuity of care and health intervention result in a sub-optimal state of health service
      for these individuals. The Falls, Fracture and Osteoporosis Risk Control and Evaluation
      (FORCE) Study is a two-year randomized controlled trial evaluated on the effect of
      coordinated community-based, multidisciplinary approach for fall and fracture prevention in
      Sault Ste. Marie.

      The FORCE partners are a broad collaboration of interested consumers, stakeholders and
      providers, led by the Algoma Health Unit (AHU) and the Group Health Centre (GHC) - a
      community-based, not-for-profit, multidisciplinary health organization. Other partners
      include the multi-agency, consumer-orientated Algoma District Slips, Trips and Falls
      Committee, the Sault Area Hospital (SAH), the Algoma Community Care Access Centre (ACCAC),
      and Pharma Companies Alliance (Aventis and Proctor &amp; Gamble), Merck Frosst and Lilly. The
      Green Shield Foundation has also provided sponsorship.The results of this study might
      directly benefit up to eight thousand seniors in the district by providing the impetus to
      integrated, evidence-based health services. Qualitative and quantitative research during this
      time will also be a unique opportunity to identify the modifiable barriers to the continuity
      and quality of care in this high-risk population. By involving the community, the project
      will also educate those at future risk and hopefully prevent disease and complications.
      Evaluation and research should provide nationally suggestions for better health service
      delivery.
