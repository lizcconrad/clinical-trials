  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      in pre- and postmenopausal women who will undergo surgery for breast cancer. Subjects will
      either receive estetrol or placebo during a 2 week treatment period.

      Several biological markers, such as a cellular growth marker and cell death markers, will be
      assessed in the tumor tissue and surrounding normal tissue before and after the treatment
      period. During the 2 week interval between diagnosis of breast cancer and surgical resection,
      no therapy for breast cancer is usually administered.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of early invasive primary breast cancer (clinically
             stage I or II; T1 - T2; N0-1; M0, which requires surgery).

          2. The malignant tumor must be estrogen receptor (ER) positive as determined by the local
             pathologist. Weak, intermediate and strong staining is considered appropriate for
             inclusion.

          3. The breast tumor size must be adequate for core cut biopsy to obtain sufficient amount
             of tissue for gene and protein expression analysis.

          4. Subjects will be either pre- or post-menopausal.

               -  The postmenopausal study group has been defined as follows: not older than 70
                  years of age and a natural menopause with the last menstrual bleeding at least 12
                  months before the start of the study. If the date of last menstruation is
                  uncertain because of perimenopausal HRT or in case of past hysterectomy with
                  intact ovaries, then the subject must have appropriate FSH and Estradiol (E2)
                  levels (FSH &gt; 40 International Units (IU)/L and E2 &lt; 20 pg/ml (=73.40 pmol/l))
                  after completion of a HRT wash-out according to exclusion criterion 2 and 3.

               -  The premenopausal study group has been defined as follows: At least 18 years and
                  not older than 50 years of age with at least one spontaneous menstrual bleeding
                  during the last 6 months, combined with an FSH level below 10 IU/L. Before
                  treatment starts a pregnancy test will be performed that has to be negative. If
                  appropriate a barrier method of contraception has to be used for the duration of
                  the study. The criteria for perimenopausal HRT wash-out are according to
                  exclusion criterion 2 and 3.

          5. BMI must be between 18 and 32 kg/m2.

          6. The patient must provide voluntary written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any serious disease (e.g. severe liver or renal disease), clinically significant
             abnormal laboratory values (e.g. abnormal serum liver enzyme concentrations above the
             upper safety limit) or any other clinically significant abnormalities which, in the
             investigator's opinion, may lead to adverse events during the course of the trial

          2. Previous use of estrogen/progestogen within:

               -  6 months for depot preparations.

               -  8 weeks for oral preparations or progestogen containing IUD.

               -  4 weeks for transdermal preparations

          3. Use of hormone containing implant at any time

          4. Contraindications for using steroids:

               -  A history of, or existing thromboembolic, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular
                  disorder.

               -  A history of, or existing conditions predisposing to, or being prodromi of, a
                  thrombosis.

               -  A known defect in the blood coagulation system (e.g. deficiencies in AT-III,
                  protein C, S, and APC resistance).

               -  A medical history positive for the presence of more than one risk factor for

               -  Porphyria.

               -  A history during pregnancy or previous estrogen use of severe pruritus, herpes
                  gestationis or deterioration of otosclerosis.
