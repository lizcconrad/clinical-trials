    <textblock>
      Japanese encephalitis virus is the leading cause of viral neurological disease and disability
      in Asia. The severity of sequelae, together with the volume of cases, make JE the most
      important cause of viral encephalitis in the world. Approximately 3 billion people—including
      700 million children—live in areas at risk in Asia for JE. JE most commonly infects children
      between the ages of 1 and 15 years, and can also infect adults in areas where the virus is
      newly introduced. More than 50,000 cases are reported annually and cause an estimated 10,000
      to 15,000 deaths. This figure is believed to represent only a small proportion of the disease
      burden that actually exists.

      An inactivated JE vaccine is currently being used in Sri Lanka. It is given to children in 3
      doses, at 12 months of age, 13 months of age, and 2 years of age. A booster dose must also be
      given to children at 5 years of age. If Sri Lanka decides to replace the inactivated JE
      vaccine with the live attenuated JE vaccine, there will be many children who still need a 3rd
      or booster dose of the inactivated JE vaccine. This research study is being done to see if
      the live attenuated vaccine will work well to replace the inactivated JE vaccine and if it is
      safe in Sri Lankan children.

          -  Subject is up-to-date for all vaccinations recommended in the Sri Lankan childhood
             immunization schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrolled in another clinical trial involving any therapy.

          -  Subject and/or parent(s) or guardian(s) are unable to attend the scheduled visits or
