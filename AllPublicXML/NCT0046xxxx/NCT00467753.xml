      The proposed study is designed to assess the effectiveness of treatment with Oxcarbazepine
      vs. placebo in childhood/adolescent autism. This is a twelve-week study involving twenty
      subjects between the ages of five and seventeen with a diagnosis of autism. Subjects will
      receive a psychiatric and medical evaluation by the study psychiatrist to see if she/he has
      any psychiatric or medical illnesses that would interfere with their ability to participate
      in this study. These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete. In addition, subjects
      will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to determine the child's
      diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be asked to fill out
      psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to 4 hours to
      complete.

    <description>Oxcarbazepine is available in a 300mg/5ml solution. Dosage will start at 150 mg (2.5ml) at night for 3 days and will be increased to 150 mg in the am and pm. For children who are able to tolerate the 150 mg BID dose, the oxcarbazepine will be increased to 300 mg at night and 150 mg in the morning for 3 days and 300 mg BID for the next week. The children will remain on this dose until week 3, at which time if they are tolerating the medication and do not have a Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI) of 1 (very much improved) they will be increased to 600 mg twice a day in a method similar to the above increases. After week 4, the child will remain on the same stable dose.</description>

            <description>Oxcarbazepine is the active drug to be given to subjects in the experimental arm
Oxcarbazepine : Oxcarbazepine is available in a 300mg/5ml solution. Dosage will start at 150 mg (2.5ml) at night for 3 days and will be increased to 150 mg in the am and pm. For children who are able to tolerate the 150 mg BID dose, the oxcarbazepine will be increased to 300 mg at night and 150 mg in the AM for 3 days and 300 mg BID for the next week. The children will remain on this dose until week 3, at which time if they are tolerating the medication and do not have a CGI of 1 (very much improved) they will be increased to 600 mg twice a day in a method similar to the above increases. After week 4, the child will remain on the same stable dose.</description>
