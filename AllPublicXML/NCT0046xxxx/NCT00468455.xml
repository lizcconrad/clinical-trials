  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to produce a user-friendly tool- in the form of a questionnaire
      - to accurately assess early quality of life in patients after abdominal colorectal surgery
      from the first day after surgery to 6 months after. The study will also compare this
      questionnaire to the other currently available assessment tools. Patients are invited to
      participate if they are undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery at University Hospitals of
      Cleveland.

      The purpose of this study is to produce a user-friendly tool to accurately assess early
      quality of life in postoperative patients following abdominal colorectal surgery in the early
      postoperative period (from surgery to 6 months) that is practical for routine application.
      The study will also compare this tool to the current available tools, namely the Short Form
      (SF-36), the short form inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), the Cleveland Clinic
      Global Quality of Life (CGQOL). Patients will be invited to participate if they are
      undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery at University Hospitals of Cleveland.
