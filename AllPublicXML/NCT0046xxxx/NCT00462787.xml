      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine, topotecan, vinorelbine, thiotepa,
      and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of clofarabine when
      given together with topotecan, vinorelbine, thiotepa, and dexamethasone in treating young
      patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine when administered in combination
           with topotecan hydrochloride, vinorelbine ditartrate, thiotepa, and dexamethasone in
           young patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.

        -  Evaluate the antileukemic potential of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the incidence and severity of treatment-related morbidity and mortality in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Develop a new reinduction treatment regimen that will result in a patient clinical
           response with as little residual disease as possible to permit a bone marrow
           transplantation while in subsequent remission; maintain the response long enough to
           identify an appropriate stem cell donor; and permit the patient to undergo a stem cell
           transplantation free of infections and without vital organ dysfunction.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, prospective, dose-escalation study of clofarabine.

      Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV continuously over 120 hours on days 0-4;
      vinorelbine ditartrate over 6-10 minutes on days 0, 7, and 14; thiotepa IV over 4 hours on
      day 2; clofarabine IV over 2 hours on days 3-7; and oral or IV dexamethasone 3 times daily on
      days 3 and 7-13 and then on day 3 only thereafter. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 8 and continuing until blood counts recover.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of clofarabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity OR the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed once a week for 4 weeks, twice a
      month for 6 months, and then once a month for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>This is a single arm phase I clinical trial to assess safety (morbidity and mortality) of a novel leukemia re-induction regimen. The first component of this trial is a phase I dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the novel agent Clofarabine, when used in combination with topotecan, vinorelbine, thiotepa and dexamethasone. A total of three dose levels will be explored in this study.</description>
