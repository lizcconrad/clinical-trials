             or living donor

          -  Patient willing and capable of giving written informed consent for study participation

          -  Patients treated with as induction therapy at the time of transplantation

          -  Patients maintained on a triple immunosuppressive regime consisting of cyclosporine
             (C-0 h between 100-250 ng/ml or a C-2 h between 900-1100 ng/ml), Enteric coated
             mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS), minimum dose 1080 mg and corticosteroids, minimum dose
             10 mg

          -  Patients without any biopsy proven acute rejection episode or treatment for any acute
             rejection since the transplant

          -  Females capable of becoming pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test prior to the
             switch to everolimus and are required to practice a medically approved method of birth
             control for the duration of the study and a period of 8 weeks following
             discontinuation of study medication, even where there has been a history of
             infertility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipient of multi-organ transplants, and or previously transplanted with any other
             organ different from a kidney transplant

          -  Patients with antibodies towards the donor kidney above 30%

          -  Patients receiving a renal transplant from HLA-identical sibling

          -  Presence of hyper sensitivity to drugs similar to everolimus ( e.g. macrolides)

          -  Patient with past (within the last two years) or present malignancy other than excised
             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  Patients who are recipients of AB0 incompatible transplants

          -  Patients with unsuitable laboratory values

          -  Patients with ongoing wound healing problems or other severe surgical complication in
             the opinion of the investigator

          -  Patient with a current severe major local or systemic infection

          -  Patients requiring dialysis and/or having a calculated glomerular filtration rate
             (Cockcroft-Gault) &lt; 20 ml/min

          -  Presence of intractable immunosuppressant complications or side effects (e.g., severe
             gastrointestinal adverse events) at the time of the switch

          -  Patients who are HIV positive or Hepatitis B surface antigen positive or Hepatitis C
             virus positive. Recipients of organs from donors who test positive for Hepatitis B
             surface antigen or Hepatitis C are excluded.

          -  Evidence of severe liver disease

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
