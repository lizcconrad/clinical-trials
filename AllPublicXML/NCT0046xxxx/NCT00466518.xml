      This study is designed to look at the effect sitagliptin has on tacrolimus and sirolimus drug
      levels in kidney transplant patients. It is also designed to look at the side effects
      experienced in the transplant population.

      Within the last six months, the FDA has approved sitagliptin phosphate as an oral drug that
      potentiates the effect of native GLP-1 through inhibition of DPP-4. It is approved for
      treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults as monotherapy or in combination with metformin or a
      TZD. It has several advantages over extenatide when considering its use in kidney transplant
      recipients:

        1. It is administered orally once a day

        2. Nausea occurred at a rate of only 1.4%

        3. Its potential of hypoglycemia is low

      However, it may not be as potent, in terms of HbA1C with % change in HbA1C&lt;1%. In addition
      there is not a lot of information on gastric emptying, although this is probably not as
      severe as exenatide, with fewer symptoms of nausea reported.

      We propose to conduct a pilot study for using sitagliptin in patients who have both type 2
      diabetes and who have received a kidney transplant. Our objectives are to study the effect of
      sitagliptin administration on side effect profiles, change in HbA1C, and the percentage of
      patients who require discontinuation of the drug as a result of major changes in
      immunosuppressant drug levels. The data will be used as preliminary data for a larger study
      that attempts to prevent or delay the onset of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients. We
      anticipate treating patients with both impaired fasting glucose and normoglycemia, given the
      high frequency of PTDM in the post-kidney transplant population.
