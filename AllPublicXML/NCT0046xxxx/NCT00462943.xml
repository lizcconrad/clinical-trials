    <textblock>
      A Phase II open-label trial of subcutaneous HHT (omacetaxine mepesuccinate) in the treatment
      of patients who are resistant to or intolerant to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label, multicenter study of subcutaneous HHT (omacetaxine mepesuccinate)
      therapy of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic, accelerated, or blast
      phase who have failed or are intolerant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Patients will
      be treated with induction course cycles consisting of subcutaneous (SC) HHT 1.25 mg/m² twice
      daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days. Patients will be evaluated every 7 days with
      complete blood and platelet counts while undergoing induction therapy; the number of
      consecutive doses of HHT or intervals between subsequent cycles may be adjusted, as
      clinically indicated, according to guidelines provided in the treatment plan.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Hematologic Response by Subpopulation and Total Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subpopulations reflect chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) phases at the time of enrollment: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Primary endpoints as adjudicated by the Data Monitoring Committee were used for the primary analyses.
Overall hematologic response for chronic phase participants includes confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR). Overall hematologic response for accelerated or blast phase participants includes confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR), no evidence of leukemia (NEL), or return to chronic phase (RCP). Hematologic response must last &gt;= 8 weeks to be considered meaningful.
Response rates by disease phase were examined relative to an a priori value of 2.5% using a one-sided lower 95% exact binomial confidence limit. If the lower limit from the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit exceeds 2.5%, the observed response rate will have exceeded the minimum threshold required to demonstrate efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Major Cytogenetic Response by Subpopulation and Total Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subpopulations reflect chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) phases at the time of enrollment: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Primary endpoints as adjudicated by the Data Monitoring Committee were used for the primary analyses.
Major cytogenetic response includes complete or partial response. Both confirmed and unconfirmed major cytogenetic response is considered meaningful. Unconfirmed response is based on a single bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation for participants where a confirmatory evaluation is not available.
Complete response shows 0% Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cells. A partial response shows &gt;0% - 35% Ph+ cells.
Response rates by disease phase were examined relative to an a priori value of 2.5% using a one-sided lower 95% exact binomial confidence limit. If the lower limit from the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit exceeds 2.5%, the observed response rate will have exceeded the minimum threshold required to demonstrate efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Subpopulation and Total</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>TEAE are any untoward events that were newly occurring or worsening from Baseline.
Treatment related toxicity was considered by the investigator to be unrelated, possibly, probably or unknown related to study drug. Severity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 on the following scale: Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life-threatening, Grade 5 = death. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that is fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient; and conditions not included in the above that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
A participant is only counted once in each category (at worst severity or strongest relationship).</description>

          <description>Class I: Cardiac disease, but no symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity, e.g. shortness of breath when walking, climbing stairs etc.
Class II: Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity.
Class III: Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20–100 m). Comfortable only at rest.
Class IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bed-bound patients.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Hematologic Response by Subpopulation and Total Population</title>
        <description>Subpopulations reflect chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) phases at the time of enrollment: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Primary endpoints as adjudicated by the Data Monitoring Committee were used for the primary analyses.
Overall hematologic response for chronic phase participants includes confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR). Overall hematologic response for accelerated or blast phase participants includes confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR), no evidence of leukemia (NEL), or return to chronic phase (RCP). Hematologic response must last &gt;= 8 weeks to be considered meaningful.
Response rates by disease phase were examined relative to an a priori value of 2.5% using a one-sided lower 95% exact binomial confidence limit. If the lower limit from the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit exceeds 2.5%, the observed response rate will have exceeded the minimum threshold required to demonstrate efficacy.</description>

        <description>Subpopulations reflect chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) phases at the time of enrollment: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Primary endpoints as adjudicated by the Data Monitoring Committee were used for the primary analyses.
Major cytogenetic response includes complete or partial response. Both confirmed and unconfirmed major cytogenetic response is considered meaningful. Unconfirmed response is based on a single bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation for participants where a confirmatory evaluation is not available.
Complete response shows 0% Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cells. A partial response shows &gt;0% - 35% Ph+ cells.
Response rates by disease phase were examined relative to an a priori value of 2.5% using a one-sided lower 95% exact binomial confidence limit. If the lower limit from the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit exceeds 2.5%, the observed response rate will have exceeded the minimum threshold required to demonstrate efficacy.</description>

Overall hematologic response for chronic phase participants includes confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR). Overall hematologic response for accelerated or blast phase participants includes confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR), no evidence of leukemia (NEL), or return to chronic phase (RCP). Hematologic response must last &gt;= 8 weeks to be considered meaningful.</description>

Treatment related toxicity was considered by the investigator to be unrelated, possibly, probably or unknown related to study drug.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that is fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient; and conditions not included in the above that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

        <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the initiation of treatment until death from any cause or the last day of participant contact or evaluation for participants that were lost to follow-up. Participants were censored t the last recorded contract or evaluation when a participant was alive at time of analysis. A quarterly phone survey was conducted to collect survival data for participants who discontinued from the study.</description>
