  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dose aspirin have been shown to increase the level of Methotrexat in patients with
      Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, most of RA patients are not currently treated with high dose
      aspirin. On the other hand, they frequently receive treatment with low dose aspirin. The
      effect of low dose aspirin on the levels of Methotrexate is not well known. Therefore,the
      purpose of this study is to assess the effect of low dose aspirin on the levels of
      methotrexate.

      Thirty Rheumatoid Arthritis patients currently treated with low dose methotrexate (MTX) will
      participate in this study. On the day of intake of methotrexate, the patients will receive 10
      mg of MTX. Serum levels of MTX will be measured at time 0,30 ,90, 120 minutes, and after 12
      and 24 hours.

      Two weeks later, the patients will be recommended to take 100 mg aspirin/d during a week. The
      levels of MTX will be measured after a week of treatment in a way similar to a week before.
