  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of artesuante + amodiaquine four years
      after its introduction as first line treatment for uncomplicated childhood malaria in
      Zanzibar. The hypothesis is that the treatment has a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)adjusted
      parasitological cure rate of at least 85% 42 days after treatment.
