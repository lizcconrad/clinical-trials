  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to count the number of white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood
      at the beginning and end of treatment with firategrast and at 4 and 12 weeks after stopping
      firategrast. Cerebrospinal fluid flows through and protects the brain and spinal cord. It is
      important to understand what happens to the number of white blood cells because they are
      important in preventing infections.

    <description>The number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

In the event that a participant had missing MRI data for a gadolinium enhanced lesion parameter during the on-treatment period (scans at Weeks 4-24 inclusive), the missing value was imputed using the mean value for that parameter for all non-missing scans during the treatment period.</description>

    <description>Participants were assessed for the presence of A allele of rs887829 which is associated with Gilbert's syndrome. Gilbert's syndrome is benign and characterized by transient increases in bilirubin levels (&gt;1.5XUpper limit of normal [ULN]). Participants who were carrying two copies of A allele of rs887829, suggested that elevations in bilirubin (maximum total bilirubin [MTB] &gt;1.5xULN, &gt;1.0 to 1.5xULN and less than or equal to 1.0xULN) were due to benign Gilbert's syndrome. Genotypes AA, AG and GG were analyzed.</description>

                       data showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than 1% per
                       year).

                    -  Spermicide in conjunction with either a diaphragm, cervical cap or condom.

                    -  Male partner sterilization (vasectomy) prior to female subject's entry into
                       the study and is the sole partner for that female subject.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study:

          -  Subjects receiving corticosteroids within 4 weeks of Screening for treatment of MS. If
             non-systemic steroids are being used for other chronic inflammatory conditions,
             subjects may be included at the discretion of the investigator after discussion with
             the GSK medical monitor.

          -  Use of a b-interferon product, glatiramer acetate or azathioprine within 3 months of
             Screening, or use of Mitoxantrone within 12 months of Screening. Subjects who have
             received other therapies affecting the immune system (such as intravenous
             immunoglobulin (IVIg), cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis, or any other
             immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment) in the past may be included on a case
             by case basis after discussion with the GSK medical monitor. None of these treatments
             will be allowed during this study.

          -  Previous exposure to alemtuzumab, natalizumab or firategrast administration, bone
             marrow transplantation or whole body irradiation.

          -  Subjects with a cardiac pacemaker or any other type of metal implant or with any other
             contraindication for MRI (including known allergy to gadolinium).

          -  Use of 4-aminopyridine, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or any drug that is an inhibitor
             of or a substrate (with a low therapeutic index) for Organic Anion Transporter Protein
             (OATP).

          -  Subjects with clinically significant renal laboratory values: subjects with a
             calculated creatinine clearance &lt;60ml/min (by Cockcroft and Gault) at Screening
             [Cockcroft, 1976].

          -  Subjects with local urinalysis findings of 1) proteinuria, defined as ³1+ protein on
             urine dipstick or 2) renal tubular cell casts or 3) ³5 red blood cells / high power
             field will be excluded from the study if the result is still present on a repeat
             urinalysis during the Screening Phase.

          -  Presence of clinically significant hepatic laboratory values: Alanine Amino
             Transferase (ALT), Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST), Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)
             &gt; 2 times the upper limit of the reference range; total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 the upper
             limit of the normal range.

          -  CD4 count &lt; 500, CD4:CD8 &lt; 1.0, JCV viremia in plasma or white cells, idiopathic
             CD4/CD8 lymphopenia or secondary lymphopenia at Screening.

          -  Any findings at Screening on the MRI of the brain other than MS, except for benign
             findings that (in the opinion of the central MRI reading site and local site
             investigator) require no further evaluation or treatment and do not impact patient's
             neurological health (e.g. small arachnoid cysts, venous angiomas).

          -  Uncontrolled or any active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. Any previous serious
             infections should be discussed with the GSK medical monitor (e.g. opportunistic or
             atypical infections).

          -  History of tuberculosis (TB) or positive chest X-ray for TB at Screening (prior chest
             X-ray is acceptable if performed within previous 6 months).

          -  Known congenital or acquired immunodeficiency.

          -  Current or history of cancer, excluding localized non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Any abnormality on 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening which is clinically
             significant in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody or HIV tests at Screening.

          -  Women who are lactating, pregnant (positive pregnancy test at Screening), or planning
             to become pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Recent history or suspicion of current drug abuse (including analgesic abuse) or
             alcohol abuse within the last 6 months prior to Screening. Alcohol abuse is defined as
             an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units for men and 14 units for women or an
             average daily intake of greater than three units for men and two units for women. One
             unit is equivalent to approximately 250mL of beer or one measure of spirits or one
             glass of wine.

          -  Use of an investigational drug for a condition other than MS within 30 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) preceding Screening. Prior use of an investigational
             drug for MS should be discussed with the GSK medical monitor.

          -  Any concurrent illness, disability or clinically significant abnormality (including
             laboratory tests) that may affect the interpretation of clinical efficacy or safety
             data or prevent the subject from safely completing the assessments required by the
             protocol.

          -  Contraindications, in the opinion of the investigator, to lumbar puncture, e.g.
             congenital or acquired spine or CNS conditions that may render LPs unsafe, platelet
             count of less than 50 GI/L and/or an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of greater
             than or equal to 1.5 (by history), known history of clotting/bleeding disorder, needle
             phobia.
