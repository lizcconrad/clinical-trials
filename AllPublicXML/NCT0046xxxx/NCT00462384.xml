  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Mircera for
      correction of anemia in participants with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis and
      are not treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). Eligible participants will
      receive Mircera by monthly subcutaneous injections, dependent on body weight (with a starting
      dose of 1.2 micrograms/kilogram [mcg/kg]). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12
      months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.
