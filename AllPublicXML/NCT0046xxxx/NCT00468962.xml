  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional properties of chitooligosaccharides have been studied for antitumor activity,
      immunostimulating effects, antimicrobial activity, free radical scavening activity, adn
      angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activity. Recent in vitro, and in vivo toxicity
      and absorbability studies have demonstrated that chitooligosaccharides have high
      absorbability and are essentially non-toxic. In the present study, we prepared a
      chitooligosaccharide with high absorbability and evaluated its effects on activation of
      immune function and cardiovascular funciton(lipid, atrial stiffness, etc) in healthy adults.

      This study was a 8-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The 30 volunteers were
      divided into a control group(n=10), half dose chitooligosaccaride(FACOSTM) intake
      group(n=10), and full dose FACOS intake group(n=10). Peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells(PBMCs) were isolated and cultured in 12 well plate for 48 hours. Cytokine production by
      PBMCs pre- and postintervention were measured simultaneously after stimulation with
      lipopolysaccaride.
