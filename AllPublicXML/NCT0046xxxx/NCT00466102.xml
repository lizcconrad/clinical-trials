  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine wether RAD001 can inhibit growth of tumour cells
      and/or stop the formation and activity of bone degrading osteoclasts.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RAD001 is an orally bioavailable and well tolerated rapamycin ester analogue, which acts by
      selectively inhibiting mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). mTor is an intracellular protein
      kinase implicated in the control of cellular proliferation in neoplastic cells. Treatment
      with RAD001 has been shown to inhibit these signalling events and leads to growth retardation
      of tumour cells. In addition RAD001 in vitro stops the formation and activity of osteoclasts.
      Therefore a therapy of advanced breast cancer with progressive bone metastases seems to be
      reasonable with RAD001.

      Comparison:

      All patients receive RAD001 in an 8 week run in phase. Patients who show a response after 8
      weeks will continue receiving RAD001. All patients with stable disease after the run in phase
      will be randomised to receive either RAD001 or placebo and will be followed up until
      progression of disease. Patients with progressive disease after the 8 week run in phase will
      be withdrawn from the trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent prior to beginning specific protocol procedures, including
             expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and follow-up, must be obtained
             and documented according to the local regulatory requirements.
