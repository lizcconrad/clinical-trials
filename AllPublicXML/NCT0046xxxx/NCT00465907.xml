    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cancer death in many countries of the world including Singapore.
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of 80-85% of lung cancers, and is a major health
      problem. The main etiology of lung cancer is well recognized and established to be cigarette
      smoking which accounts for up to 80% of the cases in the western countries. Due to success of
      anti-smoking campaig, we anticipate to see less smoking related lung cancer and more
      non-smoking related lung cancer which is rising rapidly. For eg, currently in Singapore,
      smoking only accounts for 50-60% of all lung cancers, this is particularly true in female
      patients, as smoking occured in 30-40% of female lung cancer patients only.

      It is unclear if there is any significant difference in the fundamental biology between
      smoking and non-smoking related lung cancers, particularly in areas of natural course of
      disease, genetic changes of tumor cells, clinical presentation, response to treatment or
      survival. These are potential aspects for further investigation.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  Malignant pleural effusion proven by cytological examination.

          -  Patient must have stage IIIB or IV disease with malignant pleural effusion.

          -  We plan to recruit 16 patients who have smoked cigarettes of at least 20 pack per
             year, 16 patients who do not smoke but have been exposed to second hand smoking by
             living with a person who has smoked 20 pack per year cigarette in the same household
             and 16 patients who are non-smokers (never smoked) and no second hand smoking exposure
             in the same household. The accrual will be stopped once the number of patients is
             reached in each group.

          -  ECOG PS 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Measurable disease (in addition to malignant pleural effusion).

          -  No prior chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent disease. Patient may have surgery or
             radiation or combined chemoradiation, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy at primary
             diagnosis. This kind of chemotherapy will not be counted as patient has had prior
             chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent NSCLC.

          -  WBC &gt; 3500/uL and ANC &gt; 2,000/uL, platelet &gt; 100,000/uL AST/ALT &lt; 3 X UNL, bilirubin &lt;
             1.5 mg/dL ( or &lt; 35 uM), creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL (or &lt; 125uM for men and 90uM for
             women).

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  No history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or life-threatening
             arrthymia (such as ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, brachycardia
             &lt; 40/min or atrial fibrillation or flutter with ventricular rate &gt; 150/min) within 6
             months of entry.

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Negative mammogram and ovaries examination by CT scans and no history of breast cancer
             or ovarian cancer in female patients.

          -  Negative pregnancy test in female menstruating patient within one week of starting
             chemotherapy and use of effective contraceptive methods during study.

             abnormality is stable or improved after whole brain radiation, stereostatic
             radiosurgery or gamma knife treatment and/or dexamethasone for 3 weeks and patients
             fulfil all other eligibility criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status 3 or worse.

          -  Any prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent diseases.

          -  No measurable disease, even after drainage of pleural effusion.

          -  ANC &lt; 1,999/uL or Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dL (or &gt; 35uM)

          -  ALT/AST &gt; 3 x UNL

          -  Creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dL (or &gt; 125uM)

        Patient has history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or life-threatening
        arrthymia (such as ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial
