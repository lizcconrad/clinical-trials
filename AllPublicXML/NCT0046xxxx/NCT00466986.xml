      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of Abraxane and Carboplatin
      together will improve the chances of controlling recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal
      cancer.

      Current best practice recommends Carboplatin combined with Taxol in the treatment of Ovarian
      cancer.

      Taxol is paclitaxel in the solvent Cremophor-El and the solvent has been associated with
      significant side effects e.g. anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity. this requires the routine use
      of premedication with antihistamines and steroids.

      Abraxane by contrast is Cremophor-El free and is protein bound. This has 2 advantages over
      Taxol.

        1. No need for routine premedications

        2. Increased drug entry into cells facilitating greater potential for anti-tumor activity.

      Schedule: Carboplatin day1 every 28days. Abraxane day1,8,15 every 28days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent epithelial ovarian or primary
             peritoneal carcinoma. Patient will have been staged at diagnosis according to FIGO
             Classification.

          2. Measurable Disease by RECIST Criteria (defined by the presence of at least 1
             measurable lesion (see Section 7.7.1 for definition of measurable lesions) or elevated
             CA-125 in the absence of measurable disease. A pre-treatment sample of CA-125 will be
             collected within 2 weeks before treatment is started. A pre-treatment sample of CA-125
             should be at least twice the upper limit of normal.

          3. Patients must have disease recurrence 6 months or more after completion of front-line
             platinum and paclitaxel-containing regimen. Duration of response from prior therapy
             and prior consolidation therapy will be documented in case report forms for
             descriptive analysis.

          4. Patients must have received at least 3 cycles of a front-line taxane and
             platinum-containing regimen prior to entry on this study.

          5. Patients must have a documented complete clinical response on front-line therapy.

          6. Patients must be disease-free from prior malignancies for more than 5 years with the
             exception of curatively-treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          7. Life expectancy of &gt; 6 months.

          8. ECOG (Zubrod) performance status 0-2.

          9. Age &gt;18 years.

               -  platelets &gt; 100 x 10-9 c/L;

               -  Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL.

               -  total bilirubin NORMAL;

               -  alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5x ULN
