      Objective: L-[3-18F]-α–methyltyrosine (FMT) is an amino-acid tracer for PET. We evaluated the
      diagnostic usefulness of 18F-FMT PET in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Tumor
      uptake of 18F-FMT PET was compared with 18F-FDG PET and the correlation with L-type amino
      acid transporter 1 (LAT1) expression also investigated.

      Method: Fifty patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study, and a pair of PET study with
      18F-FMT and 18F-FDG was performed. LAT1 expression and Ki-67 labeling index of the resected
      tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemical study.
