      INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis is a prevalent disease process in children, affecting up to
      20% of children in the United States. Various treatment options are available to treat atopic
      dermatitis to include topical emollients, topical steroids, and topical calcineurin
      inhibitors. Each treatment option has benefits and potential risks. This study was done to
      determine if topical B12 could be a tolerable and efficacious alternative treatment option in
      this population.

      METHODS: The study was conducted as a placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective,
      randomized clinical trial with intraindividual left ⁄ right comparison. Parents were given 2
      containers of creams and instructed to apply the Vitamin B12 cream to one side of the body
      and the placebo cream to the contralateral side according to the randomization scheme.
