    <measure>Mean Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Concentrations as a Measure of Gene Expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of GSK256066 on ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels indicative of Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibition in nasal scrape samples and on protein biomarkers of PDE4 inhibition in lavage samples was evaluated. Nasal lavage and scrapes were taken 2 to 3 hour post morning dose; bilateral nasal lavage was conducted before the scrape. Nasal scrape samples were taken from alternate nostrils. The novel RNA markers presented are cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM), dual specificity phosphatase 1(DUSP1), fos-like antigen 2(FOSL2), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (NR4A2), Phosphodiesterase-4A (PDE4A), Regulator of G-protein signalling 1 (RGS1), Serine/threonine protein kinase SNF1 like kinase (SNF1LK). Nasal lavage cytospins were stained with a SNF1LK specific monoclonal antibody by indirect immunofluorescence. Adjusted Geometric Mean and Standard error logs are presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Electrocardiogram variables evaluated included PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QT corrected by Bazett's formula (QTcB), QT corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) and RR interval. ECG was performed pre-dose, one hour and four hour post-dose. The ECG measurements were made with the participant in a supine position having rested in this position for at least 10 minutes before each time-point. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose measurement on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

    <measure>Mean Levels of Total Vasodilator Stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP) Protein, Phosphorylated(Phospho)157 VASP (pVASP) and phospho239 VASP in Lavage Cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal lavage were taken 2 to 3 hour post morning dose; bilateral nasal lavage was conducted before the scrape. Nasal lavage samples were analyzed to explore the effects of GSK256066 on novel protein biomarkers including pVASP. Markers indicative of PDE4 inhibition such as VASP protein levels and phospho157 VASP were also measured in this study, in lavage cells, following positive data in an enabling study which showed increases in such protein levels in participants with allergic rhinitis following a single intranasal dose of salbutamol. Nasal lavage data from earlier studies showed that pVASP157 is the best marker and not pVASP239. pVASP239 was therefore not collected or analyzed as planned.</description>

        <title>Mean Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Concentrations as a Measure of Gene Expression</title>
        <description>The effect of GSK256066 on ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels indicative of Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibition in nasal scrape samples and on protein biomarkers of PDE4 inhibition in lavage samples was evaluated. Nasal lavage and scrapes were taken 2 to 3 hour post morning dose; bilateral nasal lavage was conducted before the scrape. Nasal scrape samples were taken from alternate nostrils. The novel RNA markers presented are cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM), dual specificity phosphatase 1(DUSP1), fos-like antigen 2(FOSL2), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (NR4A2), Phosphodiesterase-4A (PDE4A), Regulator of G-protein signalling 1 (RGS1), Serine/threonine protein kinase SNF1 like kinase (SNF1LK). Nasal lavage cytospins were stained with a SNF1LK specific monoclonal antibody by indirect immunofluorescence. Adjusted Geometric Mean and Standard error logs are presented.</description>

        <description>Electrocardiogram variables evaluated included PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QT corrected by Bazett's formula (QTcB), QT corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) and RR interval. ECG was performed pre-dose, one hour and four hour post-dose. The ECG measurements were made with the participant in a supine position having rested in this position for at least 10 minutes before each time-point. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose measurement on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</title>
        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

        <title>Mean Levels of Total Vasodilator Stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP) Protein, Phosphorylated(Phospho)157 VASP (pVASP) and phospho239 VASP in Lavage Cells</title>
        <description>Nasal lavage were taken 2 to 3 hour post morning dose; bilateral nasal lavage was conducted before the scrape. Nasal lavage samples were analyzed to explore the effects of GSK256066 on novel protein biomarkers including pVASP. Markers indicative of PDE4 inhibition such as VASP protein levels and phospho157 VASP were also measured in this study, in lavage cells, following positive data in an enabling study which showed increases in such protein levels in participants with allergic rhinitis following a single intranasal dose of salbutamol. Nasal lavage data from earlier studies showed that pVASP157 is the best marker and not pVASP239. pVASP239 was therefore not collected or analyzed as planned.</description>
