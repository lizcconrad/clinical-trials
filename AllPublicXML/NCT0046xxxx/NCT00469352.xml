  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand whether genes or certain factors in the
      environment determine how eyes will respond to Lucentis (ranibizumab) treatment. For example,
      whether having variants within specific genes means that a patient is likely to get better
      vision from treatment than another patient with different genes.

    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the developed
      world. The advanced stages of the disease are characterized by the development of geographic
      atrophy or choroidal neovascularization, both of which result in significant loss of vision.
      Development of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents such as ranibizumab has significantly improved
      outcomes for the neovascular for of the disease. However, it is not possible to predict which
      individuals will respond to the treatment.

      The objective of this study is to establish the association between genetic factors and
      treatment response to intravitreal Lucentis. This will be accomplished by SNP-genotyping
      participants for AMD-susceptibility and candidate angiogenesis-pathway genes, collecting
      environmental risk factor variables and evaluating clinical outcomes. The aim of this
      pharmacogenetics study will be to identify patients at the outset of their treatment that
      require more intensive therapy.
