    <textblock>
      This study will document efficacy and safety of the Axiom Worldwide DRX9000™ for treatment of
      low back pain (LBP) in a prospective, randomized, crossover, multicenter trial utilizing a
      standardized clinical research multimodal protocol. During the first two weeks subjects are
      randomized to receive either conservative care or DRX treatment first and then cross over to
      receive either conservative care or DRX treatment the next 6 weeks. This study will test the
      hypothesis that standardized 6-week treatment regimen of spinal decompression using DRX9000™
      will reduce chronic lower back pain more than conservative therapy (current baseline
      therapy).
