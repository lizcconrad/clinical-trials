  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the change in muscle activity during gait with
      the use of ankle foot orthoses in children diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A small group of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy is investigated by 3D instrumented
      gait analysis. Muscle activity is measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) of selected
      lower limb muscle groups. Kinematic, Kinetic, and sEMG data are compared between both lower
      limbs walking with and without an ankle foot orthosis. Data are also compared with those of
      an healthy control group.
