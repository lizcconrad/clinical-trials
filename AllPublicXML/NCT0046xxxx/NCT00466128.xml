      The purpose of this study is to determine if the short term use of indomethacin will reduce
      the number of women delivering within 48 hours when given to women with preterm premature
      rupture of membranes (PPROM) between 24- 32 weeks of gestation. We hypothesize that
      indomethacin's anti-inflammatory and tocolytic action will reduce the number of women
      delivering within 48 hours when given to women with PPROM between 24-32 weeks of gestation.

    <textblock>
      Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is defined as rupture of the chorioamniotic
      membranes before the onset of labor prior to 37 weeks of gestation. The etiology of PPROM is
      not well understood but likely to be multifactorial. Although the underlying mechanism of
      PPROM is unknown, some speculate it is the human's inflammatory response to bacterial
      infection with the subsequent production of prostaglandins which weaken the fetal membranes.
      Therefore, the use of indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, may decrease prostaglandin
      synthesis leading to less uterine irritability and prevention of weakened membranes.

      This is a double blind randomized controlled trial comparing indomethacin to placebo in women
      with PPROM between the gestational ages of 24-32 weeks. Women between the gestational age of
      24 to 32 weeks with premature rupture of membranes and not in active labor will be eligible
      for this clinical trial. After informed consent, patients will be randomized to either
      indomethacin or placebo. Maternal and neonatal outcomes will be assessed.
