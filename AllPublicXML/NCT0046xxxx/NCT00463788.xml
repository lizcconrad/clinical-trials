      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether overall response to cetuximab
      combined with cisplatin is better than overall response to cisplatin alone together with
      showing that the overall response for cetuximab and cisplatin was above a pre-specified
      threshold of 0.2 in the treatment of &quot;triple negative&quot; metastatic breast cancer.

      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the differences between the two treatment
      groups using the following criteria : Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time, Overall Survival
      (OS), Time to Response (TTR) and Safety.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomization to disease progression, death or last tumour assessment, reported between day of first participant randomized, 20 June 2007, until cut-off date, 31 July 2009</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS was defined as the duration from randomization until radiological progression according to investigator (based on RECIST) or death due to any cause. Only deaths within 85 days of last tumor assessment were considered. Participants without event were censored on the date of last tumor assessment.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomization to death or last day known to be alive, reported between day of first participant randomized, 20 June 2007, until cut-off date, 05 April 2010</time_frame>
    <description>The OS time was defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants without event were censored at the last date known to be alive or at the clinical cut-off date, whatever was earlier.</description>

    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from the first dose of study treatment (cetuximab or cisplatin) to first assessment of CR or PR, reported between day of first participant randomized, 20 June 2007, until cut-off date, 31 July 2009</time_frame>
    <description>The TTR was determined for participants whose confirmed BOR (based on RECIST) was either a CR or a PR . It was defined as the time from the first dose study treatment until the date of the first assessment of confirmed CR or PR.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive an initial dose of cetuximab 400 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) followed by weekly doses of 250 mg/m^2. All doses will be given by intravenous (IV) infusion.
Subjects will receive cisplatin (75 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1) every 3 weeks, with a maximum of 6 cycles.
Administration of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) will be stopped upon the first occurrence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive cisplatin (75 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1) every 3 weeks, with a maximum of 6 cycles.
Subjects have the option of receiving cetuximab plus cisplatin at progression within the first 6 cycles, or cetuximab alone at progression after the 6 cycles.
Administration of the IMP will be stopped upon the first occurrence of disease progression (except in cisplatin arm where switch to cetuximab plus cisplatin, or cetuximab alone is possible), unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Following a mandate of the Spanish health authority, data from all participants at site 0904 (Spain) were excluded from analyses due to evidence of misconduct, with significant deviations from Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Therefore, 173 of the 181 randomized participants were considered in the full analysis set (FAS).</pre_assignment_details>
