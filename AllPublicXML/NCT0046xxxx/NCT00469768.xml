  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IPM 018 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted at one site in
      Belgium among 24 healthy, HIV-negative women to evaluate dapivirine release for 28 days from
      matrix and reservoir intravaginal rings, each containing 25 mg of dapivirine, and to assess
      safety and tolerability compared to placebo
