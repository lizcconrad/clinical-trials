  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study we used the FreeStyle Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)
      System to obtain 30 days of glucose measurements from 30 people with diabetes treated with
      insulin. The purpose of this study is to characterize glycemia (glucose) control in 30 people
      without diabetes and to compare these data to the 30 people with diabetes from a previous
      study. Through this approach it may be possible to develop a means of establishing a model of
      normal glucose patterns and a basis of comparison with glucose patterns in people with
      diabetes.
