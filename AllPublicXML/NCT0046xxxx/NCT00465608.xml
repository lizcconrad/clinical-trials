      Problem and Objectives: There is currently no pharmacological treatment for curing post
      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The investigators will test whether propranolol when given
      immediately after trauma evocation is able to decrease the strength of the traumatic memory,
      and by extension, the severity of PTSD symptoms associated with that memory.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The subjects will show a significant pre/post decrease in PTSD symptoms.

        2. Those gains will be maintained at follow-up.

      Study Design: Open pharmacological trial.

      Method: On the first visit (V1), the subjects will describe their traumatic experience in
      writing and will receive the propranolol. A script describing this experience will be
      constructed to be used in the subsequent encounters to elicit the trauma memory. A week later
      (V2), before receiving the propranolol, subjects will be asked to read aloud their trauma
      script while imagining it as vividly as possible for 10 minutes. This weekly treatment will
      be repeated 6 times (from V1 to V6). A total of 6 doses of propranolol will be given. A
      self-report measure will be used to monitor improvement in PTSD symptomatology on the
      following visits: V1, V4, V6, V7 and V8 (3 month follow-up).

      Statistical Analyses: A repeated measure ANOVA (pre-test, post-test, and 3-month follow-up)
      using the PTSD symptom score will be conducted.. Three t-tests will be performed to examine
      simple effects. The alpha level will be set at p = .05 (two-tailed). Fisher's exact test will
      be used to examine whether Ss still meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD at the end of the
      study.

      Clinical Implications: If this treatment is effective, a randomized controlled trial will be
      launched. This treatment has the potential to become the first pharmacological treatment
      designed to cure PTSD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-65 years old

          -  Suffer from AZF-related PTSD (PCL score more than 44)

          -  Sign consent form

          -  Subjects must have health coverage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not diagnosed with current, chronic AZF-related PTSD

          -  Age &lt; 18 or &gt; 65

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mm Hg

          -  Medical condition that contraindicates the administration of propranolol, e.g.,
             history of congestive heart failure, heart block, insulin-requiring diabetes, chronic
             bronchitis, emphysema, or asthma. With regard to asthma, because many persons who say
             they have had an asthma attack, especially as a child, may only have had hay fever,
             another allergy, or another non-asthmatic episode, a blanket exclusion criterion may
             be overly restrictive. Therefore, asthma attacks will only be exclusionary if they:

               -  occurred within the past ten years,

               -  occurred at any time in life if induced by a β-blocker, or

               -  are currently being treated, regardless of the date of last occurrence.

        Cardiological consultation will be obtained as necessary.

          -  Previous adverse reaction to, or non-compliance with, a β-blocker

          -  Current use of medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with
             propranolol, including, other β-blockers, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers,
             and potent P450 2D6 inhibitors, e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, miconazole, sulconazole,
             metoclopramide, quinidine, ticlopidine, and ritonavir.

          -  Contraindicating psychiatric condition, including lifetime or current psychotic,
             bipolar, melancholic, or substance dependence or abuse disorder; suicidality.

          -  Initiation of, or change in, psychotropic medication within the previous two months.
             For subjects receiving stable doses of pharmacotherapy, they and their providers will
             be asked not to change the regimen except in clinically urgent circumstances; if this
             becomes necessary, a decision will be made on a case-by-case basis with regard to
             retaining the subject or terminating participation.

          -  Current participation in any psychotherapy (other than strictly supportive). Subjects
             will be asked not to initiate psychotherapy during the course of the proposed study
             except in clinically urgent circumstances; if this becomes necessary, a decision will
             be made on a case-by-case basis with regard to retaining the subject or terminating
             participation.

          -  Inability to understand the study's procedures, risks, and side effects, or to
             otherwise give informed consent for participation

          -  Does not understand French
