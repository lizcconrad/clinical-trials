  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will investigate important clinical outcomes of patients with acute
      carbon monoxide poisoning randomized to receive either one or three hyperbaric oxygen
      treatments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients presenting with acute carbon monoxide poisoning will receive one hyperbaric
      oxygen treatment (barring contraindications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy). After this
      treatment, eligible patients who provide consent will be randomly allocated to receive two
      sham sessions, or two additional hyperbaric oxygen sessions administered in a double-blind
      fashion.

      Outcome measures will be administered at 6 weeks and 6 months.

    <description>Before patients are offered an opportunity to participate in this study, they will receive a single hyperbaric oxygen session. During the first session, hyperbaric oxygen will be administered at 3.0 atmospheres absolute (atm abs) for 25 minutes breathing oxygen, 5 minutes air breathing, 25 minutes oxygen breathing, 5 minutes air breathing, pressure reduced to 2.0 atm abs for 30 minutes breathing oxygen, 5 minutes air breathing, and 30 minutes oxygen breathing.
For the second and third hyperbaric oxygen sessions, the subject will breathe 100% oxygen delivered at 2 atm abs for 90 minutes with two 5-minute air breathing periods.</description>

          -  History of prior brain injury (i.e., stroke, traumatic brain injury)

          -  Presence of chronic debilitating disease likely to result in death within 12 months
             (i.e., kidney failure on dialysis, heart failure)

          -  Subject has a significant medical condition or conditions that would interfere with
             the treatment, safety, or compliance with the protocol.

          -  Intubated subjects

          -  Subjects requiring greater than 50% oxygen by non-rebreather facemask or exhibiting

             requirements of the study or are unsuitable for any reason. The investigator and the

             document any waiver of these inclusion and exclusion criteria.
