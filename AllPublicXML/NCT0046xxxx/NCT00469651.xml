    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of candidate malaria vaccine MSP3 in children aged 12-24
      months in Tanzania in a highland area with low malaria transmission.

      Written informed consent will be sought from all guardians/parents of potentially
      participating children. Eligible children will be randomly allocated to receive either the
      the study vaccine (MSP3 for a total of 30 children)) or the control vaccine (hepatitis B for
      a total of 15 children). The vaccines will be given in 3 immunizations one month apart to all
      the study children and neither the clinical investigators nor the children's parents will be
      aware of which vaccine has been administered during the initial four months of the study. The
      study is designed to begin with a lower dose of the MSP3 vaccine (15µg of MSP3 for 15
      children) and then followed by the higher dose(30µg MSP3 for 15 children). Following each
      immunization, children will be evaluated for a seven day solicited symptoms. Unsolicited
      symptoms will also be collected throughout the study duration.

      The study will be overseen by an international safety monitoring committee who will follow
      safety matters closely as the trial progresses. The study will also be approved by the
      Tanzania National ethics Committee, The Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority, and the London
      school of hygiene and tropical medicine ethics committee. The study is planned to last 13
      months for each participant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double blind (observer blind, participant blind), randomized, controlled, dose
      escalation, Age deescalation, phase Ib study. It will include two parallel groups as follows:

        -  Group 1: 23 subjects (15 subjects receiving MSP3-LSP vaccine 15 µg and 8 subjects
           receiving Hepatitis B vaccine).

        -  Group 2: 22 subjects (15 subjects receiving MSP3-LSP vaccine 30 µg and 7 subjects
           receiving Hepatitis B vaccine).

      The Immunization schedule will be 0, 1, and 2 months for all cohorts and provisionally as
      following for each group:

        -  Study days 0, 28 and 56 for group 1

        -  Study days 14, 42, 70 for group 2 Vaccinations of groups 1 and 2 will be staggered:
           immunization in group 2 will start 2 weeks after group 1. This interval may be extended
           if deemed necessary in case of serious adverse events or other safety concerns.
           Randomization will be done for each group at the time of first vaccinations and only the
           study pharmacist will be aware of which vaccine is allocated to a particular study ID
           number. The pharmacist will have no other role and will be sworn to confidentiality.

      The study vaccine will be administered through the subcutaneous injection into right or left
      deltoid (alternately). Each child will be observed for at least 60 minutes after vaccination
      to evaluate and treat any acute adverse events.

      This will be followed by a Seven (7) day follow-up period for solicited adverse events (day
      of vaccination plus 6 subsequent days; twenty eight (28) day follow-up period for unsolicited
      adverse events (Vaccination day plus 27 subsequent days). The follow-up of serious adverse
      events (SAE's) for 12 months after the first dose of study vaccine (9 months after dose 3).
      Biological safety will be evaluated through regular physical examinations, blood sampling for
      routine clinical chemistry, and hematology). At the end of the follow-up period for
      unsolicited AEs (i.e., one month after the third dose), children will be followed by field
      workers at home at monthly intervals to record SAEs. There are 10 clinic visits planned,
      however, participants will be advised to report to the clinic any time they feel unwell.

      Data collection will be through participant record files from which transcription on to
      conventional Case Report Forms will be done. All the date on the CRFs will be verified by the
      clinical Monitor. The database will be locked after study day 84 to allow for an interim
      analysis to review safety and immunogenicity thus collected.
