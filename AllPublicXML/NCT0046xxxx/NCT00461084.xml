  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a treatment with Biaxin (clarithromycin) which is an
      antibiotic given by mouth for 3 months can delay the growth of your lymphoma or shrink the
      lymphoma. We would also like to see how Biaxin (clarithromycin) works on lymphoma and blood
      cells.There is some evidence that this medication may change the behavior of lymphocytes, in
      addition to its known anti-infection activity.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a biaxin (clarithromycin)-based antibiotic
      therapy in previously untreated patients with indolent lymphoma who do not require active
      lymphoma therapy (utilizing GELF criteria,). This is the primary objective Response rate (CR
      + PR) stratified for Follicular/Non-Follicular disease.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to understand the biologic correlates of indolent
      lymphoma biaxin (clarithromycin) response and progression:

      Response rate (CR + PR) according to H. pylori positive or negative (RR with a confidence
      interval will be estimated for each subset). Immunohistochemistry in all diagnostic biopsy
      specimens: Lymphocyte- Activated Macrophage (CD68) and other selected markers to clarify
      tumor infiltrating cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) studies to evaluate
      possible HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibition with biaxin (clarithromycin) therapy.
