      Primary objective: Efficacy of 4 weeks of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome®) at high dose
      [10 mg/kg/j] or at maximal tolerable dose in initial zygomycosis treatment. Evaluation after
      4 weeks of treatment or at end of treatment if it occurs before. Efficacy will be defined as
      objective responses; complete and partial response.

      Secondary objectives: Efficacy, tolerance and survival after 15 days of treatment, cumulative
      dose of AmBisome® necessary to obtain objective response, efficacy in operated and non
      operated patients, tolerance after 4 and 12 weeks treatment, survival, and relapse rate at 6
      months of 4 weeks of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome®) at high dose [10 mg/kg/j] or at
      maximal tolerable dose.

      Scheme : prospective, multicentric, non comparative therapeutic pilot study.

      Inclusion criteria: Presence on a tissue biopsy of large non septated hyphae compatible with
      zygomycete or presence of a zygomycete in culture associated with clinical or radiological
      abnormalities compatible with fungal invasive infection.

      Exclusion criteria: Life expectancy below 72 hours, pregnancy, breast feeding, polyene
      hypersensitivity, absence of histologic or mycologic zygomycosis documentation, absence of
      informed consent, previous treatment with polyene or other antifungal active on zygomycete
      (posaconazole, itraconazole) over 5 days during the month previous inclusion.

      Treatment : AmBisome® 10 mg/kg/j monotherapy during at least 15 days, then AmBisome® at
      maximal tolerable dose during 15 days associated with early optimal surgical treatment. After
      the first treatment month, following treatment is decided by referent physician.
