      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some find
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      kill tumor cells. Gemcitabine and cetuximab may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation
      therapy. Giving gemcitabine together with cetuximab and radiation therapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine when
      given together with cetuximab and radiation therapy in treating patients with locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride when administered with
           cetuximab and radiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic or
           periampullary region cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly in weeks 1-7 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 15-40 minutes once weekly in weeks 2-7. Patients also undergo
      radiotherapy 5 days a week in weeks 2-7. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
