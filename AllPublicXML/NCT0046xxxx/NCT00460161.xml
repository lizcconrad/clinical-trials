  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom pain is a common complication following limb amputation, and is thought to result
      from a system of pathophysiological mechanisms - peripheral, spinal, central and
      psychological. Treatment is primarily medical, using antidepressant and anticonvulsant
      medications. At present, there is no evidence-based approach for the management of phantom
      limb pain (PLP). Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese treatment during which thin needles
      (diameter 0.20-0.30mm) are inserted into various points on the skin. Studies of this
      treatment have found significant benefit in a number of conditions with chronic pain.

      We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo/sham -controlled study to evaluate whether
      acupuncture is an effective and safe modality for preventing and reducing PLP in patients
      following lower limb amputation. Patients requiring lower limb amputation (above-ankle) will
      be randomized into two groups, for real or placebo/sham acupuncture treatment. Both groups
      will be treated twice-weekly with a standardized (as opposed to individualized) acupuncture
      treatment protocol, using either true or placebo needles at sham acupuncture points, for a
      period of four weeks (eight treatments).

      The primary outcome to be evaluated will be PLP at 4 weeks, using a site-specific numerical
      rating pain scale (ss-NRS). Secondary outcome measures to be evaluated are: stump pain
      (ss-NRS); analgesic use (Tramadol, 100mg Tablet); and depressive symptoms, using the Beck
      Depression Score. Blinding of the participants will be evaluated using a Validation of
      Blinding Questionnaire at the end of the treatment period.
