      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is safe to receive an injection of your
      own bone marrow adult stem cells (autologous BM-MNC) to your heart wall during coronary
      artery bypass graft (CABG).

      The experimental design will be a Phase I safety trial in which all subjects from the VA Salt
      Lake City Health Care System presenting with CAD and associated depressed LV function
      requiring myocardial surgical revascularization will be eligible for enrollment. Patients
      enrolled in the study will receive autologous BM-MNC as adjunct to CABG. The primary outcome
      measure will be safety as measured by the incidence of postoperative Serious Adverse Events
      (SAE) and Adverse Events (AE). The secondary outcome measures will be LV function, myocardial
      perfusion, and clinical improvement. The trial will have one experiment with one patient
      group. Group 1 (n=15) will follow standard Phase I dose escalation curve on a magnitude of
      0.5 log increase after every third patient. Dose escalation will continue until a dosage of 1
      x108 cells/pt is reached or maximum tolerated dose equivalent (MTDE) is identified. Cellular
      therapeutic products such as BM-MNCS do not possess the same pharmacologic profile as small
      molecule drugs, and thus, do not possess predictable metabolic activity and metabolite
      production, as do traditional pharmaceuticals. This can make the identity of a maximum
      tolerated dose somewhat difficult. We are therefore using the term MTDE instead of MTD to
      indicate a cell dosage that is consistent with clinical morbidity beyond obvious clinical
      benefit. The characteristics identifying a MTDE could be any adverse event felt to be related
      to the actual cell dosage or its escalation. Although unlikely, MTDE events could include
      microembolic phenomena, hematoma at the injection site, obvious myocardial congestion or
      ischemia at the injection site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veteran

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Have documented CAD and depressed LV function (EF &lt;40%) that is felt to be
             appropriately treated with surgical revascularization by the VA Salt Lake City Health
             Care System Cardiothoracic Surgery team and in accordance with the published 2004
             ACC/AHA Guideline Update for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery; specifically, in
             accordance with the described indication for CABG in patients with Poor LV Function
             (see below).

        Class I

          1. CABG should be performed in patients with poor LV function who have significant left
             main coronary artery stenosis. (Level of Evidence: B)

          2. CABG should be performed in patients with poor LV function who have left main
             equivalent:

             significant (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis of the proximal LAD and proximal
             left circumflex artery. (Level of Evidence: B)

          3. CABG should be performed in patients with poor LV function who have proximal LAD
             stenosis with 2- or 3-vessel disease. (Level of Evidence: B)

        Class IIa

        CABG may be performed in patients with poor LV function with significant viable
        noncontracting, revascularizable myocardium and without any of the above anatomic patterns.
        (Level of Evidence: B)

          -  NHYA/CCA Class I or higher

          -  Abnormal cardiac wall segment on preoperative data

          -  Acutely stable myocardium without evidence of cardiogenic shock or evolving myocardial
             infarction

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  EF 40%

          -  CAD not amenable to CABG

          -  ACC/AHA Poor LV Function Class III - CABG should not be performed in patients with
             poor LV function without evidence of intermittent ischemia and without evidence of
             significant revascularizable viable myocardium. (Level of Evidence: B) Evidence of
             intermittent ischemia is defined clinically by Cardiovascular Disease Classification
             (see chart above). Objectively, this can be demonstrated by various modalities that
             can demonstrate ischemic myocardium. Such modalities include SCA, Echo, CMRI, and
             radionucleotide imaging.

          -  Patients undergoing cardiac re-operation

          -  Patients with operable valvular disease

          -  Patients with preexisting malignant arrhythmia

          -  Patients with preexisting systemic malignancy

          -  Patients with a contraindication to MRI

          -  Presence of ongoing local or systemic infection

          -  Participation in another clinical trial

          -  Emergency operation

          -  Preoperative cardiogenic shock or evolving myocardial infarction

          -  ASA Class V or contraindication to general anesthesia

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Prisoner

          -  Active history of alcohol or substance abuse

          -  Active psychiatric history leading to potential for poor study participation and
             follow-up
