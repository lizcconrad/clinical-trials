      The purpose of this study is to determine if antibiotic treatment of appendicitis is an
      option compared to surgery. The investigators' hypothesis is that a majority of patients with
      appendicitis can heal without surgery and that there are several advantages with antibiotic
      treatment related to time to recover, complications and economical aspects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appendicitis is a common disease; 1/1000 gets it every year. 7% will get appendicitis during
      their lifetime. Surgery, open or laparoscopic, is the traditional treatment. A number of
      these patients don´t have appendicitis when operated on and the operation is therefore
      unnecessarily performed. It is also a risk for complications after surgery; for instance
      wound infection, postoperative small bowel obstruction.

      In our study we will compare antibiotic as the only treatment with traditional surgical
      treatment. Patients with &quot;suspected appendicitis&quot; are randomized to either surgery or
      antibiotics according to their birth date.

      Patients in &quot;the surgery group&quot; are treated according to standard routines. Patients in &quot;the
      antibiotic group&quot; are treated with intravenous antibiotics for at least 24h - this regime can
      be prolonged if clinical recovery doesn´t occur - and submitted from hospital with oral
      antibiotics. If patients in the antibiotic group deteriorate during the hospital stay
      (suspicious perforation) they will be operated.

      Parameters that will be analyzed are:

        -  primary healing in the antibiotic group

        -  frequency of relapse in appendicitis in the antibiotic group

        -  complications in both groups

        -  economical analysis (hospital stay, sick leave time, time off work) in both groups
