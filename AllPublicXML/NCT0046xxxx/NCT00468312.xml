    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average AM Instantaneous (NOW) Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through 15 days daily</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS was defined as the sum of the following four nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, and sneezing; each symptom scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 12.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average AM Instantaneous (NOW) Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through 15 days daily</time_frame>
    <description>TOSS was defined as the sum of the following three ocular symptoms: redness of eyes, itching/burning eyes, and tearing/watering eyes; each symptom scored on a scale of 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on the scale is 9.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in AM NOW Nasal Congestion Score Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through 15 days daily</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal congestion was one of the symptoms measures in the TNSS and was scored on a scale of 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 3.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) Total Score at Endpoint (Last Post Baseline Evaluation Carried Forward)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The RQLQ consisted of 28 items that fell into the following seven domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. Each of the items was scored from 0 = not troubled to 6 = extremely troubled, and the total of the seven domains was the primary focus of this quality of life evaluation. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 42. The Endpoint was the last post baseline evaluation carried forward and was Day 15 for the majority of the participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in AM Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through 15 days daily</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were to measure nasal airflow twice daily (in the morning prior to study drug dosing and in the evening) using their PNIF meter. The highest of 3 assessments was to be recorded in the electronic diary. The PNIF meter limits were between 30 and 370 liters/minute. Normal values range between 100 and 150 liters/minute. A positive change from Baseline correlates with improved nasal air flow.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be 12 years of age or older, of either sex and of any race.

          -  Must have at least a 2-year documented history of SAR which exacerbates during the
             study season.

          -  Must have a positive skin-prick test response to an appropriate seasonal allergen at
             Screening (Visit 1). IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to an appropriate seasonal allergen
             (ie, prevailing trees and/or grasses) must be documented by a positive response to the
             skin prick test with wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than diluent control after 20
             minutes.

          -  Must be clinically symptomatic at the Screening Visit.

          -  Must be clinically symptomatic at the Baseline Visit.

          -  Must be in general good health as confirmed by routine clinical and laboratory testing
             and ECG results. Clinical laboratory test (CBC, blood chemistries, and urinalysis)
             must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator and the
             sponsor.

          -  Must be free of any clinically significant disease, other than SAR, that would
             interfere with the study evaluations.

          -  A subject and/or a parent/guardian must be willing to give written informed consent
             and must be able to adhere to dosing and visit schedules and meet study requirements.

             the subject's participation in the study. Particular attention should be given to
             exclude subjects with conditions that would currently interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug or interfere with the
             subject's ability to complete or reliably complete the diaries.

          -  Significant medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, might
             interfere with the study or require treatment.

        <description>TNSS was defined as the sum of the following four nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, and sneezing; each symptom scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 12.</description>

        <population>All randomized participants were to be included in the analysis (intent-to-treat principle). However, participants with a missing evaluation at a given visit or time point were not included in the analysis for that evaluation. This included participants without a baseline score for a given change-from-baseline evaluation.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in AM Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</title>
        <description>Participants were to measure nasal airflow twice daily (in the morning prior to study drug dosing and in the evening) using their PNIF meter. The highest of 3 assessments was to be recorded in the electronic diary. The PNIF meter limits were between 30 and 370 liters/minute. Normal values range between 100 and 150 liters/minute. A positive change from Baseline correlates with improved nasal air flow.</description>

        <population>All randomized participants were to be included in the analysis (intent-to-treat principle). However, participants with a missing evaluation at a given visit or time point were not included in the analysis for that evaluation. This included participants without a baseline score for a given change-from-baseline evaluation.</population>
