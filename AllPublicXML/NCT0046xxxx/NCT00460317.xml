  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if treatment with AMG 706 (motesanib diphosphate) in combination with paclitaxel
      and carboplatin improves overall survival compared to treatment with placebo in combination
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin in subjects with advanced non-squamous NSCLC and in subjects
      with adenocarcinoma histology (adenocarcinoma subpopulation).
