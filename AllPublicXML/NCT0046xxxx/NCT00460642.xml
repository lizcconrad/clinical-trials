  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      26% of all ART cycles performed in the USA in 2003 (CDC data) are frozen embryo transfers
      (FET) and transfer of embryos resulting from egg donation (ED) to recipients. The typical
      protocol used to prepare a recipient for ET involves GnRH agonist (Lupron, Tap
      Pharmaceuticals) to down regulate the patient. A GnRH antagonist, such as Cetrotide (EMD
      Serono), is comparable to GnRH agonist and FDA approved to prevent spontaneous ovulation with
      ART treatment, and its usage decreases significantly the number of injections that the
      patient receives with treatment. The working hypothesis for this study is that the GnRH
      antagonist (Cetrotide) can be used instead of an agonist to achieve effective down regulation
      in FET and ED cycles. Presumably, patients will prefer Cetrotide over Lupron because of the
      markedly fewer injections required.
