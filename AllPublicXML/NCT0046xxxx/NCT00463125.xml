  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma; SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterized by a
           progressive fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs.

        -  A diffuse cutaneous microvascular damage occurs in 30-50% of patients, often leading to
           digital ulcers development, responsible for pain, functional disability, disfiguring
           scars, digital bony reabsorption, infection and osteomyelitis.

        -  Although the availability of drugs as i.v. prostacyclin analogs, oral vasodilating
           agents, oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, oral endothelin receptor blockers has
           improved the prognosis, digital ulcers are frequently refractory to the medical
           treatment.

        -  Preliminary data seems to demonstrate a pivotal role played by some growth factors
           (PDGF, TGF beta 1-2, IGF) in the process of ulcers healing: tissue regeneration and
           re-epithelization. Alpha-granules in the platelets store these factors in significant
           amount.

        -  Recently, the application of a gel rich in platelets, prepared from donors’ plasma taken
           by apheresis, seems to be beneficial to enhance pressure and vascular ulcers healing.

        -  On the basis of these considerations we expect that application of a platelet gel,
           combined with advanced dressing and conventional medical therapy, makes a more rapid
           healing of digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis. We decided to conduct a
           double blind RCT to test this hypothesis
