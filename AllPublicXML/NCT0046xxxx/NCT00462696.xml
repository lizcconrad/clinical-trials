      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may help in
      learning how well chemotherapy works to kill breast cancer cells and allow doctors to plan
      better treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin and docetaxel, may stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue
      that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying MRI in evaluating early response to chemotherapy in
      women receiving chemotherapy for infiltrating breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the feasibility (reproducibility and repeatability) of MRI for assessing tumor
           vascularity in women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for infiltrative breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the results obtained by semiquantitative measurement of vascularization (MRI) vs
           traditional empirical evaluation.

        -  Evaluate the MRI accuracy for the measurement of tumoral volume after completion of
           chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an uncontrolled, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising epirubicin hydrochloride IV and
      docetaxel IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo dynamic-contrast MRI before treatment, 3 weeks after the first course of
      chemotherapy, and 3 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. They also undergo a bilateral
      mammogram and sonography and clinical examination.

      Within 22-35 days after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo breast-conserving
      surgical resection of tumor and lymph nodes or mastectomy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
