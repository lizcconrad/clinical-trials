  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, a gland that lies behind the stomach. The
      inflammation may develop suddenly (acute pancreatitis) or over many years (chronic
      pancreatitis). The pancreas produces the hormones, insulin and glucagon to control
      metabolism. The hormones and enzymes flow from the pancreas through the pancreatic duct into
      the upper part of the small intestine.

      Most chronic pancreatitis patients often experience chronic abdominal pain during the course
      of the disease. Thalidomide increased the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), which is
      important in regulating intestinal inflammation. Thalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for a leprosy skin condition, erythema nodosum lerosum (ENL), but not
      for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. In this case it is considered experimental.
