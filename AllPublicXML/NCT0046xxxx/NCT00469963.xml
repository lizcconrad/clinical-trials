      RATIONALE: Specialized internal radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation
      directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well internal radiation therapy works in
      treating patients with primary liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine tumor response to selective internal radiation therapy comprising yttrium Y 90
           resin microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) in patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the health-related quality of life of patients receiving this regimen.

        -  Determine the survival of patients receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo selective internal radiation therapy comprising yttrium Y 90 resin
      microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) via catheter directly into the hepatic artery on day 1.

      Health-related quality of life is assessed prior to initial treatment and then periodically
      thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 12-24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>The assessment will include a Karnofsky score the patient-completed SF-36 questionnaire. This information will be assessed at each quarterly evaluation, as well as any unscheduled clinical appointments. Karnofsky functional performance36 will be assessed by a clinician. This widely-used scale ranges from 0 to 100 and derives three broad categories of functional performance (able: 80-100; unable: 50-70; and disabled: 0-40).
Patient report of HRQOL will be determined via the Medical Outcome Study 36-item short form (SF-36)37, which includes eight individual scales, physical and mental component summary scores, and is normed to both healthy and clinical populations.</description>
