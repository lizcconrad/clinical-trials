  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycaemic emergencies are associated with significant mortality (mortality in Diabetic
      Ketoacidosis 0.65 - 3.3% and in HyperOsmolar Non-Ketotic Coma 12 -17%). To reduce morbidity
      and mortality, prompt intervention and coma and close monitoring are essential. The study is
      designed to investigate whether a simple intervention with a long acting insulin can improve
      resolution of acidosis and hyperglycaemia, prevent recurrence of ketoacidosis and shorten
      hospital stay.

      This is a randomised trial concerning patients presenting in A &amp; E with a diabetic emergency,
      either a Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) or a Hyperosmolar Non-Ketotic Coma (HONC). Once informed
      consent has been given, each patient will receive standard intravenous treatment. They will
      also receive a daily sub-cutaneous bolus of either a long-acting insulin or a placebo.

      Blood will be taken at regular intervals to analyse the rate of fall of glucose and
      normalisation of blood pH.
