      Summary:

      Postoperative delirium is a highly prevalent disease (10–30% prevalence) after surgery in
      intensive care unit, however, it is often misdiagnosed and mistreated. The aim of the present
      project is to investigate risk factors for postoperative delirium in more detail, to evaluate
      respective cognitive test systems and to measure EEG activity parallel to patients’ serum
      anticholinergic activity. The pathophysiology of delirium is unknown up to now: a possible
      dysbalance between cerebral acetylcholine and dopamine concentrations is a likely hypothesis.
      Therefore, the measurement of peripheral serum anticholinergic activity could be a new
      prognostic factor for evaluation of delirium. Because delirium is also associated with higher
      postoperative mortality and morbidity, with delayed functional recovery, and postoperative
      delirium makes patient management much more difficult, increases costs, and, above all,
      causes severe discomfort to the patient new interdisciplinary diagnostic strategies are
      necessary to resolve this problem.
