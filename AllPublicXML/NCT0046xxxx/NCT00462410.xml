      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the consequences of advertisement on treatment compliance in women with breast
           cancer.

        -  Determine the factors favoring or not favoring adherence to the medical recommendations.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their medical and nonmedical caregivers are interviewed by a
      sociologist or anthropologist twice over 1 year. The first interview is at the consultation
      visit and the second interview is at the patient's home. The impact of advertisement on
      treatment compliance is measured.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study.
