  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MabThera in combination with
      methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one
      or more anti-TNF therapies. Patients will receive MabThera 1000mg i.v. on days 1 and 15, and
      methotrexate (10-25mg/week p.o. or parenteral), together with methylprednisolone 100mg i.v.
      prior to infusion of MabThera. After week 24, eligible patients may receive re-treatment. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100
      individuals.

    <measure>Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS-28)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 was calculated from the number of swollen joints and tender joints using the 28 joints count, the ESR (millimeters per hour [mm/hr]) and PtGA of disease activity with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity. DAS28 ≤3.2 equals (=) low disease activity, DAS28 greater than (&gt;)3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Modified Total Sharp-Genant Score (mTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening and Weeks 24 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Posterior-anterior (PA) radiograph of each hand and anterior-posterior (AP) radiograph of each foot were taken separately and assessed according to Genant's method as modified from Sharp's method. The Sharp-Genant score=total of the erosion score and the joint space narrowing (JSN) score of all the hands and feet. Erosion Score: 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=Normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. JSN Score:13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). Maximum total erosion score in hands=100 and in feet=42; maximum scores for JSN in the hands=100 and in feet=48. Maximum modified Sharp score achievable is 290. A lower number change from Baseline indicated a better score. Change in scores was calculated as change=final score minus initial score.</description>

Participants also received MTX 10 to 25 mg/week, PO or parenterally, and folate at a stable dose of ≥5 mg/week, PO, either as a single dose or as divided daily doses from Day 1 through Week 24. Participants also received prednisone ≤10 mg/day, PO, OR equivalent corticosteroid, OR NSAIDs, PO, from Day 1 through Week 24. Eligible participants who completed the first 24-week course were entered into a second course.</description>

          <description>The percentage of participants categorized as good, moderate, or nonresponders according to the EULAR response criteria at Week 24. Participants were categorized as good responders if the intensity of their symptoms was in the “low disease activity (DAS28 less than [&lt;]3.2)” category after treatment, and their symptoms significantly decreased to &gt;1.2. Participants were categorized as moderate responders if the intensity of their symptoms was in the “moderate or high disease activity (DAS28 &gt;3.2)” category after treatment, and the symptoms significantly decreased to &gt;1.2; or if the intensity of their symptoms was in the “low or moderate disease activity (DAS28 &lt;5.1)” category, and the DAS28 score changed more than 0.6 or 1.2 or less. Participants were categorized as non-responders if they did not fall into the good or moderate categories.</description>

        <description>Posterior-anterior (PA) radiograph of each hand and anterior-posterior (AP) radiograph of each foot were taken separately and assessed according to Genant’s method as modified from Sharp’s method. The Sharp-Genant score=total of the erosion score and the joint space narrowing (JSN) score of all the hands and feet. Erosion Score: 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=Normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. JSN Score:13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). Maximum total erosion score in hands=100 and in feet=42; maximum scores for JSN in the hands=100 and in feet=48. Maximum modified Sharp score achievable is 290. A lower number change from Baseline indicated a better score. Change in scores was calculated as change=final score minus initial score.</description>

        <description>JSN Score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). Maximum total scores for JSN in the hands was 100 and in the feet was 48, for a maximum overall score of 148. Total JSN was for both hands and feet.</description>
