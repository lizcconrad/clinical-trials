    <textblock>
      It has been reported that Baclofen is an appropriate tool in the therapeutic management of
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. To objectify gastroesophageal reflux combined
      pH-metry/impedance monitoring was applied to patients with persistent reflux-associated
      symptoms despite PPI-therapy (40mg esomeprazole for 2 weeks). After provement of pathological
      findings in the test PPI-dosage was escalated to double standard-dosage for another for
      weeks. In case of persistent symptoms another ph-metry/impedance monitoring was performed. In
      case of pathological findings additional baclofen was administered to the therapeutic regime.
      After 3 months another ph-metry/impedance monitoring was performed. At the time point of the
      tests a questionnaire was completed.

      Aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of high dosage PPI-therapy and additional
      baclofen in patients with persistent symptoms and objectified gastroesophageal reflux.
