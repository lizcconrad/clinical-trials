      RATIONALE: The CAT-8015 immunotoxin can bind tumor cells and kill them without harming normal
      cells. This may be an effective treatment for hairy cell leukemia(HCL) that has not responded
      to chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase I dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of CAT-8015
      immunotoxin in treating patients who have hairy cell leukemia (HCL) that has not responded to
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive CAT-8015 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 followed by rest.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to a total of 10 courses in the absence of dose
      limiting toxicity, complete response or disease progression. Patients are followed at 1, 3,
      6,12,15,18, 21, 24 months following the start of the last treatment cycle.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each will receive escalating doses of recombinant CAT-8015 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose proceeding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, between16 to 25 new patients will be added to the MTD cohort depending on how
      well the CAT-8015 is tolerated.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia

          -  Measurable disease

        At least one of the following indications for treatment:

          -  Neutropenia (ANC &lt;1000 cells/µL)

          -  Anemia (Hgb &lt;10g/dL)

          -  Thrombocytopenia (Plt &lt;100,000/µL)

          -  An absolute lymphocyte count of &gt;20,000 cells/µL, or

          -  Symptomatic splenomegaly

          -  Patient’s must have had at least 2 prior systemic therapies. There must have been at
             least 2 prior courses of purine analog, or 1 if the response to this course lasted &lt;2
             years, or if the patient had unacceptable toxicity to purine analog.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

        Performance status • ECOG 0-2

        Life expectancy

        • Life expectancy of greater than 6 months, as assessed by the principal investigator

        Other

          -  Patients with other cancers who meet eligibility criteria and have had less than 5
             years of disease free survival will be considered on a case-by-case basis

          -  Ability to understand and sign informed consent

          -  Female and male patients agree to use an approved method of contraception during the
             study

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Documented and ongoing central nervous system involvement with their malignant disease
             (history of CNS involvement is not an exclusion criterion)

          -  History of bone marrow transplant

             measured by ELISA, or antibody that neutralizes the binding of CAT-8015 to CD22 as
             measured by a competition ELISA.

          -  HIV positive serology (due to increased risk of severe infection and unknown

             anti-neoplastic therapy)

          -  Baseline coagulopathy &gt; grade 3 unless due to anticoagulant therapy

          -  A patient will not be excluded because of pancytopenia ≥ Grade 3, or erythropoietin
             dependence, if it is due to disease, based on the results of bone marrow studies

        Pulmonary function:

        • Patients with &lt; 50% of predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or &lt;50% of predicted
        diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), corrected for hemoglobin concentration and
        alveolar volume. Note: Patients with no prior history of pulmonary illness are not required
        to have PFTs. FEV1 will be assessed following bronchodilator therapy.

        Recent prior therapy:
