  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of intravenous Bevacizumab in patients with pathologically confirmed
      nonresectable primary adrenocortical cancer (ACC). Patients must have received no prior
      therapy. They will receive Bevacizumab as a single agent every 2 weeks intravenously until
      disease progression. This study will be open at multiple sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenocortical carcinoma(ACC)is a rare malignancy with an incidence of 1.5 to 2 per million
      per year in the United states. Surgery is the only therapeutic option that can prolong
      survival. Currently there are no therapies that have been proven to prolong survival for
      patients with nonsurgically resectable disease. ACC has been shown to be highly resistant to
      standard chemotherapy, therefore, it is important that we test agents with mechanisms of
      action. This is a single arm phase II study of Bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor, given
      as a single agent at 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks in patients with unresectable ACC. Bevicizumab
      will be used as first line therapy. The study will test if Bevacizumab will be able to
      prolong the time to progression. If a delay in time to progression of 4 months or greater is
      seen, this will be considered clinically meaningful and further studies will be considered.
      This study will be conducted at multiple institutions (see below).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must provide written informed consent

          -  Subjects must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Subjects must have histologically confirmed ACC by the Department of Pathology at
             Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center

          -  Subjects must have inoperable disease

          -  This is a first and/or second line study. Patients must have completed only one or
             fewer regimes of systemic therapy. They may have received one prior systemic therapy
             either: a) mitotane, or b)chemotherapy, or c) experimental therapy, or d) concurrent
             chemotherapy and mitotane, or e) no prior systemic therapy

          -  Subjects must have a life expectancy of three or more months

          -  If subjects have received some form of systemic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy or
             mitotane), they should have completed that systemic therapy at least 28 days before
             beginning Bevacizumab

          -  All subjects of child-bearing potential(men and women) must agree to the use of
             effective means of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years wtih
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ

          -  Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater than CTC grade 2 from previous anticancer
             therapy (except alopecia)
