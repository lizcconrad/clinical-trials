    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The disease activity score (DAS28) is an evaluation index of rheumatoid arthritis. The DAS28 applies a mathematical formula based on the following parameters: 1. TJC-28 joints, 2. SJC -28 joints, 3. ESR or CRP measurement, 4. Participant's judgement on his own overall health (global health [GH]) status expressed by a VAS (0 [no disease activity] to 100 [maximum disease activity]). The mathematical formula is 0.56 × √28TJC + 0.28 × √28SJC + 0.7 x loge ESR + 0.014 × GH. The DAS28 scale ranges from score of 0 to 10, where lower scores indicate best disease control and higher scores indicate worsening of disease. Change from Baseline = difference between the score at Week 24 and the score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With DAS28 Low Disease Activity and DAS28 Remission at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is an evaluation index of RA. The DAS28 applies a mathematical formula based on the following parameters: 1. TJC- 28 joints, 2. SJC- 28 joints, 3. ESR or CRP measurement, 4. Participant's judgement on his own overall health status (GH) expressed by a visual analogue scale VAS (0 [no disease activity] to 100 [maximum disease activity]). The mathematical formula is 0.56 × √28TJC + 0.28 × √28SJC + 0.7 x loge ESR + 0.014 × GH. The DAS28 scale ranges from score of 0 to 10. A participant was categorized as having low disease activity, if participant's DAS28 score was &lt;= 3.2, and was categorized as having clinical remission if participant's DAS28 score was &lt; 2.6.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Good, Moderate, or no European League Against Rheumatism Responses at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response is defined based on the DAS28 score and the EULAR response criteria (Van Gestel et al, 1996 and 1999). The DAS28 scale ranges from score of 0 to 10, where lower scores indicate best disease control and higher scores indicate worsening of disease. At a given visit, participants with a DAS28 score of &lt; 3.2 are considered good responders if the change from baseline in their DAS28 score is &gt;1.2. Participants with a DAS28 score &gt;= 3.2 to 5.1 are considered moderate responders if the change from baseline in their DAS28 score is &lt;=1.2 to &gt;=0.6. Participants with DAS28 score &gt;5.1 are considered non-responders if the change from baseline in their DAS28 score is &lt;=1.2 to &gt;=0.6.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline of Short Form 36 Total Scores at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (SF)-36 determined participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual daily activities because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems since last month; 7) limitations in usual work (house hold and outside) due to emotional problems 8) current and 1 year past status of health 9) general mental health. Transforming and standardizing these domains leads to the calculation of the physical component summary and mental component summary measures. Scores on each item were summed and averaged (range 0 [worst] to 100 [best]); increase in score from baseline indicated improvement. Change from Baseline = difference between the score at Week 24 and the score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Categorical Change From Baseline in the Physical Component Scores of SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 determined participants' overall quality of life by assessing :1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual daily activities because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems since last month; 7) limitations in usual work (house hold and outside) due to emotional problems 8) current and 1 year past status of health 9) general mental health. Scores on physical component were summed and averaged (range 0 [worst] to 100 [best]); If participants' had shown change from baseline in physical health component score &gt;5.42, it was considered as improved; score between -5.42 to 5.42 was considered as unchanged, and score &lt; -5.42 was considered as worsened. Change from Baseline = difference between the score of physical component at Week 24 and the score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Genant-modified Sharp Joint Space Narrowing Score, Genant-modified Sharp Total Score, and Erosion Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to Weeks (W) 24, 56, and 104</time_frame>
    <description>The Genant-modified Sharp scoring system assesses structural damage due to rheumatoid arthritis in radiographs. A score for erosions of 0-3.5 (8 gradations) is assigned for 14 joints in each hand and wrist, and 6 joints in each foot. Joint space narrowing scores of 0-4 (9 gradations) are assigned to 13 joints in each hand and 6 joints in each foot. The maximum erosion score is 40 x 3.5 = 140. The maximum joint space narrowing score is 38 x 4.0 = 152. Both the erosion and joint space narrowing scores are normalized to 145 and are added together for a maximum total Genant-modified Sharp score of 290. For all the three radiograph assessment, the minimum score is 0. A higher score indicates more damage and a negative change score indicates improvement. The change in score is to be calculated as: Change from Baseline = difference between the score at Weeks 24, 56, or 104 and the score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints at Week 24</title>
        <description>The disease activity score (DAS28) is an evaluation index of rheumatoid arthritis. The DAS28 applies a mathematical formula based on the following parameters: 1. TJC-28 joints, 2. SJC -28 joints, 3. ESR or CRP measurement, 4. Participant’s judgement on his own overall health (global health [GH]) status expressed by a VAS (0 [no disease activity] to 100 [maximum disease activity]). The mathematical formula is 0.56 × √28TJC + 0.28 × √28SJC + 0.7 x loge ESR + 0.014 × GH. The DAS28 scale ranges from score of 0 to 10, where lower scores indicate best disease control and higher scores indicate worsening of disease. Change from Baseline = difference between the score at Week 24 and the score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With DAS28 Low Disease Activity and DAS28 Remission at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is an evaluation index of RA. The DAS28 applies a mathematical formula based on the following parameters: 1. TJC- 28 joints, 2. SJC- 28 joints, 3. ESR or CRP measurement, 4. Participant’s judgement on his own overall health status (GH) expressed by a visual analogue scale VAS (0 [no disease activity] to 100 [maximum disease activity]). The mathematical formula is 0.56 × √28TJC + 0.28 × √28SJC + 0.7 x loge ESR + 0.014 × GH. The DAS28 scale ranges from score of 0 to 10. A participant was categorized as having low disease activity, if participant’s DAS28 score was &lt;= 3.2, and was categorized as having clinical remission if participant’s DAS28 score was &lt; 2.6.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Good, Moderate, or no European League Against Rheumatism Responses at Week 24</title>
        <description>European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response is defined based on the DAS28 score and the EULAR response criteria (Van Gestel et al, 1996 and 1999). The DAS28 scale ranges from score of 0 to 10, where lower scores indicate best disease control and higher scores indicate worsening of disease. At a given visit, participants with a DAS28 score of &lt; 3.2 are considered good responders if the change from baseline in their DAS28 score is &gt;1.2. Participants with a DAS28 score &gt;= 3.2 to 5.1 are considered moderate responders if the change from baseline in their DAS28 score is &lt;=1.2 to &gt;=0.6. Participants with DAS28 score &gt;5.1 are considered non-responders if the change from baseline in their DAS28 score is &lt;=1.2 to &gt;=0.6.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline of Short Form 36 Total Scores at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Short Form (SF)-36 determined participants’ overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual daily activities because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems since last month; 7) limitations in usual work (house hold and outside) due to emotional problems 8) current and 1 year past status of health 9) general mental health. Transforming and standardizing these domains leads to the calculation of the physical component summary and mental component summary measures. Scores on each item were summed and averaged (range 0 [worst] to 100 [best]); increase in score from baseline indicated improvement. Change from Baseline = difference between the score at Week 24 and the score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Genant-modified Sharp Joint Space Narrowing Score, Genant-modified Sharp Total Score, and Erosion Score</title>
        <description>The Genant-modified Sharp scoring system assesses structural damage due to rheumatoid arthritis in radiographs. A score for erosions of 0-3.5 (8 gradations) is assigned for 14 joints in each hand and wrist, and 6 joints in each foot. Joint space narrowing scores of 0-4 (9 gradations) are assigned to 13 joints in each hand and 6 joints in each foot. The maximum erosion score is 40 x 3.5 = 140. The maximum joint space narrowing score is 38 x 4.0 = 152. Both the erosion and joint space narrowing scores are normalized to 145 and are added together for a maximum total Genant-modified Sharp score of 290. For all the three radiograph assessment, the minimum score is 0. A higher score indicates more damage and a negative change score indicates improvement. The change in score is to be calculated as: Change from Baseline = difference between the score at Weeks 24, 56, or 104 and the score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The Genant-modified Sharp scoring system assesses structural damage due to rheumatoid arthritis in radiographs. A score for erosions of 0-3.5 (8 gradations) is assigned for 14 joints in each hand and wrist, and 6 joints in each foot. The maximum erosion score is 40 x 3.5 = 140 which is normalized to 145. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 145. A higher score indicates more damage and negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
