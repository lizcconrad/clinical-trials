    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the immune response as well as the safety and
      tolerability of an H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population. Further, the
      study will assess the need for a booster vaccination and whether a 6-month booster or a
      12-month booster is more appropriate. An independent data safety monitoring board will review
      and evaluate the safety data obtained in this study on an ongoing basis.

             high dose inhaled (&gt;800µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent)
             corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs,

          -  Have a history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis,

             reaction rating,

          -  Have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 90 days of study entry,

          -  Have donated blood or plasma within 30 days of study entry,

          -  Have received any live vaccine within 4 weeks or inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks
             prior to vaccination in this study,

          -  Have a functional or surgical asplenia,

          -  Have a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse,

          -  Were administered an investigational drug within six weeks prior to study entry or are
             concurrently participating in a clinical study that includes the administration of an
             investigational product,

          -  Are a member of the team conducting this study or are in a dependent relationship with
             the study investigator. Dependent relationships include close relatives (i.e.,
