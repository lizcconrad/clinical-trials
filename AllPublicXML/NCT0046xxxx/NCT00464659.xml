  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the evolution of memory deficit (verbal
      episodic memory, procedural memory, working memory, short-term memory) in Sleep Apnea
      Obstructive Syndrome (SAOS) patients after treatment by Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      treatment (CPAP). For thus, we will compare memory tests in two separate groups of SAOS
      patients with &quot;effective &quot; versus &quot;ineffective&quot; ( or sham) CPAP, before and 6 weeks after the
      beginning of the treatment. Thus we will assess the evolution of memory deficit, the
      effectiveness of the treatment on the evolution of memory deficit before and 6 weeks after
      the beginning of the treatment by &quot;effective &quot; versus &quot;ineffective&quot; CPAP.

      We feel the results of the tests of memory will show greater memory disorders in patients
      with SAOS before beginning the treatment rather than six weeks afterwards. Thus we
      hypothesise that, after the treatment by &quot;effective&quot; CPAP, the patients with SAOS will have
      greater improvement of their memory disorders than those treated by &quot;sham CPAP&quot;.

      We want to assess the evolution, before and 6 weeks after the beginning of the treatment, of
      the significant differences of the performances of the various memory tests evaluating
      several forms of memory (episodic memory, working memory, short-term memory and procedural
      memory) according to the treatment for patients with SAOS (effective versus sham).
