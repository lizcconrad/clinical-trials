      High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation have an established role in
      the treatment of aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) when refractory to first line
      chemotherapy or after relapse. The PARMA study randomized 109 patients, with chemo-sensitive
      relapse and no marrow involvement to receive, following the initial salvage regimen,
      high-dose chemotherapy versus continuous standard dose chemotherapy. 5-year progression-free
      survival was 46% in the transplant group compared with 12% in the chemotherapy group. Results
      are significantly inferior in patients with multiply relapsed or chemo-refractory disease
      with only 0-20% of patients achieving long-term disease control with autologous
      transplantation. Thus a large proportion of patients with refractory and relapsing disease
      are not cured with currently available transplantation methods and newer approaches are
      required.

      Rituximab is the first monoclonal antibody approved for clinical use. It is an anti CD20
      antibody with high response rate in the treatment of follicular lymphoma and increases
      response rate in aggressive lymphoma when combined with chemotherapy. It is well tolerated
      with minimal side effects. However tumors may escape rituximab sensitivity by loss of
      antigen, poor access of antibody to bulky or poorly vascularized tumors, or failure of host
      effectors to eliminate antibody binding tumor cells. Lymphoma cells are inherently and
      exquisitely sensitive to radiation. Radioimmunotherapy uses monoclonal antibodies conjugated
      with a radioactive isotope to target radiation directly to tumor cells. Ibritumomab is the
      parent murine anti CD20 antibody witch targets the same epitope as rituximab. Tiuxetan is a
      chelator covalently linked to the antibody which chelates the isotope 90Yttrium to form the
      active radioconjugate Zevalin. 90Yttrium is a pure high-energy beta emitter with a relatively
      short half time (64 hours) and a path length of 5 mm. These properties make it an ideal
      isotope for radioimmmunotherapy. The high energy and long beta path are advantageous in
      treating bulky, poorly vascularized tumors, and tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression
      as neighboring tumor cells can be hit by cross fire from tumors binding the radioconjugate.
      Pure beta emission limits radiation to the patient body and is safe for the surrounding
      allowing simple outpatient care, no need for patient isolation or shielding. Biodistribution
      is predictable, eliminating the need for dosimetry. Initial studies showed that Zevalin has a
      favorable toxicity profile and is more effective than rituximab in patients with follicular
      and transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and studies are currently performed in aggressive
      lymphoma.

      There are initial phase I-II studies combining radioimmunotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy
      and autologous stem-cell transplantation with promising results. We conducted a phase II
      study of fixed-dose Zevalin at 0.4 mCi/kg with BEAM high-dose chemotherapy in patients with
      chemo-refractory disease. So far, 23 patients were included. With a median follow-up of 17
      months the estimated progression-free survival was 52% compared with 0-20% expected in
      patients with multiply relapsed and chemo-refractory disease. Based on these data and data
      from other groups we expect that the addition of Zevalin to standard high-dose chemotherapy
      will improve transplantation outcomes in patients with standard-risk chemosensitive disease,
      as well. This study will randomize patients to Zevalin-BEAM versus BEAM alone to determine
      the potential of Zevalin radioimmunotherapy to improve outcome of autologous stem-cell
      transplantation.
