  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of titration, analgesics, and 12
           month telephone follow-up period from the B.E.T.A nurse program upon adherence to
           treatment with Betaseron in patients with a first clinical demyelinating event
           suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and patients with onset of RRMS within the past 12
           months

        -  Secondary outcomes include analysis of the following parameters: progression of clinical
           severity by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS score), health related quality of
           life (HrQoL), and safety.

        -  Exploratory outcomes include changes over time in cytokine and neurotrophic factor
           production by immune cells and visual function as assessed by visual examination, OCT
           measurements and a neuro-ophthalmologic Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire
           (NEI-VFQ-25) with 10-item supplement.
