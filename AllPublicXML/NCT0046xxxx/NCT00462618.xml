      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess feasibility and patient accessibility in order
      to design an adequately powered study to compare group cognitive behavioral therapy for
      insomnia (CBT-I) to quetiapine in non-demented patients aged 60 years or older with
      controlled bipolar disorder (I or II) or major depressive disorder who suffer from residual
      insomnia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater or equal to 60 years.

          2. Patients with history of major affective disorder, including Bipolar disorder type I
             or type II or major depressive disorder, as assessed by the Structured Clinical
             Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), currently in remission.

          3. Difficulty starting or initiating sleep four or more times/week for at least 3 months
             by history.

          4. Total Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index &gt;5.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient in an acute mood episode as assessed by SCID

          2. Patients with sleep disruptive medical problems including: sleep apnea, restless leg
             syndrome, periodic limb movement, parasomnia, congestive heart failure, chronic pain
             and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as assessed by medical history and medical
             record review.

          3. Patients with schizophrenia, primary anxiety disorder and active substance abuse as
             determined by SCID.

          4. Patients on or with history of failure or intolerance to respond to quetiapine.

          5. Patient with positive Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) with a total
             score above 8.

          6. Patients with dementia brain degenerative diseases, cognitive disorders and Mini
             Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score of less or equal to 24.

          7. Patients who are in an acute depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed state as reflected
             by SCID

          8. Patients on concurrent sedating medications that would confound interpretation of the
             results. This is operationalized as follow: Sedating medications must be present and
             stable dosage for at least 14 days prior to enrollment in the study. If the medication
             is not prescribed as a primary sleep aid, it will be continued. Our rationale is that
             patients may need these medications and the initial sedating effect will have
             plateaued by 14 days. However, medications prescribed to assist insomnia will be
             discontinued as they are not effective for the subjects who otherwise meet inclusion
             ad exclusion criteria for the current study. Medications will be tapered as clinically
             indicated after the patients sing informed consent and prior to baseline assessment.
