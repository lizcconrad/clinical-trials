  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM),
      with atherosclerosis accounting for approximately 80% of the cases. Although the cause for
      the increased cardiovascular risk is multi-factorial, there is compelling evidence obtained
      from experimental models of DM suggesting that excessive myocardial lipid uptake may be
      contributory. This ectopic deposition of lipid, often stored as triacylglycerol (TAG) may
      directly cause myocardial damage and decreased function through a variety of mechanisms.
      However, accurate translation of these findings to humans with DM, requires an noninvasive
      imaging method that provides both accurate and reproducible measurements of myocardial tissue
      TAG. Currently, no such imaging method exists.

      Because routine biopsy of the myocardium is not feasible, MRS is the most promising technique
      for the quantification of myocardial TAG. MRS is routinely used to precisely characterize
      metabolite concentrations in muscle and liver. 14-16 Studies such as monitoring the levels of
      deoxymyoglobin and real-time tracking of the postprandial accumulation of cellular lipids are
      examples of its diversity and potential.15,17,18 Generally, these studies suggest that the
      reproducibility of MRS is between 2 and 6%.18,19 In vivo cardiac MRS provides unique
      challenges because of the requirement to compensate for concurrent heart and lung motion.
      Using cardiac and respiratory gating to minimize motional artifacts, an initial validation
      study found a variation of 17% for sequential measurements, attributing the major error to
      residual motional effects. 20 Moreover, measurements were limited to the interventricular
      septum. Using navigator and cardiac gating appeared to give a slight, 4%, improvement, but
      this was a preliminary study and no validation was done.21 For a comprehensive clinical
      validation, other reproducibility factors must be addressed. Variations due to
      post-processing, coil placement and calibration, trigger reproducibility, internal versus
      external standard, shimming, and protocol sequence variables such as pulse quality, gradient
      strength, voxel size, relaxation time, echo time, and the number of scan repetitions are all
      known sources of reproducibility. 17,19,22-24 All of these variables must be characterized in
      order to achieve optimal inter- scanner and subject reproducibility along with accurate
      treatment tracking capability.
