  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate whether the addition of continuous
      glucose monitoring to point-of-care (POC) glucometer monitoring improves glucose control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe burns and traumatic injury can be associated with protracted illness and prolonged ICU
      course. The beneficial effects of strict serum glucose control in critically ill surgical
      patients have been demonstrated. Continuous glucose monitors may improve glucose control by
      providing close to real-time glucose measurements, giving the critical care team the ability
      to react to trends before hypo- or hyperglycemia is reached. These improvements may decrease
      the morbidity and mortality associated with severe thermal injury, thereby minimizing
      hospital stay and recovery. Burned and injured soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines may
      return to duty in a more expeditious fashion, or at minimum, enjoy a better quality of life
      after discharge from the intensive care unit.
