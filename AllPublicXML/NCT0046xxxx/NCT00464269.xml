    <measure>Partial Onset Seizure (Type I) Frequency Per Week Over the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12-week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>Partial (Type I) seizures can be classified into one of the following three groups:
Simple partial seizures
Complex partial seizures
Partial seizures evolving to generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.
Partial Onset Seizure (POS) Frequency per week over the Treatment Period (TP) was calculated as:
(Total Type I seizures over the TP)*7/(Total number of days with no missing seizure count in the TP)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate for Partial Onset Seizure (Type I) Frequency Per Week Over the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12-week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The responder rate was presented as the number of responders and non-responders. A subject is a responder, if the subject has at least 50 % reduction in partial onset seizure frequency per week from Baseline to Treatment Period. Subjects with zero seizure frequency per week at Baseline were considered as non-responders.</description>

    <measure>All Seizure Frequency (Type I+II+III) Per Week Over the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12-week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>There are three different types of seizures:
Type I: Partial seizures
Type II: Generalized seizures
Type III: Unclassified epileptic seizures.
All seizure frequency per week over Treatment Period (TP) was calculated as: (Total number of seizures over the TP)*7/(Total number of days with no missing seizure count in the TP)</description>

          <description>Patient's Global Evaluation Scale (P-GES) is a global assessment of the disease evolution which was performed using a seven-point scale (1= Marked worsening to 7 = Marked improvement) with the start of the study medication as the reference time point. The subject completed it by answering to the following: 'Overall, has there been a change in your seizures since the start of the study medication?'</description>
          <population>The modified Intent-To-Treat population consists of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication but excluding 3 randomized subjects from a site with significant GCP deviations and 1 subject who had an exceedingly high seizure frequency and a clinical presentation that may not have been consistent with a diagnosis of focal epilepsy.</population>

        <description>The QOLIE-31-P is an adaptation of the original QOLIE-31 instrument that includes 30 items grouped into seven multi-item subscales - Seizure Worry (5 items), Overall Quality of Life (2 items), Emotional Well-Being (5 items), Energy/Fatigue (4 items), Cognitive Functioning (6 items), Medication Effects (3 items) and Daily Activities/Social Functioning (5 items) - and a Health Status item. The subscale scores, the Total score and the Health Status item score are calculated according to the scoring algorithm defined by the author with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better function. A positive value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

          <description>The QOLIE-31-P is an adaptation of the original QOLIE-31 instrument that includes 30 items grouped into seven multi-item subscales - Seizure Worry (5 items), Overall Quality of Life (2 items), Emotional Well-Being (5 items), Energy/Fatigue (4 items), Cognitive Functioning (6 items), Medication Effects (3 items) and Daily Activities/Social Functioning (5 items) - and a Health Status item. The subscale scores, the Total score and the Health Status item score are calculated according to the scoring algorithm defined by the author with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better function. A positive value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>
