               2. Ph+ ALL

          2. The subject has one of the following:

               -  Known T315I Abl mutation

               -  Known resistance to or intolerance of imatinib and dasatinib

               -  At least one prior anti-leukemia therapy, including, but not limited to,
                  interferon, imatinib, or dasatinib

          3. The subject is at least 18 years old.

          4. The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2.

          5. The subject has adequate organ function.

          6. The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed
             the informed consent document.

          7. Sexually active subjects must use an accepted method of contraception during the
             course of the study.

             enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has received interferon, imatinib, or dasatinib within 7 days of the first
             dose of XL228.

          2. The subject has received an investigational agent or radiotherapy within 28 days of
             the first dose of XL228.

          3. The subject has received immunosuppressive therapy (eg, cyclosporine, steroids,
             tacrolimus for graft-versus-host disease [GVHD]) within 28 days prior to the first
             dose of XL228.

          4. The subject has not recovered to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 Grade ≤1 from toxicities related to
             peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant.

          5. The subject has not recovered to CTCAE v3.0 Grade ≤1 from adverse events (AEs) due to
             investigational drugs or other medications.

          6. The subject has known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the
             investigational drug product.

             ongoing or active infection, diabetes, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          8. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          9. The subject is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         10. The subject has an inability or unwillingness to abide by the study protocol or
