  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown through research that alveolar ridges (Part of jaw bone holding teeth) tend
      to lose width and height after extraction of teeth. Lost in height and width of the ridge can
      cause problems in the restoration of missing teeth with bridges and implants. Hence, this
      study is proposed to assess the use of polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for alveolar ridge
      preservation following extraction of teeth in humans.

      20 patients will be divided into 2 groups. In one group, patients will have a PCL scaffold
      placed into the socket after extraction. In other group, no scaffold will be placed. After a
      healing period of 6 months, changes in width and height from baseline is measured for both
      groups. A bone biopsy is also taken at this time from both groups. Hardness of bone,
      histologic (microscopic) features of cells, percentage of living bone, radiographic density
      of alveolar ridge and mechanical properties of the bone biopsy are then assessed.

      This study will attempt to show that a resorbable (can be removed by body) material like a
      PCL scaffold can be used to maintain physical dimensions of the alveolar ridge after
      extraction and will not interfere with osseointegration (fusion with bone). It will avoid the
      necessity for additional corrective surgeries for patients when alveolar ridges presented
      with inadequate width and height for placement of aesthetically pleasing and functionally
      sound restorations. This would improve chances of success for the patient.

      If the study successfully shows that the PCL scaffold can be accepted by the body with good
      bone growth, uses for the PCL scaffold can be extended to other areas of clinical medicine
      and dentistry.

      The PCL scaffold to be used in this study is designed and developed by a local company
      (Osteopore International Pte Ltd). With the success of this product, Singapore's standing as
      a biomedical hub will be further enhanced.
