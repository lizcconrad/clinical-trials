      coagulate tissue in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to reduce lower urinary
      tract symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Enlarged prostate or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common diseases of
      aging men and can be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as having to
      urinate very often, a sudden strong feeling of having to urinate, having to get up at night
      to urinate, decreased and intermittent force of stream and the feeling of incomplete bladder
      emptying. These symptoms affect quality of life by interfering with normal daily activities
      and sleep patterns. When surgery is the best treatment option for the patient, the most
      common technique is a &quot;transurethral resection of the prostate&quot; (TURP). TURP involves
      removing the some of the extra tissue of the prostate gland. Even though TURP is a good
      treatment, there are concerns about the frequency of complications following treatment as
      well as the significant costs to patients, doctors, and insurance providers.

      Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) is a relatively new technology that has
      similar benefits with fewer side effects than TURP. PVP is a minimally invasive procedure
      that uses a special high-energy laser to eliminate excess prostate tissue and seal the
      treated area. This technology has been used for more than a decade with over 200,000
      procedures performed worldwide.

      The focus of this study is to 1) document the long-term advantages of GreenLight HPS 120w and
      2) to show that the stronger laser is a more flexible and efficient device which allows for a
      shorter procedure time, may be done in an out-patient setting in healthy patients, allows for
      shorter catheterization time, may result in a rapid urinary flow rate with minimal side
      effects, and may allow a quick return to normal activities. This device has been approved by
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of obstructive BPH.
