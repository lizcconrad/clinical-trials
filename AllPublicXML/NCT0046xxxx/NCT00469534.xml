      A Pilot Study Evaluating Minimized Time to Beam Hypofractionated IMRT with PET Assisted
      Target Definition in Patients with High Grade Gliomas

      The aim of this pilot project is to explore the feasibility of combining a simple conformal
      plan (Phase I) with an IMRT treatment approach (Phase II) for high grade glioma patients with
      the aim of starting the RT as soon as possible following the patient's first outpatient visit
      (thus, minimized 'time to beam'). It is hoped that the rapid treatment start with the initial
      3D CRT plan will lessen clinical deterioration due to the growth of these aggressive tumours.
      The use of Linac-based IMRT in Phase II of the patient's treatment plan will maintain the
      benefit of the sophistication of IMRT.

      Using novel PET imaging we also hope to better characterize regions of glioma cells thus
      producing more optimized planning target volumes (PTVs) for each patient and decreasing the
      volume of normal brain irradiated with the aim of minimizing radiation toxicities. Hopefully
      this planning and treatment approach will provide an improvement in the quality of life and
      outcome for high grade glioma patients.

      A Pilot Study Evaluating Minimized Time to Beam Hypofractionated IMRT with PET Assisted
      Target Definition in Patients with High Grade Gliomas

      BACKGROUND INFORMATION Standard Treatment High grade gliomas (HGG) comprise the vast majority
      of primary brain tumors. With conventional treatment, tumor recurrence and subsequent patient
      death is expected in all but a small minority of patients. Conventional treatment consists of
      maximal surgical debulking followed by radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ)
      chemotherapy. Typically the radiation therapy is given in 2 Gy fractions to a total dose of
      60 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV).

      What is the Optimal PTV? Currently it is not know what target volume constitutes the optimal
      PTV for an individual patient with a HGG. With conventional MRI-based target definition, a
      common practice is to draw a gross tumour volume (GTV) to include the contrast enhancing
      lesion seen on T1C images. An additional uniform margin of approximately 1.5 cm is added to
      address clinically occult glioma cells and create the clinical target volume (CTV), plus an
      additional 0.5 cm to create the final PTV. This practice is based on pattern of recurrence
      studies. In these studies, 80-90% of the HGGs tended to recur within 2 cm of the original T1C
      enhancing lesion. The addition of a uniform 2 cm margin to the initial GTV dramatically
      increases the volume of apparently normal brain irradiated, and the volume of brain
      irradiated is a principal determinant of subsequent radiation toxicity. By using positron
      emission tomography (PET) imaging to better characterize which regions harbour glioma cells,
      we hope to be able to minimize the size of the uniform margins applied to the GTV, and thus
      produce a more optimized PTV for each patient.

      PET Imaging For this pilot study we will be using novel PET agents including F19AZA and C11
      Methionine to assist in the construction of a more patient optimized PTV. The volumes
      constructed based on MRI reflect the underlying anatomy or structure of the tumor. On the
      other hand the volumes constructed base on PET imaging reflect the underlying physiology and
      thus will be referred to as the biological target volume (BTV) to distinguish it from the MRI
      base GTV. The clinician will then use the complementary information provided by the GTV and
      BTV to construct a composite CTV, and this will be grown with a uniform 0.5 cm margin into
      the PTV. The PET imaging will be carried out under a separate research protocol submitted by
      nuclear medicine, and the patient will need to sign an informed consent for each agent used.
      At the investigators discretion, the patient will be given the choice to undergo imaging
      using the full complement of PET agents or a selected subset of these agents.

      IMRT 3D conformal RT (3D CRT) is the standard treatment technique used to treat HGGs at many
      centres. With the advancement of IMRT techniques, clinicians are able to deliver more
      sophisticated RT plans. With these more sophisticated approaches clinicians should be able
      limit the volume of apparently uninvolved brain encompassed in the high dose treatment
      volume. In our recent protocol we gained experience using helical tomotherapy-base IMRT. In
      the current protocol, we plan to use Linac-based IMRT. One of the advantages of Linac-based
      IMRT over helical tomotherapy is that the plan may include non-coplanar beams. This
      additional degree of freedom is expected to result in better plan conformation. Also,
      Linac-based IMRT plans can be added to the conformal plan of phase I and thereby adjusted
      accordingly.

      Overcoming Radio-Resistant Tumor Clonogens In this protocol we plan to use hypofractionated
      RT (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks). Hypofractionation has the advantage of shortening
      the overall treatment time (which minimizes the opportunity for tumor repopulation during the
      treatment course). The larger dose per fraction is also expected to be more biologically
      effective against radio-resistant tumor clonogens. An identical fractionation scheme was
      reported to be safe in a recent study of patients with HGG (IJROBP 58 1 247-252 2004
      Sultanem) and a similar fractions scheme was used in our recent glioma protocol 60 Gy in 22
      fractions over 4.5 weeks). As of yet, we have not observed any obvious increased toxicity in
      these patients (Personal Observation).

      Minimizing Time to Beam HGGs are locally aggressive and rapidly growing tumors. The typical
      presenting symptoms are usually related to the mass effect of the tumor on the adjacent and
      distant nerve cells. Once the intracranial pressure (ICP) has begun to rise, any subsequent
      growth of the tumor within the confined space of the skull results in a dramatic increase in
      ICP and subsequent neuron damage (usually permanent). Hence it is imperative that the
      initiation of therapy not be delayed. Unfortunately the design of sophisticated IMRT plans
      base on advanced imaging technology is a complex and potentially time consuming process. When
      treatment is delayed as a consequence of this process, the patient frequent deteriorates
      clinically possibly resulting in a permanent decline in quality of life, a decision to
      discontinue RT or even death. In this protocol we plan to explore the feasibility of a
      combined approach using 3D CRT and IMRT. The first half of the treatment (2 weeks) will be
      given using a simple 3D CRT approach based on the patient's preoperative MRI images. This
      will have the advantage of facilitating a rapid start of RT and hopefully arrest any evolving
      clinical deterioration which may have occurred (minimizing the time to beam). The goal will
      be to start the RT as soon as possible from the first OPD visit. The planning, evaluation and
      QA of the IMRT plan will progress while the patient is undergoing phase I of the treatment.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary End Point:

      1. Time from initial OPD visit to start of RT compared with historical controls receiving
      helical tomotherapy base IMRT (Time to Beam)

      Secondary End Points:

        1. Overall Survival

        2. Disease-free survival

        3. Patterns of recurrence

        4. Toxicity

        5. Quality of life

        6. Number of patients who complete treatment

      STUDY DESIGN

      Schema Radiation Therapy Phase I 30 Gy in 10 fractions to PTV1 Using 3D CRT

      GTV1 = Intra and peri-tumoural edema seen on preoperative MRI CTV1 = GTV1 + 1.5 cm margin
      PTV1 = CTV1 + 0.5 cm margin

      Note: The 1.5 cm margin added to create the CTV1 may be reduced at the discretion of the
      clinician in areas of anatomical barriers to glioma spread (i.e. skull, tentorium, etc.)

      Phase II 30 Gy in 10 fractions to &gt; 90% of the PTV2

      GTV2 = Contrast enhancing lesion BTV = Extent of tumor seen on PET imaging CTV2 = (Union of
      GTV2 and BTV) + &gt;0.5 cm margin PTV2 = CTV2 + 0.5 cm margin

      Note: The margin added to the CTV2 may be enlarged at the discretion of the clinician to a
      maximum of 1.5 cm. The dose received by the PTV2 regions which encroach within 3 mm, or
      overlap, a dose limiting critical structure should be restricted to the dose constraints
      allowed for that particular critical structure. Exceptions may be made at the clinician's
      discretion when the dose limiting critical structure is grossly involved by tumor.

      Chemotherapy Patients will also be offered standard TMZ chemotherapy, but patients who refuse
      TMZ or are unable to tolerate/receive it, may still enroll in the study.

      PET Imaging Studies will be done at baseline and post RT (0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 months).

      RECRUITMENT Number of patients 25 (High Grade Glioma)

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS This is a pilot study comprising a total of 25 high grade glioma
      patients.

      STOPPING RULES Both acute and late toxicities will be of interest in this study as well as
      disease-free survival, patterns of recurrence and quality of life assessments. Patients will
      be closely followed by their treating Radiation Oncologist and / or the Research Nurse and
      any sever adverse events will be reported to the Principal Investigator and the Research
      Ethics Board as per the set REB guidelines.

      DATA SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE Any serious adverse event that occurs from the time the
      consented patient has begun study treatment until 30 days after the end of study treatment
      must be reported to the participating institution's Research Ethics Board within their REB
      set reporting guidelines. Any SAE that occurs after the one month post study treatment
      timeframe that is felt to be related to the study treatment must be reported to the
      participating institution's Research Ethics Board within the REB set reporting guidelines. If
      a death is related to study treatment, the REB should receive notification within 24 hours of
      the event, with a full report to follow. All deaths that occur during a study or within 30
      days after last study treatment, regardless of the relationship to the treatment, need to be
      reported to the REB. A research nurse and / or a radiation oncologist will be responsible for
      regular monitoring of patients on study treatment. If the number of events meets the stopping
      criteria listed in point 12.0, accrual will be halted and the Principal Investigator will
      inform the Research Ethics Board in a timely manner.
