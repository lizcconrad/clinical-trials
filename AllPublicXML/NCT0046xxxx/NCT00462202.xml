  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of KRX-101 in treating
      persistent microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients who are also being treated with
      stable, maximum tolerated doses of either ACE inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is one of the most common causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the U.S. and
      in many other developed nations. Despite advances in clinical care, including improvements in
      glycemic and blood pressure control, the number of new cases of diabetes-related ESRD
      continues to rise, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The current standard of care for the prevention and treatment of diabetic renal disease
      includes screening all diabetic patients for microalbuminuria. Patients who test positive for
      microalbuminuria are then treated with either ACE inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers. Both of
      these classes of medication have been shown to reduce levels of microalbuminuria in some
      patient populations. This improvement in microalbuminuria has also shown a delay of
      progression to a number of other renal function problems, as well as a minimal delay in
      certain clinical events including ESRD.

      Unfortunately, some patients achieve the majority of their therapeutic effect of ACE
      inhibitors or A2 receptor blockers within the first 6 months of therapy, and many of these
      patients continue to show persistent microalbuminuria. Therefore, these patients are at an
      increased risk of progressing to ESRD due to the lack of adequate benefit from their current
      medication.

      Microalbuminuria has a straight-line relationship with adverse renal outcomes; therefore any
      level of reduction may have clinical benefit. It is reasonable to believe that patients who
      can reduce or have a complete remission of their microalbuminuria may also lessen the risk of
      progressing to ESRD. Thus, if KRX-101 is able to cause a reduction or complete remission of
      microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria, patients may receive a significant clinical benefit.
