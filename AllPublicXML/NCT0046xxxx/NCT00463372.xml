      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of PF-02545920 subjects with
      schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder who are currently clinically stable and to
      evaluate the serum and urine pharmacokinetics of PF-02545920 and the N-desmethyl metabolite,
      PF-01001252, after multiple doses of PF-02545920 administered orally.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder for whom
             antipsychotic monotherapy is indicated.

          -  Subjects must be free from an acute exacerbation of psychosis for at least 3 months
             prior to screening.

          -  Current Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of Severity of Illness score ≤3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, or allergic
             disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal
             allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Evidence or history of a primary DSM-IV axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia or
             schizoaffective disorder.

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy).
