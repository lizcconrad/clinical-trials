  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Picoplatin is a new platinum-based chemotherapy drug that has been studied in a variety of
      cancers. Phase 1 and 2 studies have demonstrated that picoplatin may be effective in patients
      whose cancer returns or does not improve after treatment with chemotherapy. In these studies,
      picoplatin was administered intravenously. A capsule containing picoplatin has been
      formulated. This study will investigate the activity of the oral capsule in humans.
      Participants with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary study design is a randomized, two-period crossover, open label study in which a
      single dose (Cycle 1) of picoplatin will be given either IV or by oral capsule, followed 4
      weeks later by a single dose (Cycle 2) of picoplatin given either IV or by oral capsule
      (whichever route was not used in Cycle 1). Participants may continue to receive cycles of IV
      picoplatin every 3 weeks, beginning with Cycle 3, as part of a Continuation Study.

      This study will determine the relative safety, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and urinary excretion of picoplatin administered orally with reference to
      picoplatin administered intravenously.
