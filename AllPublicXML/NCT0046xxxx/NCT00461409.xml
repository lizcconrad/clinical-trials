  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the correct dosing for intravenous levetiracetam in
      term new born babies with seizures. In addition information on safety and efficacy will be
      collected. This new anticonvulsant drug is a promising treatment for seizures in newborns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need to improve the treatment of seizures in the neonatal period. The
      anticonvulsant agents currently in use may damage the developing brain and are quite
      ineffective at controlling seizures in neonates. Newborn seizures are common (1 in 300
      newborns) and are associated with very poor outcomes. 20-30% of infants with neonatal
      seizures die, 20-30% develop epilepsy outside the neonatal period and 20-40% develop cerebral
      palsy and/or mental retardation. Better treatments for neonatal seizures could improve these
      outcomes.

      An intravenous form of the anti-seizure medication levetiracetam has been released for use in
      adults with epilepsy. Experience with oral levetiracetam has shown it to be a very safe
      medication, with good efficacy in stopping seizures in other age groups. The intravenous
      preparation could allow its use in neonates with seizures. Drug handling by the body is very
      different in neonates to adults. Before we can use levetiracetam in this age group we need to
      determine the correct dose and frequency by studying its absorption and distribution in the
      body (pharmacokinetic profile).

      This study is an add-on open label pharmacokinetic and preliminary safety study. Twenty-four
      patients with neonatal seizures, who still experience clinical or electroencephalographic
      seizures after treatment with Phenobarbital will be treated with intravenous levetiracetam,
      and serial determinations of serum levetiracetam levels will be made to allow calculation of
      pharmacokinetic parameters. We will also collect preliminary safety data. We will
      specifically monitor for abnormalities of heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure,
      unexpected death, the occurrence of hypotonia, sedation, poor feeding, irritability or
      infection. Blood tests monitoring blood, liver and kidney function will be checked at
      baseline, 48 hours and at completion of 7 days of treatment. We will also collect preliminary
      descriptive data on the efficacy of levetiracetam in stopping neonatal seizures.
