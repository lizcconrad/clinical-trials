      versus the current formulation of MOA-728 focusing on the theoretical potential for
      infusion-related and formulation-related complications.

        -  A signed and dated informed consent form.

          -  Men or nonlactating and nonpregnant women, aged 18 to 80 years, inclusive.

          -  Women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP) must be surgically sterile (hysterectomy,
             oophorectomy, and/or tubal ligation) or postmenopausal for ³1 year.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an acceptable nonhormonal method
             of contraception (intrauterine device [IUD], diaphragm, or condom with spermicidal
             jelly or foam, abstinence) for a period of at least 1 month before and after dose
             administration.

          -  All women must have a negative pregnancy test result within 48 hours before the start
             of the first test article administration.

          -  Body mass index in the range of 18 to 32 kg/m² and body weight ≥50 kg.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history, physical
             examination, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  Subjects aged 65 to 80 years should be healthy, but may be enrolled with a chronic
             illness, if such illness is well controlled and does not interfere with the primary
             objective of the study. Certain concomitant medications will be allowed for the
             treatment of these conditions and are listed in the Concomitant Treatment section.

          -  Nonsmoker or smoker of fewer than 10 cigarettes per day as determined by history. Must
             be able to abstain from smoking from 48 hours before and throughout the inpatient

          -  Have a high probability for compliance with and completion the study.
