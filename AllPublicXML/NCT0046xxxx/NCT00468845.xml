             incision with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The total hysterectomy may,
             however, be cervix-sparing.

          -  The subject is expected to remain at the hospital (or intermediate care facility) for
             a minimum of 2 days following surgery.

          -  The subject's preoperative health is graded as the American Society of
             Anesthesiologist P1 to P2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects having vaginal hysterectomy (whether laparoscopically assisted or not)

          -  Subjects having additional procedures (such as those involving the bladder) at the
             same time as the total abdominal hysterectomy

          -  The use of nerve block, spinal anesthesia or epidural anesthesia for post-surgical
             pain control

          -  Subjects who have been using any opioid medications 2 weeks or more continuously
             within 3 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  The subject has taken any NSAID or any analgesic other than acetaminophen within 3
             days prior to surgery or is unwilling to abstain from NSAIDs or other analgesics,
             except as specified in the protocol, during the study. (Subjects taking &lt;325 mg per
             day of aspirin at a stable dose for at least 30 days before the first dose of study
             medication will be allowed to continue their aspirin regimen for the duration of the
             study).

        <description>Current pain with movement caused by peak expiratory flow (PEF) test as reported by participant on 11 point Likert scale 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Assessment performed 3 times each day of hospital stay, with 1 daily assessment at 24 (+/- 2) hour interval from end of surgery. PEF test performed 3 times, with 120sec rest periods in between. At beginning of each rest period, participant asked to rate pain caused by forced expiration. LS Means adjusted for treatment, pooled center and salpingo-oophorectomy strata.</description>

          <description>Pain reported by participants at rest (numeric rating scale (NRS) – Current Pain) on an 11 point Likert scale 0 (no pain) - 10 (worst pain). Pain at rest during the hospital stay was assessed just before each Pain with Movement assessment. Assessment performed 3 times each day of hospital stay, with 1 of daily assessments at 24 (+/- 2 ) hour intervals from end of surgery. LS Means adjusted for treatment, pooled center and salpingo-oophorectomy strata.</description>

        <description>Participant rated questionnaire assessed current health for 6 domains: mobility/self-care/ usual activities/pain/discomfort/anxiety and depression. Scoring developed by EuroQol Group assigned a utility value for each domain in the profile. Scores ranged from 1 better health (no problems) to 3 worst health (eg, &quot;confined to bed&quot;). Score transformed and resulted in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score=better health state. Health profile scores estimated using Dolan computational algorithms 1997 and 2001.
