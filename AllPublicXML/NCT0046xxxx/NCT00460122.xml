    <textblock>
      This study will determine if transfusion of platelets containing HLA antibodies (certain
      antibodies to white blood cells) are more likely to cause transfusion reactions than
      transfusion of platelets that do not contain HLA antibodies.

      People 18 years of age or older who donate platelets at the NIH Clinical Center may be
      eligible for this study.

      An extra tube of blood (about one teaspoon) is obtained from participating donors at the time
      of their donation at the NIH Platelet Center. The blood plasma in the extra tube is tested
      for HLA antibodies and antibodies to certain white blood cells called granulocytes. The
      research sample is assigned a code number for identification and sent to the HLA Laboratory
      in the Department of Transfusion Medicine.

    <textblock>
      Leukocyte antibodies can cause febrile transfusion reactions, pulmonary reactions to
      granulocyte transfusions, and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). Despite the fact
      that the role of leukocyte antibodies in these reactions was first described almost 50 years
      ago, and that TRALI is now the leading cause of transfusion related fatalities, much remains
      uncertain concerning the role of HLA antibodies in these reactions. The primary purpose of
      this study is to retrospectively and prospectively determine if the incidence and nature of
      transfusion reactions differs in Clinical Center (CC) patients that were transfused with
      platelet components from donors with HLA antibodies and those without HLA antibodies. In
      addition, this study will prospectively determine the incidence of HLA antibodies in the NIH
      Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) platelet donor population. In this natural history
      study a 10-mL blood sample will be drawn from 600 platelet donors at the time that they are
      in the DTM donating platelets and it will be tested for HLA antibodies in the DTM. The blood
      sample for HLA antibody testing will be collected with other samples collected as part of the
      regular platelet donation process. Reactions in platelet transfusion recipients will be
      assessed by reviewing CC and DTM patient records.
