    <textblock>
      Berberine has showed effective in lowering blood sugar levels in db/db mice and
      anti-dyslipidemia in human. These findings have not been tested in a clinical trial. This
      randomized, double blind, placebo controlled and multi-center study has demonstrated that
      berberine is effective in lowering plasma glucose concentrations, reducing serum HbA1c and
      anti-dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia.

      Berberine, a natural plant alkaloid, has not been well investigated for clinical application
      in the treatment of diabetes. The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of
      berberine in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia. 116 patients with
      type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia were assigned in a randomized, double-blind, and
      placebo-controlled 4-clinical center study to receive berberine (1.0g daily) or placebo for 3
      months. The primary efficacy outcomes were changes in plasma glucose and serum lipid levels.
      The glucose disposal rate (GDR) was measured using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp to
      assess insulin resistance in a randomly selected subjects of 54 patients. The baseline
      characteristics were similar in berberine and placebo groups. After 3 months, fasting and
      post load plasma glucose levels, HbA1C, triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels were
      all significantly reduced in the berberine group compared with the placebo group (p&lt;0.0001,
      p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.0001, p=0.002, p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0001 respectively). The GDR was significantly
      increased after 3 months of berberine (p=0.037), while no change was found in the placebo
      group (p=0.86). BMI, systolic blood pressure and serum IL-6 levels were all significantly
      reduced after treatment in berberine group as compared with the placebo group (p=0.016,
      p=0.041 and p=0.014, respectively). Our results show berberine to be effective and safe in
      the treatment of persons with diabetes and dislipidemia. This agent may be useful in the
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, and could play a role in treatment of metabolic
      syndrome.
