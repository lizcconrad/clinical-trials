    <textblock>
      The study will compare patient's experience between those taking a standard bowel cleansing
      regimen with minimal laxative tagging regimen of senna and gastrofin. Additionally comparing
      any possible reduction in diagnostic accuracy that may ensue from an increased quantity of
      retained faecal residue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cleansing with high dose laxative is the standard bowel preparation prior to whole
      colon investigations but such regimens are associated with considerable patient discomfort
      and inconvenience, potentially affecting compliance rates [1-3].

      Unlike existing whole colon investigations (conventional colonoscopy and barium enema),
      reduced laxative regimens can be successfully used with VC, with the aim of improving patient
      experience, whilst maintaining diagnostic accuracy. These regimens utilize faecal tagging; a
      method of labeling residual faeces and fluid with radiodense liquids, such as iodine or
      barium based fluids, which are taken orally by the patient. Once faecal residue and fluid is
      labeled in this way, it can easily be discriminated from true pathology (which remains
      'untagged').

      We are proposing to compare different bowel preparation regimens, and ascertain patient
      experience of the different regimes, while monitoring diagnostic accuracy of the 2 different
      regiments.
