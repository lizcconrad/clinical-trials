    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether five drugs (pravastatin, Losartan, Zileuton, N-acetylcysteine
      and erythromycin) used together can slow the course of pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the
      lung tissue) in patients with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS). Patients with this disease
      have decreased skin color (albinism), bleeding problems, and sometimes colon problems. Two of
      the known types of Hermansky Pudlak syndrome, type 1 and type 4, are at high risk of
      pulmonary fibrosis between the ages of 30 and 50.

      Patients 18 to 70 years of age who have Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome with a serious loss of lung
      function due to pulmonary fibrosis may be eligible for this study.

      Participants begin taking pravastatin on study day 2 and start a new drug every 3 days.
      Patients who experience no problems with the medicines return home and continue on the drugs
      for the next 2 years. They return to the NIH Clinical Center every 3 months for a medical
      history, physical examination, and blood, urine and lung function tests. CT and bone density
      scans are done every year. The study may continue for up to 3 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease consisting of
      oculocutaneous albinism and a platelet storage pool defect. The most serious complication of
      this disorder, pulmonary fibrosis, occurs only in genetic subtypes HPS-1 and HPS-4 and is
      generally fatal in the fourth or fifth decade. HPS-1 is very common in northwest Puerto Rico.
      There is no effective treatment for the pulmonary disease of HPS (HPS-PF), which resembles
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A preliminary study of the antifibrotic drug,
      pirfenidone, gave promising results for mild to moderate HPS-PF, but not for severe pulmonary
      fibrosis. A second study is currently addressing only mild to moderate HPS-PF. Other drugs,
      studied in IPF as single agents, have some efficacy for mild to moderate disease, but none
      has had a major effect on mortality. Recently, a call has been made for consideration of
      multi-drug therapy (i.e., an oncologic approach) for severe pulmonary fibrosis. Based upon
      positive responses from companies producing relevant drugs, we propose a multi-drug trial
      using five agents: Losartan, Zileuton, a generic statin (Pravastatin), generic
      N-acetylcysteine, and generic Erythromycin. Participants with severe pulmonary fibrosis will
      be drawn largely from the Puerto Rican population. Eligibility will require a molecular
      diagnosis of HPS-1 or HPS-4, radiographic evidence of interstitial lung disease, persistent
      pulmonary function testing less than or equal to 45% of predicted after bronchodilation, and
      absence of other causes of lung dysfunction. Participants will be admitted to the NIH
      Clinical Center for a 21-day admission to establish baseline function and to begin medication
      therapy. Follow-up admissions (3 days) will occur every 3 months. The primary outcome
      parameter will be survival at 2 years.
