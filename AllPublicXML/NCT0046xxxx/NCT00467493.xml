  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors have been approved for use in postmenopausal women to treat and prevent
      breast cancer. They act by blocking the action of the enzyme, aromatase, that is necessary
      for the production of estradiol. This class of drugs, aromatase inhibitors, are very
      effective in reducing estradiol levels in postmenopausal women and in treating estrogen
      receptor positive breast cancers. This study is examining the effect of a specific inhibitor,
      anastrozole, on endometrial thickness in premenopausal women. The endometrium is sensitive to
      estradiol and also has local aromatase which, if inhibited, may result in reduced endometrial
      thickness. The main hypothesis is that anastrozole can be administered at any time during the
      menstrual cycle and reduce endometrial thickness compared to placebo.
