    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of nursing care in relation to
      usual medical care in adult patients who demand to be visited the same day in Primary Care
      Teams in Catalonia, as it is suggested in other countries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary care demand is rapidly growing and the family physicians feel overflowed by the
      demand and their capacity to solve things is limited by lack of time. Many organizational
      interventions have been planned to solve this problem. One of these is to imply the nurse
      professional to solve and control health problems that traditionally were the doctor’s job.
      So, to demonstrate the nursing care is as effective as the medical care, we will compare,
      among both collectives, the ‘quality’ of care received by patients who ask an appointment for
      the same day.
