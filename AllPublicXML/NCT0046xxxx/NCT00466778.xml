  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a case-controlled study using an innovative, non-invasive, FDA approved technology to
      measure the autonomic nervous system. Detection of unsuspected DPN or ANS dysfunction may
      allow physicians to re-assess current treatment and develop new dietary or pharmacological
      strategies. This also is an immense public health concern since there are currently 18
      million diabetics in the United States and 220 million worldwide.

      A consecutive cohort of 20 neurologically asymptomatic (absence of numbness, tingling,
      burning or pain in the feet) patients with Type I from the practice of Dr. Richard Noto
      (gatekeeper) and associates will be asked with their legal guardians to enroll in this
      case-controlled study using a battery of safe, neurological tests which are unlikely to be
      painful. A second group of 20 subjects who are nondiabetic and healthy (age/sex matched) will
      also be enrolled and undergo the same battery of neurological tests. The battery of tests is
      highly accurate, objective and safe. Subjects will be referred and enrolled from the private
      practices of community pediatricians. A BMI derived from the subject's height and weight will
      be assessed by Dr. Noto. Subjects who are felt to be acceptable by the inclusion criteria
      will then receive consecutive numbers from 1 to 40 and their initials will follow their
      specific number for each study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cooperation of the subject and guardian are required for this 60-120 minute
             evaluation.

          -  Capable of understanding and complying with study protocol.

          -  Twenty (20) male/females with juvenile diabetes [of at least 3 years duration and no
             longer than 7] (Type I) who are neurologically asymptomatic without numbness,
             tingling, burning or pain in the feet, ages 10-18.

          -  Fasting blood glucose greater than 120 mg at the time of initial diagnosis or a HbA1C
             greater than 6.0 at the time of the initial diagnosis will indicate that individual is
             to be considered a diabetic.

          -  BMI ranges of acceptability are greater than 5th percentile and less than 85th
             percentile.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic with neurological symptoms of numbness, tingling, burning or pain in the
             feet of either controls or diabetic subjects.

          -  On medications that can produce peripheral neuropathy, i.e. statins (Lipitor),
             Dilantin, anti-neoplastic drugs.

          -  Unable to understand informed consent, i.e. mental retardation, psychosis,
             communicative impairment, language barrier.

          -  Morbid obesity - maximum BMI greater than 85th percentile.

          -  Underweight status less than 5th percentile BMI.
