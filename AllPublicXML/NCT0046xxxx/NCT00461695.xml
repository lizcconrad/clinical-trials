  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that persistent viral infections particularly with Cytomegalovirus
      (CMV) might have a negative impact on immune senescence (i.e. immunocompetence of elderly
      individuals). We will test this hypothesis by performing a vaccination trial in healthy
      elderly individuals subdivided in two groups of CMV-seropositive and CMV-seronegative
      individuals. All individuals will be vaccinated with the currently licensed vaccine for the
      prevention of TBE (FSME Immun CC) which is recommended for the general population in our
      area. Vaccination efficacy will be monitored longitudinally concerning the TBEV-specific
      antibody (TBEV-neutralization, TBEV-specific ELISA) and T cell response (ELISpot, cytokine
      production).

      Vaccination efficacy will be compared between CMV+ and CMV- individuals and correlated with
      the CMV-specific immune response in CMV+ individuals.
