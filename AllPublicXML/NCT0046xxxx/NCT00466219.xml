      The aim of the study is to assess whether patients with recurrent hepatitis C after liver
      transplantation will benefit from a treatment with ribavirin/PEG-IFN-alpha combined treatment
      for 48 weeks.

      The aim of the study is to assess whether patients fulfilling the criteria as defined in
      section 3 will benefit from a treatment with ribavirin/PEG-a-IFN combined treatment. This
      study will be open to all patients with histologically documented hepatitis C recurring after
      LT, provided that all inclusion and exclusion criteria, as defined below, are met, and
      irrespectively of the pattern of response to a previous antiviral treatment (if any).

      The benefit will be assessed in terms of biochemical (normalization of serum transaminases
      levels), virological (disappearance of HCV RNA from serum) and histological (amelioration of
      the histological signs of hepatitis) response. The presence of a sustained virological
      response, as defined below in section 6, will also be studied in relation to the early
      kinetics of serum HCV RNA, in keeping with recent data obtained in chronic hepatitis C
      patients, which suggest that an early rapid decrease of HCV viremia is associated with a
      durable response.

             disease due to HCV

          -  patients presenting after LT with recurrent HCV infection, documented by presence of
             HCV RNA in serum, and recurrent hepatitis, diagnosed at histology; the liver biopsy
             upon which the diagnosis is established must have been performed within the 12 months
