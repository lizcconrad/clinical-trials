  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with
      combination chemotherapy works as first-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of bevacizumab, irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and
           fluorouracil, in terms of partial or complete response, in patients with unresectable
           metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacogenetics and change in genetic polymorphisms susceptible to
           modification by this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours, and bevacizumab IV on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV over 46 hours
      beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected periodically for pharmacogenetic and genetic
      polymorphism analysis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 61 patients will be accrued for this study.
