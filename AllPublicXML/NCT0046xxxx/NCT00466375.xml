  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there are genes that are common in children with
      infantile hemangioma. This information will allow physicians to improve care for patients who
      have been diagnosed with this disease and to provide their parents with more complete
      information regarding the cause of this disease. This research is being done because many
      unanswered questions remain regarding children with infantile hemangioma. There are very few
      medications to treat infants with hemangiomas.

      WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?

        -  Buccal smear (cheek cells) or small blood sample (4 mL or 1 teaspoon) from child being
           seen in the Dermatology clinic having infantile hemangioma or vascular anomaly

        -  Buccal smear (cheek cells) or small blood sample (4 mL or 1 teaspoon) from parents of
           child

      If you and your child agree to be in this study, the following will happen:

        1. Informed consent and permission to use or disclose your/your child's health information
           for research purposes will be obtained by Dr. Drolet, the principal investigator, or her
           research team. You will receive a copy of this consent form.

        2. A buccal swab or blood sample will be obtained from you and your child; buccal sampling
           involves rubbing the inside of your cheek and removing cells to perform a genetic test
           called &quot;Genomewide Association (GWA).

      We expect you and your child to be involved in this study until you and your child have the
      genetic testing performed.

        Study Population Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No limit to age

          -  Diagnosis of infantile hemangioma and/or vascular anomaly

          -  Unaffected twin sibling

          -  Each patient's authorized legal guardian must understand the nature of the study and
             must provide written informed consent. Each patient must also give assent to study
             participation.

        Study Population Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis other than infantile hemangioma or vascular anomaly

          -  If the lesion has resolved and cannot be confirmed as a hemangioma by clinical exam

          -  If the biologic parents are unwilling or unable to submit DNA samples the child will
             be excluded from the DNA study. Therefore, if DNA samples cannot be or are not
             obtained from both biologic parents, the child and family will be excluded from the
             study.
