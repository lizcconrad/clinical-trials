      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and efficacy of a combination of 3 new
      antiretroviral drugs: darunavir, etravirine and MK-0518 (raltegravir) in patients who have
      multi-resistant viruses and limited treatment options. An optimized background regimen that
      may include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and enfuvirtide can be added,
      if possible, to this combination. Patients will undergo treatment for 48 weeks and
      virological efficacy will be evaluated at week 24.

      Methods: A phase II pilot, prospective, open label, single arm multicentric clinical trial
      assessing a darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and MK-0518-containing regimen, if possible
      associated to an optimized background regimen that may include NRTIs and enfuvirtide, in
      HIV-1 infected patients failing combination antiretroviral therapy with multi-resistant
      viruses.

      Treatment strategy: Patients will receive raltegravir (MK-0518), darunavir/ritonavir
      (TMC114/r) and etravirine (TMC125) and if possible an optimized background therapy.

        -  raltegravir (MK-0518) (400 mg x 2/d = one 400 mg pill twice daily)

        -  darunavir (600 mg x 2/d= two 300 mg pills twice daily with meal)

        -  ritonavir (100 mg x 2/d = one 100 mg pill twice daily with meal)

        -  etravirine (200 mg x 2/d = two 100 mg pills twice daily with meal)

        -  if possible an optimized background therapy: may include NRTI(s) and enfuvirtide but not
           nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs).
           NRTIs choice is left to the clinician's discretion. Enfuvirtide is highly recommended in
           enfuvirtide-naive patients but is left to the clinician.

      Main outcome: proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels of less than 50 copies/ml in an
      intent to treat analysis at W24.

      Secondary outcomes: proportions of patients with HIV RNA levels of less than 50 copies/ml at
      week 48, with HIV RNA levels of less than 400 copies/ml at week 24 and 48; HIV RNA level
      evolution between baseline and week 48; HIV proviral DNA and 2LTR circle HIV DNA between
      baseline and week 48; number and type of resistance mutations in case of virologic failure
      occurrence; CD4 lymphocyte count and proportion evolution between baseline and week 48; HIV
      infection progression; frequency of the study regimen modifications and interruption; study
      regimen tolerance; study regimen adherence; association between study drugs' minimum
      concentrations at week 4 and virologic success at week 24; evolution of pharmacokinetic
      parameters of study drugs between week 1 and week 4 in the Pharmacokinetic substudy.

      Sample size: 103 patients

      Enrollment period: 24 weeks

      Patient's participation duration: 52 weeks

      An extended follow-up (from week 52 to week 96) has been added in April 2008.
