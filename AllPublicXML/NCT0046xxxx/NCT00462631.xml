      The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon dilation
      (SeQuentTM Please) followed by cobalt-chromium stent (CoroflexTM Blue) deployment versus
      Paclitaxel-eluting stent (TaxusTM LibertéTM) deployment in the treatment of de-novo-stenoses
      in native coronary arteries (reference diameter:more then 2.5 mm and below 3.5 mm, length of
      stenosis ≥ 10 mm ≤ 20 mm) of patients with diabetes mellitus for ≥ 3 years for procedural
      success and preservation of vessel patency.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, two-armed phase-II pilot study
      conducted in Malaysia and Thailand.

      128 diabetes mellitus patients shall complete the study per protocol after random assignment
      to either of the treatment groups on the order of 20 to 50 patients per center.

      Diabetes mellitus patients with stable or selected forms of unstable angina or documented
      ischemia due to a de-novo stenosis in a native coronary artery will be enrolled. Vessels may
      not supply an entirely infarcted myocardial area.

      Late lumen loss at 9 months is the primary endpoint.
