  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three forms of continuing medical education (CME)
      on provision of preventive dental services to Medicaid-enrolled children by medical personnel
      in primary care physician offices.

    <textblock>
      Practice-based, randomized controlled trial. Setting: 1,400 pediatric and family physician
      practices in North Carolina providing care to an estimated 240,000 Medicaid-eligible children
      aged 0-3 years. Interventions: Group A practices (n=39) received didactic training and course
      materials in oral health screening, referral, counseling and application of fluoride varnish.
      Group B practices (n=41) received the same as Group A and were offered weekly conference
      calls providing advice and support. Group C practices (n=41) received the same as Group B and
      were offered in-office visit providing hands-on advice and support. Outcome measures were
      computed from reimbursement claims submitted to NC Division of Medical Assistance. Primary
      outcome measure: rate of preventive dental services provision per 100 well-child visits.
      Secondary outcome measure: % of practices providing 20 or more preventive dental visits.

    <description>Group A practices took part in a 90 minute lecture with slides, case-based presentations and discussions of the clinical interventions, instruction in children's dental development, common dental diseases and prevention, screening, referral, counseling and fluoride varnish application. Group B practices received the same as group A and additionally were offered support through telephone conference calls using &quot;learning collaborative&quot; methods where staff receive ongoing support from CME instructors and learn from one another as they begin to implement systems for preventive care in their practices. The conference calls were moderated by research staff with clinical expertise in primary health care who had assisted in other interventions among NC pediatric and family medicine offices. Group C received the same intervention as Group B and were offered additional in-office support for implementation of preventive dental procedures provided by a dental hygienist.</description>
