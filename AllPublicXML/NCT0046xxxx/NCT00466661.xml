  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled outpatient clinical trial of
      acamprosate in individuals with alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder who are also
      receiving mood stabilizing medication. The study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      acamprosate in alcohol-dependent bipolar patients as measured by its effects on alcohol use
      and mood symptoms relative to placebo.

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is whether individuals with comorbid bipolar disorder and
      alcohol dependence who receive acamprosate plus mood stabilizer will have greater improvement
      in alcohol-related outcomes than those who receive mood stabilizer alone. A secondary
      hypothesis that will be explored is that alcohol-dependent bipolar individuals treated with
      acamprosate will have greater mood stability as compared to those treated with mood
      stabilizers alone.
