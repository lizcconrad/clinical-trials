  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminhtiasis occur throughout the developing world and
      are most prevalent in the poorest communitites. These worms have been linked to several
      nutritional and intellectual deficiencies in many endemic populations worldwide. Helminth
      control, though crucial has been neglected for varied reasons. Currently, interests towards
      the control of neglected diseases including schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths
      has been revived through many interventions including repeated chemotherapy to help improve
      public health outcomes and prevent long term morbidity. This will contribute to achieving
      several of the Millennium Development Goals at a favourable cost. A community-directed
      treatment of human schistosomiasis and STH in school-aged children in rural notrhern Ghana
      using praziquantel and albendazole is proposed. It is planned to test the hypothesis that
      community-based volunteers are non-inferior and more cost effective than rural school
      teachers at reaching school-aged children.

      The primary objectives of the study are:

      To compare coverage rate of community based volunteers and rural school teachers in the
      distribution of praziquantel and albendazole to scholl-aged children To determine the cost
      effectiveness of using community based volunteers to distribute praziquantel and albendazole
      to school-aged children in rural Ghana.

      Study methods:

      A list of all school-aged children (6-15 years) in the study area will be generated from the
      Navrongo Demographic Surveillance System database and registers produced and given to all
      school teachers and community based volunteers who will be responsible for the distribution
      of the antihelminithics. The school teachers and community based volunteers will provide the
      drugs to both enrolled and non-enrolled school-aged children. Percentage coverage of
      school-aged children will be the outcome measure and compated between the school teachers and
      the community based volunteers. Stool and urine samples will be collected from a
      representative sample (916) of the children for laboratory analysis before the administration
      of the drugs for baseline data. Sample collection and laboratory analysis will be repeated 6
      and 12 months after the first round of chemotherapy.
