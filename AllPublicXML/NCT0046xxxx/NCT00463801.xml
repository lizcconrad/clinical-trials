    <description>Primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous (IV) daptomycin in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as assessed by measuring the clinical success rate achieved at the day 7 and day 14 visit (D7, D14) after treatment start. Clinical success is defined as complete resolution of signs and symptoms of infection, or clinical improvement, i.e. partial resolution of signs and symptoms so that no further antibacterial treatment was required.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the microbiological efficacy of intravenous (IV) daptomycin in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as assessed by measuring the proportion of patients achieving eradication of the Gram-positive baseline organisms at the study visits on D4, D7, D10, and D14. Microbiological success is documented eradication of baseline Gram-positive organism or presumed eradication defined as clinical success and no culture performed because of absence of drainage or other material for culture.</description>

    <description>350 mg of Daptomycin was supplied as sterile lyophilized powder in glass vials. Each vial was to be reconstituted with 7 mL of normal saline or water for injection, to give a 50 mg/mL drug concentration.

        <title>Efficacy Assessed as Success After 4, 7, 10 and 14 Days of Treatment With Daptomycin on Infecting Gram Positive Bacteria</title>
        <description>To evaluate the microbiological efficacy of intravenous (IV) daptomycin in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as assessed by measuring the proportion of patients achieving eradication of the Gram-positive baseline organisms at the study visits on D4, D7, D10, and D14. Microbiological success is documented eradication of baseline Gram-positive organism or presumed eradication defined as clinical success and no culture performed because of absence of drainage or other material for culture.</description>

        <title>Efficacy Assessed as Percentage of Patients With Clinical Success at Day 4 and 10</title>
        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous (IV) daptomycin in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as assessed by measuring the clinical success rate achieved at the interim visits on day 4 (D4) and day 10 (D10) after treatment start. Clinical success is defined as complete resolution of signs and symptoms of infection, or clinical improvement, i.e. partial resolution of signs and symptoms so that no further antibacterial treatment was required.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The terms and conditions of Novartis' agreements with its investigators may vary. However, Novartis does not prohibit any investigator from publishing. Any publications from a single-site are postponed until the publication of the pooled data (i.e., data from all sites) in the clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Inadequate accrual caused the premature study termination and the insufficient sample size, therefore none of the planned study analyses were performed; nor were any tabulations with descriptive statistics were provided.</limitations_and_caveats>
