  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of individualized performance feedback
      coupled with an educational module in improving resident performance of the physical and
      developmental examination component of developmental surveillance of infants at the two month
      preventive care visit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children in the United States have developmental or behavioral disabilities. The
      American Academy of Pediatrics recently published a policy statement outlining
      recommendations for developmental surveillance and screening of infants and young children.
      One of the Academy's recommendations was for inclusion of developmental surveillance during
      all preventive care visits. The five components of developmental surveillance include
      elicitation and attendance to parental concerns, maintenance of the developmental history,
      observation of the child through physical and developmental examinations, identification of
      risk and protective factors, and documentation of surveillance findings and process
      (referral, follow-up, etc.).

      As a result of concerns expressed by the public regarding accountability in medical education
      and health care, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the American
      Board of Medical Specialties mandated that training programs shift to a competency based
      assessment system. The focus of this study will be to assess the impact of performance
      feedback (based upon video recorded observation) coupled with an educational module on
      resident demonstration of competency in regard to the physical and developmental examinations
      component of developmental surveillance of infants at the two month preventive care visit.

    <time_frame>Residents were observed during each of the eligible preventive care visits. Each visit was an average of 20 minutes in length. Preventive care visits were observed over a 13 month time period.</time_frame>
    <description>Residents were observed to determine whether specific aspects of infant developmental status, as part of developmental surveillance, were assessed during the two-month preventive care visit. The components of developmental surveillance observed were: assessment of the infant's ability to follow past midline, assessment of the infant's ability to lift his/her head off of the table in prone, assessment of the infant's ability to hold an object placed in his/her hand, assessment of the infant's ability to coo, and assessment of the infant's ability to demonstrate a social smile.</description>
