    <description>The medication performance assessment assessed study drug performance on a 5-point categorical scale of 0-4 (0=poor, 1=fair,2=good, 3=very good, 4=excellent) 60 minutes after administration of study drug during the double-blind treatment periods and for the first 5 BTP episodes after each visit during the open-label extension period were recorded in the patient's paper diary. Patients were asked &quot;How well did your study medication perform in controlling this breakthrough pain episode?&quot; The number of episodes rated for each category were recorded.</description>

    <measure>Breakthrough Pain Preference Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After completion of both double-blind treatment periods or early termination</time_frame>
    <description>The BTP preference questionnaire is a questionnaire used to measure patients' preference for FBT or immediate-release oxycodone for management of BTP. The question is used to determine a patient's preference between the study drugs given in the 2 double-blind treatment periods. The patient was asked to select 1 of the following: 1, a preference for study drug used in the 1st double-blind treatment period; 2, a preference for study drug used in the 2nd double-blind treatment period; or 3, no preference.</description>

    <time_frame>The end of the first double-blind treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>The PFTS is used to measure patient's satisfaction with study drug. Although the full scale has 25 questions, the question that is most useful (and least redundant with prior scales) for assessing the efficacy of the study drug is Question 21 which states: Which medication would you prefer to use when treating your pain flares? The subject can choose either: Prior medication, Study medication, or No preference. The number of subjects in each treatment group at the end of the first double-blind treatment period (Visit 5) who responded to each option is presented.</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to titrate immediate-release oxycodone first and to titrate FBT second, or to titrate FBT first and immediate-release oxycodone second, followed by 2 double-blind crossover treatment periods (in randomized order). For the double-blind treatment period of the study involving FBT administration, a patient is randomly assigned to receive FBT at the 200, 400, 600, or 800 mcg strength found to be successful during open-label titration. For the double-blind treatment period of the study to which a patient is randomly assigned to receive immediate-release oxycodone, the patient will receive immediate-release oxycodone at the strength (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) found to be successful during open-label titration.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects 18 to 80 years of age with chronic pain for at least 3 months, were opioid tolerant, on around-the-clock opioid therapy, with 1-4 breakthrough pain episodes a day were recruited from 46 centers in the United States. First participant screened: June 2007. Last participant last visit: February 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to the double-blind treatment period, subjects participated in two titration periods to identify a &quot;successful&quot; and tolerated dose of Fentanyl Buccal Tablets (FBT) and immediate-release oxycodone. Subjects who did not titrate successfully were excluded from further participation in the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>FBT First Immediate Release Oxycodone Second</title>
          <description>Patients were randomized 1:1 to titrate Fentanyl Buccal Tablet (FBT) during the first titration period and then titrated immediate-release oxycodone during the second period or the reverse. Titration began with either 200 mcg FBT or 15 mg oxycodone taken as needed for breakthrough pain. If after 30 minutes pain relief was unsuccessful, a second dose could be taken. If more than one dose was required for at least 1 of 3 breakthrough pain episodes in one day, the next day the dose was increased in 200 mcg increments for FBT and 15 mg increments for oxycodone. The maximum allowable dose was 800 mcg for FBT (4 tablets) and 60 mg (4 capsules) for oxycodone. If a dose was not tolerated the dose was lowered to the previous tolerated dose. Titration completed when successful analgesia was achieved with a tolerated dose or maximum dose was reached. If unsuccessful at maximum dose subject was discontinued from proceeding further in the study. Subjects who successfully titrated were randomized.</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity Difference (PID15) At 15 Minutes</title>
        <description>Pain intensity (PI) scores were assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine after each episode of breakthrough pain during the double-blind treatment period. The PID15 is the difference between the PI scores from the episode baseline (immediately prior to study drug administration)and 15 minutes after the administration of the study drug. Least squared mean was from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as randomized, phase, and sequence as fixed factors and patient as a random factor using compound symmetry.</description>

An episode was evaluable if it had a valid pain intensity measurement immediately prior to drug administration.

        <title>Pain Intensity Difference (PID 10) at 10 Minutes</title>
        <description>Pain intensity (PI) scores were assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine after each episode of breakthrough pain during the double-blind treatment period. The PID10 is the difference between the PI score from the episode baseline (immediately prior to study drug administration) and 10 minutes after the administration of the study drug. Least squared mean was from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as randomized, phase, and sequence as fixed factors and patient as a random factor using compound symmetry.</description>

        <description>Pain intensity (PI) scores were assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine after each episode of breakthrough pain during the double-blind treatment period. The PID5 is the difference between the PI scores from the episode baseline (immediately prior to study drug administration)and 5 minutes after the administration of the study drug. The difference is calculated and assessed as a percentage of the baseline pain intensity score.

          <title>Percentage Change in Pain Intensity Difference (% PID) at 45 Minutes</title>
          <description>Pain intensity (PI) scores were assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine after each episode of breakthrough pain during the double-blind treatment period. The PID45 is the difference between the PI scores from the episode baseline (immediately prior to study drug administration)and 45 minutes after the administration of the study drug. The difference is calculated and assessed as a percentage of the baseline pain intensity score. The percentage is calculated as the PID at 45 minutes divided by the baseline PI score times 100.</description>

        <description>The medication performance assessment assessed study drug performance on a 5-point categorical scale of 0-4 (0=poor, 1=fair,2=good, 3=very good, 4=excellent) 30 minutes after administration of study drug during the double-blind treatment periods and for the first 5 BTP episodes after each visit during the open-label extension period were recorded in the patient’s paper diary. Patients were asked “How well did your study medication perform in controlling this breakthrough pain episode?” The number of episodes rated for each category were recorded.</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set defined as having at least one evaluable episode of breakthrough pain treated with FBT and at least one with oxycodone. An episode was evaluable if it had a valid pain intensity measurement immediately prior to drug administration. No imputation for missing breakthrough pain episodes, but LOCF was applied for missing PR scores.</population>

        <title>Pain Flare Treatment Satisfaction (PFTS) Questionnaire - Question 21 at the End of the First Double-blind Treatment Period (Visit 5)</title>
        <description>The PFTS is used to measure patient's satisfaction with study drug. Although the full scale has 25 questions, the question that is most useful (and least redundant with prior scales) for assessing the efficacy of the study drug is Question 21 which states: Which medication would you prefer to use when treating your pain flares? The subject can choose either: Prior medication, Study medication, or No preference. The number of subjects in each treatment group at the end of the first double-blind treatment period (Visit 5) who responded to each option is presented.</description>
