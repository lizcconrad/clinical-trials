  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized placebo-controlled study is to demonstrate the efficiency and
      safety of the injection of Botulinum Toxin Type A (200 Units) into the external urethral
      sphincter for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of the male CP/CPPS is often as unsuccessful as frustrating for patients and
      doctors. Because of that patients change their general practitioners or urologists quite
      regularly. One of the major problems is the unknown pathomechanism of the disease. Most
      patients are suffering from irritative voiding symptoms and a dysfunction of the pelvic
      floor. By looking at the various (non-) conservative therapeutical strategies it becomes
      quite clear that there is no unique and convincing therapeutical strategy.

      At present Botulinum-Toxin Type A (BTX A) is widely used in the urological field especially
      for para-/tetraplegics patients having trouble with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. It has
      been reported in case series (doses: 200U and 30U) that BTX A injected into the external
      urethral sphincter is able to reduce the symptoms without provoking incontinence. This is
      implied with the hypothesis that obstructive voiding symptoms because of a CP/CPPS are
      associated with an incomplete relaxation of the bladder neck and the external urethral
      sphincter.

      After having given their informed consent, patients undergo a screening visit and baseline
      evaluation including patients history, clinical examination, NIH-CPSI and
      IPSS-questionnaires, micturition diary, sonography, 4-glass test and urodynamics. Patients
      fulfilling the study eligibility criteria are randomized to receive intrasphincteric
      injection of either BTX A or placebo. There will be 5 follow-up visits including a
      post-treatment follow-up after 1 year.
