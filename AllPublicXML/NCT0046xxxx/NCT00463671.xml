  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) increases tissue oxygenation and serves as an adjunct
      therapy for diabetic wounds. However, some patients have insufficient increase or even
      paradoxical decrease in tissue O2 due to vasoconstriction. The aim of the present study was
      to investigate the pathophysiology responsible for the different consequences of HBOT and to
      evaluate the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on these changes.

      Methods: Prospective, randomized, cross-over trial including fifty diabetic patients with
      non-healing ulcers. All patients had two HBOT (100%oxygen, 2ATA) with NAC at the first or the
      second evaluation. At the beginning and at the end of each evaluation, ulcer oxygenation and
      plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), total anti-oxidant status (TAOS) and nitric oxide
      (NO) were measured. Patients with ulcer oxygenation above 200mmHg, were subjected to complete
      HBOT protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diabetic patients, aged 18 years or older, with non-healing foot ulcers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with macrovascular disease amenable for revascularization with more than 70%
             obstruction in femoral artery (evaluated by US doppler) were excluded from the study.
             Similarly, patients with a documented allergy to NAC, liver cirrhosis or those
             receiving NAC for other indications were excluded. Finally, patients with chest
             pathology incompatible with pressure changes, patients with inner ear disease, or
             those suffering from claustrophobia were excluded.
