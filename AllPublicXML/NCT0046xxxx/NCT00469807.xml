  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we have assessed the potential prognostic value for gestational outcome of
      maternal ghrelin levels at very early stages of IVF pregnancies. In addition, ghrelin
      responses to meal intake were explored at early gestation.

      Ghrelin is a pleiotropic hormone recently involved in the control of growth and metabolism,
      whose circulating levels fluctuate in relation to food intake and body mass index. Ghrelin
      has been detected in the decidualized endometrium, as well as in human and rat placenta, with
      a distinctive temporal pattern of expression along pregnancy.

      Comparison(s): A total of 106 patients undergoing IVF procedures were prospectively
      recruited. On d-16 and 23 after oocyte retrieval, the patients were subjected to blood
      sampling after overnight fasting, for determination of serum ghrelin, hCG and progesterone
      levels. In addition, ghrelin levels were assayed in these groups, 2-h after ingestion of a
      fixed-calorie meal.
