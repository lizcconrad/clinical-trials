    <description>The perinatal public health nurse home visit intervention also includes a trifold brochure, printed on 8X10 inch paper, with 6 panels, that can be read with the woman in an interactive manner so that the woman is encouraged to describe her experiences and choose her options as they proceed. Participants will receive three prenatal and three postpartum sessions. The first prenatal sessions will be given during the first (enrollment), second, and third trimesters, with at least three weeks between sessions. Women entering the study after the first trimester will receive the initial session at enrollment, with two subsequent sessions spread out over the remainder of the scheduled prenatal home visitation program sessions.</description>
