      The primary objective of this study is to obtain clinical performance information on the
      GYNECARE TVT-SECUR* System (Tension-free Support for Incontinence) in women with stress
      urinary incontinence (SUI).

      The primary variable for effectiveness is &gt; 50% improvement on the subjective symptom Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS) at Visit 3/Week 5 (35 days post-surgery) to be accepted.

             60].

          -  Have an active urinary tract infection (UTI) or vaginal infection at time of surgery.

          -  Are deemed by the investigator as medically unfit for surgery or who in the opinion of
             the investigator should not be enrolled in the study because of the precautions,
             warnings or contraindications outlined in the GYNECARE TVT SECUR System IFU.

          -  Employees of the investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed
