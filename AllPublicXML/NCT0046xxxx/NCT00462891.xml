      RATIONALE: Screening may help doctors find breast cancer cells early and plan better
      treatment for breast cancer. The Mammography FastTrack program may be effective in increasing
      the number of patients who undergo mammography.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the use of a Mammography FastTrack
      program to increase the number of women who undergo mammography.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Classify all patients within the Massachusetts General Primary Care-Practice Based
           Research Network (MGPC-PBRN) according to patient-primary care provider (PCP) linkage
           status.

        -  Develop a breast cancer screening intervention program called Mammography FastTrack that
           facilitates the ordering of mammograms to be used either by PCPs (for PCP-linked
           patients) or by practice managers (for practice-linked patients).

        -  Compare the impact of the Mammography FastTrack program on mammography screening rates
           in PCP-linked vs practice-linked patients overdue for breast cancer screening.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Mammography-eligible women are linked to either a provider or a practice within the
      Massachusetts General Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network (MGPC-PBRN). Practices
      within the MGPC-PBRN are stratified according to baseline mammography screening rates (high
      vs low) and practice type (community health center vs hospital-based vs community-based) and
      are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Physicians and practice managers receive e-mail alerts at months 1 and 3
           informing them of the availability of mammography screening data for their panel of
           primary-care patients. A hyperlink refers the provider to a web-portal for the
           Mammography FastTrack program that lists all eligible patients who have not undergone
           mammography. The provider may then click a button to schedule, defer (providing reason
           for deferral), or provide the date of a recent mammogram.

        -  Arm II: Practices continue standard care. At the end of 12 months, electronic report and
           billing data and a review of electronic health records are used to determine the
           completion of mammograms.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6,730 patients will be accrued for this study.
