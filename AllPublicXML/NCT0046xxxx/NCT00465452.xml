  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to determine if switching PD patients treated with
      pramipexole to ropinirole CR reduces the non-motor side effects frequently experienced by
      these patients. Side effects that we will monitor in particular include somnolence,
      peripheral edema, cognitive decline with and without hallucinations. PD patients followed in
      the MUO Neurology Clinic who are being treated with pramipexole and have evidence of at least
      one of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive impairment with or without
      hallucinations, or peripheral edema will be offered the opportunity to participate in this
      study.

      The purpose of this proposal is to determine if switching PD patients treated with
      pramipexole to ropinirole CR reduces the non-motor side effects frequently experienced by
      these patients. Side effects that we will monitor in particular include somnolence,

      the MUO Neurology Clinic who are being treated with pramipexole and have evidence of at least
      one of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive impairment with or without
      hallucinations, or peripheral edema will be offered the opportunity to participate in this
      study.

      Fifteen subjects who are currently receiving pramipexole therapy (monotherapy or adjunctive
      therapy) who are experiencing one or more of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive
      decline with/without hallucinations, and peripheral edema will be asked if they are willing
      to participate at the time of their clinic visit at the PDMDP.

      The crossover from pramipexole to ropinirole CR will be performed over a 2 week interval.
      During the first week, the initial drug dose will substitute ½ of the pramipexole with ½ of
      the target dose of ropinirole CR. If subjects are tolerating the drug change, then 100% of
      the target dose of ropinirole CR (and no pramipexole) will be started in the second week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to qualify for entrance into
        the study:

          -  Subjects who are male or female and are aged 55 and older.

          -  Subjects and/or their legal guardians must be able and willing to give informed
             consent.

          -  Subjects must be on stable doses of pramipexole for greater than 4 weeks duration
             prior to screening.

          -  Subjects who are female must be non-pregnant and non-nursing. Women of Child-Bearing
             Potential (WOCBP) must use a reliable method of contraception (e.g., oral
             contraceptive or long-term injectable or implantable hormonal contraceptive,
             double-barrier methods, such as condom and diaphragm, condom and foam, condom and
             sponge or intra-uterine devices) and have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening. Women are considered to not be of child-bearing potential if they have been
             surgically sterilized (physician-documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or if they
             are post-menopausal.

          -  Subjects must have a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's based on the presence of at
             least 2 of the 3 cardinal criteria - rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity - and no
             obvious history of head trauma, stroke, infectious, structural, or metabolic
             abnormality consistent with an alternative diagnosis to Parkinson's disease.

          -  Evidence of one or more of the following symptoms: somnolence (ESS score ≥ 9),
             cognitive decline (MMSE &lt; 24 ± presence of hallucinations (NPI-Q), peripheral edema
             (present by objective physical exam with baseline ankle and calf circumference
             measured in centimeters).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject who meets any of the following criteria will NOT qualify for the study:

          -  Subjects must not be receiving any treatments for excess somnolence such as
             amphetamine derivatives, other stimulants or Provigil.

          -  Subjects with actively treated malignancies, clinically significant heart disease,
             kidney, liver, or pulmonary disorders will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with clinical depression who are not receiving stable doses of antidepressant
             therapy in excess of 4 weeks duration.

          -  Subjects with history of orthostatic hypotension (&gt;30mm drop in systolic pressure
             and/or &gt;20mm drop in diastolic pressure) associated with syncope.

          -  Subjects started within the last 14 days on any drug known to substantially inhibit
             CYP1A2 (e.g., cimetidine, fluvoxamine) or induce CYP1A2 (e.g.omeprazole) (Note:
             Subjects already on these agents may be enrolled but must remain on the stable doses
             of the agents from 14 days prior to the beginning of the study).

          -  Subjects who have other medical conditions that are considered clinically unstable or
             that may compromise the safety of the patient during this study.
