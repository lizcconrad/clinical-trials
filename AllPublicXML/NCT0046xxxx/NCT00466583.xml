  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerance, and pharmacologic profile of EZN-2968, a locked
      nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide against hypoxia-inducible factor 1α administered as a
      2-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion weekly for 3 weeks per 6-week cycle. In patients treated
      at a recommended Phase 2 dose of EZN-2968, dose intensification will proceed by maintaining
      the dose, but gradually increasing the number of doses per 6-week cycle. Up to 3
      intensification cohorts will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose of EZN-2968.

             solid tumor or lymphoma (Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's)

          -  Patients who have failed standard therapy and have no known effective therapy
             available to them

          -  Patients may have a tumor amenable to biopsy

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Age 18 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria: Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be
        eligible for enrollment.

          -  Concurrent serious medical illness

          -  Known, clinically suspected, or history of central nervous system (CNS) tumor
             involvement

          -  Prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, or other therapy used to
             treat the cancer within 4 weeks (6 weeks for prior treatment with mitomycin C or
             nitrosoureas) before the scheduled administration of EZN-2968. Luteinizing
             hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy is permitted for patients with
             hormone refractory prostate cancer.
