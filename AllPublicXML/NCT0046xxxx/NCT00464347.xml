  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VERTACL will investigate whether a triple therapy, Avastin®, half fluence verteporfin
      photodynamic therapy (PDT), and triamcinolone acetonide-preservative free (TAC- PF), results
      in improved 12-month vision outcome compared to Avastin® alone in participants with
      neovascular AMD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VERTACL study is a multi-center, randomized, Phase II trial to investigate whether a
      triple therapy, Avastin®, half fluence verteporfin PDT, and TAC- PF, results in improved
      12-month vision outcome compared to Avastin® alone in participants with neovascular AMD.

      Participants will be randomized (similar to the flip of a coin) in a 1:1 ratio to one of the
      two study groups: single therapy (Avastin®), or triple therapy (Avastin®, half fluence
      verteporfin PDT, and TAC- PF). Participants in the Avastin® alone arm will receive 1.25 mg
      intravitreal Avastin®, at every study visit. Participants in the triple-therapy arm will
      receive all treatments (Avastin®, half fluence verteporfin PDT, and TAC- PF) at baseline.

      Following baseline, participants in the triple therapy study arm will receive study treatment
      on an as-needed (PRN) basis if protocol-specific re-treatment criteria are met. After
      randomization, participants will return to the clinic approximately every six weeks for one
      year for study assessments and possible re-treatment.

      Participants will return to the clinic at month 24 for a final study assessment. Study
      assessments include: visual acuity, optical coherence tomography, and fundus photography.
