    <textblock>
      There has been considerable debate over the last 30 years about the interaction between
      asthma and parasitic infection. It has been suggested that at least part of the reason for
      the increasing prevalence of asthma in the developed world is a decrease in parasite
      infections resulting from improved living conditions with economic development. Our previous
      studies in Ethiopia suggest that hookworm infection may be particularly important in this
      process.

      To establish definitively whether parasites can protect against allergic disease, and
      specifically asthma, ultimately requires a randomised clinical trial of parasite infection in
      patients with asthma. We, the researchers at the University of Nottingham, have completed a
      study in normal volunteers to establish the dose of hookworms necessary to generate infection
      at the level shown to be protective in population surveys, and shown that infection is well
      tolerated. In addition, we have recently completed a randomized placebo-controlled clinical
      trial of hookworm infection in allergic patients with rhinitis which showed that there was no
      negative effect on bronchial responsiveness during the phase in the lifecycle where the
      hookworm larvae migrate through the lungs. Consequently, are now proceeding with the
      definitive randomized placebo-controlled trial of hookworm infection in people with asthma.
      This study will also provide us with the opportunity to investigate the cellular mechanisms
      of the effect of hookworm infection on the immune system.

      Epidemiological evidence suggests that human hookworm infection is associated with a reduced
      risk of asthma and allergic disease. This association is potentially important not only to
      understanding the aetiology of asthma and allergic disease, but also because it suggests that
      hookworms or their products might be therapeutically effective in these conditions. To test
      the hypothesis that hookworms protect against asthma ultimately requires a clinical trial.

      We have carried out a dose-ranging study to establish the dose of hookworm larvae necessary
      to generate infection at the intensity shown to be protective in epidemiological studies,
      with acceptable side effects. We have also completed a randomized controlled clinical trial
      of hookworm infection in people with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and have shown that there
      is no significant change in airway responsiveness during the lung migration phase of the
      hookworm life cycle. We are now performing the definitive study which is a randomized
      placebo-controlled trial of the effects of therapeutic hookworm infection in people with
      asthma. During this study, we will be monitoring various indicators of asthma control but
      will also be able to measure a range of relevant immunological parameters to explore the
      relation between these parameters and expression of the allergic and asthmatic phenotypes
