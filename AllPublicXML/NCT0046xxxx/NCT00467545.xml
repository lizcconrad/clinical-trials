  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety of telbivudine for up to 21 months of open-label
      treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B who have completed the CLDT600A2407 trial.
      Patients treated with telbivudine during core phase will continue telbivudine and patients
      treated with entecavir during core phase will be switched to telbivudine if the patient is
      willing to enroll this study.
