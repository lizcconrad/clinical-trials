  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mono-centre trial performed at the medical ICU at the Medical University Graz.
      There will be a study visit (V1) and a follow-up assessment (V2). In the study visit (V1)
      arterial blood glucose values will be monitored and subcutaneous sampling of interstitial
      fluid (ISF) with microdialysis for glucose determination and with microperfusion for
      cytokine-measurement will be performed. The study visit will last for 26 hours starting with
      the insertion of two catheters in the abdominal subcutaneous tissue (one microdialysis- and
      one microperfusion catheter). The primary hypothesis of the study is: Interstitial fluid
      glucose concentration profiles correlates to the arterial blood glucose concentration profile
      in patients with severe sepsis in the medical ICU.
