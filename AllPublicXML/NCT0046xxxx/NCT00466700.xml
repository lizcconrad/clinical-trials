    <textblock>
      H. pylori infection causes the stomach to become inflamed. The problem usually begins in
      childhood and leads to stomach problems in adult life. Study participants will be residents
      of The Gambia, West Africa, and will be studied at the Medical Research Council of Great
      Britain facility in Fajara, The Gambia. Up to 75 adults 18 years and older and 20
      malnourished children 6 months to 2 years of age, who are undergoing endoscopy as part of
      their medical care, will be studied. (Endoscopy is when a thin, lighted device is used to
      look inside the body.) During this study procedure, tiny pieces of tissue, called biopsies,
      will be taken from the stomach and checked for H. pylori infection. Participants found to be
      infected will be given antibiotic treatment. Participation in the study will last
      approximately 72 hours.

      The overall goal in this pilot project is to implement and evaluate a new method for
      isolating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains from young children, and to compare these
      isolates with those obtained from adults from the same population. This is part I of the
      study, and part II is described in the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases
      protocol 06-0004. The transition from childhood colonization to adult disease state may be
      affected by multiple factors including evolution of genotypes of colonizing H. pylori strains
      themselves, driven in part by the host response to infection. The hypothesis is that H.
      pylori strains from Gambian children will differ genetically from the strains of chronically
      colonized adults from the same community. Genetic and phenotypic characterization of
      pediatric and adult H. pylori isolates will test for fundamental differences between strains
      circulating in these 2 age groups, and thereby help evaluate the importance of strain
      selection and/or genome evolution in such high risk societies. Specific objectives are: to
      compare the range of genotypes obtained from H. pylori cultured from gastric biopsies from
      Gambian adults and children undergoing diagnostic upper endoscopy, with those obtained by
      culture of gastric juice aspirates from the same subjects. This will allow interpretation of
      results obtained from culture of nasogastric aspirates from children who do not require
      diagnostic endoscopy, when compared to gastric biopsy-derived H. pylori isolates. Most
      genotyping will entail polymerase chain reaction tests for virulence markers, limited
      (focused) DNA sequencing, and tests for susceptibility to metronidazole and frequency of
      forward mutation. The study population will consist of residents of The Gambia, West Africa.
      Up to seventy five adults of both sexes and all ages, who are undergoing diagnostic endoscopy
      as part of their clinical management, and 20 malnourished children of both sexes and less
      than 2 years of age, who are undergoing diagnostic endoscopy as part of their clinical
      management, will be studied. All subjects will be studied at the Medical Research Council of
      Great Britain research laboratories and clinical facility in Fajara, The Gambia. The main
      outcome measure will be the degree of relatedness between bacterial isolates. This will be
      assessed by visual comparison between random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) results,
      by comparison of genotype for alleles of interest, and definitively by sequencing of
      housekeeping genes to construct phylogenetic trees of relatedness, using the STAR program (a
      computer program for putting DNA sequences together for analysis) and multiple locus sequence
      typing (MLST) database. There are no outcome measures for human subjects. All laboratory
      investigations will be conducted upon bacterial isolates.

        The study population will consist of rural subsistence farmers and semi-urban dwellers
        attending the clinic at the MRC research laboratories in Fajara, The Gambia. The study will
        be comprised of subjects who are undergoing endoscopy for diagnostic purposes within the
        endoscopy unit at Fajara.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adult Subjects: All consenting subjects referred for diagnostic upper endoscopy to the
        Medical Research Council (MRC) unit in Fajara will be eligible for inclusion, provided none
        of the exclusion criteria apply. In The Gambia, subjects aged 18 years and above are
        considered as adult. Subjects will be sampled only once.

        Child Subjects: All subjects under 2 years of age referred for diagnostic upper endoscopy
        to the MRC unit in Fajara will be eligible for inclusion, provided their parents give
        informed consent and that none of the exclusion criteria apply. The minimum cut-off age for
        this study will be 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Adult Subjects: Any contraindication to endoscopy and biopsy, such as as liver dysfunction,
        history of bleeding, history of other serious organ disease (for example, kidney, heart,
        lung), bleeding time prolonged to over 10 minutes, or unexpected findings such as
        esophageal or gastric stricture that limits endoscopic examination will exclude subjects
        from the study, as will the use of antibiotics during the previous 2 weeks. Specific tests
        such as bleeding times will be performed at the discretion of the supervising clinician,
        who is undertaking the diagnostic endoscopy for the subject's clinical benefit. In
        addition, if the endoscopist feels that prolonging the procedure by 2 or 3 minutes in order
        to take the research biopsies would not be advisable for any reason, the subject will be
        excluded from the study.
