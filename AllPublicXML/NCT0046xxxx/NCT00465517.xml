    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an investigational drug-ganaxolone -
      on partial seizure frequency in adults with epilepsy taking a maximum of 3 antiepileptic
      medications (AEDs). The study will also evaluate the effectiveness of ganaxolone in females
      with catamenial epilepsy.

      Catamenial epilepsy refers to a relationship between seizure frequency and a woman's
      menstrual cycle, where the number of seizures increases around the time of a woman's
      menstrual cycle.

      Subjects will undergo

        -  8-week baseline seizure period

        -  Randomization to ganaxolone or placebo

        -  Dose titrate for 2 weeks followed by 8 weeks of maintenance.

        -  Eligible subjects will be offered participation in the open-label extension study.

        -  Those not entering open-label will undergo a 6-week dose de-escalation to gradually
           taper ganaxolone.

             according to the International League Against Epilepsy [ILAE] Classification of
             Epileptic Seizures (1981). Diagnosis should have been established by clinical history
             and CT or MRI of the brain to rule out progressive structural lesions and EEG with
             results consistent with partial-onset epilepsy.

          -  During the 8 week baseline period preceding randomization visit (Visit 4), subjects
             should have a documented seizure frequency of ≥ 3CPS per 4 weeks on average.

          -  Subjects should not be seizure free for more than 28 consecutive days during treatment
             with a stable dose of AEDs [Note: Subjects with historically sufficiently high seizure
             frequency who fall short 1 seizure in any 4 weeks period or with a seizure-free period
             &gt; 28 consecutive days may be allowed to enter the study after discussion with the
             Medical Monitor. Prolongation of the screening period for questionable cases may also
             be allowed by the Medical Monitor.]

          -  Treatment with a stable dose of up to 3 (FDA approved) current AEDs for 1 month prior
             to screening.

          -  Maintenance of current AEDs without a change in dosing for the duration of study.

               -  Concomitant vigabatrin not permitted;

               -  Felbamate is allowed if the subject has been on felbamate for at least 18 months
                  and has stable laboratory tests) for the course of the study. [Note: A shorter
                  period for stable laboratory results may be allowed by the Medical Monitor,
                  depending on the extent of dose change and the half-life of the AED.]

               -  Subjects receiving treatment with a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) may be included
                  as long as the VNS has been in place for at least 12 months prior to entry into
                  the study, the VNS battery is not due for replacement during 0600 subject
                  participation, and stimulation parameters have been kept constant for 1 month
                  prior to screening. VNS will be counted as 1 of the 3 concomitant AEDs.

          -  Male or female, 18 to 69 years of age (inclusive). [Note: Subjects who are &gt; 69 years
             of age but are of good health condition may be allowed to enter the study after
             discussion with and approval by the Medical Monitor.]

          -  A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) w/o clinically significant abnormalities.

          -  Be properly informed of the nature and risks of the study and give informed consent in

             acceptable method of birth control and have a negative qualitative β-human chorionic
             growth hormone (β-HCG) pregnancy test result from a urine sample collected at the
             initial screening visit. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as a female who
             is biologically capable of becoming pregnant. A medically acceptable method of birth
             control includes intrauterine devices in place for at least 3 months, surgical
             sterilization, or adequate barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm and foam). An oral
             contraceptive alone is not considered adequate for the purpose of this study. Use of
             oral contraceptives in combination with another method (eg, a spermicidal cream) is
             acceptable.in subjects who are not sexually active, abstinence is an acceptable form
             of birth control and serum β-HCG must be tested per protocol.
