      This study aims to investigate the role of fronto-striatal circuits and cognitive control in
      the perseverative and inflexible behavior that is a defining feature of autism. We
      hypothesize that deficits in the development of fronto-striatal circuitry may underlie
      cognitive inflexibility in autism. Specifically, we hypothesize that repetitive, inflexible
      behavior arises as (1) fronto-striatal systems are capable of learning patterns present in
      the environment (as in implicit learning paradigms), but are unable to adapt behavior to
      changing circumstances, related to either (2) decreased ability of basal ganglia to detect
      violations of expectancy, (3) decreased ability of prefrontal cortex to respond to detected
      violations, or (4) decreased connectivity of the circuits. We are conducting three functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies to address these hypotheses.
