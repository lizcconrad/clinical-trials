  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant rejection following organ transplant occurs because the recipient's immune system
      attacks the transplanted organ. The recipients immune system recognizes the transplanted
      organ as foreign tissue and attempts to destroy it in the similar way that it attempts to
      destroy infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      system is a set of genes that is responsible for controlling an individuals' ability to tell
      the difference between an infectious agent and self tissue.

      Differences in HLA genes between donors and recipients play a major part in influencing the
      rejection or acceptance of foreign tissue (i.e. transplanted organs). Due to time limitations
      in heart transplantation, HLA matching is not considered. It is unclear how individual HLA
      differences affect the recovery and expected lifespan of pediatric heart transplant
      recipients.

      This study is designed to look at the donor-recipient matching and mismatching to determine
      if mismatching leads to more complications, shorter graft survival and, therefore, increased
      risk of death following pediatric heart transplantation.

      It is generally thought that immunologic mismatching in solid organ transplant will lead to
      increased rates of graft failure due to acute rejection in the short term and chronic
      rejection, or coronary vasculopathy in the longterm. Many studies in renal, pancreas and lung
      transplantation suggest favorable outcomes when HLA matching occurs and unfavorable outcomes
      when HLA mismatching occurs and circulating donor-specific antibodies are produced.

      However, in heart transplantation this association is less clear. Advances in recognition and
      identification of HLA antibodies have resulted in more specific information regarding HLA
      mismatching and outcomes. This study is aimed at analyzing outcomes in pediatric heart
      transplant based on recipient-donor HLA incompatibility and the post-transplant production of
      donor-specific HLA antibodies.

      Hypothesis:

        1. HLA systems' genes class I &amp; II matching results in a survival/rejection benefit in
           pediatric heart transplant recipients.

        2. Mismatched transplants with donor-specific HLA antibodies have decreased overall
           survival.

      A Multivariate Analysis of data will be performed by both Emory and Children's investigators
      and research support staff.
