    <textblock>
      This study in PD patients is designed to assess the affect food has on the absorption,
      distribution, metabolism and excretion of ropinirole (by dosing some patients in the fasted
      state and other patients following a high-fat breakfast), and to assess the difference in
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of ropinirole if patients are given three
      4mg ropinirole tablets versus one 12mg tablet.
