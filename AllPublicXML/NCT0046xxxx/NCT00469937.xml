      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as
      lithium, may protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy. Giving lithium
      together with radiation therapy may allow a higher dose of radiation therapy to be given so
      that more tumor cells are killed.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lithium when given
      together with whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases from
      primary cancer outside the brain.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of concurrent lithium carbonate and whole-brain radiotherapy,
           as measured by safety and compliance, in patients with primary extracranial malignancy
           and brain metastases.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of lithium carbonate.

      Patients receive oral lithium carbonate twice daily on days 1-7 and 2-4 times daily on days
      8-21. Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy once daily on days 8-12 and 15-19.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lithium carbonate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life and mental status are assessed at baseline, on days 1, 8, and 15, at 1-month
      post-treatment, and then periodically thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then periodically
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Protocol radiotherapy must begin within seven days following initiation of Lithium therapy if day seven falls on a holiday or weekend; it is acceptable to begin treatment the next business day. One treatment of 3Gy will be given daily with the exception of weekends and holidays for a total of (10 fractions) for a total of 30 Gy over 2 to 3 weeks.</description>
