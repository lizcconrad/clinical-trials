  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP) started in 1999 with local allocation of kidneys from
      deceased donors elder than 65 years to recipients elder than 65 years. The requirements for
      immunosuppression in this group of patients are high due to the large amount of
      comorbidities.

      This prospective randomized trial compared the standard immunosuppressive protocol based on
      cyclosporine A (CyA) used at our center within the ESP, to a calcineurin inhibitor-free
      protocol based on sirolimus (SRL).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a CNI-free therapy on the function of
      elderly kidneys 6 months post transplantation, measured by GFR.
