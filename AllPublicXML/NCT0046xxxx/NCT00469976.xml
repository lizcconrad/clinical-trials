      RATIONALE: Enzastaurin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as carboplatin and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry
      tumor-killing substances to them. Giving enzastaurin together with carboplatin and
      gemcitabine, with or without bevacizumab, may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving enzastaurin together with
      carboplatin and gemcitabine, with or without bevacizumab, works in treating patients with
      recurrent, stage IIIB, or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or stage IIIB or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and enzastaurin with
           or without bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based
      on eligibility for bevacizumab therapy.

        -  Group 1 (bevacizumab-eligible): Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and
           bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1; gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes
           on days 1 and 8; and oral enzastaurin hydrochloride 3 or 4 times daily on days 1-21 in
           courses 1-6 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral enzastaurin
           hydrochloride 3 times daily on days 1-21 in all subsequent courses.

        -  Group 2 (bevacizumab-ineligible): Patients receive carboplatin, gemcitabine
           hydrochloride, and enzastaurin hydrochloride as in group 1 in courses 1-6 and
           enzastaurin hydrochloride alone 3 times daily on days 1-21 in all subsequent courses.

      In both groups, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study.
