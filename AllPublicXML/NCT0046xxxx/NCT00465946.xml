  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope is a syndrome consisting of a relatively short period of temporary and self-limited
      loss of consciousness caused by transient diminution of blood flow to the brain (most often
      the result of systemic hypotension). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect
      of salt supplementation in vasovagal syncope prophylaxis.
