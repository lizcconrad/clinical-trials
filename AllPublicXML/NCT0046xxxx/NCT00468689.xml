      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and exposure of SB-751689 when administered
      alone at supratherapeutic doses and when SB-751689 is co administered with ketoconazole, a
      PGP/CYP3A4 inhibitor that increases exposure of SB-751689. Data from this study will enable
      the planning and conduct of a QTc study for SB-751689.
