  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease and stroke are major causes of death and disability worldwide and are largely
      preventable. Cholesterol and blood pressure are major cardiovascular risk factors. Previous
      studies have shown that certain drugs can effectively and safely lower cholesterol and blood
      pressure and prevent heart attacks and strokes. Such studies have been conducted primarily in
      people who had already sustained a heart attack or a stroke, or in people with high
      cholesterol and blood pressure levels. However, most heart attacks and strokes occur in
      people with average (&quot;normal&quot;) cholesterol and blood pressure. Therefore, in the HOPE-3 trial
      the investigators will evaluate whether a cholesterol lowering drug, rosuvastatin, and a
      combination blood pressure lowering pill, candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, used alone or
      together can reduce the risk of heart attacks, stroke and their sequelae in people without
      known heart disease and at average risk.

      The trial has randomized 12,705 women 60 years or older and men 55 years or older without
      known heart disease or prior stroke and without a clear indication or contraindication to any
      of the study medications. Eligible and consenting individuals were randomized to receive
      either active study medications or placebo (dummy pills) and will be monitored for an average
      of 5.7 years. The rates of heart attacks, strokes, deaths and other cardiovascular events
      will be compared between subjects receiving the active drugs and those on placebo. The study
      included people from 21 countries, which were monitored by an international group of
      scientists and physicians. The study was coordinated by the Population Health Research
      Institute at McMaster University. The study is expected to demonstrate that combined lipid
      lowering and blood pressure lowering will substantially lower the risk for cardiovascular
      diseases and may substantially change our approach to cardiovascular prevention.
