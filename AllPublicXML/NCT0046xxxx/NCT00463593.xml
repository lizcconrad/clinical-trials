  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current efforts to control schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthes infections focus
      on the school-age population, and school-based treatment delivery programs offer a major cost
      advantages because of the use of the existing school infrastructure and the fact that
      schoolchildren are accessible through schools. However, in many developing countries, large
      numbers of school-age children are not in school and this has raised questions about the
      effectiveness of school-based programs in reaching non-enrolled children. Increasingly, the
      non-formal education sector is providing a growing solution to the problem of poor enrolment
      in basic education, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and has recently been used to deliver
      praziquantel as part of a national schistosomiasis control program in Uganda. However, it is
      unclear how effective this program has been in reaching children who attend non-formal
      schools and whether the program has been reaching children from the poorest households.

      This study will compare infection and nutritional status of children enrolled in formal
      schools and non-formal schools, and non-enrolled children in Nakasongola District in Uganda,
      and investigate the process and impact of treatment delivered by the national control
      program. The study will consist of household surveys and cross-sectional parasitological and
      hematological surveys, with follow-up six months later. The evaluation will take place over
      the course of a year and will:

        -  Compare the infection and nutritional status of children enrolled in formal schools and
           non-formal schools, and non-enrolled children in Nakasongola District, Uganda

        -  Compare programmatic process indicators, including enrolment rates, attendance rates,
           access to water and sanitation, treatment coverage in formal and non-formal schools

        -  Investigate the impact of treatment on intensity of infection and reinfection rates in
           formal and non-formal schools.
