  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A unique multinational study was conducted simultaneously in the USA, England and Australia.
      The goals of the study were to answer two questions: Does psychosocial support for the family
      enhance the effectiveness of drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease? Is the added value of
      psychosocial support the same in all 3 countries?

    <textblock>
      This study is a single-blind prospective randomized trial with 150 patient/caregiver pairs
      (50 in each country). Eligibility criteria at baseline require that the primary caregiver is
      the spouse of the patient; the patient must have a diagnosis of AD, be in the in mild to
      moderate stage of dementia, be living with the caregiver, and be willing to take Donepezil
      (Aricept). These participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: in one group, the
      intervention consists of drug treatment for the patient plus psychosocial intervention for
      the caregiver; in the other group the intervention consists solely of drug treatment for the
      patient.

      The intervention for the caregiver consists of 5 scheduled individual and family counseling
      sessions within 3 months of baseline, and unlimited consultations on request. Assessments
      were conducted every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months for a second year. There
      are 3 sources of data: an interview of the caregiver by an independent rater, an assessment
      of the patient, and a count of the amount of medication used. Thus we will be able to assess
      the effect of adding counseling to medication for the caregiver, for the patient, and on
      compliance with medication use.
