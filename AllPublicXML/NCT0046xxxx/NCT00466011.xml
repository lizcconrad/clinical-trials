      Introduction: The full night polysomnography (PSG) in sleep lab is the gold standard to
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) diagnosis. However, there is a need to evaluate simple and
      accurate home diagnostic equipment that can reliably detect or exclude OSA. The aim of our
      study was to evaluate if an ambulatory portable monitor (SD) is accurate to measure
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in OSA patients referred to a Sleep Lab. Methods: Patients with
      clinical suspicion of OSA were selected. Three-order randomized evaluations had been
      performed within a period of two weeks: the 1) SD (Stardust®, Respironics, Inc, USA) was used
      at patients home (SD home), 2) SD was used simultaneously with PSG in the sleep lab (SD+PSG
      lab) and 3) PSG was performed without the use of SD (PSG lab). Four AHI were generated and
      analyzed: AHI from SD home, AHI from SD of SD+PSG lab, AHI from PSG of PSG+SD lab and AHI
      from PSG lab. The analyses of SDs and PSGs recordings were performed by two blinded
      technicians.
