    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of rosiglitazone, a medicine commonly used to treat
      type 2 diabetes, on the utilization of glucose by the heart in patients with heart failure
      which is not due to heart attacks. The primary purpose of the study is to determine whether
      treatment with an insulin-sensitizing medication will improve the heart's ability to
      metabolize glucose (sugar).

      Nondiabetic patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who are insulin-resistance or
      insulin-sensitive based on a fasting homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) value are eligible
      for the trial. At baseline, a 6-minute walk test is performed, followed by assessment of
      coronary flow reserve with ammonia-PET imaging before/after adenosine infusion. Subjects are
      then given an oral glucose load (75g), followed by PET imaging with
      F-18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG). Subjects then begin taking rosiglitazone 4 mg qd x 12
      weeks, after which the 6-minute walk test &amp; PET imaging is repeated.
