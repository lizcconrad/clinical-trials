  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transcervical Foley catheter (TFC) is a proven and effective mode of cervical ripening.
      It is common practice to use TFC with simultaneous low-dose oxytocin under the assumption
      that the combination results in a more successful labor induction. Scientific validation of
      this practice is lacking. We seek to determine if the addition of oxytocin to TFC improves
      induction success.

      This is a prospective, randomized trial that aims to enroll 200 singleton pregnancies
      presenting for preinduction ripening. Patients will be randomized to receive either TFC alone
      (control) or TFC plus low-dose oxytocin (treatment). Providers will not blinded to use of
      oxytocin and labor was managed according to routine obstetric protocols. This study is
      powered to detect a 20% difference in the proportion of patients delivered within 24 hours,
      the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are related to vaginal delivery rate, duration of
      induction, complications, and pain management.
