  <official_title>A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group, Treatment-withdrawal Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Esomeprazole for the Treatment of Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD) in Infants Aged 1 to 11 Months, Inclusive</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the improvement of a once a day dose of esomeprazole
      for reducing the signs and symptoms of infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
      This research study consists of a screening, open-label, and double-blind treatment
      withdrawal phase. The screening phase ensures the patient eligibility. No study medication is
      dispensed during the screening phase. During the open-label phase, patients are administered
      esomeprazole 2.5mg, 5.0mg or 10.0mg based on his/her weight. During the double-blind phase,
      the patients are administered either his/her open-label dose or placebo. Double-blind means
      neither the physician, parent, or patient will know if patient is taking esomeprazole or
      placebo. The patient will have an equal chance of receiving esomeprazole or placebo.
