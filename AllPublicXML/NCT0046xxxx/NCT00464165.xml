  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of 2 fixed doses of rimonabant versus placebo
      on abstinence from tobacco use in cigarette smokers.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of rimonabant on craving and weight and on
      the clinical and biological safety and tolerability of rimonabant in a population of
      cigarette tobacco smokers during a 10-week treatment period and to observe the percentage of
      abstinent subjects during a 40-week follow-up post treatment.
