      Objective. To determine the effect of a short osteoporosis educational program on young
      womenâ€™s knowledge and beliefs about osteoporosis. Methods. Ten college physical activity
      classes enrolling 133 predominantly Caucasian women (age range 18 to 21 years) were
      randomized to an osteoporosis educational program or control. Knowledge and beliefs about
      osteoporosis were assessed at baseline and at one week and three weeks following the
      intervention using the Multiple Osteoporosis Prevention Survey. Knowledge was defined as the
      ability to identify correctly osteoporosis risk factors. Beliefs were measured with the use
      of a five point Likert type scale. The educational program was comprised of a lecture and
      printed materials developed by the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Chi-square and analysis
      of variance evaluated for between group differences. Alpha was set at 0.05.
