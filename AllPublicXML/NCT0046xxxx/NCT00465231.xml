  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study is about providing a better birthing experience by placing and initiating epidural
      for labour pain before the contractions start. This concept of prevention of pain before its
      onset is known as preventive - or preemptive -pain management and is well known in surgical
      and anaesthetic practice. We believe that the use of preventive epidural analgesia will
      improve the quality of labour epidurals, increase maternal satisfaction and reduce the stress
      response to labour and delivery.

    <textblock>
      Labour induces a well-documented stress response in both mother and fetus. Pain, anxiety and
      stress associated with labour result in the activation of the sympathetic nervous system,
      which increases plasma catecholamine concentrations with a resultant increase in cardiac
      output, peripheral vascular resistance and eventually, reduction in utero-placental
      perfusion. One aspect that has not been addressed in the literature is the role of preventive
      analgesia in labour. We believe that the use of preventive epidural analgesia will improve
      the quality of labour pain, increase maternal satisfaction and reduce the stress response in
      labour.

      The multiparous parturients that are scheduled for elective inductions of labour will be
      offered preventive epidural analgesia. Upon placing the epidural, patients will receive, in a
      double blind fashion, one of two possible epidural drug regimens, which are a saline placebo
      or 0.0625% bupivacaine with 2 micrograms of fentanyl per millilitre. The patient then
      undergoes routine induction and management of labour. At any point after induction of labour,
      patients in either group can request analgesia. Upon request for analgesia the standard
      epidural loading dose and infusion with PCEA is initiated. The primary outcome will be the
      success of analgesia (Verbal Analogue Scale of 3 or less) during the first stage of labor,
      from first request of epidural analgesia to full dilatation.
