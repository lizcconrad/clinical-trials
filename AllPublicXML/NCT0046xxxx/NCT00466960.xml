      RATIONALE: Colony stimulating factors, such as sargramostim (GM-CSF), may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing and may also increase the
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and help the immune system
      recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving GM-CSF
      together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation may be an effective
      treatment for ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving GM-CSF together with paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation works in treating patients with advanced ovarian
      cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that did not respond to previous
      chemotherapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether chronic GM-CSF administration during and after cytotoxic chemotherapy
      with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation can induce a longer remission
      than experienced in the most recent platinum-containing regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the extent to which chronic GM-CSF administration can increase the number of
      activated monocytes in patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

      II. To determine the extent to which chronic GM-CSF administration can increase the number
      and activation state of peripheral circulating antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic
      cells and activated monocytes, in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.

      III. To determine the extent to which chronic GM-CSF administration can increase the number
      and functional status of T cells that recognize tumor specific antigens in patients with
      advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

      IV. To determine the extent to which chronic GM-CSF administration can increase the number
      and functional status of antigen specific T cells that recognize foreign pathogens in
      patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive GM-CSF subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 16-26.
      Patients also receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously
      (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4-6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 14 days after last GM-CSF injection, patients receive GM-CSF
      SC once daily on days 1-15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months and then
      every 3 months thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically proven epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary
             peritoneal malignancies, excluding tumors of low malignant potential (borderline)

          -  Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous
             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell
             carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified

          -  Patients must have either primary platinum refractory or resistant carcinoma or
             secondary platinum resistant disease:

               1. Primary platinum refractory disease is defined as progression of disease on
                  initial platinum-based chemotherapy or persistent disease at the conclusion of
                  the initial platinum-based chemotherapy course associated with the primary
                  debulking surgery.

               2. Primary platinum resistant disease is defined as recurrence of carcinoma within 6
                  months (+ 14 days) of completion of initial platinum-based chemotherapy
                  associated with the primary debulking surgery. (The 14 day window is to allow
                  study entry for those patients where evidence clearly suggests that had an
                  assessment been made early the patient would have met the 6 month time line. This
                  will be determined by the study principal investigator [P.I.])

               3. Secondary platinum resistant disease is defined as meeting any one of the listed
                  criteria during or following a subsequent platinum containing regimen.

          -  Patients must have an elevated serum cancer antigen (CA)125 on two occasions greater
             than 7 days apart

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1500/uL

             radiation therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has an allergic history to paclitaxel or GM-CSF, not manageable by
             pre-medication and/or slow drug infusion
