      The main aim of this study is to determine if persons can increase fruit and vegetable
      intakes if they make a specific plan to do so.

      The conduct of cancer prevention trials through community settings and/or national networks
      of clinical sites requires the development of appropriate interventions. One promising
      behavioral strategy that is very simple to administer is that of the formulation of
      implementation intentions. The premise of this intervention is that once persons formulate a
      plan of action, automatic behavior follows. Use of this intervention in primary care is an
      innovative approach to eliciting preventive behaviors with minimal staff time. The goal in
      this study will be to increase fruit and vegetable consumption by 2 servings/day without a
      change in overall energy intakes by decreasing consumption of a less nutritious food.
      Substitution of foods is critical for prevention of weight gain. This feasibility study aims
      conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial to test whether formulation of implementation
      intentions, either alone or with telephone support, can increase fruit and vegetable
      consumption without an increase in overall energy intakes. Recruitment success in a family
      medicine clinic in Ypsilanti Michigan will be documented with emphasis on the extent of
      minority participation. Dietary assessment will be the main outcome variable. Other
      assessments will include demographics, self-assessment of behaviors targeted by the
      intervention and levels of carotenoids in plasma. We will enroll 105 subjects to retain
      28/arm, and power is good to detect small differences in fruit and vegetable intakes among
      the three study arms. This will generate useful data for the design of larger dietary
      intervention trials that are cost-effective and which will utilize multiple clinical sites to
      optimize enrollment.
