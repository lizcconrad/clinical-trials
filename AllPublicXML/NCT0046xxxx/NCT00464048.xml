  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will evaluate the effect of a short-term aerobic exercise program as an adjuvant treatment
      in patients with depression undergoing standard clinical antidepressant medication therapy as
      compared to the effect of stretching exercise. In addition, the effect of exercise on plasma
      biological markers will be examined and observed changes correlated with clinical
      antidepressant effects. We hypothesize that the aerobic exercise group will achieve a
      significantly higher response rates of depressive symptoms, will also have a greater degree
      of change in the plasma markers, than the control stretching group.

      The patients will be randomly assigned to 3 weeks of augmentation therapy (in addition to the
      antidepressant medication, which will be continued) with either: 1) aerobic exercise or 2)
      stretching exercise (control group). Random assignment to each group will be stratified
      according to previous response to treatment as determined by a psychiatrist and review of the
      Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) and by gender.

      Severity of depression will be rated at the first baseline visit and every week during the
      exercise program using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D 21 items), Clinical Global
      Impression Scale (CGI) (observer-rated) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Visual Analog
      Scale (self-rated).

      Blood samples will be obtained four times during the study - before and after the first
      exercise session and before and after the last exercise session. The blood taken before the
      exercise sessions will be used to assay thyroxine, cortisol, insulin, opioid peptides and
      cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-Î± in the plasma. The blood taken after the exercise sessions
      will be used to re-examine variables expected to be altered immediately after exercise such
      as cortisol, opioid peptides, catecholamines and cytokines.
