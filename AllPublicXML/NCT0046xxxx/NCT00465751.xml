      The purpose of this study is to determine whether chenodeoxycholic acid decreases de novo
      hepatic lipogenesis, hepatic fat content, hepatic triglyceride production and plasma
      triglyceride concentrations and improves hepatic glucose metabolism in patients with the
      metabolic syndrome, Familial Hypertriglyceridemia and Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia.

      Insulin resistance has been found to be the key pathophysiological factor of the metabolic
      syndrome and may precede the onset of impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and dyslipidemia.
      Recently, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has been identified as another feature of
      this syndrome. Importantly, a close relation between liver fat content and hepatic insulin
      sensitivity has been described. We hypothesize that activation of FXR with chenodeoxycholic
      acid decreases hepatic de novo lipogenesis and subsequently hepatic fat content and
      triglyceride production. The decrease in liver fat content will be associated with improved
      hepatic insulin sensitivity and a decrease in hepatic glucose production.

      Patients diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, familial hypertriglyceridemia or familial
      combined hyperlipidemia will be recruited from the the outpatients department of the Division
      of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Clinical Nutrition, University Hospital Basel. Eligible
      patients will be admitted to the CRC for metabolic studies, including baseline blood samples
      for the measurement of hormones, cytokines and adipokines, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp
      studies for the assessment of glucose turnover and insulin sensitivity and in vivo NMR
      studies to determine intrahepatic and intramyocellular lipid content. Patients will
      alternatively receive chenodeoxycholic acid and placebo. The study population will be
      compared to a group of age, gender and weight matched normolipidemic controls.
