      Purpose of the study is the evaluation of the tolerability (both local and systemic) and the
      clinical efficacy (in terms oocytes recovered) of subcutaneously versus intramuscularly
      administered Merional® (IBSA, Lugano – CH) in patients undergoing controlled ovarian
      hyperstimulation (COH) in an ART programme (IVF).
