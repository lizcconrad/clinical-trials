      This study is executed to evaluate the outcome on quality of life, pain, sexuality, pregnancy
      rate and recurrence rate after a fertility sparing multidisciplinary CO2 laser laparoscopic
      radical excision of deep infiltrating colorectal endometriosis with a bowel resection.

      Patients

      All women (n=45) who had undergone fertility sparing CO2 laser laparoscopic radical excision
      of deep infiltrating endometriosis with bowel resection were selected retrospectively from
      the list of all patients (n=more than 500, of whom slightly more than 50% with endometriosis)
      operated at the Leuven University Fertility Centre (LUFc) between September 2004 and
      September 2006.

      Questionnaires

      All 45 patients were asked to complete the Oxford Endometriosis Quality of Life questionnaire
      (27), a sexual activity questionnaire (28), visual analogue scales (VAS) for dysmenorroe,
      chronic pelvic pain and deep dyspareunia, and to answer questions about medication and
      fertility, to compare their status before surgery and at the moment of the evaluation
      (December 2008).
