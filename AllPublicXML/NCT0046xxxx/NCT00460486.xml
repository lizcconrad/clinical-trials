      The objective of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of FSME-IMMUN 0.5
      ml in two age strata (stratum A: 16 to 49 years, stratum B: &gt; 50 years), with the first and
      second vaccinations being administered according to a rapid immunization schedule (12 ± 2
      days apart). The third vaccination will be administered approximately 6 months after the
      first dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects will be eligible for participation in this study if they:

          -  Are aged &gt;= 16 years (from the 16th birthday) at screening;

          -  Are clinically healthy, (i.e. the physician would have no reservations vaccinating
             with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml outside the scope of a clinical trial);

          -  Have a negative pregnancy test result at the first medical examination (if female and
             capable of bearing children);

          -  Agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study (if
             female and capable of bearing children);

          -  Agree to keep a Subject Diary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they:

          -  Have a history of any previous tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination;

          -  Have a history of TBE infection;

          -  Have a history of infection with or vaccination against other flaviviruses (e.g.
             dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese B-encephalitis);

          -  Have a history of allergic reactions, in particular to one of the components of the
             vaccine;

          -  Suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment
             (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence immunological
             functions;

          -  Have a known or suspected problem with drug or alcohol abuse (&gt; 4 liters wine / week
             or equivalent level of other alcoholic beverages);

          -  Have donated blood or plasma within 30 days of study entry;

          -  Have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 30 days of study entry;

          -  Are known to be HIV positive (an HIV test is not required specifically for the purpose
             of this study);

          -  Are simultaneously participating in another clinical trial including administration of
             an investigational product;

          -  Have participated in any other clinical study within six weeks prior to study entry;

          -  Are pregnant or breastfeeding (if female);

          -  Are a member of the team conducting this study or are in a dependent relationship with
             the study investigator. Dependent relationships include close relatives (i.e.,
             children, partner/spouse, siblings, parents) as well as employees of the investigator.

          -  Have received any other vaccination within two weeks prior to study entry.
