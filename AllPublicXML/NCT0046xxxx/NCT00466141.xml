      This study will focus on maintenance of weight loss achieved in the 2007 Shape-Up Rhode
      Island(SURI)program. We plan to recruit 180 individuals who participated in SURI and lost at
      least 10 pounds to take part in a 4-month weight loss maintenance program when the SURI ends.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Education, Increased Exercise,
      or Daily Self-Weighing.
