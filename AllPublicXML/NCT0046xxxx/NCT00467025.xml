      This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study to
      estimate the improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of AMG 386 in combination with sorafenib in the treatment of subjects with
      advanced clear cell carcinoma of the kidney.
