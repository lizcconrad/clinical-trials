  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By integrating a miniaturized pulse oximetry sensor into the frame of oxygen delivery glasses
      which dissimulates the nasal cannula, the investigators hope to optimize and long term oxygen
      therapy (LTOT) regarding medical and social aspects. The validation of the novel SpO2 sensor
      is the first step in the concept of personalized, dynamic delivery of oxygen by eyeglasses
      using a closed-loop system.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine accuracy of SpO2 measurements by the novel sensor compared to 2 reference
           pulse oximeters in healthy subjects undergoing a normobaric hypoxic challenge provoking
           SpO2 desaturation.

        2. To determine accuracy of SpO2 measurements by the novel sensor compared to 2 reference
           pulse oximeters and to arterial blood gas analysis in patients qualifying for LTOT,
           breathing room air at rest (lying, sitting, standing position) and during exercise (slow
           walking, 6-MWT, ergometer cycle).

    <description>Assessment of the accuracy of the novel pulse oximeter sensor in patients qualifying for LTOT over the entire saturation range by calculating accuracy root mean square (ARMS). Continuous SpO2 measurement of the novel pulse oximeter will be compared to measurements assessed by 2 standard pulse oximeters and arterial blood gas analysis.</description>

    <description>Assessment of accuracy of the novel pulse oximeter sensor in healthy subjects undergoing a normobaric hypoxic challenge provoking SpO2 desaturation. SpO2 will be measured continuously over the hole procedure and SpO2 range by the novel pulse oximeter sensor and the 2 reference pulse oximeters.</description>
