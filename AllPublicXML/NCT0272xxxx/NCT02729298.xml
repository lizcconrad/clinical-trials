  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TP-0903 is a novel oral inhibitor that targets AXL kinase and reverses the mesenchymal
      phenotype associated with advanced cancers. Preclinical studies have shown promising
      antitumor activity of TP-0903 as a single agent against a variety of tumor types in both in
      vitro and in vivo studies.

      This first-in-human Phase 1a study is conducted to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of TP-0903 administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors and to identify the
      safety profile and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of TP-0903. Once the MTD has been
      established, additional patients with specific tumor types (advanced solid tumors that have
      progressed despite immunotherapy*, EGFR+ Non Small Cell Lung Cancer [NSCLC] and have
      progressed on â‰¤2 lines of oral TKIs*, BRAF-, KRAS-, or NRAS-mutated Colorectal Carcinoma
      [CRC] for whom there is no standard therapy remaining, persistent/recurrent Ovarian Cancer
      who would be platinum refractory/ resistant and have had any number of lines of prior
      therapy, and BRAF-mutated Melanoma that has not responded to immunotherapy or a combination
      BRAF/MEK inhibitor) will be enrolled at the MTD in the Phase 1b study. Data collected from
      patients enrolled in each of these additional cohorts will be used for to confirm safety,
      explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of activity when TP-0903 is
      administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or given in combination with
      immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

      *Patients with immunotherapy-resistant tumors or EGFR+ NSCLC who are enrolled in these
      expansion cohorts will continue treatment with their previous immunotherapy or TKI regimens,
      respectively, and add TP-0903. The rationale is based on preclinical data that has shown that
      the combination is superior in patients who have progressed on prior immunotherapy or a TKI.

      The study will investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary
      anti-tumor activity profiles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1a / 1b, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study of TP-0903 administered once daily for the first
      21 out of 28 days.

      There are 2 phases in this study. In Phase 1a (dose escalation), sequential cohorts of three
      (3) patients will be treated with escalated doses until the MTD is established. In the
      absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose will be increased using a modified
      Fibonacci dose escalation scheme.

      Once the MTD has been established, dosing will change from BSA-dependent to a flat dose based
      on the average of the dose administered in the MTD expansion safety cohort. Once the MTD has
      been established, in Ph 1b (expansion), 5 additional cohorts of up to 20 patients each with
      specific tumor types (up to 100 additional patients total) may be enrolled at the MTD dose
      level to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of
      activity when TP-0903 is administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or
      given in combination with immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Ten patients in
      each of these 5 Expansion Cohorts will be required to consent to undergo pre- and post-dose
      tumor biopsies. All patients who undergo these biopsies will comprise the 'Biopsy Cohorts'
      (Phase 1b).

      Patients who successfully complete a 4-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant
      treatment-related toxicity or progressive disease will be permitted to continue to receive
      treatment with the same dose and dosing schedule.
