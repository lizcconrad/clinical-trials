    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of laparoscopic surgery in patients diagnosed with
      colorectal liver metastases. Half of participants will be operated on by laparoscopic
      approach and the results obtained will be compared with the results from the other half of
      patients operated on by open approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of liver surgery in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases are
      well established for the open approach. It allows good results in terms of complications,
      disease free survival and overall survival, and for these reasons it has become the gold
      standard technique in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases.

      On the contrary, the role of laparoscopic liver resection in this context is not so clear
      nowadays. Generally, laparoscopic surgery offers some advantages such as less pain, shorter
      hospital stay and better aesthetic results. But the use of laparoscopic approach in liver
      surgery is still discussing: two international consensus conferences have been held and no
      strong conclusions have been made. Furthermore for colorectal liver metastases no randomized
      trials, comparing both techniques, have been published until now.

      To assess the feasibility of laparoscopic liver resection for colorectal metastases, the
      investigators propose this trial in which the patients suitable for laparoscopic approach are
      randomized to open or laparoscopic group
