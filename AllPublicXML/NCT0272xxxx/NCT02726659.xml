  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      of celecoxib as an add-on treatment to the mood stabilizer among women with bipolar I or II
      postpartum depression. Women who are taking a mood stabilizer for treatment of bipolar
      disorder in the postpartum treatment will receive either a placebo or celecoxib add-on
      treatment. Patients will be monitored regularly to assess psychiatric symptoms and side
      effects. The investigators aim to evaluate the potential antidepressant effect of celecoxib
      in bipolar postpartum depression.
