  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II study which were to enroll 112 newly
      diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma patients in a 1:1 fashion. Patients were to enroll at
      approximately 20 centers in the United States.

      Patients were to undergo stem cell mobilization with plerixafor plus Granulocyte Colony
      Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), according to investigator discretion, after 4 cycles of induction
      therapy. Study treatment interruption for stem cell collection were not to exceed 30 days.
      All patients were to receive one additional cycle of study treatment after stem cell
      collection and then proceed to autologous transplant using melphalan 200mg/m2(140mg/m2 for
      patients &gt; 70 years), as conditioning.

      After Autologus Stem Cell Transplant( ASCT), patients still on study were to initiate
      maintenance therapy within the 60-120 day period following ASCT, provided they have adequate
      blood count and clinical recovery. Patients in the RVD arm were to initiate maintenance
      therapy with lenalidomide alone, and patients in RVD-panobinostat arm were to receive
      lenalidomide + panobinostat maintenance. Lenalidomide were to be dosed orally at 10mg/day
      continuously in both arms, increasing to 15mg/day after the first 84 day cycle. Panobinostat
      were to be dosed at 10mg three times a week, every other week. Total planned duration of
      maintenance therapy were to be 3 years.

      Patients were to remain on study treatment until they complete the maintenance phase, or
      until they experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or at the discretion of the
      Investigator.
