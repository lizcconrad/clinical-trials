    <textblock>
      Background. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (E.R.A.S.) programs are now widely accepted in
      colonic laparoscopic resections because of faster recovery and less perioperative
      complications.

      Objective. Aim of this study is to assess safety and feasibility of discharging patients
      operated on by laparoscopic colectomy on Post Operative Day 2 (POD 2), so long as the first
      flatus has passed and in the absence of complication-related symptoms.

      Design &amp; Settings. Non-inferiority, open-label, single center, prospective, randomized study
      comparing &quot;Ultra&quot; to Classic E.R.A.S. with discharge on POD 2 and 4 respectively.

      Patients. 765 patients with resectable non metastatic colonic cancer were analyzed: 384
      patients were assigned to &quot;Ultra&quot; E.R.A.S. and 381 to Classic E.R.A.S.

      Main Outcome Measures. Demographics, clinico-pathological, ASA class and morbi-mortality,
      along with surgical complications, re-operation and readmission rate were recorded and
      compared. Primary end-point was mortality; secondary end-points were morbidity, re-admission
      and re-operation rate.

      Limitations. It is a single center experience; it is not double-blind, with the intrinsic
      risk of intentional or unconscious bias; exclusion criteria because of &quot;non compliance&quot; may
      be considered arbitrary.

      From January 2008 to September 2015, 765 patients were prospectively randomized for early
      discharge after laparoscopic colectomy according to E.R.A.S. programs: after obtained
      informed consent, 384 patients were randomly assigned to the &quot;Ultra&quot; E.R.A.S. group and 381
      to Classic E.R.A.S. group.
