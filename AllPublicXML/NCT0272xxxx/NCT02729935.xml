    <textblock>
      Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is defined as an urge to void or discomfort in the
      supra-pubic region; reported postoperatively in patients who have had urinary catheterization
      intra-operatively. In the present study, the investigators evaluated Parecoxib (P) for
      preventing CRBD in patients undergoing catheterization after transurethral resection of
      bladder tumor (TURBT).

      Participants will be randomized into one of two study groups: Group P: 40 mg of intravenous
      parecoxib 30 min before surgery and Control Group C: an equal volume of saline.

      Lumber subarachnoid block was administered with 2 ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 2.5 Âµg
      Sufentanyl. Intra-operatively, urinary catherization was performed with a 16 Fr Foley's
      catheter, and the balloon was inflated with 10 ml distilled water. The CRBD was assessed at
      0, 1, 2, and 6 h after patient's arrival in the post-anaesthesia care unit. Severity of CRBD
      was graded as none, mild, moderate and severe.
