  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Correlation study between the data provided by two measurement systems, trans- pulmonary
      thermodilution and ClearSight © (non invasive), to determine the interest in routine use
      (cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume and blood pressure).

    <textblock>
      Since 2014, Edwards society has developed a completely non-invasive monitoring device for
      measurement of blood pressure and continuous cardiac output without inserting foreign
      intravascular bodies in the patient. Initially tested on healthy volunteers cardiac disease
      -free, the correlation with the other devices seems to be good. If this ClearSight © system
      show a relevant accuracy in measuring blood pressure and cardiac output with a specific ICU
      hospitalized population, it could justify its place in the therapeutic arsenal of monitoring
      in intensive care.

      This is a common care ,prospective observational single center study , concerning the results
      of blood pressure , cardiac output values and their variations.
