    <textblock>
      Participant is being asked to take part in this study because participant is going to have
      surgery that requires general anesthesia (in which participant is unconscious for the
      procedure).

      During surgery, anesthesiologists often place a supraglottic airway device (SGAD). An SGAD is
      a device that helps participant breathe and may help the anesthesiologist put a breathing
      tube in participant's airway while participant is asleep during surgery. There are many
      different kinds of SGADs that are readily available for use by anesthesiologists during
      surgery. The SGADs that are being studied are the Ambu Auragain and the Teleflex LMA
      Protector.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effectiveness of both devices.

      This is an investigational study. Both of the SGADs that are being used on this study are FDA
      approved and are frequently used for the surgery that participant is going to have. It is
      investigational to compare the 2 devices.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

  <detailed_description>

      Surgery:

      Participant will sign a separate consent form for surgery that describes the procedure and
      its risks. Participant will receive anesthesia through a catheter (sterile flexible tube) in
      one of participant's veins. During the procedure, participant's vital signs (heart rate,
      blood pressure, oxygen levels) will be monitored.

      Study Groups:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, demographic information (such as
      participant's age, sex, and race) will be collected.

      Participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This
      is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other
      group. Participant will have an equal (50/50) chance of being assigned to either group. One
      group will use the Ambu Auragain, and the other will use the Teleflex LMA Protector.

      Study Procedures:

      After general anesthesia is given and participant falls asleep, the anesthesiologist will
      place the SGAD. The study staff will measure how easy it is to place the SGAD and how long
      each different step of the placement takes. Correct placement of the SGAD will be checked
      using a device with a small camera to help the doctor see participant's airway on a screen. A
      gastric tube will be placed to measure the volume of air and content of the stomach.
      Additionally the study doctor may place a breathing tube using the SGAD to make sure air is
      moving in and out of participant's lungs.

      Participant will then be positioned and prepared for the surgery. The study staff will be
      collecting information from the time participant enters the operating room until the time
      participant leaves.

      Additionally, participant will be interviewed after participant's surgery in the recovery
      room once participant is awake. Participant will be asked about any pain or soreness
      participant has, as well as any difficulty breathing, swallowing, or talking. This interview
      may take up to 5 minutes. Participation in the study will be over after the interview.

    <time_frame>All participant assessments and observations (clinical data) completed and recorded during the 1st visit</time_frame>
    <description>Success defined as correct placement of SGAD. For the SGAD to be considered as placed correctly, the teeth of the patient should be between the teeth-marks indicated on the proximal end of the airway tube designed as a bite absorption area. Unsuccessful appearance of CO2 curve suggests incomplete placement of the SGAD, and the device will be removed completely and another insertion attempt should be performed while the recording of time continues. An insertion attempt is defined as, when the SGAD touches the patient's lips. Only three attempts shall be made for proper device placement.</description>

    <measure>Oropharyngeal Leak Pressure (OLP)</measure>
    <time_frame>All participant assessments and observations (clinical data) completed and recorded during the 1st visit</time_frame>
    <description>OLP measured by a portable, handheld manometer. The measurement of OLP will be performed, with an Ambu cuff pressure gauge, prior to surgical incision and at the end of surgery; this measurement will be performed by closing the adjustable pressure-limiting valve, with a fresh gas flow of 3 L/min, and noting the airway pressure at equilibrium. The maximum pressure allowed is 40 cmH2O. The epigastrium will not be auscultated when measuring leak pressure with the purpose of detecting any possible air entrainment into the stomach intraoperatively.</description>

    <description>Rate of successful intubation and ventilation by utilizing the SGAD as an intubation conduit guided by the Ambu® aScope™ 3 Slim. Success is defined as the insertion and placement of a SGAD on the first attempt. Success rates will be computed as proportions for each study arm. Qualitative Assessment scale of: 1:) Easy; 2:) Resistance, 3:) Difficult; and 4:) Unsuccessful.</description>

    <description>Gastric tube will be passed through gastric drainage channel, of either SGAD, until depth mark of 40-50 cm. Confirmation of gastric tube placement will be obtained by aspiration of 2 ml of gastric content and/or auscultation of inflated air at the epigastrium. An insertion attempt is defined as when tip of gastric tube touches proximal channel. Insertion failure is defined as inability to pass a gastric tube until appropriate depth mark, lack of confirmation of correct placement by auscultation, and inability to evacuate any gastric content.</description>
