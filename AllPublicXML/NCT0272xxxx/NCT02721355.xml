  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      H. pylori positive patient volunteers that passed the selection criteria are recruited and
      divided into a test and a control group. Both groups are treated with a current treatment
      regime (EAC: Esomeprazole 40 mg/day; Clarithromycin 1000 mg/day; Amoxicillin 2000 mg/day) but
      only the test group received IgY-containing food supplement as an adjunctive measure for 15
      days. The subjects are examined before and 4 weeks after the treatment initiation by Urea
      Breath Test (UBT) and gastro-endoscopy.
