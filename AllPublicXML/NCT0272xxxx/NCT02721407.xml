  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the feasibility and efficacy of
      anti-CD22:TCRz:4-1BB chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T (CAR-T) cells in treating
      recurrent patients with refractory or resistant lymphoma to anti-CD19:TCRz:CD28 CAR-T cells.
      Recently, cancer immunotherapy, treatments aiming to arm patients with immunity specifically
      against cancer cells, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Among the many
      emerging immunotherapeutic approaches, clinical trials utilizing CARs against B cell
      malignancies have demonstrated remarkable potential. CARs combine the variable region of an
      antibody with T-cell signaling moieties to confer T-cell activation with the targeting
      specificity of an antibody. Thus, CARs are not MHC-restricted so they are not vulnerable to
      MHC down regulation by tumors. However, defined by the recession of evaluable lesions, the
      persistence and efficacy of CAR-T cells are still restricted by the &quot;target&quot; selection.
      Previous clinical studies largely utilized CD19 for the in vivo targeting of CAR-T cells,
      which preferentially become refractory or resistant due to the heterogeneity of lymphoma.
      This clinical investigation is to test a hypothesis whether anti-CD22 CAR-T cells work more
      effective in lymphoma patients refractory or resistent to anti-CD19:TCRz:CD28 CAR-T cells.
