      This study plans to learn more about how age and weight impact appetite and food intake.
      Specifically, this study is being done to see whether age and obesity impact appetite and the
      brain's response to food. In this study the investigators will be evaluating how participants
      brains respond to food images as well as your food-related behaviors and hormones. The
      investigators will be comparing older individuals aged 65 to 85 years who are normal weight
      compared to those who are obese. The Investigators will then compare older aged individuals
      to younger adults aged 21 to 45 years.

      In a cross sectional design participants will be studied on one occasion after a 3-day diet
      run-in. On the study day they will present in the fasting state, have an intravenous catheter
      placed for blood draws and have baseline blood samples taken and appetite measures performed.
      Participants will then undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This will be
      followed by a breakfast meal. Blood and appetite measures will be performed every half hour
      for 3 hours. Repeat fMRI will be performed 30 minutes after the meal. After three hours
      participants will be offered a buffet style lunch and then will be done with the study visit.
