        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient who is capable of giving informed consent and complying with study procedures

          2. Patient who has Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease defined by the cardinal sign,
             bradykinesia, plus the presence of at least 1 of the following: resting tremor,
             rigidity, or impairment of postural reflexes, and without any other known or suspected
             cause of Parkinsonism

          3. Patient who is Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage less than or equal to 3

          4. Patient who is male or female aged greater than or equal to 18 years at Screening

          5. Patient who has a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of greater than or equal
             to 25

          6. Patient who has a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score (Part
             III) of greater than or equal to 10 but less then or equal to 30 at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient who has atypical Parkinson's syndrome(s) due to drugs (e.g., metoclopramide,
             flunarizine), metabolic neurogenetic disorders (e.g., Wilson's Disease), encephalitis,
             cerebrovascular disease, or degenerative disease (e.g., progressive Supranuclear
             Palsy)

          2. Patient who has a history of pallidotomy, thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, or
             fetal tissue transplant

          3. Patient who has dementia, active psychosis or hallucinations, or clinically
             significant depression

          4. Patient who has a lifetime history of suicide attempt (including an active attempt,
             interrupted attempt, or aborted attempt), or has suicidal ideation in the past 6
             months as indicated by a positive response (&quot;Yes&quot;) to either Question 4 or Question 5
             of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Screening

          5. Patient who has a history of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with a decrease of
             less than or equal to 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or great than or equal
             to 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure when changing from supine to standing position
             after having been at supine position for at least 5 minutes within 28 days prior to
             the Screening Visit, or SBP less than 105 mmHg at study entry, or reports clinical
             signs of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension within 28 days prior to the
             Screening Visit.

          6. Patient who is receiving therapy with a dopamine agonist either concurrently or has
             done so within 28 days prior to the Screening

          7. Patient who is receiving therapy with 1 of the following drugs either concurrently or
             within 28 days prior to screening: MAO-B inhibitors, DA releasing agents, DA
             modulating agent, DA antagonists, neuroleptics, or other medications that may interact
             with DA function.

          8. Patient who is currently receiving central nervous system active therapy (e.g.,
             sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics), unless the dose has been stable
             for at least 28 days prior to Screening Visit and is likely to remain stable for the
             duration of the study. Patients should not take those medications within 8 hours prior
             to clinical visits

          9. Patient who has a current diagnosis of epilepsy, has a history of seizures as an
             adult, has a history of stroke, or has had a transient ischemic attack within 1 year
             prior to Screening

         10. Patient who has a history of known intolerance/hypersensitivity to non-dopaminegic
             antiemetics, such as domperidone, ondansetron, tropisetron, and glycopyrrolate

         11. Patient who has any other clinically relevant hepatic, renal and cardiac dysfunction,
             or other medical condition or laboratory abnormality including abnormal plasma
             magnesium level, which would in the judgment of the investigator, interfere with the
             patient's ability to participate in the study

         12. Patient who has a history of significant skin hypersensitivity to adhesive or other
             transdermal preparations or recent unresolved contact Dermatitis
