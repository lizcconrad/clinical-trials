  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot randomized trial is to determine the effectiveness, feasibility,
      and acceptability of a mobile, semi-automated text message-based intervention (MILK) to
      prevent perceived low or insufficient milk supply (PIM) among mothers without prior
      breastfeeding experience. PIM is the leading cause of premature breastfeeding cessation, and
      prior work shows that it is often rooted in low breastfeeding self-efficacy and
      misconceptions about lactation physiology and trajectory. The MILK intervention is designed
      to address PIM, as well as other common breastfeeding problems via semi-automated text
      messages of prenatal and postpartum breastfeeding education and support. Messages are
      time-sensitive (e.g., specific to gestational age, time since delivery) and based on the
      Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy (Social Cognitive) Theory; they are also modeled from pilot work
      that investigated how first-time mothers view, manage and describe breastfeeding problems.
      Messages were vetted with clinical lactation experts, as well as pregnant and postpartum
      women with no other children.

      The MILK intervention will be trialed against a control intervention group, who will receive
      general perinatal education through the national Text4Baby system. The investigators will
      recruit approximately 186 healthy, pregnant women at 13-25 weeks gestation from Magee Women's
      Hospital clinics and outpatient sites. Women will be randomized via computer-generated simple
      randomization to the experimental or control intervention. Both groups will receive text
      messages 3-5 times per week from week 25 of pregnancy through week 8 postpartum. Measured
      outcomes of interest will include perceived breast milk supply, breastfeeding confidence,
      maternal anxiety, breastfeeding exclusivity, and breastfeeding duration. Data will be
      collected at baseline (13-25 gestational weeks), 34-36 gestational weeks, and at 1, 2, 4, and
      8 weeks postpartum via online survey or telephone call. To assess the potential longer-term
      impact of the intervention, breastfeeding continuation and exclusivity will be reassessed via
      telephone at 6 months postpartum. Between group and group x time differences in outcome
      measures will be examined graphically and via linear mixed modeling. To inform modifications
      to MILK, telephone interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants in each group
      to assess and compare intervention use, burdens and challenges, and suggested alterations (8
      weeks).

      The purpose of the MILK Trial is to examine and compare the effectiveness, feasibility, and
      acceptability of a semi-automated, text-based, theory-driven intervention (&quot;MILK&quot;
      intervention) to prevent perceived insufficient milk and its potential inter-related
      sequelae, including maternal anxiety and early breastfeeding cessation, among mothers without
      breastfeeding experience who intend to exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfeed.
      Specifically, the investigators will:

        1. Determine the effect of the MILK intervention on perceived insufficient milk supply
           (PIM) and related maternal psychological and behavioral sequelae.

           Compared to the control intervention group (&quot;Text4Baby&quot;), the investigators hypothesize
           that MILK participants will have a perception of greater breast milk volume/supply,
           higher self-reported breastfeeding confidence, lower anxiety scores, and longer duration
           of exclusive breastfeeding.

        2. Assess the feasibility of a semi-automated text-based PIM intervention (MILK) for
           mothers.

      The investigators will compare characteristics of women who are and who are not eligible for,
      chose to participate in, and complete this randomized pilot intervention study. The
      investigators will also conduct post-study individual interviews with mothers to determine
      how the interventions were used and perceived (e.g., burden, challenges).
