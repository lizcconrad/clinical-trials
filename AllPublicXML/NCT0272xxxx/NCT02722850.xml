  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this parallel group study, participants were randomized to either 1 of 3 conditions (a)
      fruit and vegetable consumption, (b) dietary fat and added sugars, or (c) physical activity.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary results of a
      3-month web-based lifestyle intervention 500 female cancer survivors.

      Specific aim 1: to determine the rates of recruitment, retention, attendance, satisfaction,
      adverse events, and barriers to participation in the proposed intervention.

      Specific aim 2: to determine whether a home-based intervention is associated with greater
      improvements in mean minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity, diet quality, body
      size, constructs of Social Cognitive Theory, and health-related quality of life than
      participants randomized to a sedentary behavior reduction condition.

    <description>PA CONDITION: The goal of the PA condition is to encourage participants to gradually increase moderate to vigorous PA to 150 minutes per week and to increase resistance training to a total of 15 minutes per day twice per week.</description>

    <description>DIET CONDITION: The goal of the dietary condition includes increasing intake of fruit and vegetable to 5-servings per day. The program also encourages participants to increase the consumption of colorful fruits and vegetables. The fat goals consist of reducing saturated fats to &lt;10% of total kilocalories per day, trans fats to &lt;3 grams per day, and added sugar to &lt;50 grams per day.</description>

    <description>ALIVE is an email-based platform designed to help participants increase their physical activity, increase fruit and vegetable consumption, and decrease their intake of saturated and trans fats and added sugars. This automated system contains content and tailoring that is delivered in the form of emails obtained directly from cancer patients. Additional information they will receive included: tips for achieving those goals, health information, and opportunities for interaction and engagement.</description>
