  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIÉ) is a unique, multimodal movement
      program for people with dementia (affected individuals) that is taught by trained instructors
      and combines physical, mental and social activities. The Paired PLIÉ Program is an adapted
      version designed for pairs of affected individuals and care partners. The goal of this study
      is to perform a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) with a delayed start design to examine the
      effects of the Paired PLIÉ Program on function and quality of life in affected individuals
      and care partners.

      Study participants are 60 pairs of individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia and their
      primary care partners who are randomly assigned to Group 1 (immediate start) or Group 2
      (delayed start). Pairs randomized to Group 1 participate together in the Paired PLIÉ program
      2 days/week for 12 weeks (24 classes total) while pairs randomized to Group 2 continue with
      their usual activities. Then Group 1 transitions into a maintenance phase, and Group 2
      participates in the Paired PLIÉ program 2 days/week for 12 weeks. Outcome data are collected
      in all study participants at baseline, mid-point and end-point so that we can examine the
      initial impact of the program as well as whether effects are maintained in Group 1. Outcome
      measures include cognitive function, physical performance, quality of life and caregiver
      well-being.

    <description>The Paired PLIÉ Program is a novel, multimodal, movement program that focuses on abilities that are well maintained in people with dementia, including training procedural ('muscle') memory for basic daily movements, in-the-moment mindful body awareness, and social engagement. Group classes are held with affected individuals, care partners and instructors together. A monthly home visit also is provided.</description>
