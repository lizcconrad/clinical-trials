  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether daily use of Duavee® is accepted and tolerated
      by peri- and post-menopausal women at moderate risk for development of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duavee® is tissue specific estrogen complex of bazedoxifene plus conjugated estrogen which is
      FDA approved for relief of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis in women with a
      uterus who have not been diagnosed with estrogen dependent neoplasia. The overall purpose of
      this research is to demonstrate in a preliminary fashion that despite reduction in menopausal
      symptoms, (Duavee®) does not increase and may decrease proliferation in benign breast tissue
      in a cohort of peri- or post-menopausal women at moderately increased risk for breast cancer.
      If this pilot shows rapid accrual, good retention, and lack of significant increase in the
      risk biomarker Ki-67 in benign breast tissue, a larger prevention trial is envisioned

    <description>Outcome will be based on three separate factors used collectively to determine feasibility of the study and consideration of a subsequent larger trial. These are accrual rate (ability to accrue target number of subjects in a timely manner), dropout rate (frequency of subjects who are compliant and complete the intervention) and change in Ki-67 (increase vs decrease in percent of cells stained positive in the majority of subjects). Should accrual be inadequate or too slow; or if retention is too low; then a decision would be made not to proceed to a larger trial. Also, if there is evidence of an increase in proliferation (Ki-67) then no further studies would be planned.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with vasomotor symptoms with a uterus who are postmenopausal or in late
             menopause transition

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;36 kg/m2

          -  Class I-III mammogram within 6 months of Random Periareolar Fine Needle Aspiration
             (RPFNA); If Class 0 or 4, must be resolved with additional procedures

          -  If previously on oral contraceptives or hormone replacement, off for 8 weeks or more
             prior to baseline RPFNA; the exception is low dose vaginal hormones

          -  Confirmed moderate risk of developing breast cancer

          -  RPFNA results within study defined range

          -  Kidney and liver function within study defined range

          -  Willing and able to comply with study related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous biopsy showing evidence of breast cancer

          -  Have a predisposition to or prior history of thromboembolism, deep venous thrombosis,
             pulmonary embolism, or stroke

          -  History of renal or liver disease

          -  Prior ovarian or endometrial cancer

          -  Stopped or started hormone replacement within 8 weeks

          -  Any other condition or intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the investigator
             makes the woman a poor candidate for RPFNA

          -  Currently taking or have taken specific medications in the past 6 months

          -  Participation on any chemoprevention trial within 6 months

          -  Current illness which would make potential participant unsuitable for enrollment
