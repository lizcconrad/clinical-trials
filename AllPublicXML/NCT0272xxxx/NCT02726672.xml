  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a training of the inspiratory muscles
      against resistance at home during 10 weeks in multiple sclerosis patients with a severe
      disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be informed about the study procedures during a follow-up consultation or an
      hospitalization in a Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine Unit. If they give their informed
      consent to participate in the study, an investigator will randomize them into one of the 2
      arms of the study. This study consists of 3 visits. The first visit (inclusion) is planned at
      day 0, the second visit 10 weeks later and the third 3 months after day 0. A patient who is
      randomized in the experimental arm will have to follow 10 weeks of rehabilitation of the
      inspiratory muscles at home between first and second visit. During this period, investigators
      will call these patients once a week to assess the compliance with the rehabilitation. The
      patients who have been randomized in the control group will not follow this rehabilitation
      program.
