  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of hypertension is increasing while the controlled rate is
      extremely low in China. A substantial percentage of participants with uncontrolled
      hypertension are correctable if potential associated factors are identified and corrected.
      Therefore, it is clinically relevant to investigate and identify these potential associated
      factors of uncontrolled hypertension so as to increase controlled rate and reduce
      hypertension-associated health and economic burdens in the future. Investigators plan to
      conduct a prospective registry study in a single-center to initially investigate the
      potential associated factors of uncontrolled hypertension in cardiovascular outpatient
      department. Furthermore, investigators plan to evaluate the effects of potential associated
      factors correction on hypertension controlled rate and cardiovascular outcomes.

    <description>Participants with uncontrolled hypertension (SBP and/or DBP &gt;=140 and/or 90 mm Hg) treating with 3 or more anti-hypertensive drugs (not necessarily including diuretic) in outpatient department will under assessment of hypertension controlled rate 1 month later after initial investigation of potential associated factors. Based on these findings, investigators will give instructions to participants how to correct those potential associated factors and follow-up participants via telephone or outpatient visit 1 month later to assess whether these corrections could help increase hypertension controlled rate. Participants will be required to record home blood pressure measurements every day, and average home SBP and DBP will be calculated 1 month later. If average home SBP/DBP &lt; 135/85 mm Hg then participants will be considered as controlled-case, otherwise uncontrolled case.</description>
