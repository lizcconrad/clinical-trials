  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotid plaque can lead to ischemic stroke. Treatment of asymptomatic carotid plaque, based
      on degree stenosis, is still controversial. Beyond the degree of stenosis, the composition of
      the plaque could reflect the vulnerability and the risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke.
      Identification of new predictive factor of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with
      carotid plaque could help to screen high risk patients and to guide the treatment. The aim of
      the study is to assess 18F-sodium fluoride uptake among carotid plaque in recently
      symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Investigators conduct a pilot case-control study.
      Twelve patients (6 recently symptomatic and 6 asymptomatic) with carotid stenosis (≥50%
      NASCET) will have a 18F-sodium fluoride PET/MR. Standardized uptake value (SUV) and
      tissue-to-background ratio (TBR) will be measured among carotid plaques.
