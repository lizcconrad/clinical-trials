      This is an open label, neoadjuvant phase II study to evaluate the objective response,
      toxicity, and safety of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with newly diagnosed HER2-equivocal
      breast cancer. Trastuzumab emtansine at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg will be intravenously
      administered every 3 weeks for a total of 6 weeks. Patients who achieve a partial or complete
      response after the 6-week treatment (responders) will continue on trastuzumab emtansine for
      an additional 12 weeks.

      NATURE is an open label, neoadjuvant, phase II study designed to evaluate the objective
      response rate of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with newly diagnosed HER2-equivocal breast
      cancer. Patients will receive trastuzumab emtansine at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg via intravenous
      infusion every 3 weeks for a total of 6 weeks (2 21-day cycles). Patients who achieve partial
      or complete response (responders) after the 6-week treatment will continue on trastuzumab
      emtansine for an additional 12 weeks (4 cycles). The primary objective will be objective
      response rate after 6 weeks of neoadjuvant trastuzumab emtansine. Secondary objectives will
      include imaging response (ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) after six weeks of
      neoadjuvant trastuzumab emtansine and toxicity and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine. After
      completion of continued trastuzumab emtansine treatment, pathological complete response rate
      of responders as a whole and according to estrogen receptor status will be explored. Markers
      related to the mechanism of action of trastuzumab emtansine (HER2 copy number in circulating
      tumor cells; tissue expression of PTEN, PI3K, and other potential candidate markers) will
      also be explored.

    <ipd_description>Data and materials on human subjects will be shared with other eligible investigators through appropriate means in accordance with the NIH policy on Sharing Research Data (NIH Guide, February 26, 2003). Data will be also shared with the funding agency and regulatory agencies as required. Data will be shared with other investigators within the limits of HIPAA and other patient confidentiality requirements. This will generally require removal of all patient identifiers for all source documents and the use of arbitrarily assigned one-way identifiers. In some cases, requestors will be asked to sign a formal data sharing agreement that will provide for a commitment to use data only for research purposes and not to identify individuals, keep the data secure, and destroy or return data after analyses are complete. Prior approval will be obtained from collaborating investigators, research sponsors, and/or other stake-holders before sharing if proprietary information or products are involved.</ipd_description>
