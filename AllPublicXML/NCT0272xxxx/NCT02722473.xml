  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is at present a major cause of mortality as well as a cause of disability for
      the surviving victims.In Europe, every year counts as 300,000 cardiac arrests responsible for
      250,000 deaths. Thus, less than 20 % of patients discharged home with impaired quality of
      life associated with symptoms of tiredness, stress, anxiety. The prognosis is related to the
      initial cardiac rhythm present during the initiation of resuscitation. Recent progress in the
      improvement of mortality and neurological outcome has been achieved over the last decade
      thanks to the systematic implementation of a period of targeted temperature control between
      32 and 34 ° C in patients who benefited from the realization of at least one electrical
      external shock.

      There are theoretical and clinical arguments to think that achieving the same way a period of
      targeted temperature control between 32 and 34 ° C in patients treated for cardiac arrest
      with a non- shockable rhythm on arrival can also benefit from this procedure. However other
      arguments are against this hypothesis including an increase in the risk of infection ,
      worsening of the patient's hemodynamic status with no benefit to him. To answer this
      question, we conduce a randomized multicenter study testing the potential improvement of
      neurological outcome through this procedure targeted temperature control between 32.5 and
      33.5 ° C in these patients.

      NSE-Ancillary Study of HYPERION Trial will determine impact on neurospecific enolase (brain
      biomarker) of two temperature target for targeted temperature management (33°C or 37°C) after
      cardiac arrest in non-shockable rhythm.

             therapy initiation is used.

          -  Patient must be randomized in a center which participate in the ancillary study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No-flow time &gt;10 min (time from collapse to initiation of external cardiac massage);

          -  Low-flow time &gt;60 min (time from initiation of external cardiac massage to return of
             spontaneous circulation).

          -  Major hemodynamic instability (defined as a continuous epinephrine or norepinephrine
             infusion at a flow rate &gt;1 μg/Kg/min)

          -  Time from cardiac arrest to study inclusion &gt;300 min
