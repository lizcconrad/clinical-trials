  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3179106 is a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of RET kinase which has been
      designed to be a safe and effective therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients .

      This is a randomized, double-blind (sponsor unblind), placebo-controlled, dose escalating,
      four period, single-dose crossover, first time in human study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK3179106 in normal healthy subjects.

      The study will be composed of 2 cohorts, each having screening (21 days prior to first dose
      of study drug), Treatment, and follow-up periods (7-10 days after their last dose [Day 1 of
      dosing period 4]). The Treatment period will include 4 dosing periods. Subjects will
      participate in either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. The total duration of the study for each subject
      will be approximately 10 weeks. A sufficient number of healthy subjects will be screened to
      enrol 16 subjects who complete the planned study procedures. Each dosing period will be
      staggered so that only 2 of the 8 subjects will be administered study drug initially. Once 24
      hours (h) have elapsed, and provided there are no safety concerns, the remainder of subjects
      scheduled for that dosing period may be dosed. A review of safety and tolerability will occur
      prior to administration of the next dose level. This same procedure will be followed for each
      escalating dosing period. Subjects assigned to Cohort 1 will participate in 1 placebo and 3
      dose escalating periods. Subjects assigned to Cohort 2 will participate in up to 4 dosing
      periods which include up to 2 escalating doses and placebo in Periods 1 and 2, and a pilot
      food effect in Periods 3 and 4. Within each cohort, subjects will return for their next
      scheduled dosing period approximately 14 days after administration of the study drug during
      the prior dosing period. Cohort 2 will proceed after completion of the treatment periods in
      Cohort 1. Each subject will be enrolled in only one cohort. The planned dose range is 10
      milligram (mg) to 200 mg in Cohort 1. The actual doses to be administered may be adjusted
      based on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data at previous dose levels; these dose
      adjustments may involve either an increase or a decrease in the planned dose for both Cohorts
      1 and 2. There are no formal hypotheses being tested in this study.

             consultation with the medical monitor, agree and document that the finding is unlikely
             to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  History of regular bowel habits.

          -  Male or Female Males: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential
             must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose

             dose of study medication.

               1. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia.

               2. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below:

        vaginal ring.

        This is an all-inclusive list of those methods that meet the following GlaxoSmithKline
        (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1 percentage (%)
        per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the
        product label. For non-product methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines
        what is consistent and correct use.

        The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use
        these methods of contraception.

        Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-reproductive
        potential defined as: Pre-menopausal females with one of the following:

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including
             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication for each dosing period until Day 4
             of each dosing period, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety. Paracetamol (&lt;=2 grams per day) is acceptable.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than 4 investigational medicinal products within 12 months prior to
             the first dosing day

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.
