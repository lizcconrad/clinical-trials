  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oocyte maturation requires a lot of energy, which is provided by the mitochondria via the
      synthesis of ATP. The majority of patients with advanced maternal age (AMA) have poor egg
      quality. One of the reasons depends on oxidative phosphorylation of Pyruvate to undergo
      maturation; on the contrary, the cells of the cumulus (CC) show great activity glycolytic so
      that these cells are able to provide ATP(adenosine triphosphate and energy substrates to the
      oocyte. The goal of this work is to analyze the mitochondrial function and energy production
      in oocyte donors compared with a group of women of advanced maternal age subject to a same
      ovarian stimulation Protocol

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Controls: Women between 18-35 years old who are oocyte donors and fulfill the
             requirements of the our program of oocyte donation according to the Spanish Law of
             Human Reproduction

          -  Cases: infertile women undergoing IVF due to advanced maternal age (&gt;38 years)

        Exclusion criteria:

        For controls: Women with antral follicle count &gt;20 or &lt;6 follicle per ovary or with
        pathologies which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the treatment of
        ovarian stimulation

          -  Severe hypersensitivity to drugs of similar structure

          -  In the case of associated pathologies which can be considered as exclusion criteria on
             the part of the researcher are endocrine disruption and multi-follicular ovaries with
             risk of OHSS (Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome)

          -  Be positive in serology for syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, gonorrhea, hepatitis B,
             hepatitis C and HIV and lack of personal history and family of hereditary diseases.
