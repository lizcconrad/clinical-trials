  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      of GSK1070806 in subjects undergoing renal transplantation. GSK1070806 is an anti-interleukin
      18 (IL18) monoclonal antibody, which binds to IL-18 and inhibits signaling through the IL-18
      receptor. Recipients of donor kidneys, retrieved after circulatory death of the donor, will
      be administered a single intravenous infusion of GSK1070806 to test whether inhibition of
      IL-18 can reduce the rate of Delayed Graft Function (DGF) and graft rejection. Subjects will
      be followed for 12 months post dose/transplant. Up to 40 adult subjects will be enrolled in
      this study.

             a risk to recipient, particularly if the infection was resistant or systemic,
             normothermic regional machine perfusion organ retrieval techniques were utilized,
             surgical damage to donor allograft during organ procurement

             therapy (ie monoclonal antibody) that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Substance abuse: has clinical evidence of current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence.

          -  Co enrollment: participating in another interventional study (participation in purely
