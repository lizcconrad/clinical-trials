    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. In this research the investigators are
      studying the combination of Atezolizumab with Bevacizumab. Participants will receive both
      vascular endothelial targeted therapy and immunotherapy.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Atezolizumab for Advanced
      Non-Clear Cell Kidney Cancer, but it has been approved for other uses.

      The FDA has approved Bevacizumab with Interferon (IFNα) as a treatment option for Advanced
      Kidney Cancer.
