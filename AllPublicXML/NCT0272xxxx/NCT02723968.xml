  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is a late cystic fibrosis (CF) associated comorbidity whose
      prevalence is increasing sharply lifelong. Guidelines for glucose metabolism (GM) monitoring
      relies on oral glucose tolerance test . However, this test is neither sensitive nor specific.

      The aim of this study is to compare sensitivity and specificity of different methods for GM
      monitoring in children and adolescents with CF.

      Continuous GM system (CGMS) will be used as the reference method. Results will be compared to
      those of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), intravenous glucose tolerance test (IGTT),
      homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-%IR) , homeostasis model
      assessment index of beta-cell function (HOMA-%B) and HbA1C dosage (glycated haemoglobin A1C).
      Patients will be classified into three groups according to CGMS: normal glucose tolerance,
      impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus.

    <description>At the first visit at day 1an OGTT will be performed then the CGMS is implanted. Capillary glycaemia will be taken four times a day to set up the CGMS. A second visit is scheduled at day 4, where the intravenous glucose tolerance test is performed as well as the HbA1C level.</description>
