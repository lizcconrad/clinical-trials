      Monitoring and quantification of reflux events in high risk critically ill inpatients and
      lower risk general medical/surgical inpatients, with comparison to relevant clinical
      variables.

      The investigators will conduct a pilot prospective cohort study of the incidence of reflux of
      gastric contents into the esophagus and the correlation with clinically evident aspiration
      events. The investigators will demonstrate that an esophageal multichannel pH/impedance probe
      can be used safely and effectively in an inpatient population to monitor reflux of acidic and
      non-acidic contents into the esophagus. The investigators will determine the frequency and
      severity of reflux events in a 24 hour period in two hospitalized patient populations:
      general medicine patients on the wards and critically ill patients in the intensive care
      unit. The investigators will then examine the relationship between the documented reflux
      events and clinically apparent aspiration events. The incidence of these silent reflux events
      in hospitalized patients is currently unclear.
