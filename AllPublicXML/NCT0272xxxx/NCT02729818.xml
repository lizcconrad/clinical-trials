  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microperimetry is a relatively new and extremely sensitive method of assessing visual
      function. It projects light stimuli onto a defined area of the retina to map retinal
      perceptual thresholds. Participants look at a focal point and press a button to indicate when
      they have seen a light stimulus. The stimuli vary in intensity to find the participant's
      visual sensitivity.

      Microperimetry is carried out in low light conditions. Before testing, participants must
      adapt to the low light conditions in a process called 'dark adaptation.' Currently there is
      no consensus on the optimal time needed for dark adaptation. Investigators know that visual
      sensitivity differs in differing light conditions. Failing to sufficiently dark-adapt may
      therefore adversely affect test results.

      The aim of this study is to establish the optimal length of dark adaptation for
      microperimetry performance in healthy volunteers. On day 1, participants will undergo
      training field tests to reduce a learning effect affecting the results. Tests will then be
      performed following 5 mins adaptation, 10 mins adaptation and 30mins adaptation, On day 2,
      participants will perform testing following no adaptation time, 15 mins adaptation, and 20
      mins adaptation. Statistics will be used to determine the effect of adaptation time on
      average threshold measures.

        Forty healthy adult volunteers (over 18) will be recruited from the University of Oxford.
        They will need to have healthy eyes and good eyesight (better than 6/7.5 Snellen visual
        acuity), with no eye diseases apart from refractive error (needing to wear glasses or
        contact lenses). Participants will need to be able to sit upright at the microperimeter
        (which involves putting their chin on a chin rest and being able to sit still for up to 20
        minutes at a time), and be able to press a button to indicate when they have seen a light
        stimulus.
