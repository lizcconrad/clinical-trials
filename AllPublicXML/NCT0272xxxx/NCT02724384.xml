          3. Dermatophyte infection or infection with C. Albicans in the target great toenail
             confirmed by identification of a dermatophyte organism in culture;

          4. Subject must have at least 3 mm from the proximal end of the target toenail free of
             infection;

          5. Subject must have a target toenail that is assessed as capable of growing
             approximately 1 mm/month, (e.g., the subject needs to report cutting his or her
             toenails at least once per month);

             medically prescribed intrauterine device, oral or systemic hormonal contraceptive
             (plus an additional reliable barrier method), and surgical sterilization (e.g.,
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation);

          9. Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test

          3. Subject with one or more of the following conditions on the primary target toenail:

               1. white superficial onychomycosis

               2. dermatophytoma or &quot;yellow spike/streak&quot;

             other abnormalities that could result in a clinically abnormal nail;

          5. Subject with peripheral vascular disease or peripheral circulatory impairment;

          6. Subject with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, subjects with diabetes controlled by
             insulin or with known diabetic peripheral neuropathy

          7. Subject with any known immunodeficiency;

          8. Any pacemakers, or any metallic implants or prostheses in the vicinity of the
             treatment site (such as ankle, foot, etc.);

          9. Subject with any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the
             condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with

         10. Subject who has received systemic antifungal therapy within 6 months (except single
             diflucan tablet for vaginal candida) or topical antifungal therapy applied to the foot
             or toenails within 1 month of study entry;

         11. Subject who has received radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunosuppressive
             drugs within 6 months of study, and/or oral corticosteroids for &gt;1 month within the 6
             months of study (exception: inhaled steroids);

         13. Subject who is unwilling to abstain from any cosmetic nail or foot treatments outside
             those provided by the study clinic, beyond basic nail trimming (i.e. no spa foot
