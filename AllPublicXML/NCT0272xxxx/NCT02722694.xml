  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of abatacept 125mg
      administrated SC weekly comparing to placebo after 24 weeks treatment in Chinese subjects who
      have active rheumatoid arthritis, are receiving methotrexate and experiencing an inadequate
      response to methotrexate. This will be estimated by the proportion of subjects meeting the
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for 20% improvement (ACR20).

    <time_frame>Day 169</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR 20 definition of improvement is a 20% improvement from baseline in the number of tender and swollen joints, and a 20% improvement from baseline in 3 of the remaining 5 core set measures: participant global assessment of pain, participant global assessment of disease activity, physician global assessment of disease activity, participant assessment of physical function and acute phase reactant value (C-reactive protein).</description>

    <measure>The proportion of subject meeting Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) improvement at 24 weeks (Day 169)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 169</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ questionnaire includes 20 questions to assess physical function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. The domain questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do. A disability index was calculated by summing the worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered. Clinically meaningful HAQ-DI response=an improvement of at least 0.3 units from baseline in HAQ-DI.</description>

    <description>The ACR 50 definition of improvement is a 50% improvement from baseline in the number of tender and swollen joint counts, and a 50% improvement from baseline in 3 of the remaining 5 core set measures: participant global assessment of pain, participant global assessment of disease activity, physician global assessment of disease activity, participant assessment of physical function and acute phase reactant value (C-reactive protein).</description>

    <measure>The mean change of disease activity score from baseline by measuring DAS28-CRP at 24 weeks (Day 169)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 169</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 index measures disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and is a composite derived from the number of swollen/tender joints, laboratory tests of inflammation (C-reactive protein measured in mg/L), and participant assessment of global health (by marking a visual analog scale 100 mm line from &quot;very good&quot; to &quot;very bad&quot;). A higher DAS28 score indicates worse control of disease. High disease activity is &gt; 5.1, low disease activity is &lt; 3.2 and remission is &lt; 2.6.</description>
