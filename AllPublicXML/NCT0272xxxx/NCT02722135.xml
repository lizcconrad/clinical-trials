  <brief_title>A Study to Find a Safe Dose of Volasertib Given in Addition to Standard Salvage Chemotherapy in Children (Age 3 Months to Less Than 18 Years) With Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, in Whom Front-line Chemotherapy Failed</brief_title>
  <official_title>Open-label, Dose-escalating Trial to Evaluate the Tolerability, Toxicity, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Activity of Volasertib Added to the Standard Intensive Salvage Chemotherapy Regimen With Liposomal Daunorubicine, Fludarabine and Cytarabine (DNX-FLA) Followed by Fludarabine and Cytarabine (FLA) in Children From 3 Months to Less Than 18 Years of Age With Acute Myeloid Leukaemia After Failure of the Front-line Therapy</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating trial to evaluate the MTD and/or dose to be used for
      further development by evaluation of DLT in course 1 and the safety of volasertib when added
      to standard intensive salvage chemotherapy with DNX-FLA in paediatric patients with AML after
      failure of first-line therapy. Furthermore, data on efficacy and PK/PD of volasertib in
      paediatric patients with AML when added to standard intensive salvage chemotherapy will be
      collected.
