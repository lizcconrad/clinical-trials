  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early intervention and resuscitation based upon a lot of clinical, laboratory findings make a
      big difference regarding outcome in poly trauma patients, the study uses the dynamic lactate
      change and the difference between arterial and venous CO2, oxygen tension or content as
      indicators for tissue perfusion.

      Poly trauma patients have high incidence of mortality and morbidity in spite of improvements
      and advances in facilities. However, no doubt that early resuscitation and interventions make
      a big difference upon the overall outcome.

      A lot of methods, indices, laboratory and biomarkers have been utilized to evaluate the
      progress and quality of resuscitation and the early hospital interventions in such group of
      critically ill patients including central venous pressures, urine output, mixed venous oxygen
      saturation, and gastric tonometry. Most of recent means focus upon the regional tissue
      perfusion rather than global, however some researches have tried the difference between
      arterial and venous CO2,oxygen tension or content ( Pv -a co2&amp; Pa -v O2 ) in addition to
      dynamic changes in lactate(3) as predictors for tissue perfusion in sepsis patients after
      establishment of sepsis campaign (bundle).
