  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to evaluate (&quot;screen&quot;) a large number (12) of different dual
      therapies of perampanel + another AED (&quot;PMP+&quot;) for a large, 75-100% seizure frequency
      reduction. The design of the study will differ from usual AED studies. The study will be (i)
      open label, with (ii) a small n per group, n=6, with (iii) outcome measures a 'blockbuster
      effect': (a) â‰¥75 seizure frequency reduction; and (b) seizure freedom.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will compare rates of seizure freedom and &gt;75% seizure frequency reduction
      among 12 treatment arms consisting of 6 subjects each with refractory focal epilepsy treated
      with perampanel and one other AED (&quot;PMP+&quot;). Treatment arms will include (1) Perampanel
      +phenobarbital, (2) PMP+valproate, (3) PMP+ lamotrigine, (4) PMP + topiramate, (5) PMP +
      tiagabine, (6) PMP + levetiracetam, (7) PMP + zonisamide, (8) PMP + pregabalin, (9) PMP +
      lacosamide, (10) PMP+ clobazam, (11) PMP + ezogabine; and (12) PMP + eslicarbazepine. Each
      group of 6 will be followed for 12 weeks of baseline observation on baseline medication.
      Seizure frequency will be counted, using subjects' self-reported seizure diaries. PMP will be
      titrated to 8-12 mg/day, with the final dose determined by side effects and tolerability of
      PMP at 8-12 mg/day doses. Titration will occur at the rate of 2 mg/week or two weeks (in
      accordance with FDA labeling), as tolerated. Subjects will be observed for 12 weeks of
      maintenance treatment on the target PMP doses. Seizure frequency will be compared between the
      12 weeks of baseline observation and 12 weeks of maintenance treatment.
