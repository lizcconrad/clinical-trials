      The purpose of this study was to test whether a brief motivational intervention is associated
      with enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation programs help reduce morbidity and mortality following a cardiac
      event, but only a subset of referred patients chooses to participate. An intervention based
      on principles of motivational interviewing may help resolve individuals' ambivalence about
      cardiac rehabilitation. The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief motivational
      intervention (MI) for enhancing intention to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation compared to a
      usual care (UC) control condition among patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation. It is
      hypothesized that patients in the MI condition will report greater intention to enroll in
      cardiac rehabilitation compared to patients in UC. A small-scale feasibility trial will
      include patients (n = 100) with acute coronary syndrome who are referred to a standard
      12-week exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program in Calgary, Canada. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to MI or UC. The primary outcome will be self-reported intention to attend
      cardiac rehabilitation. Secondary outcomes will include beliefs about cardiac rehabilitation,
      exercise self-efficacy, perceived barriers, and cardiac rehabilitation enrollment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention to Attend Cardiac Rehabilitation Scale (adapted from Blanchard et al., 2002)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 1 day after receiving MI or UC but prior to enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (average 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Intention to attend cardiac rehabilitation will be assessed using the average of two self-report items: (1) &quot;My goal is to attend ___ exercise classes at cardiac rehabilitation&quot; with responses ranging from 1 (no exercise classes) to 7 (some exercise classes) and (2) &quot;I intend to attend scheduled classes during cardiac rehabilitation&quot; with responses ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac Rehabilitation Enrollment (attendance at â‰¥1 appointment; chart review)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days after initial referral to cardiac rehabilitation program</time_frame>
    <description>Participation in cardiac rehabilitation will be confirmed by chart review 60 days after referral. Non-enrollment will be defined as (a) explicitly declining interest in CR participation, (b) not attending the initial scheduled exercise appointment within 60 days of referral, or (c) inability to be contacted by program staff within 60 days of referral to cardiac rehabilitation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beliefs About Cardiac Rehabilitation Scale (BACR; Cooper et al., 2007)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 1 day after receiving MI or UC but prior to enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (average 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The BACR is a 13-item questionnaire that evaluates patients' beliefs regarding CR. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; Items are summed to provide a score on each of four subscales: perceived necessity, concerns about exercise, practical barriers, and perceived suitability.

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale (Rodgers et al., 2008)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 1 day after receiving MI or UC but prior to enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (average 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSES is a 9-item questionnaire that evaluates exercise self-efficacy in three domains: task (e.g., ability to follow directions to complete exercise), coping (e.g., ability to exercise when feeling discomfort from exercise), and scheduling (e.g. ability to fit exercise into daily routine). Items are rated from 0 (not at all confident) to 100 (completely confident), and averaged in each domain.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale (CRBS; Shanmugasegaram et al., 2012)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 1 day after receiving MI or UC but prior to enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (average 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The CRBS is a 21-item questionnaire designed to assess perceptions of patient, provider, and health system barriers to CR participation. Items are rated on 5-point Likert-type scales ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree,&quot; and are averaged to provide a total score, with higher scores indicating greater perceived barriers. Totals are also calculated for four subscales: perceived need/healthcare factors, logistical factors, work/time conflicts, and comorbidities/functional status.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>ENRICHD Social Support Instrument (ESSI; Mitchell et al., 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 1 day after receiving MI or UC but prior to enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (average 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The ESSI is a 7-item questionnaire designed to assess social support in patients post-myocardial infarction. Items are rated from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time), and are summed to provide a total score, with higher scores indicating more social support.

    <measure>Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (BIPQ; Broadbent et al., 2006)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 1 day after receiving MI or UC but prior to enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation (average 7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The BIPQ is an 8-item questionnaire that assesses cognitive and emotional representations of illness. It evaluates perceived consequences, timelines, personal/treatment control, symptoms, concern, understanding, and emotional consequences associated with the illness. Items are summed to provide a total score, with higher scores indicating greater perceived threat of the illness.
