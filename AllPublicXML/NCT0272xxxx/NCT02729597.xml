    <textblock>
      The natural history of brain affection in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 is still unknown.
      The investigators designed a 5-year longitudinal neuropsychological and neuroimaging
      follow-up study to address this issue. Myotonic dystrophy type 1, myotonic dystrophy type 2
      patients, and healthy controls were enrolled. All participants undergo clinical-neurological
      examinations, neuropsychological analyses according to a 13-item neuropsychological test
      battery, and 3T-brain MRI including voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging at
      baseline and at follow-up using identical examination protocols.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether brain affection in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 is due to
      neurodevelopmental defects, neurodegeneration, or both. An exact definition of the nature and
      dynamic of brain affection is of urgent need for the identification of clinical trial outcome
      parameters and the design of therapy compounds. The investigators planned a 5-year
      longitudinal study to examine the natural history of functional and structural brain
      affection. Myotonic dystrophy type 1, myotonic dystrophy type 2 patients, and healthy
      controls were enrolled. All participants undergo clinical-neurological examinations,
      neuropsychological analyses according to a 13-item neuropsychological test battery, and
      3T-brain MRI at baseline and at follow-up using identical examination protocols. The intended
      time span between baseline and follow-up examinations is 5 years minimum. To investigate gray
      and white matter affection, voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging are
      performed, and data are statistically analyzed including (i) group comparisons between
      patients and controls at baseline and follow-up, and (ii) group comparisons using difference
      maps to focus on isolated disease-related effects over time.
