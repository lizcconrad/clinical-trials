    <textblock>
      This phase 3, open label study will evaluate the safety of tenapanor 50 mg BID in subjects
      with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) defined by the ROME III
      criteria. Subjects who have completed either TEN-01-301 (16 weeks) or TEN-01-302 (26 weeks)
      studies may be enrolled. Subjects will take tenapanor for approximately 52-55 weeks total
      based on previous protocol and this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the treatment period of up to 39-weeks, subjects will return for study visits
      approximately every 13 weeks. Subjects will undergo safety assessments at these visits, which
      may include a physical exam, ECG, vital signs, and clinical labs. Adverse events and
      concomitant medications will be recorded. Medication compliance will be monitored and the
      subjects will be given additional study drug as appropriate.
