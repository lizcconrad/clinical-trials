      This research study is assessing the feasibility of reduced intensity allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a possible treatment for relapsed /
      refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the central nervous system (CNS). HSCT is the
      transplantation of stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or
      umbilical cord blood.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention (allogeneic stem cell transplantation) for this population (patients
      with CNS lymphoma), which is a type of stem cell transplantation.

      Historically, patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (NHL) have had high rates of disease relapse after initial therapy. Given these poor outcomes
      with conventional chemotherapy, more intense treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been explored, yet relapse remains an issue.
      For older patients, ASCT may not be feasible given the inability to tolerate high-doses of
      chemotherapy.

      In patients with systemic NHL who relapse after ASCT or cannot tolerate ASCT, yet are
      responsive to chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplant is often considered. Allogeneic
      transplantation is thought to work by giving the recipient an entirely new blood system from
      a donor. This new blood system includes a new immune system which can hopefully attack any
      lymphoma much like it would attack a bacterial or viral infection. Currently, this is one
      established standard of care for patients with lymphoma of the body who relapse after initial
      chemotherapy treatment. The investigators are testing if this treatment can be extended to
      patients with lymphoma of the central nervous system.

      The following chemotherapy drugs included in this study which will be administered:
      Fludarabine, Thiotepa, and Methotrexate. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has
      approved these chemotherapy agents individually as a treatment option for your disease. The
      combination has not been approved by the FDA. Thiotepa and Methotrexate have been shown to
      pass through the blood-brain barrier, a highly selective barrier that restricts many
      chemicals from entering the brain and spinal cord. Fludarabine is the backbone chemotherapy
      in all reduced intensity conditioning regimens.

                  demonstrating NHL.

               -  Ocular biopsy from retina, subretinal pigment epithelial space, or optic nerve,
                  or vitrectomy specimen, demonstrating NHL.

               -  Biopsy of mass lesion outside of the CNS, or blood or body fluid specimen,
                  documenting NHL, in conjunction with brain or spinal CT, PET/CT (positron
                  emission tomography / computed tomography), or MRI showing radiographic
                  abnormalities characteristic of CNS involvement with lymphoma.

               -  CSF cytology demonstrating a malignant clonal NHL population, consistent with
                  lymphomatous leptomeningitis, with or without a radiographically or
                  pathologically identifiable CNS or systemic mass lesion. Patients with CSF
                  (cerebral spinal fluid) studies negative for NHL by cytology but positive for a
                  monoclonal population by flow cytometry and/or molecular PCR (polymerase chain
                  reaction) studies may be eligible if they have radiographic evidence of a CNS
                  lymphoma or if they have symptoms clinically consistent with CNS lymphomatous
                  involvement; for such cases, please contact the protocol chair, Dr. Yi Bin Chen,
                  to discuss eligibility prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients must have experienced relapsed disease after high-dose chemotherapy with
             autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) OR have experienced relapse / progression
             on first-line high-dose methotrexate-based therapy and are not candidates for ASCT in
             the judgment of the treating physician. Discussion with the PI is encouraged for the
             latter scenario.

          -  All participants must demonstrate a partial or complete response (PR or CR) of their
             CNS and systemic disease to pre-enrollment therapy and must be in PR or CR at the time
             of enrollment. Acceptable therapies include systemic or intrathecal
             chemo/immunotherapy and/or radiotherapy as well as corticosteroids.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years as this study will be open at sites which treat adults.

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky score ≥
             60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Participants must have adequate organ function as defined below:

               -  Total serum bilirubin within normal institutional limits (unless patient has
                  Gilbert's syndrome, where then direct serum bilirubin should be within normal
                  institutional limits).

               -  AST (SGOT) / ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3× institutional upper limit of normal.

               -  Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits

                  --- OR

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine level
                  above institutional normal.

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40% measured either by echocardiogram or
                  nuclear cardiac scan.

               -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), FVC (forced vital capacity) and DLCO
                  all ≥ 50% of predicted (DLCO corrected for hemoglobin).

          -  Participants must have a well-matched adult donor willing to donate peripheral blood
             stem cells with well-matched defined as: 8/8 matched related or unrelated donor
             (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 by allele level).

          -  Because chemotherapy agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 12 months after the date of stem cell
             transplantation.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Eligibility Criteria for Donors

               -  Donors must be medically fit to donate peripheral blood stem cells through
                  standard G-CSF mobilization as assessed by institutional or unrelated marrow
                  registry standards.

               -  Donors will not have to sign a study specific informed consent to participate
                  given that donors will be undergoing standard G-CSF mobilization and
                  leukapheresis.

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the 1st
             day of conditioning chemotherapy.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to fludarabine, thiotepa or other agents used in study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because they are routinely
             ineligible to be treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.
