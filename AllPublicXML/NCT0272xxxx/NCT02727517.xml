  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the hypothesis that delayed compared to early umbilical cord clamping
      will improve neonatal transition in terms of circulation and breathing during resuscitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the time of birth, the infant is still attached to the placenta via the umbilical cord.
      The infant is usually separated from the placenta by clamping the cord with two clamps. Early
      cord clamping has been generally advised to be carried out in the first 30 seconds after
      birth, regardless of whether the cord pulsation has ceased. However, arguments against early
      cord clamping include the reduction in the amount of placental transfusion and any associated
      benefits of extra blood volume, as delayed clamping allows time for a transfer of the fetal
      blood in the placenta to the infant at the time of birth.

      The study will evaluate the effect of early versus delayed cord clamping in a low-income
      setting in children that do not spontaneously start to breathe. The randomized controlled
      trial will be carried out at Paropakar Maternity and Women's Hospital (PMWH) in Kathmandu.

      The trial will fill several important gaps in relation to early and delayed cord clamping and
      results.
