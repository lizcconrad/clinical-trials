  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) and normal ALT, who have been under treatment
      with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for at least 4 weeks, will be enrolled into this
      non-interventional, open-label study. The primary aim is to evaluate quality of life
      according to the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire, modified for the
      Greek population.

    <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 domains of functional health and wellbeing: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. The score for general health domain was an average of the individual question scores of this domain, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). Data was reported by status of gender (male and female) and drug addiction (yes and no).</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 domains of functional health and wellbeing: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. The score for general health domain was an average of the individual question scores of this domain, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). Data was reported by status of gender (male and female) and drug addiction (yes and no).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (up to 48 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population included all enrolled participants. Number of participants analyzed = participants with evaluable data. Participants evaluable for Gender = 76; participants evaluable for Drug Addiction = 75. Same participants could be evaluated under Gender and Drug Addiction.</population>

          <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 domains of functional health and wellbeing: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. The score for general health domain was an average of the individual question scores of this domain, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). Data was reported by status of gender (male and female) and drug addiction (yes and no).</description>
          <population>Analysis population included all enrolled participants. Number of participants analyzed = participants with evaluable data. Participants evaluable for Gender = 76; participants evaluable for Drug Addiction = 75. Same participants could be evaluated under Gender and Drug Addiction.</population>

        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 domains of functional health and wellbeing: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. The score for a domain was an average of the individual question scores, which were scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). Score from mental health, role emotional, social functioning, and vitality domains were averaged to calculate MCS. Total score range for MCS was 0-100 (100=highest level of mental functioning).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, EOT (up to 48 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population included all enrolled participants. Number of participants analyzed = participants with evaluable data. Participants evaluable for Gender = 76; participants evaluable for Drug Addiction = 75. Same participants could be evaluated under Gender and Drug Addiction.</population>
