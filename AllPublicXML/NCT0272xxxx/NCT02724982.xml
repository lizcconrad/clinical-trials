    <textblock>
      Body image satisfaction and self- esteem level are important to be known among students in
      order to intervene in a correct time. Body dissatisfaction is one of the factors leading to
      negative self-perception, low mood, depression, and eating disorders. This may be detrimental
      to students in their academic performance. However, the correlations of body image
      satisfaction towards body mass index and self- esteem among university female students are
      still unclear in Malaysia. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine its relationships
      among Chinese female students. university female participants will be included with
      convenience sampling method. Participants will completed Ronsenberg Self- Esteem Scale and 8
      items version of Body Shape Questionnaire. These 2 scales used to measure level of self-
      esteem and body image satisfaction. Body mass index will be calculated from self- reported
      height and weight. The data will be analysed by using descriptive and correlation methods.
