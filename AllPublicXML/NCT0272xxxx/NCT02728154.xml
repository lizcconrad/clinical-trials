  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota play an important role in normal cardiovascular function and pathophysiology
      of cardiovascular diseases. Patients with heart failure (HF) have substantial hemodynamic
      changes which lead to intestinal hypoperfusion and congestion and eventually change gut
      morphology, permeability, function and composition of gut microbiota and cause translocation
      of microbial and endotoxins into the blood stream. Additionally, metabolites derived from gut
      microbiota modulate the pathophysiology of HF. Patients with HF have intestinal overgrowth of
      pathogenic bacteria and increased gut permeability. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that
      antibiotic treatment benefits patients with acute coronary syndromes and reduces the
      incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events. Taking the strong association of gut microbiota
      with HF into account, it is reasonable to speculate that gut microbiota could contribute to
      the progression of pre-HF with preserved ejection fraction (pre-HFpEF) to HF with preserved
      ejection fraction (HFpEF). Pre-HFpEF remains poorly understood, yet has high prevalence and a
      significantly high risk for death in comparison to patient without pre-HFpEF. We hypothesize
      that altered gut microbiota is involved in the initiation and establishment of HF and
      pre-HFpEF.

      The research study will initially enroll 50 subjects without HF as normal controls,120
      subjects with history of HF and 50 subjects with pre-HFpEF to characterize gut microbiota.
      The subjects will provide blood samples and a stool sample.
