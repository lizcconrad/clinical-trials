      This study is a 2X2 factorial randomized trial that will examine the comparative
      effectiveness of different decision support strategies for patients making treatment
      decisions about hip or knee osteoarthritis. Eligible patient subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive one of two decision aids before their upcoming clinic visit with a
      participating orthopedic specialist. Participating providers are randomly assigned to either
      usual care or an intervention (a report that includes patients' goals and treatment
      preferences). Patient participants will complete three surveys at different time points:
      before their orthopedic visit, one week after the clinic visit, and 12 months later.
      Providers will complete a short survey for a subset of patient participants.

    <ipd_description>As per requirements of the funder, the study team will create a complete, cleaned, de-identified copy of the final data set that will include survey data from participants. The PI will share a de-identified data set with outside investigators at no cost, according to approved Massachusetts General Hospital policies for data sharing. Investigators from other sites will be able to request the data and will be required to complete a data use agreement that ensures that all local Institutional Review Board requirements are met before using the data, that they will not attempt to identify any data in the dataset, and that they will not share the data set with anyone outside their project team, etc.</ipd_description>
