    <textblock>
      A comparative study is conducted on the patients with suspected coronary artery disease
      (CAD). The patient will undergo coronary angiography after a somatic symptom scale (SSS)
      survey is carried out combining with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder 7-items (GAD-7). Patient is then treated according to the checklist score
      and coronary angiography result. The efficacy, sensitivity and specificity of the SSS
      checklist will be evaluated during following up.

    <textblock>
      The presentation of physical complaints such as chest discomfort suggestive of suspicious
      coronary artery disease (CAD) but remain unexplained after negative finding from coronary
      angiography represents one of the most frustrating and puzzling problems in clinical
      medicine.A comparative study is conducted on the patients with suspected coronary artery
      disease. A somatic symptom scale (SSS) survey is carried out combining with Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-items (GAD-7). Patient is treated
      according to the checklist score and coronary angiography result. Three surveys will be
      re-conducted 2 weeks after treatment. The sensitivity and specificity of the SSS checklist
      will be evaluated during following up.
