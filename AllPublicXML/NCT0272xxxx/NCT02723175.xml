  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are seeking to determine the effects of CBT, anodal tDCS over left DLPFC, and
      combined CBT+ tDCS on clinical pain and functioning among a sample of patients with
      fibromyalgia. This study will be the first randomized, double-blind, controlled study of tDCS
      technology as an adjunctive pain management strategy for fibromyalgia pain. Data from this
      trial will likely yield information regarding the feasibility and efficacy of tDCS+CBT as a
      chronic pain-management approach.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with fibromyalgia will complete questionnaires, six cognitive behavioral therapy
      sessions, quantitative sensory testing before and after the six therapy sessions, and undergo
      30 minutes of tDCS during each of the six therapy sessions.

    <measure>The Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mintues</time_frame>
    <description>well-researched, brief self-report depression-screening instrument. This instrument will be used for screening purposes in the laboratory study and to characterize depression in the clinical cohort. The BDI scale assesses suicidal ideation, those patients exhibiting suicidal ideations will be referenced to a therapist in order to further manage their depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>The Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>well-researched, brief self-report anxiety-screening instrument. It assesses different aspects of anxiety experience (e.g., physiological, cognitive, behavioral).</description>
