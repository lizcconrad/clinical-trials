  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although cochlear implants can restore hearing to individuals who have lost cochlear hair
      cell function, there is no adequately effective treatment for individuals suffering chronic
      imbalance, postural instability and unsteady vision due to loss of vestibular hair cell
      function. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the vestibular
      nerve via a chronically implanted multichannel vestibular prosthesis can partially restore
      vestibular reflexes that maintain steady posture and vision. This pilot clinical feasibility
      study of a multichannel vestibular implant system will evaluate this approach in up to ten
      human subjects with bilateral vestibular deficiency due to gentamicin ototoxicity or other
      causes of inner ear dysfunction.

      The system used in this study is the (MVI)™ Multichannel Vestibular Implant System produced
      by Labyrinth Devices, LLC. It is similar to commercially available cochlear implants in that
      it includes an implanted stimulator powered and controlled by an external unit, which
      communicate with the implant across the skin via an inductive link. Unlike a cochlear
      implant, the implanted stimulator's electrode array is designed for implantation near the
      ends of the vestibular nerve. The implanted stimulator also includes additional magnets to
      help facilitate retention of the external unit on the scalp over the implant. The external
      unit includes a head-worn unit (for sensing head motion and delivering power and signals to
      the implanted stimulator) and a power and control unit containing a battery and
      microprocessor. Participants in this trial who meet candidacy criteria and who choose to
      proceed with implantation surgery, device activation and device deactivation will be asked to
      participate in a series of post-operative monitoring visits over a 1 year period.

          -  Diagnosis of acoustic neuroma/vestibular schwannoma, chronic middle ear disease,
             cholesteatoma, or central nervous system causes of vestibulo-ocular reflex
             dysfunction, including chronic and continuing use of medications, drugs or alcohol at
