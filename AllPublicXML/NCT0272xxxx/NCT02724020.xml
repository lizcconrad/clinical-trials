    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent MLN0128 and the combination
      of MLN0128 + MLN1117 compared with everolimus in the treatment of participants with
      metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) that have progressed on vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drugs being tested in this study are called MLN0128 and MLN1117. MLN0128 and MLN1117 are
      being tested to treat people who have mccRCC. This study will assess the efficacy and safety
      of MLN0128 and MLN1117 as well as how it is processed by the body in participants with
      advanced or mccRCC.

      The study will enroll approximately 189 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups:

        -  Everolimus 10 mg once daily (QD)

        -  MLN0128 30 mg once weekly (QW)

        -  MLN0128 4 mg + MLN1117 200 mg QD*3 days per week

      All participants will be asked to take the study drug at the same time on each scheduled day.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 2 years after last participant is randomized, or when the last participant
      discontinues study treatment (approximately 3 years). Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic including a follow-up visit 30 to 40 days after receiving their last dose of
      study drug or prior to start of subsequent anticancer therapy for safety assessment.
      Participants will then be followed for Progression Free and Overall Survival.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug to disease progression or death (approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of Progressive Disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For a participant whose disease has not progressed and is last known to be alive, PFS will be censored at the last response assessment that is Stable Disease (SD) or better. PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 27 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug to death (approximately 3 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Participants without documentation of death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time-to-Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until disease progression, or death which occurs first (approximately 3 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of PD. For a participant whose disease has not progressed, TTP will be censored at the last response assessment that is Stable Disease or better. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until discontinuation of study drug due to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death which occurs first (approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST Version 1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the Baseline sum LD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose study drug until discontinuation of study drug due to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death which occurs first (approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST Version 1.1 and will be reported for both CBR with any duration SD and CBR with SD duration of at least 4 months. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the Baseline sum LD. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
