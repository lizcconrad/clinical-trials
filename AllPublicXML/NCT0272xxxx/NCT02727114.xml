  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To optimize a medical device for intradermal injection, knowledge concerning the thickness of
      epidermis and dermis at the proximal forearm is required. Since scientific knowledge is
      lacking, the investigators will examine the skin thickness (epidermis and dermis) of children
      (aged 8 weeks to 18 years) using imaging technology (High Frequency Ultrasound). The
      investigators hypothesize that they are able to correlate the thickness of the (epi)dermis to
      a specific combination of parameters age, gender, and BMI.

      Based on these results, the investigators can define which needle type and length is needed
      to correctly perform injections into the dermal layer

    <description>(Epi)Dermal thickness at the proximal forearm, the deltoid region and medial site of the thigh (till 2 years) will be measured using imaging technology, more specifically high-frequency ultrasound (20-70 MHz) in B-mode (VEVO 2100® &amp; VEVO 3100®, Visual Sonics). This non-invasive measuring technique has already been proven to be accurate.
The echographic measurement will be performed on the left and right deltoid and medial thigh region, and on two sides of the proximal forearm. Both the dorsal part and the volar/palmar part of the proximal forearm will be investigated. Ultrasound will be executed using gel (Aquasonic®) to optimize imaging.</description>

        Participants will be recruited in the vicinity of the university and its university
        hospital of Antwerp. Through primary and secundary school in Antwerp, children will be
        recruited after approval of their parents and via some Child and Family (Dutch: Kind&amp;Gezin)
        facilities children aged 8 weeks to 3 years will recruited.

        All recruitement will be done from October 2015 until November 15th 2015.
