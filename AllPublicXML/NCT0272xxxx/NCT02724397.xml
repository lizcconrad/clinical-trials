  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linked color imaging (LCI) and magnifying blue laser imaging (BLI) are two new imaging
      systems used in endoscopy which are recently developed. BLI was developed to compensate for
      the limitations of NBI. BLI shows a bright image of the digestive mucosa, enabling the
      detailed visualization of both the microstructure and microvasculature. However, BLI still is
      not able to obtain sufficient brightness for distant lesions. The newly developed LCI system
      (FUJIFILM Co.) creates clear and bright endoscopic images by using short-wavelength
      narrow-band laser light combined with white laser light on the basis of BLI technology. LCI
      makes red areas appear redder and white areas appear whiter. Thus, it is easier to recognize
      a slight difference in color of the mucosa. This is a study to determine if using LCI of the
      colon, rather than the usual white light on the colon, will improve the detection of flat
      adenomas and serrated polyps. The polyps are called serrated because of their appearance
      under the microscope after they have been removed. They tend to be located up high in the
      colon, far away from the rectum. They have been definitely shown to be a type of precancerous
      polyp and it is possible that using LCI will make it easier to see them, as they can be quite
      difficult to see with standard white light. LCI/BLI enables endoscopists to accurately
      describe the pit pattern of adenomas. By comparing White Light Endoscopy and LCI/BLI, it will
      show if there is any comparable advantage to using one or the other for lesion detection and
      assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the use of linked color imaging (LCI) and
      magnifying blue laser imaging (BLI) versus standard white light for the detection of serrated
      lesions in the proximal colon (the colon proximal to the splenic flexure). The proximal colon
      has large intestine and many folds which will lead missing flat lesions. Recent studies have
      indicated that colonoscopy is more effective in preventing cancer in the left side of the
      colon than the right side of the colon. The reasons for this difference may be partly
      biologic, in that a special group of polyps known as serrated polyps, particularly sessile
      serrated adenomas, are located primarily proximal to the splenic flexure. These lesions are
      endoscopically subtle in that they are often flat, have the same color as the surrounding
      mucosa, and are hard to differentiate from normal mucosa. LCI makes red areas appear redder
      and white areas appear whiter. Thus, it is easier to recognize a slight difference in color
      of the mucosa. This study will test whether LCI will increase the detection of serrated
      lesions in a randomized controlled trial.
