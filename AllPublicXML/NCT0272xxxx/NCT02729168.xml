  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a bridging study to evaluate safety of Rabies vaccine INDIRAB® Five Doses (0.5
      ml) post exposure administered Intramuscularly in healthy Vietnamese Volunteer Aged from 5
      years old. 120 subjects will be enrolled in Cho Gao district, Tien Giang province, in which
      there are 100 adults (≥15 years old) and 20 children (5-&lt;15 years old). These subjects will
      be received 5 doses (0.5ml) INDIRAB® on D0, 3, 7, 14 and 28.

      The frequency, rate and severity of immediate adverse events (AE) within 30 minutes after
      vaccination, solicited and unsolicited AE within 7 days after each vaccination, the frequency
      and rate of serious adverse events (SAE) within 35 days after the first vaccination will be
      recorded as evidences for INDIRAB® safety assessment. The subjects to be included from this
      trial would be representative of the population of Vietnam.

      The protocol has been reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of Pasteur
      Institute in Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam Ministry of Health - Independent Ethics Committee
      and Vietnam Minister of Health.
