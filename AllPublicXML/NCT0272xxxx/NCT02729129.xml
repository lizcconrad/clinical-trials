  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Air pollution exposure is a major environmental and public health concern. The findings from
      controlled exposure studies have given biological plausibility to the epidemiological
      associations, and have defined important pathways that may be amenable to intervention.
      Ultimately, there is a need to address how one may protect the public from these detrimental
      effects. Two studies have been performed assessing the cardiovascular effects of wearing a
      face mask in a highly polluted urban area in China in healthy volunteers and patients with
      coronary heart disease. These demonstrated lower blood pressure and increased heart rate
      variability when wearing a face mask as compared to not. The investigators aim to test if
      wearing a highly efficient face mask during exposure to dilute diesel exhaust abrogates the
      well-known adverse cardiovascular effects.
