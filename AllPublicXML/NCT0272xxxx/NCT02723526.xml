  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As prostate cancer progresses, tumor cells dissociate and enter the bloodstream. Considered a
      &quot;liquid biopsy,&quot; these circulating tumor cells (CTC) can show how a patient's cancer evolves
      and responds to treatments. The purpose of this study is to determine whether sequentially
      analyzing the expression of tumor markers in circulating tumor cells in newly diagnosed
      metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients can predict the outcome of these
      patients.
