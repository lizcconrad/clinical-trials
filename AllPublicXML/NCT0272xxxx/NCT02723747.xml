    <textblock>
      Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a wide available technique for the diagnosis of
      myocardial ischemia. However, myocardial first-pass perfusion evaluation has been limited due
      to the moderate accuracy of the currently available qualitative and semiquantitative methods
      used to assess myocardial perfusion, and due to the lack of efficient absolute quantitative
      methods. Some CMR techniques and post-processing mathematical models have been developed for
      quantitative measurement of myocardial blood flow reserve with perfusion CMR under
      pharmacological stress. Measurement of these parameters with CMR have been shown to increase
      the accuracy of CMR in diagnosing myocardial ischemia, but most of these methods present
      technical challenges and have unreasonably time consuming post-processing. The aim of this
      study is to validate a full automated post-processing software for first pass perfusion CMR
      images that results in automated generated quantitative perfusion color maps.
