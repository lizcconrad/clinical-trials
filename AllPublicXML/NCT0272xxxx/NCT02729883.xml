    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies Take the Fight in supporting and empowering patients with
      cancer through their treatment process. Patients with cancer are faced with many obstacles
      created by the current state of the healthcare system. The purpose of Take the Fight is to
      train college students, also called patients' navigators or strategists, to assist and
      support patients to navigate into the healthcare system and receive the care they need. The
      strategists are matched with patients and attend/coordinate most patients' medical
      appointments. The strategists also advance communications between the patient and the medical
      staff to facilitate both the exchange of medical information as well as increase the
      patient's compliance with treatment. Take the Fight may improve the health and quality of
      life outcomes of cancer patients during critical treatment periods by increasing treatment
      compliance, eliminating barriers to better care, and increasing clinical trial participation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Delineate the benefits of and limitations to having Take the Fight strategists, performing
      as lay-navigators, as perceived by both the patients and the students.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Investigate changes in self-reported outcomes for patients and the Take the Fight
      strategists.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive patient navigation via strategists from the Take the Fight for 8 weeks.
      Patients also complete interviews regarding perceived physical, logistical, psychosocial, and
      informational challenges experienced prior to meeting with strategists/navigators and how
      challenges were addressed by navigator or others, perceived benefits or limitations of
      navigator assistance. Strategists also complete interviews regarding their perceptions on how
      patients benefited from participation, challenges patients experienced that were directly or
      indirectly related to their cancer diagnosis and treatment, how these concerns were
      addressed, barriers to addressing these concerns, and patient health literacy.

      After completion of study, patients and strategists are followed up for 8-10 weeks.
