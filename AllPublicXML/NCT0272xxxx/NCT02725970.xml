  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide recommendations for making better food and
      physical activity choices that promote health and help prevent disease. Yet, few Americans
      meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) and a large percentage are overweight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research was to examine the association between weight and the barriers and
      facilitators to meeting the DGA in a multi-site study using a cross-sectional survey. 836
      caregiver-child dyads enrolled and completed the HEALTH study questionnaire across six sites
      among three race/ethnic groups participating in the HEALTH Study. Barriers and facilitators
      to meeting the DGA were assessed using a validated questionnaire which was developed
      specifically for the HEALTH Study. Heights and weights were measured. A series of bivariate
      regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between the caregivers BMI or
      the children BMI z-score and the barriers and facilitators to meeting the DGA, adjusting for
      appropriate covariates in the models. Path analysis was used to examine the relationship of
      caregivers and children barriers and facilitators to their relative BMI.
