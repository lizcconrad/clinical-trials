  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of financial incentives augmented
      telephone-delivered diabetes education and skills training intervention in improving HbA1c
      levels in African Americans (AA) with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans with T2DM have higher prevalence of diabetes, poorer metabolic control, and
      greater risk for complications and death compared to White Americans. HbA1c is the primary
      marker for glycemic control and is a strong independent predictor of development of
      complications and increased mortality in T2DM. Key self-care behaviors that influence
      glycemic control (and HbA1c) include diet, physical activity, self-monitoring of blood
      glucose and medication adherence. Systematic review of multiple RCTs show that self-care
      interventions that include diabetes education and skills training are effective in improving
      metabolic control in diabetes. Recent findings indicate that patients with diabetes,
      especially ethnic minority patients, prefer telephone-delivered diabetes education to group
      visits or internet-based education. Multiple RCTs have documented the effectiveness of
      telephone-delivered self-care interventions in T2DM.

      The overarching aim of this proposal is test the efficacy of three financial incentive
      structures in combination with technology intensified diabetes education and skills training
      intervention on blood pressure and quality of life in AAs with T2DM. 60 AAs with T2DM will be
      randomized to three groups with varying frequency of financial incentives: 1) High Frequency:
      financial incentives for weekly uploads plus average glucose, incentives for weekly
      attendance to educational sessions, and incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c
      goals 2) Moderate Frequency: financial incentives for weekly uploads plus average glucose,
      and incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c goals, and 3) Low Frequency:
      financial incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c goals.

    <description>The high frequency incentive structure will receive a reward or uploading glucose measurements, attending educational sessions, and absolute percentage drops in HbA1c from baseline at 3-month follow-up, up to $300.
Each week participants can receive up to $10 for uploading glucose measurements and having good glucose control throughout the week.
Participants can also earn $5 each week if they attend the educational session. Educational sessions will last for 8 weeks, so they can receive up to $5 per week for 8 weeks.
After 3 months, if their HbA1c has dropped 2% from baseline, or absolute HbA1c is 7%, they will receive a reward of $130, for a 1% drop, or an absolute HbA1c between 7 and 8 they will receive a reward of $65.</description>

    <description>Each week participants in Group B can receive up to $10 for uploading glucose measurements and having good glucose control throughout the week. If they upload measurements every day of the week and their average glucose measurements at the end of the week are 150 or below they will receive an additional $3. Up to $10 per week for 3-months.
After 3 months, if their HbA1c has dropped 2% from baseline, or absolute HbA1c is 7%, they will receive a reward of $170, for a 1% drop, or an absolute HbA1c between 7 and 8 they will receive a reward of $85</description>

Thus, the maximum reward for each subject will be $300 over the 3 months of intervention and follow up.</description>

    <description>The intervention is based on the IMB model and provides information, motivation, and behavioral skills training (using motivational enhancement techniques). Subjects will receive weekly telephone-delivered diabetes knowledge/information, patient activation (list of 5 questions to ask their provider at every visit and training on how to ask the questions), patient empowerment (diabetes responsibility contracts, personal goals, and flow charts for patients to record lab results/medications and training on how to use the empowerment tools), and behavioral skills training delivered via telephone. The intervention will be delivered by telephone once a week for 12 weeks with each session lasting ~30 minutes</description>
