  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With Institutional ethics board and Health Canada approval, pediatric patients (ages 3-12)
      undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy (under standardized anesthesia) will be
      randomized to receive dextromethorphan hydrobromide (1mg/kg orally) 30 min preoperatively and
      again 8 hours postoperatively OR placebo (syrup identical in taste, appearance and volume) at
      the same time points. The primary outcome is an integrated assessment of perioperative pain
      scores and opioid use for 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes include nausea,
      vomiting, respiratory depression, and bleeding for 24 hours postoperatively. Our hypothesis
      is that dextromethorphan will decrease the incidence/severity of post-tonsillectomy pain. The
      improved pain control will be apparent through reduced opioid consumption and integrated pain
      scores. This will result in a reduced incidence of opioid-related side effects and adverse
      events.

      With Institutional ethics board and Health Canada approval and parental consent and child
      assent, pediatric patients (ages 3-12) undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy (under
      standardized anesthesia) will be randomized to receive dextromethorphan hydrobromide (1mg/kg
      orally) 30 min preoperatively and again 8 hours postoperatively OR placebo (syrup identical
      in taste, appearance and volume) at the same time points. The primary outcome is an
      integrated assessment of perioperative pain scores and opioid use for 24 hours
      postoperatively. Pain scores were collected preoperatively at rest and then at 1,2,3,8,9,10
      and 24 hours postoperatively using the validated Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain
      Scale (CHEOPS). Secondary outcomes include nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and
      bleeding recorded by blinded observers for 24 hours postoperatively.

      Our hypothesis is that dextromethorphan will decrease the incidence/severity of
      post-tonsillectomy pain. The improved pain control will be apparent through reduced opioid
      consumption and integrated pain scores. This will result in a reduced incidence of
      opioid-related side effects and adverse events.

    <description>The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) will be measured at rest 24 hours postoperatively and this will be integrated with total opioid consumption at 24 hours postoperatively. This will be achieved by converting both pain scores and opioid consumption to % change. The % differences for each of the 2 variables are then added together on a per-subject basis to provide a summated % difference. The individual and summated % differences can then be plotted on a single graph and the integrated ranks of the experimental and control groups can be compared with standard statistical tests.(1)</description>

    <description>Dextromethorphan is a drug of the morphinan class with sedative, dissociative, and stimulant properties (at higher doses). Dextromethorphan has been explored for a number other uses in medicine, including pain relief (as either the primary analgesic, or an opioid potentiator).</description>
