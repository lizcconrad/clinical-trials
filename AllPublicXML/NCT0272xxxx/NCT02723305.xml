    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about how to measure the way the the body's energy system
      works in boys with Klinefelter syndrome, including the heart, lungs, muscles, and liver. This
      is important to know so that investigators understand how hormones and an extra X chromosome
      relate to diseases such as diabetes, extra weight gain, heart disease and liver diseases.

      Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in males and is
      associated with primary gonadal failure in adolescence and a high morbidity and mortality
      from cardiovascular-related diseases (CVD) in adulthood. Recent studies in children and
      adolescent boys with KS have found a high prevalence of CVD risk markers, however the
      underlying mechanisms have not been explored. Our central hypothesis is that pubertal boys
      with KS have relative testosterone deficiency resulting in abnormal energy metabolism that
      predisposes them to later CVD, and that exogenous testosterone will modify these
      abnormalities.

      In this study, investigators will measure markers of cardiometabolic risk in pubertal boys
      with KS.

        The study will enroll 10 youth with 47,XXY who will be subdivided into 2 groups:

          1. Testosterone naïve (no exogenous testosterone within the past 5 years)

          2. Testosterone exposed (topical testosterone treatment for at least 1 year but no more
             than 2 years) Most subjects will be recruited at the completion of a monitored,
             double-blind randomized controlled trial ongoing at our institution. Additional
             subjects may be recruited to meet enrollment goals.
