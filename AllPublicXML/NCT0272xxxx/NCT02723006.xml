  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the initial safety profile and initial antitumor
      activity of the combination treatments (immune checkpoint inhibitors [nivolumab, ipilimumab]
      with investigational drugs [TAK-580, TAK-202 (plozalizumab), vedolizumab]) in the 3 arms when
      administered to participants with advanced melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drugs being tested in this study are called TAK-580, TAK-202 (plozalizumab), and
      vedolizumab. These investigational drugs were given along with standard of care checkpoint
      inhibitors ([nivolumab in Arms 1 and 2] or nivolumab + ipilimumab in Arm 3). This study will
      look at the safety profile of the combination treatments in each arm when administered to
      participants with advanced melanoma.

      The study will enroll approximately 156 participants. Participants will be assigned to one of
      the 3 treatment groups:

        -  TAK-580 + nivolumab

        -  TAK-202 (plozalizumab) + nivolumab

        -  vedolizumab + nivolumab + ipilimumab

      This study consists of 3 parts. A dose-escalation safety lead-in phase, confirmatory safety
      phase and a cohort expansion phase. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United
      States. The overall time to participate in this study is 50 weeks. Participants may make
      multiple visits to the clinic and 30, 60, and 90 days after last dose of study drug for
      follow-up assessments.
