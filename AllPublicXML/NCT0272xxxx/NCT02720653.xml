  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olfactory dysfunction is a cardinal symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis, a disease which
      affects 12.5% of the adult population across all racial and ethnic groups. Previous research
      has documented olfactory deficit in 68% of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and 20% with
      complete anosmia, suggesting that olfactory dysfunction affects over 25 million individuals
      in the United States with chronic rhinosinusitis. This proposed investigation will be used to
      predict olfactory outcomes following treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis and gain insights
      into mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in this population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult ( &gt; 18 years of age)

          -  A diagnosis of medical recalcitrant CRS as defined by 2015 Adult Sinusitis Guidelines
             outlined by the American Academy of Otolaryngology

          -  Provide written informed consent and authorization.

          -  Study participants must be able to complete consent, all study evaluations, olfactory
             testing, and study-related health questionnaires written in the English language.

          -  Patients must self-select subsequent treatment option (endoscopic sinus surgery or
             continued medical therapy) to be dictated by the disease process and judgment and
             preferences of each individual, following counseling for each treatment option.

          -  Present to the enrolling site with indication for a CT scan or a CT scan completed,
             off-site, from another provider

          -  Complete appropriate standardized medical treatment by the Interim Assessment, 6-week
             follow-up period including, but not limited to, at least one course of either topical
             corticosteroids (&gt;21-days) or a 5-day course of oral corticosteroid therapy, and at
             least one course (&gt;14-days) of culture-directed or broad spectrum antibiotic therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children (&lt; 18 years of age)

          -  Any patient unable and/or unwilling to complete questionnaires or clinical testing or
             cooperate with all study protocols.

          -  Non-English speaking / English translation services required

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide informed, written consent.

          -  Contra-indications for any type of continued medical therapy required for treatment of
             symptoms related to CRS

          -  Patients who have not undergone previous prescribed medical therapy as described in
             Inclusion Criteria.

          -  Individuals of any vulnerable population including: children, pregnant women,
             neonates, decisionally impaired adults, or prisoners.
