      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effect on intestinal permeability of a
      supplementation with Lactibiane Tolérance® for 4 weeks (28 days) in patients suffering from
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea predominance.

      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effects of supplementation with
      Lactibiane Tolérance® for 4 weeks (28 days) in patients suffering from IBS with diarrhea
      predominance on intestinal permeability, inflammation of the digestive tract, symptoms and
      comfort.

      Single-center study in single open arms: 30 volunteer adults suffering from Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea predominance and matching the criteria of inclusion and
      non-inclusion listed below.

      single-center pilot study in single open arm:

        -  2 to 6 weeks before enrollment: a screening visit (visit 0 [V0]) is carried out for
           verification of eligibility. time between V0 and V1 is a wash-out period with a duration
           decided by the physician (max 8 weeks).

        -  The experimental phase is composed of 2 visits (Visit 1 [V1] and Visit 2 [V2]) separated
           by 28 days (± 2 days) : from V1 to V2 patients are taking the product Lactibiane
           Tolérance®.

        -  V1 and V2 each include collection of stools, a blood sample, questionnaires on abdominal
           symptoms and quality of life, dynamic test of absorption of lactulose / mannitol to
           evaluate the intestinal permeability, recto-sigmoidoscopy with confocal endomicroscopy
           for in-vivo study of fluorescein leakage in the lamina propria and biopsies for ex-vivo
           measurements.

        -  &quot;carmine red&quot; test for the evaluation of intestinal transit speed is carried out the
           week before V1 and V2 (at least 72 hours before the visit). Questionnaires on abdominal
           symptoms as well as the frequency and consistency of stools are filled during the 7 days
           before V1 and V2 before.
