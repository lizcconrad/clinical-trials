    <textblock>
      This is a prevalence study of protective antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) in
      HIV-infected adults and HIV-uninfected controls. MMR vaccination were provided to both groups
      who had no protective antibodies to at least one of the three viruses.

      From July to August 2011, 500 HIV-infected and 132 HIV-uninfected participants those met the
      eligibility criteria were enrolled and tested for protective antibodies to measles, mumps,
      and rubella.

      All participants who had no protective antibody to at least one of the three viruses were
      recruited to vaccinate for MMR vaccine. Between June to September 2012, 249 HIV-infected and
      46 HIV-uninfected adults were vaccinated. Antibodies to MMR were measured at week 8-12, and
      week 48 after vaccination, which were completed in August 2013. The results were ready for
      analysis in March 2014.
