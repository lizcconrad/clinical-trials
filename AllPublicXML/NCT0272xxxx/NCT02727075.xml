  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterize the diagnostic performance of immunological testing of occult
      gastrointestinal bleeding in stool in the population aged over 75 years with iron deficiency
      anemia.

      As secondary objectives, the study aims to:

        -  determine a threshold of positivity optimizing the immunoassay performance for the study
           population, in accordance with the probabilities of error (false positives, false
           negatives) and weights (defined by expert consensus) allocated to these errors.

        -  Assess the benefit of a double measure of bleeding (two stools) by immunoassay compared
           to a single measure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunological testing will be performed systematically for each patient.

      Research of blood in fecal sample will be based on 2 methods: one based on a qualitative
      immunochromatographic method (such as HemSign4 technique, Servibio, France; or all other
      techniques used at AP-HP) and another quantitative immunoturbidimetric method (OC-Sensor,
      Eiken, Japan). They will be performed systematically with two fresh fecal samples for each
      patient, before coloscopy examination.

      Treating physicians will not be provided with the testing result. The diagnosis of reference
      will be established by experts based on the result of explorations (colonoscopy, coloscanner)
      and the patient's progression, blinded to the result of immunoassay.

      The intrinsic characteristics of the immunoassay (sensitivity, specificity...) will be
      determined with reference to this reference diagnosis, using a positivity threshold defined
      using expert consensus on the weights to be allocated to potential errors.

      2 modeling scenarios (without vs with immunological testing) using decision trees based on
      prevalence and diagnostic performance observed and stochastic simulations.
