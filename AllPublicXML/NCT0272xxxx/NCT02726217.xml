  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CareSmarts is a theory-driven behavioral intervention designed to improve self-care among
      patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with poor glycemic control (HbA1c&gt;8%), through multiple
      mediators, including cuing, education, self-efficacy, social support, and health beliefs.
      Individuals will be randomly assigned with equal allocation to either the CareSmarts
      intervention or to usual care for 6 months.

      CareSmarts is a mobile diabetes program that provides self-management support and team-based
      care management for people with diabetes through automated SMS messages. The program is a
      theory-driven behavioral intervention designed to improve self-care through multiple
      mediators, including cuing, education, self-efficacy, social support, and health beliefs.
      Participants in the program receive educational and motivational text messages about diabetes
      self-care, some prompts to engage in a particular action (for example, &quot;Time to check your
      blood sugar&quot;), and some self-assessment questions (such as, &quot;Do you need refills of any of
      your medications?&quot;) to which the patient responds by texting. Participants' responses to
      self-assessment questions are used to facilitate remote monitoring and care management by the
      health care team. A response that is outside established parameters triggers an alert. Using
      protocols, nurses respond to each alert by the next business day.

    <description>Nurses from Diabetes Clinic will use a web-based enrollment form that includes the patient's mobile phone number, diabetes care plan, and preferred times for receiving messages. Participants in the program receive text messages about diabetes self-care. The contents of the messages that the participants receive are modified through software every two weeks as needed, based on their interactions with the system. Participants follow a flexible education curriculum in which they move from one topic to the next at their own pace.</description>
