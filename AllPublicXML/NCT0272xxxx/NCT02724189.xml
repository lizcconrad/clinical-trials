  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will intend to assess the feasibility and acceptability of MyPreOp (online
      pre-operative assessment tool). The study will aim to assess the quality of the MyPreOp
      assessment in comparison to standard practice of a nurse led face to face assessment. The
      investigators will also assess the acceptability of MyPreOp amongst patient participants and
      staff participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MyPreOp is a patient online pre-assessment tool that has been developed as a means of an
      alternative to the current existing model of a nurse led pre-assessment service.

      This pilot study will intend to assess the feasibility and acceptability of MyPreOp. The
      study will primarily evaluate the quality of the MyPreOp assessment in comparison to standard
      practice of a nurse led assessment. The investigators will also assess the acceptability of
      MyPreOp amongst patient participants and pre-assessment nurses and anaesthetists.

      Participants will be recruited directly from the pre-assessment clinic. Consenting
      participants will alternate undergoing either the MyPreOp assessment or the nurse assessment
      first. Participants will complete the MyPreOp assessment on a computer device at the
      hospital. Participants will also complete a nurse led pre-assessment process as per standard
      practice. Following the completion of both the MyPreOp assessment and the nurse assessment,
      participants will be asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire about their experience of
      using MyPreOp, together with further questions about their home internet access, usage and
      their preference of electronic or nurse led assessments.

      Similarly pre-assessment nurses will review a random sample of MyPreOp assessments and
      complete a questionnaire about their views of the MyPreOp assessment summary and recommended
      actions.

      The MyPreOp assessments will be compared with the nurse assessments through an independent
      adjudication process. Nominated adjudicators will be Consultant Anaesthetists with regular
      clinical duties in the pre-assessment clinic. Adjudicators will not be blinded with respects
      to the assessments so that the manner in which the patient data is presented can also be
      compared as well as the data itself. Adjudicators will assess the performance of the MyPreOp
      assessment in two domains, medical history and recommended investigations, and assign them
      into graded categories of over or under assessment, with or without clinical significance.

        The study group will be taken from a single centre. The patient population will be patients
        being assessed prior to general, gynaecological, urological and orthopaedic surgery. The
        investigators selected this population as they represent a diverse sample of patients of
        both genders with a varying range of ages and co-morbidities for both ambulatory and
        inpatient surgery.
