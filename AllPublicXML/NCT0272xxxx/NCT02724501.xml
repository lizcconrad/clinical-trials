  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to understand the role of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene in endometrial
      cancer (tumours of the uterine lining), the most common gynecologic cancer in the developed
      world. The studies in this program span the spectrum from fruit flies to humans, as part of a
      synergistic partnership that will significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular
      genetic events involved in the development and progression of endometrial cancer. The
      discovery of new targets for therapy, and the ability to evaluate these in subsequent
      clinical trials is a significant strength of this scientific interaction, which may result in
      cures for patients with primary and relapse endometrial cancer and prevention of this cancer
      in women who are at high risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTEN is a critical module that regulates effects of sex hormones on the growth and apoptosis
      of endometrial cells; and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of subgroups of
      endometrial cancers, their biologic behaviour and responses to therapeutic agents.
      Furthermore, mutational inactivation of the PTEN gene can serve as an independent molecular
      marker that can predict relapse and survival in endometrial cancer. The prognostic effects of
      PTEN may also be modulated by other tumour suppressor gene losses including P53 mutations, by
      hormone receptor status, and microsatellite instability.
