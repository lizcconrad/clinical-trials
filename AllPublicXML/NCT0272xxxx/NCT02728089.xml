  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-site, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of MK-7625A 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) for the treatment of
      complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) including pyelonephritis (uncomplicated or
      complicated pyelonephritis and complicated lower urinary tract infection) in Japanese
      participants. Efficacy will be primarily assessed by microbiological response defined as
      eradication of the baseline pathogen or pathogens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Japanese males or females who need hospitalization

          -  Clinical signs and/or symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) at screening visit,
             either one of the following:

               -  Pyelonephritis (uncomplicated or complicated)

               -  Complicated lower UTI (cUTI)

          -  Has a pretreatment baseline urine culture specimen obtained within 24 hours of start
             of study drug

          -  Requires IV antibacterial therapy for the treatment of the presumed UTI

          -  Female participants of child bearing potential must not be pregnant (negative human
             chorionic gonadotropin test) or breastfeeding and must agree to use adequate

             study drug

          -  Male participants must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of the

          -  Has suspected or confirmed prostatitis, urethritis, or epididymitis

          -  Has ileal loop or known vesico-ureteral reflux

          -  Severe impairment of renal function including an estimated CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min,
             requirement for peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or hemofiltration, or oliguria (&lt; 20
             mL/h urine output over 24 hours)

          -  Has urinary catheter that is not scheduled to be removed before the end of therapy

          -  Has any rapidly progressing disease or immediately life-threatening illness including

             marrow transplantation, or immunosuppressive therapy) or is receiving ≥ 40 mg of
             prednisone per day administered continuously for &gt; 14 days prior to study start
