                  marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma which have progressed within
                  12 months of achieving a partial or complete remission. Patients who had
                  remissions lasting &gt; 12 months, are eligible after at least two prior therapies.
                  Patients with bulky disease should be considered for debulking chemotherapy
                  before transplant. Patients with refractory disease are eligible, unless bulky

               -  Myeloproliferative Neoplasms/Myelofibrosis

               -  Other Leukemia Subtypes: A major effort in the field of hematology is to identify
                  patients who are of high risk for treatment failure so that patients can be
                  appropriately stratified to either more (or less) intensive therapy. This effort
                  is continually ongoing and retrospective studies identify new disease features or
                  characteristics that are associated with treatment outcomes. Therefore, if new
                  features are identified after the writing of this protocol, patients can be
                  enrolled with the approval of two members of the study committee.

          -  Additional Criteria for Bulky Disease (lymphomas)

               -  If stable disease is best response, the largest residual nodal mass must &lt; 5 cm

             physician's note.

          -  Pulmonary: DLCO, FEV1, FVC ≥ 40% predicted, and absence of O2 requirements. For
             children that are not able to cooperate with PFTs, a pulse oximetry with exercise
             should be attempted. If neither test can be obtained it should be clearly stated in
             the physician's note.

          -  Liver: Transaminases ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dL

             must have estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 ml/min/1.73m^2. Adequate performance
             status is defined as Karnofsky score ≥ 70% (≥ 16 years of age) or Lansky score ≥ 50
             (pediatrics)

               -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential and males with partners of
                  child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control during study
                  treatment.

               -  Voluntary written consent (adult or parent/guardian with presentation of the
                  minor information sheet, if appropriate)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding. The agents used in this study include Pregnancy Category
             D: known to cause harm to a fetus. Females of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to starting therapy.

          -  Untreated active infection

          -  Active HIV infection or known HIV positive serology

          -  Less than 3 months since prior myeloablative transplant

          -  Evidence of progressive disease by imaging modalities or biopsy - persistent PET
             activity, though possibly related to lymphoma, is not an exclusion criterion in the
             absence of CT changes indicating progression.

          -  CML in blast crisis

          -  Large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease that is progressing on
             salvage therapy.
