  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to compare the characteristics, i.e. efficacy, duration,
      safety and hospital stay, of a frameless fiducial-less brain biopsy method with those of the
      standard frame-based stereotactic technique.

      Inclusion criteria: adult patients with cerebral lesions: 1) for whom no conclusive diagnosis
      could be settled in a noninvasive manner; and 2a) who also had surgically inaccessible
      lesions (or involving eloquent areas), or multifocal lesions, or lesions for which the
      probable diagnosis is a contraindication for craniotomy, or 2b) were too ill or too old for
      open craniotomy.

      Type of Intervention: standard frame-based stereotactic brain biopsy technique or frameless
      fiducial-less method using an optical based navigation system and a mini frame apparatus -
      trajectory guide.

      The purpose of the present study is to compare the characteristics, i.e. efficacy, duration,
      safety and hospital stay, of a frameless fiducial-less brain biopsy method with those of the
      standard frame-based stereotactic technique, in order to apply a technique friendlier to the
      patient, more comfortable for the surgeon and more flexible concerning the overall hospital's
      function.

      Inclusion criteria: adult patients with cerebral lesions: 1) for whom no conclusive diagnosis
      could be settled in a noninvasive manner; and 2a) who also had surgically inaccessible
      lesions (or involving eloquent areas), or multifocal lesions, or lesions for which the
      probable diagnosis is a contraindication for craniotomy, or 2b) were too ill or too old for
      open craniotomy.

      Type of Intervention: standard frame-based stereotactic brain biopsy technique or frameless
      fiducial-less method using an optical based navigation system and a mini frame apparatus -
      trajectory guide.

      The following parameters will be assessed: diagnostic yield, histological - cytological
      evaluation of the biopsy specimens, cerebral lesions' location, lesions' maximum diameter,
      duration of: the overall procedure, the preparatory steps overall, the preparation inside the
      OR, operation (&quot;skin-to-skin&quot;), the time spent inside the OR overall, neurologic morbidity,
      new abnormal findings in the postoperative head CT scan, length of hospitalization.
