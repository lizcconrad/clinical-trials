  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke results in long-term disability for many people, and particularly for survivors of
      stroke who have cognitive impairments. However, a decreasing proportion of stroke patients
      are able to access or receive publicly funded rehabilitation. The investigators have shown in
      previous studies that in-person delivery of the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational
      Performance (CO-OP) rehabilitation approach to promoting attainment of everyday life goals
      has resulted in improvements in functional independence and executive function. In a small
      pilot study of tele-CO-OP with people with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n=3), the
      investigators found the delivery method was feasible and that participants were satisfied
      with the treatment and demonstrated clinically significant improvements on personally
      meaningful activities. The investigators will investigate the feasibility, preliminary
      efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of delivering CO-OP in an online format to reduce disability
      post-stroke. The study design is a single-blind (assessor), randomized wait-list control
      trial with a one-month retention follow-up. All therapy and testing sessions will be
      delivered online. We hypothesize that participants will demonstrate improvement in everyday
      activities and community participation.
