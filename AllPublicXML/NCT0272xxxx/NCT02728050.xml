      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of filgrastim (granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride,
      when given together with sorafenib tosylate and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
      (likely to be more aggressive). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as filgrastim, cladribine,
      cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride together with sorafenib tosylate may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) used in
      combination with dose-intensified mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) as part of the
      G-CSF, cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride (G-CLAM) regimen in adults with
      newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
      (Phase 1)

      II. To determine if the addition of sorafenib to G-CLAM improves the rate of minimal residual
      disease negative (MRDneg) complete response (CR) compared with our center's historical
      control of G-CLAM alone in adults with newly-diagnosed AML/high-risk MDS. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate rates of CR, overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), event-free
      survival (EFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) after the addition of sorafenib to G-CLAM in
      patients with newly-diagnosed AML/high-risk MDS.

      II. To describe the toxicity profile and safety (rate of adverse events) of sorafenib in
      combination with G-CLAM.

      III. To assess the feasibility of incorporating quality of life (QOL), cost and healthcare
      resource utilization endpoints in to a phase 1/2 clinical trial for newly diagnosed AML.

      IV. To investigate, within the limits of a phase 1/2 trial, the impact of study treatment and
      response on quality of life, cost, and healthcare resource utilization for patients with AML
      undergoing intensive chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of mitoxantrone and sorafenib tosylate
      followed by a phase II study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on
      days 1-3 and sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 10-19 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously
      (SC) once daily (QD) on days 0-5, cladribine IV QD over 2 hours on days 1-5, and cytarabine
      IV QD over 2 hours on days 1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving partial remission (including MRD positive [pos] CR, CR with
      incomplete platelet recovery [CRp], and CR with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) or
      persistent AML may receive up to 2 courses of induction therapy per the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      POST-REMISSION: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID on days 8-27 or 3 days prior to
      next course of treatment, whichever occurs first. Patients also receive filgrastim
      subcutaneously SC QD on days 0-5, cladribine IV QD over 2 hours on days 1-5, and cytarabine
      IV QD over 2 hours on days 1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving MRDneg CR may receive up to 4 courses of post-remission therapy.
      Patients achieving disease response (MRDpos CR, CRi/CRp, or persistent disease) may receive
      up to two induction course and 1 course of post-remission therapy with mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride omitted in course 3. If they then enter MRDneg CR, they can proceed with up to
      a total of 4 courses of post-remission therapy.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving MRDneg CR may receive maintenance therapy of
      sorafenib tosylate PO BID for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5
      years.

          -  Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under
             treatment with anti-microbials and/or controlled or stable (e.g. if specific,
             effective therapy is not available/feasible or desired [e.g. chronic viral hepatitis,
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]); patient needs to be clinically stable as defined
             as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 24-48 hours prior to study day 0,
             unless fever is thought to be secondary to the underlying hematologic disease

          -  Active or clinically significant (or symptomatic) cardiac disease, including active
             coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy other
             than beta blockers or digoxin within the last 3 months, unstable angina (anginal
             symptoms at rest), new-onset angina within 3 months before randomization, or
             myocardial infarction within 6 months before study day 0

          -  Previous receipt of azacitidine, decitabine, anthracyclines, cytarabine, or other
