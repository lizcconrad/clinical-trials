    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well tethered capsule endoscope works in screening
      patients with Barrett esophagus (BE), a condition where the lining of the esophagus has
      changed or has been replaced with abnormal cells that may lead to cancer also called
      esophageal cancer. In an attempt to prevent the progression from BE to esophageal cancer,
      patients undergo a standard procedure called esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) where patients
      are sedated and the doctor uses an endoscope to examine the tissue in the esophagus. Tethered
      capsule endoscope is a tiny capsule with a laser scan inside and a very thin cord attached to
      it. Patients swallow the capsule and the thin cord keeps the capsule in specific area in the
      esophagus. After pictures of the lining of esophagus are taken, the capsule is removed using
      the thin cord. Tethered capsule endoscope may be able to identify tissue changes in patients
      with BE without the need for sedation or anesthesia, thus eliminating the associated risks
      and costs associated with EGD.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate image quality and usability of the tethered capsule endoscope after repeated
      clinical use and reprocessing.

      II. Evaluate safety issues associated with the use of the device for this subject population
      - was there any noticeable difference from prior study of subjects at high risk of Barrett's
      esophagus using the same device, but without reprocessing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES;

      I. Study other specified device characteristics or device application considerations.

      II. Obtain preliminary data for use in designing a subsequent pivotal study of the device.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients swallow the tethered capsule endoscope (TCE) and undergo endoscopic examination
      while they are seated on a standard endoscopy gurney. Patients undergo standard of care EGD
      on the same day.

    <description>Consistent image quality defined as no significant degradation of lateral spatial resolution [line pairs per mm] and axial depth of focus [mm], maximum field of view [degrees cone angle], and color fidelity [qualitatively matches color chart] when measured after use in the clinic using color and resolution test targets and a test chamber to measure field of view. The standard care EGD will be digitally recorded to allow for review and comparison to the TCE procedure by a blinded, expert endoscopist.</description>
