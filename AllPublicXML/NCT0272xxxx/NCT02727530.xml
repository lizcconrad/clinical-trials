      Background:

      Infant colic is one of the most common disorders in the first year of baby´s life. It is
      estimated to affect between 10 to 40 % of healthy born children in their first year of life.
      To determine the effectiveness of a protocol manual therapy in the treatment of colic, using
      the Infant Colic Severity Questionnaire, we analyzed two intervention groups: experimental in
      which children received the protocol manual therapy and counseling to parents and the Control
      group, in which parents received advice only.

      Objectives:

      To assess the effectiveness of visceral manual therapy to improve the symptoms on infant
      colic.
