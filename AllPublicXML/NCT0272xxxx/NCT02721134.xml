  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a constant concern in ICU, frequent and severe, it requires early diagnosis and
      prompt implementation of the etiological treatment. The bacterial infections are the most
      common and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis is based on the
      detection of micro-organisms (bacteria) that can confirm the diagnosis and to tailor
      antibiotic treatments. Blood cultures are positive in 30-35% of cases and diagnosis is often
      based on a body of evidence that the use of biomarkers. No biomarkers (or even a combination
      of biomarkers) no evidence to confirm or refute the diagnosis of sepsis alone. During sepsis,
      gram + and gram - are circulating and often present in small amounts; they can be detected by
      sensitive and specific tools following a pretreatment of the blood sample (innovative
      technology Bacti-DIAG).

      The main objective of the multicentre study Bacti-DIAG-Rea is testing in prospectively, in a
      suspicious population resuscitation of sepsis, this new bacterial biomarker. Secondary
      objectives will assess whether Bacti-DIAG provides time and precision gain (gram + vs grams)
      in the patient's care including diagnosis and treatment.

      All ICU patients and with clinical criteria of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)
      sepsis suspects will be included: in addition to the samples taken for routine care of the
      patient 4 tubes of whole blood will be collected 5mL. The definitive diagnosis of sepsis or
      SIRS be confirmed retrospectively by two independent experts blinded to Bacti-DIAG. The areas
      under the ROC curves for the detection of gram + and gram will be calculated and associated
      detection limits will be determined to meet the objectives of the study.

      It is planned to include 400 consecutive patients with SIRS criteria for sepsis 300-360 and
      analyze biometric and biological data based on the subsequent evolution of the patients. The
      care of patients will be blinded to the results of the new biomarker Bacti-DIAG

    <description>determine the AUC of a test ( Bacti DIAG ) for the diagnosis of sepsis and sepsis Gram + Gram - relative to the composite gold standard . Two analyzes will be performed , one for the diagnosis of sepsis Gram + and to that of sepsis Gram . We describe below the analysis to be conducted on Gram + diagnosis , it will suffice to transpose the study of Gram</description>
