      To investigate the efficacy and safety of using the novel Tyto device for remote physical
      examination by co-investigators as compared to a standard medical physical examination by
      physicians.

      A single center, prospective, qualitative study. Patients referred to the emergency
      department will be triaged according to The Canadian Triage &amp; Acuity Scale (CTAS).

      Patients presenting with complaints suitable for examination with the Tyto device
      (ear/throat/respiratory/cardiac complaints) and meeting the inclusion criteria will be
      informed and asked for consent. Patients participating in the study will be referred to a
      room dedicated for the purpose.

      A minimum of a hundred volunteer patients will be selected and enrolled for a preliminary
      Pilot Study. Final study design and its extent will be determined accordingly.

      Physical examinations using the Tyto device will be performed by the co-investigators, and
      sent online to the principle investigator for remote analysis.

      The emergency department physician will examine the patient using conventional examination
      instruments (i.e. stethoscope, otoscope).

      The data collected will be recorded on predetermined case report form (CRF), timed, stored
      and analyzed by the principle and co-investigators. The findings of the co-investigators'
      examination will be compared to the conventional examination instruments used by the
      emergency department physician.

      Results will be checked and compared categorically (0-inconclusive; 1-normal; 2-pathological
      findings)
