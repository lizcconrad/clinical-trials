    <textblock>
      The aim of this single-centre study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Retina
      Implant Alpha AMS (Retina Implant AG, Reutlingen, Germany) in participants with severe visual
      impairment secondary to outer retinal degeneration caused by retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The
      study is sponsored by the University of Oxford and funded by the National Institute for
      Health Research (UK).

      The specific research questions are, i) can the implant partially restore vision to an eye
      with no light perception and ii) what are the safety implications for the ocular and
      periorbital tissues of the implanted eye? In advanced RP the light detecting photoreceptor
      cells of the retina degenerate slowly over time, and may eventually lead to blindness. The
      subretinal implant replaces the degenerate photoreceptor layer and stimulates the residual
      overlying healthy retinal layers in response to a light stimulus. These signals are then
      carried on to the brain along the normal visual pathway. Investigators are seeking to recruit
      six participants who fulfill the eligibility criteria, which include advanced RP with no
      useful light perception vision in the eye to receive the implant. Participants must be aged
      between 18 and 70 years old, be highly motivated, and be well enough for a general
      anaesthetic. The eye must have also had cataract surgery. The project will be conducted at
      the Oxford Eye Hospital. Those participants selected to receive the implant will be followed
      for 12 months from the date of surgery. Between week 1 and month 12 there will be at least 7
      outpatient clinic visits for a range of visual tests and eye assessments. After 12 months the
      trial will officially end, however investigators will continue to review all research
      participants in clinic as would be standard care for a patient with RP. The implant may be
      removed at any stage e.g. when it ceases to function or at the participant's request.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
