      Background: Atherosclerotic carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) may be associated with
      alterations in the sensitivity of carotid and subclavian baroreceptors.

      Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate if carotid IMT is associated with changes in the
      autonomic modulation of the heart rate variability (HRV).

      Methods: This is a prospective cross-sectional study. The carotid IMT is determined by B-mode
      and duplex ultrasonography. The cardiovagal function was determined through linear and
      nonlinear measures of HRV. Linear regression models, adjusted for demographics,
      comorbidities, body mass index, waist-hip-ratio, and left ventricular ejection fraction will
      be used to evaluate the association between HRV parameters and carotid IMT.

        Subjects referred to the Heart Institute of Santa Casa Charity (IACOR), Fernandopolis,
        Brazil for noninvasive carotid artery duplex ultrasonography. Carotid arteriosclerotic
        disease is evaluated through measuring the IMT and calculating the plaque score.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Asymptomatic patients aged 18 years and older without a history of transient ischemic
             attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms are selected to participate in
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were excluded if the patient had
             transient or permanent focal neurologic symptoms related to the ipsilateral retina or
             the cerebral hemisphere.

          -  Patients with heart rhythm disorders, pacemaker, heart failure, ejection fraction less
             than 0.45, chronic renal failure on hemodialysis, severe liver failure, myocardial
             infarction, endarterectomy, carotid angioplasty, carotid dissection and carotid
             occlusion were excluded.

          -  Patients receiving drugs known to interfere with autonomic function, such as
             beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
             vasodilators, statins, neuroleptics and nasal vasoconstrictors, were discontinued for
             24 hours before the tests.
