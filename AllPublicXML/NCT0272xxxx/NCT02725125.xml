    <textblock>
      This single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat the patients who have relapsed or
      refractory stomach cancer with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been
      genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR) that will bind to tumor
      cells that express the EPCAM protein on the cell surface.The study will determine if these
      modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumor cells.The trial will also
      study the safety of treatment with CAR-T, how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body and
      the impact of this treatment on survival.

      This is a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      CAR-T for Stomach Cancer. The study will be conducted using a phaseⅠ /Ⅱ design.The study will
      have the following sequential phases: Part A(screening leukapheresis, cell product
      preparation, and cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B(treatment and follow-up). The
      follow-up period for each participant is approximately 35 months after the final CAR-T
      infusion.The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years. A total of
      19 patients may be enrolled over a period of 3 years.

    <description>This study have only one arm that is CAR-T experimental arm. Firstly all participators will be attended the screening, who passed the screening for the treatment of CAR-T cells, the CAR-EPCAM-modified T cells can recognize and kill tumor cells in the body，follow-up 35 months.</description>
