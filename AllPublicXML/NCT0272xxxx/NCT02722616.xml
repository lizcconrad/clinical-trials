  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to collect data and analyze the motion of soft tissue in
      the abdomen (liver, pancreas, stomach and intestines) of people who have pancreatic and liver
      cancer as well as healthy volunteers.

      During the study researchers will look at the movement of organs in the abdomen that
      naturally occurs with breathing and with a bowel movement.

      This study will examine the differences between abdominal soft tissue motion in healthy
      volunteers and in cancer patients with the goal of developing a better way to manage and
      minimize the abdominal soft tissue motion. Accurate location of the tumor is very important
      in treatment delivery and reduction of toxicity.

    <textblock>
      Within the last decade, Linac based stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been shown
      to be an effective treatment option for pancreas1, 2 and liver3, 4 tumors. SBRT delivers high
      doses of radiation therapy to the tumor over only 1-5 treatments. Because of the spatial
      precision of SBRT, it is feasible to administer a high radiation dose in only a few
      treatments. By minimizing the amount of radiation to surrounding healthy tissue, it is
      possible to decrease the rate of toxicity/complication and increase the radiation dose to
      cancerous tissue, thereby allowing better local control.

      SBRT of the abdomen has been limited by the movement of intra-abdominal organs that naturally
      occurs with respiration and bowel movement. Organ motion occurs both intra- and
      inter-fractionally. While intra-fractional motion is a result of respiration, peristalsis and
      cardiac motion, the magnitude of inter-fractional target motion is dependent of daily
      variations in organ filling, weight change, tumor growth and radiation induced changes of
      tissue. Tumor movement may lead to tumor displacement and suboptimal dose delivery. Accurate
      localization of the target is very important to improve treatment delivery accuracy and
      reduce toxicity of the treatment. To evaluate tumor motion due to breathing motion, a 4-D CT
      simulation scan is performed. If the tumor moves more than 3 mm during a breathing cycle,
      breathing motion management is employed using Active Breathing Control (ABC) technique. ABC
      requires the patient to hold his/her breath within the proper tidal volume while treatment is
      delivered, while free breathing may be resumed between periods of treatment. This technique
      limits the delivery of RT to specific phases of the respiratory cycle so as to minimize the
      influence of breathing on the delineated tumor.

      Despite significant progress made in ABC technique, tumor and organ motion could only be
      minimized and not eliminated completely with this technique. Assessing patient specific
      tumor/organ motion (both intra- and interfractional) throughout the course of SBRT treatment
      offers the possibility of ensuring delivery of the prescribed target dose while
      simultaneously minimizing normal tissue damage. In order to monitor the abdominal soft tissue
      motion, the Department of Radiation Oncology has developed a 4D ultrasound technique based on
      an ultrasound probe holder and a continuous motion monitoring software. The 4D ultrasound
      image is acquired by using a motorized 3D ultrasound probe and image continuously. 4D
      ultrasound is a new non-ionizing and non-invasive imaging technique that continuously
      monitors the tumor motion during the radiation treatment in real time.

    <description>A 4D ultrasound scan of the pancreas will be acquired at the time at simulation and used as a reference ultrasound image for localizing tracking target. The ultrasound probe will be placed at the abdominal area to monitor the pancreas motion. The probe will remain in place during the CT scan. Patient setup and the ultrasound probe location will be recorded so that the same setup can be reproduced during treatment delivery. The ultrasound probe in the CT image will be contoured and radiation beams that directly pass through the ultrasound probe will be avoided.
On each treatment day, 4D ultrasound images will be acquired continuously during beam on time to monitor pancreas motion. Intra-fraction CBCT images acquired during treatment will be registered with reference CT images. Organ motion registered by ultrasound will be compared to motion recorded by CBCT and the accuracy of the ultrasound system will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>A reference ultrasound scan will be conducted on each subject during breath-hold. Subjects will be required to lie in supine position and engaged with ABC; an ultrasound probe will be placed at the abdomen area with minimal pressure applied. Continuous motion monitoring is achieved by acquiring 4D ultrasound images using a motorized 3D ultrasound probe to image the pancreas, liver and other intra-abdominal organs continuously. Several 4D ultrasound scans will be collected during subsequent breath-holds that serve as secondary images. Additional registration of ultrasound images will be performed with Velocity software to evaluate accuracy of automated registration software in the ultrasound system.</description>
