  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the preventability of serious adverse drug
      reactions (ADRs) related to the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The investigators
      also aim at identifying the underlying causes of these preventable ADRs. The endpoint
      measurements will be compared with a group of patients taking vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs).
      For this purpose, a protocol for a prospective observational study was developed. The study
      was approved by the Ethics Committee of the CHU UCL Namur (site Godinne) and the Cliniques
      Universitaires Saint-Luc. Patients admitted to the emergency department of these two teaching
      hospitals with a thrombotic or a bleeding event while under DOAC or VKA are included. After a
      comprehensive medication history, the appropriateness of prescribing is evaluated, using an
      adapted version of the Medication Appropriateness Index. Causality, severity and
      preventability of adverse events are assessed by two pharmacists and two hematologists using
      predefined scales. Second, for cases of serious and preventable ADRs, semi-structured
      interviews are performed with general practitioners to understand the underlying causes of
      medication errors. Based on the results, risk-minimization strategies that specifically
      target the problems encountered in clinical practice will be proposed.

    <description>Concerning patients taking DOACs, blood samples are drawn to evaluate DOAC plasma concentration. One EDTA tube is also drawn to extract DNA and determine the genetic profile of genes involved in the metabolism of DOACs. The aim will be to assess if genetic determinants can explain the observed interindividual variability in plasma concentrations.</description>
