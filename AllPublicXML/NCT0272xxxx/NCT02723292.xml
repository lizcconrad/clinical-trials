    <textblock>
      As part of a 5-year national effort to reduce teen pregnancy, the University of Rochester is
      partnering with the City of Rochester Department of Recreation and Youth Services to evaluate
      the City's replication of the Teen Outreach Program (TOP™) for 11-14 year old youth
      registered at 11 selected Recreation Centers (RCs). A youth development program with
      demonstrated efficacy to reduce teen pregnancy, school failure and drop-out rates, TOP™ has
      never been studied in RCs. Advancing from efficacy to effectiveness, the investigators will
      also measure program fidelity obtained in RCs.

    <description>This study will replicate the evidence-based TOP™ in after-school sessions held during RC hours. The primary components of TOP™ include: Comprehensive age-appropriate sexuality education; 90-minute sessions, once a week after-school, during the school year for nine months, using the Changing Scenes© curriculum, and at least twenty hours of youth-led service learning, which involves youth in planning, implementing and reflecting on, community service and leadership.</description>

    <description>Youth in the control arm will receive a work readiness training curriculum focused on competencies to secure employment. This will include such topics as building customer service skills, clear and direct communication, and creating a work portfolio.</description>
