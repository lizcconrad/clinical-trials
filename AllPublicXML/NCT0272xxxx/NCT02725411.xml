  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of a fixed dose of tanezumab 5
      mg and 10 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) seven times at 8 week intervals. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the long term safety of tanezumab 5 mg and 10 mg
      administrated SC every 8 weeks (7 administrations). In addition, the study will evaluate the
      long term analgesic efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 10 mg SC administered every 8 weeks (7
      administrations).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group Phase 3
      study of the safety and efficacy of tanezumab when administered by SC injection for up to 56
      weeks in subjects with chronic low back pain. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment groups will include: 1) Placebo SC matching tanezumab
      administered at an 8-week interval (total of 7 times) plus celecoxib 100 mg twice a day (BID)
      to be administered orally for 56 weeks; 2) Tanezumab 5 mg SC administered at an 8-week
      interval (total of 7 times) plus placebo matching celecoxib to be administered orally BID for
      56 weeks; 3) Tanezumab 10 mg SC administered at an 8-week interval (total of 7 times) plus
      placebo matching celecoxib to be administered orally BID for 56 weeks. The study is designed
      with a total duration (post-randomization) of up to 80 weeks and will consist of three
      periods: Screening (up to 37 days; includes a Washout Period and an Initial Pain Assessment
      Period [IPAP]), a Double-blind Treatment Period (56 weeks) and a Follow-up Period (24 weeks).
      The Screening Period (beginning up to 37 days prior to Randomization) includes a Washout
      Period (lasting 2 to 32 days), if required, and an IPAP (the 5 days prior to
      Randomization/Baseline). Prior to entering the study, subjects must be experiencing some
      benefit (eg, analgesic effect) from their current stable dose regimen of oral NSAID
      (celecoxib, loxoprofen or meloxicam) treatment, be tolerating their NSAID regimen, be taking
      this medication regularly (defined as an average of at least 5 days per week) during the 30
      day period prior to the Screening Visit.
