      To compare the effect of a single-agent home intravenous (IV) versus oral antibiotic therapy

      appendicitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain requiring emergent surgical
      intervention in children and approximately one third of patients present with perforation.
      Perforated appendicitis has been demonstrated to have a significant impact on patients and
      families due to the prolonged hospitalization, high complication rates, and tremendous
      economic burden from treatment. The most significant complication following operative
      treatment of perforated appendicitis is intra-abdominal abscess, which develops in
      approximately 20% of children following appendectomy in recent literature. Due to this
      frequent and morbid complication, continued research has been driven at determining the most
      efficacious and cost-effective postoperative antibiotic treatment regimen to reduce
      post-operative abscess. As postoperative abscess rates following appendectomy for perforated
      appendicitis remain high, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate a new postoperative
      antibiotic treatment regimen based on single daily dosing ertapenem while inpatient with
      randomization into ten day completion course of home antibiotics with IV ertapenem versus
      oral amoxicillin/clavulanate. The hypothesis is that the ertapenem based regimen will offer
      reduced rates of postoperative abscess, with no major difference between completion courses
      of home IV versus oral antibiotics.
