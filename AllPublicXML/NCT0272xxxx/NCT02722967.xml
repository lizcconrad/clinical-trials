  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the helpfulness of the integrated call center in optimizing use of the
      Digital Medicine System in adult subjects with Schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder, or
      Bipolar Disorder taking oral aripiprazole.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Digital Medicine System includes a drug-device combination of aripiprazole + an
      ingestible event marker (IEM), a wearable sensor (skin patch), and application software to
      convey the level of activity and rest, and to mark events through the act of ingestion.

      Physician and self-report are the most commonly used to assess medication compliance yet
      studies have consistently found that healthcare providers' subjective judgments of medication
      compliance are often inaccurate, with a tendency for practitioners to overestimate subject
      adherence. The sponsor's intent is to develop a system that will benefit future subjects by
      providing the ability to measure their medication-taking behavior in an objective manner and
      being able to monitor several physiologic parameters.

    <description>The primary outcome was assessed as the establishment of a functional and operational integrated call center with coordinated feedback to the subject and investigative site to optimize the use of DMS as measured by:
Inbound calls (ie, calls from the subject to the integrated call center) by help type;

The number presented in the table is the number of subjects in trial who made (inbound) or received (outbound) calls</description>

      <recruitment_details>This open-label, single-arm trial assessed the functionality of an integrated call center for digital medicine system (DMS) as used by adult subjects (18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at the time of screening) with Schizophrenia (SCH), Bipolar 1 disorder (BP1), or Major depressive disorder (MDD) being treated with oral aripiprazole.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial consisted of a screening period of ≤ 7 days. This period assessed the eligibility criteria at 1 or more visits. An interactive web response system (IWRS) was used to obtain an identification number for each subject with a signed electronic informed consent form (eICF).</pre_assignment_details>
