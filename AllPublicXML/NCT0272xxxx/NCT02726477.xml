    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Wuling San, a traditional
      Chinese medicine, in reducing arm volume excess in women with stage I-II breast cancer
      related unilateral lymphedema.

      The investigators will aim to enroll 200 female adult patients (aged between 20 and 40 years)
      of all ethnicities/races, who have been referred to the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi
      Medical University for breast cancer related unilateral lymphedema. The investigators will be
      using a standardized data collection form in this study, where standard of care will be
      practiced and the patients are not placed at additional risk from participating in this
      study. However, as the investigators are collecting data prospectively, all participants will
      sign consent.

    <description>Volume changes in the arm after the therapy will be calculated using the methods established by Anderson et al (2000). Briefly, the difference in volume measurements between the normal and lymphedematous arms at baseline will be compared to the volume differential after drug treatment (i.e volume excess) using the following formula:
Change in absolute edema=(Vo−Vc)B−(Vo−Vc)3 months/(Vo−Vc)B
Change in ln ratio=ln (Vo/Vc)B−ln (Vo/Vc)3 months.
Vo is the volume of the lymphedema arm. Vc is the volume of the contralateral arm.

    <description>This is a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled, multi-center clinic trial, using before and after treatment measurements.
A total of 200 clinical diagnosed BCRL participants with affected arm circumference 10-40% larger than unaffected arm, are randomly allocated to two groups: the Wuling San group or the placebo group, where the intervention group administers Wuling San, at a dosage of 1g/kg, twice a day for six weeks. The primary outcome measurement will be the percentage of limb volume changes measured by perometry.</description>
