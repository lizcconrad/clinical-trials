      The study is looking at the pneumonia vaccine and the immune system response to this vaccine.
      The information gathered from this study may be important for your doctor to take care of
      patients with smoking histories, immune deficiency, asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD), or elderly patients. It is important that your immune system builds a strong
      defense to the vaccine so that you are better able to fight a bacterium that can cause
      pneumonia. Some disease prevent the immune system from building a strong defense and these
      patients will not benefit from the vaccine.

      One hundred forty subjects will have pre-vaccination titers checked for the 23 serotypes in
      the PPV-23 vaccine. They will then receive the vaccine. All subjects will be given the
      vaccination as standard of care. Approximately 4 weeks following immunization, the subjects
      will have post-vaccination titers checked to the same serotypes checked prior to vaccination.

             steroids in the three months prior to enrollment or oral/intravenous steroids within a
             month of enrollment or two or more prednisone bursts in the past year.
