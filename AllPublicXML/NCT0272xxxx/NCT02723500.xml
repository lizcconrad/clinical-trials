  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects aged 18-85 with lung disease will undergo hyperpolarized Xenon 129 (129-Xe) MRI and
      Pulmonary Function testing for the development of tools to evaluate the Apparent Diffusion
      Coefficient (ADC) and ventilation defect volume obtained by analysis of hyperpolarized 129-Xe
      MRI.

    <textblock>
      Briefly, during a one to two hour visit, subjects will provide written informed consent and
      then undergo:

        1. brief medical history and vital signs,

        2. full pulmonary function tests,

        3. proton MRI,

        4. spin-density and/or diffusion weighted 129Xe MRI.

      Full pulmonary function tests including spirometry, plethysmography and diffusing capacity of
      carbon monoxide (DLCO), Lung Clearance Index (LCI) and Airwave Oscillometry (AO) will be
      performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. MedGraphics Elite Series,
      MedGraphics Corporation. St. Paul, Minnesota USA and/or nDD EasyOne Spirometer, nDD Medical
      Technologies Inc. Andover, Massachusetts USA will be used. All measurements will be performed
      in the Pulmonary Function Laboratory at Robarts Research Institute.

      Subjects will be placed in the 3T Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner with the 129Xe chest coil
      fitted over their torso and chest. Hearing protection will be provided to each subject to
      muffle the noise produced by the gradient radiofrequency (RF) coils. A pulse oximeter lead
      will be attached to all of the subjects to monitor their heart rate and oxygen saturation.
      MRI will be performed for up to a period of 30 minutes. All subjects will have supplemental
      oxygen available via nasal cannula at a flow-rate of 2 liters per minute as a precaution in
      the event of oxygen desaturation.

    <description>Hyperpolarized noble gas imaging using Xenon-129 has been used to explore structural and functional relationships in the lung in patients with lung disease and healthy controls. In contrast to proton-based MRI imaging, 129Xe gas is used as a contrast agent to directly visualize the airways, and thus ventilation. Whereas the normal density of gas is too low to produce an easily detectable signal, this is overcome by artificially increasing the amount of polarization per unit volume using optical pumping.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects male and female aged 18-85 with diagnosed lung disease including but not
             limited to: asthma, emphysema, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),
             bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, alpha 1-anti-trypsin deficiency, and
             lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)

             indicated by signature on the informed consent

          -  Subject must be able to perform a breathhold for 16s.

          -  Subject is judged to be in otherwise stable health on the basis of medical history

          -  Subject able to perform reproducible pulmonary function testing (i.e., the 3 best
             acceptable spirograms have Forced Expiratory Volume at one second (FEV1) values that
             do not vary more than 5% of the largest value or more than 100 ml, whichever is
             greater.)

          -  FEV1 &gt;25% predicted

          -  Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)&gt; 25% predicted and &gt;0.5 liter

        Exclusion Criteria:

             preventing informed consent from being obtained, or cannot read or understand the
             written material.

          -  Subject has a daytime room air oxygen saturation ≤ 92% ± 2% while supine.

          -  Patient is unable to perform spirometry or plethysmography maneuvers

          -  Subject unable to tolerate MRI due to patient size and/or known history of
             claustrophobia.

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating

          -  In the investigator's opinion, subject suffers from any physical, psychological or
             other condition(s) that might prevent performance of the MRI, such as severe
             claustrophobia.
