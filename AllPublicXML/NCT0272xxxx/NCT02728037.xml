  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, single-centre superiority trial
      with two parallel groups. The primary outcome will be average myofascial pelvic pain in the
      two weeks following final injection treatment as assessed using the visual analogue scale.
      Randomization will be performed as block randomization with a 1:1 allocation ratio,
      stratified based on opioid use at the time of study enrollment. In total, 60 participants
      will be recruited and randomized, with 30 being assigned to each treatment arm. The study
      will be restricted such that none of the participants enrolled will be current concomitant
      opioid users (for any reason) and will not have used opioid drugs within the 3 months
      preceding enrollment in the study.

      A third non-randomized arm of 30 participants who are on the waiting list for the chronic
      pain clinic will be enrolled and compared to the two randomized arms. Among this patient
      population and in the setting of the Chronic Pain Clinic it was determined that it would not
      be acceptable to randomize participants to a no-treatment control group. As such, an active
      treatment is being used as comparator in the randomized trial. In order to assess
      participants in the absence of treatment this third non-randomized arm will serve as a
      no-treatment control group.

      Eligibility criteria for this third arm is the same as the main study, except for the
      restriction by opioid use status. Participation in this third arm will not exclude a
      participant from randomization into one of the two main arms of the study. Therefore, across
      the three arms, up to 90 patients will be enrolled in this study.

      Study Setting: This study will be conducted at the Chronic Pain Clinic at Hotel Dieu Hospital
      and the General Gynecology Clinic at Kingston General Hospital in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.
      All of the physicians who provide trigger point injection treatment for chronic pelvic pain
      in the Chronic Pain Clinic have agreed to participate as co-investigators in this study (RN,
      RH, and SC). Women are referred to this clinic for treatment of chronic pelvic pain by both
      primary care providers and gynecologists in the Kingston and surrounding area. Two of the
      investigators (RN and SC) see patients in the General Gynecology Clinic for assessment and
      management of chronic pelvic pain. Both investigators regularly refer patients to the Chronic
      Pain Clinic for consideration of trigger point injections.

      Participant Timeline: Participants in this study will be followed for a total of 8 treatments
      and 9 study visits over a period of 12 weeks. Participants in the third wait-listed arm of
      the study will be followed for 3 visits over a period of 12 weeks.

      Treatment Arms, Baseline Visit &amp; Treatment 1: At the baseline study visit a research nurse
      will administer a questionnaire in order to obtain a thorough medical history and collect
      information on participant demographics. The research nurse will then administer the VAS pain
      scale and pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire based on the participant's
      experiences in the week preceding the baseline visit and the WHOQOL-BREF based on the
      participant's experiences in the 4 weeks preceding the baseline visit. A study investigator
      will then mix and administer the trigger point injections. The research nurse will remain
      present for the treatment to assist with recording and administer the VAS pain scale for
      procedural discomfort immediately following completion of treatment.

      Treatment Arms, Follow Up Visits &amp; Treatments 2-8: In total, participants will be seen for 7
      follow up visits with additional treatment. Visits 2 through 4 will be done on a weekly basis
      and visits 5 through 8 will be done bi-weekly, for a total time of 11 weeks. At these visits
      a research nurse will administer the VAS pain scale and pelvic pain specific functional
      questionnaire based on the participant's experiences in the week preceding the visit. The
      research nurse will ask further questions about concomitant medication usage and screen
      participants for any adverse event or injection-associated complications. In addition at
      visit 5 the research nurse will administer the WHOQOL-BREF. A study investigator will then
      mix and administer the trigger point injections. The research nurse will remain present for
      the treatment to assist with recording and administer the VAS pain scale for procedural
      discomfort immediately following completion of treatment.

      Treatment Arms, Final Study Visit 9: For participants who undergo a full course of treatment
      the final study visit will be visit 9 and will occur 12 weeks after the baseline visit. If a
      woman chooses to conclude treatment early, for any reason, then the final visit will occur
      earlier than 12 weeks. However, the final visit must always be done at least 1 week after the
      final trigger point injection treatment. At the final study visit a research nurse will
      administer the VAS pain scale and pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire based on the
      participant's experiences in the week preceding the visit and the WHOQOL-BREF based on the
      participant's experiences in the 4 weeks preceding the visit. The research nurse will ask
      further questions about concomitant medication usage and screen participants for any adverse
      event or injection-associated complications. In order to assess blinding participants will be
      asked which treatment they believed they received and their reasons for this belief.
      Participants will also be asked if they would recommend the treatment to others experiencing
      myofascial pelvic pain. Finally, participants will be offered continuation of treatment under
      the care of the primary investigator with an injection formulation of their choosing if they
      are still experiencing myofascial pelvic pain.

      Wait-List Arm, Baseline, Follow Up and Final Study Visit: At the baseline study visit a
      research nurse will administer a questionnaire in order to obtain a thorough medical history
      and collect information on participant demographics. The research nurse will then administer
      the VAS pain scale and pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire based on the
      participant's experiences in the week preceding the baseline visit and the WHOQOL-BREF based
      on the participant's experiences in the 4 weeks preceding the baseline visit. The research
      nurse will ask further questions about concomitant medication usage. A follow up visit will
      be completed 5 weeks after the baseline visit. At this visit a research nurse will administer
      the VAS pain scale and pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire based on the
      participant's experiences in the week preceding the visit and the WHOQOL-BREF based on the
      participant's experiences in the 4 weeks preceding the visit. The research nurse will ask
      further questions about concomitant medication usage. For participants who are on the
      wait-list for at least 12 weeks the final study visit will occur 12 weeks after the baseline
      visit. If a woman is on the wait-list for under 12 weeks then the final study visit will
      occur at her first visit to the Chronic Pain Clinic. At the final study visit a research
      nurse will administer the VAS pain scale and pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire
      based on the participant's experiences in the week preceding the visit and the WHOQOL-BREF
      based on the participant's experiences in the 4 weeks preceding the visit. The research nurse
      will ask further questions about concomitant medication usage.

    <measure>Mean Change in Average Pelvic Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure a comparison of the two treatment arms. It is the mean change in average pain in the week preceding the study visit, from baseline to final visit, as measured by the visual analogue pain scale. Using this scale participants rate their average pain over the last week on a scale from 0 to 10 by drawing an &quot;x&quot; on the horizontal line. This line is 10cm long and the participant's pain level is measured using a ruler to the millimeter mark and translated to a score out of 100mm. If the &quot;x&quot; falls between millimeter marks on the ruler the reader will round up to the nearest mark.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Functional Pelvic Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the two treatment arms. Function will be scored at each visit using a validated functional pelvic pain scale. The functions of bladder, bowel, intercourse, walking, running, lifting, working and sleeping are each rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 4. With 0 corresponding to no pain and normal function and 4 corresponding to an inability to function because of pain. Participants are asked to rank these functions based on when their pain was at its worst in the last week. Both individual functions and overall function score will be considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the two treatment arms. Quality of life will be scored using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) at the baseline, fifth, and final visit. The WHOQOL-BREF assesses quality of life in 4 domains of physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment through a series of 26 questions using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Changes in each of these 4 domains over the course of treatment will be considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Average Daily Concomitant Opioid Analgesic Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit participants will be asked to report their average daily concomitant analgesic medication usage during the preceding week, which will be recorded in the concomitant medication log. Type of medication, dosage and frequency of usage will be recorded. This comparison will focus on opioid medication usage and the summary measure of number of days in the preceding week that at least one dose of an opioid medication was required will be used. If a participant required at least one dose of opioid medication every day of the preceding week then they will be assigned a summary measure of 7. If they only required at least one dose of opioid medication on two days in the preceding week then they will be assigned a summary measure of 2. Changes in these summary measures over the 12 week course of treatment will be compared between the two treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Procedural Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the two treatment arms. At each visit participants will be asked to report the level of pain experienced during administration of injections. Immediately following administration, participants will report this using the same visual analogue scale used to measure the primary outcome. Each participants average procedural pain score over the course of treatment will be calculated. These average procedural pain will be compared between treatment groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Resolution of Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the two treatment arms. The time to resolution of symptoms to a manageable level in weeks of treatment will be compared between groups. Participants will stop receiving treatment either at their 8th visit (12 weeks from baseline) or earlier if they choose. Only those women who indicate that their pain has reached a manageable level at the time of treatment conclusion will be included in this analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complications and/or Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the two treatment arms. At each study visit participants will be asked about any complications or adverse events that they may have experienced. Participants will also be monitored for complications and adverse events during the course of treatment at the pain clinic. The type and frequency of complications and adverse events will be compared between groups.</description>
