    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to estimate the R0 resection rate in patients with Resectable
      Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (R-PDAC) as well as those with Resectable Pancreatic Ductal
      Adenocarcinoma (BR-PDAC) independently in response to neoadjuvant sequential therapy of
      combination nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in both cohorts will receive a total of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant combination
      chemotherapy of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, followed by re-staging CT scan, if re-staging
      CT does not show evidence of metastatic disease. Patients will receive SBRT and definitive
      surgical resection. Subsequently, patients will receive 3 cycles of adjuvant combination
      chemotherapy of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Each cycle of combination chemotherapy will
      be a total of 4 weeks. Patients will be evaluated for response at completion of the 3 cycles
      of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with CT scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients
      will undergo surveillance CT scan at 3-month intervals until evidence of disease progression.
