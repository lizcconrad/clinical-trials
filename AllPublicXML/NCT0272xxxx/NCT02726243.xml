      Build a collection of fecal microbiota in order to determine the characteristics of gut
      microbiota associated with colorectal cancer in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are chronic and relapsing disabling disease. Crohn's disease
      (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two main types of IBD.

      Patients with IBD are at greater risk of intestinal infection including viral infections
      (including cytomegalovirus) and bacterial (especially Clostridium difficile). In the long
      term, patients with colonic involvement are at an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).
      Moreover, it has been reported in several cohort studies that patients with primary
      sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) associated with IBD (PSC-IBD), have an even increased risk of
      CRC (about 10 to 20% at 10 years). Other studies also suggest that the microbiota has an
      impact on liver diseases. Conversely, cholestatic liver diseases (such as PSC) can influence
      the microbiota, notably through modification of the production of bile acids. Finally, the
      role of the gut microbiota in the development of the CRC in IBD has been well established in
      animal models. The pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood but may involve an
      alteration of the balance between protective bacteria against harmful microbiota.

      This study aims to investigate the link between gut microbiota, intestinal inflammation,
      colorectal cancer, bile acid and liver diseases and this, through the creation of a
      biological collection of fecal microbiota from fecal samples from 8 groups of subjects: (i)
      IBD without CCR (ii) IBD with CCR, (iii) IBD with dysplasia, (iv) non IBD without CCR, (v)
      non IBD with CCR, (vi) IBD-CSP without CCR, (vii ) IBD-CSP with CCR, (viii) IBD-CSP with
      dysplasia. In these patients, microbiota composition will be assessed by sequencing
      technology.
