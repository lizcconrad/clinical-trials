  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first of three planned phases designed to evaluate the feasibility and
      tolerability of TubeClear® to restore patency in occluded Pediatric Enteral Access Devices.
      Based on preliminary data obtained from this phase of the study, subsequent phases will
      continue to evaluate feasibility and tolerability (Phase IIA) and ultimately compare efficacy
      of TubeClear® to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Standard Treatment to restore
      patency in occluded Pediatric Enteral Access Devices (EAD) (Phase IIB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Occluded enteral access devices (EADs) are a significant problem for pediatric patients, with
      occlusion rates ranging from 12.5% to 35%. Occluded EADs can lead to extended times of
      decreased energy intake, resulting in patients quickly exhausting their energy reserves and
      developing dehydration with electrolyte abnormalities. Current methods used to restore
      patency to an occluded EAD at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) involve
      application of enzymes and chemicals (e.g., Clog Zapper), which have variable rates of timely
      success. If these methods are unsuccessful and patency cannot be restored, the EAD must be
      replaced and may require radiological intervention with exposure to radiation and contrast
      material. TubeClear® addresses this clinical need to safely and efficaciously restore patency
      to occluded EADs at the patients' bedside while the EAD remains in the patient. Additionally,
      this reduces the need to transport the patient to the radiology suite with subsequent
      exposure to radiation and contrast material for EAD location conformation after replacement.

      Current Study (Phase I): Feasibility and tolerability of TubeClear® intervention in 10
      consecutive eligible Subjects with occluded Enteral Access Devices who are between eight (8)
      years of age and have not attained their 18th birthday.

      Following successful completion of Phase I as deemed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB),
      the Study will proceed to Phase IIA and IIB to run concurrently.

      Future Studies:

      Phase IIA: Ability of TubeClear® intervention to restore patency in 20 consecutive eligible
      Subjects with occluded Enteral Access Devices who are between eight (8) years of age and have
      not attained their 11th birthday.

      Phase IIB: Randomized efficacy comparison between 17 subjects using the TubeClear®
      intervention and 17 subjects using CHOP Standard Treatment in eligible Subjects with occluded
      Enteral Access Devices who are between 11 years of age and have not attained their 18th
      birthday.

    <description>Feasibility will be defined as ability of the user to operate TubeClear® from clearing stem insertion into the occluded Enteral Access Device through activation to patency restoration. Successful restoration of patency will be defined as the ability to flush the EAD(P) with 10ml of air within five minutes following the intervention by the investigator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Age-Appropriate Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 days post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability will be defined as ability of the subject to undergo TubeClear® intervention. To assess this, subject pain will be assessed before and after use of TubeClear® intervention and then daily for up to 3 days post-intervention using one of the well-established age-appropriate pain scales. Based on subject age, one of the following pain scale assessments will be used: Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Scale; Revised Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (rFLACC) scale; FACES pain scale revised (FPS-R); Numeric Pain Scale; or Nursing Judgement</description>

    <description>To determine feasibility and tolerability, 10 subjects will receive the TubeClear® intervention. If the TubeClear® intervention is unable to restore Enteral Access Device patency, further steps to restore patency of the occluded EAD will be determined by the clinical team per usual practice.</description>
