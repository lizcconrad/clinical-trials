      Objective: To improve local control following complete resection of a single brain metastasis
      using fractionated local stereotactic radiotherapy, whilst maintaining neurological
      functioning, neurocognition and quality of life.

      Study design: Multicenter randomized phase III, with at least three high-volume Dutch centers
      participating in the trial. Stratification on primary tumor type and age.

      Study population: Patients undergoing complete resection of a single brain metastasis,
      confirmed by an early (i.e. within 72 hours) postoperative contrast-enhanced MR scan.

      Study intervention: Patients will be randomized between observation alone (standard arm) and
      local stereotactic radiotherapy in three fractions of 8 Gy to the surgical cavity (study
      arm).

      Main study parameters: Primary objective: local control rate at 6 months. Secondary
      objectives: local control rate at 12 months, neurological functioning, freedom from clinical
      neurological progression, performance status, quality of life, toxicity, steroid use,
      neurocognition and overall survival.

      The objective of this study is to improve local control following complete resection of a
      single brain metastasis of solid tumors using fractionated local stereotactic radiotherapy,
      whilst maintaining neurological functioning, neurocognition and quality of life. The study is
      performed in the form of a multicenter randomized phase III, with at least three high-volume
      Dutch centers participating in the trial. Stratification will be performed on primary tumor
      type and age. A total of 70 patients will be included. Inclusion is restricted to patients
      who underwent a complete resection of a single brain metastasis, confirmed by an early (i.e.
      within 72 hours) postoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) scan. Patients will
      be randomized between observation alone (standard arm) and local stereotactic radiotherapy in
      three fractions of 8 Gy to the surgical cavity (study arm).The main study parameters are:
      local control rate at 6 months (primary outcome measure) and local control rate at 12 months,
      neurological functioning, freedom from clinical neurological progression, performance status,
      quality of life, toxicity, steroid use, neurocognition and overall survival (secondary
      outcome measures). Follow up will be performed at three-monthly interval during the first two
      years, including MRI scans. Quality of life questionaires and neurocognitive functioning
      tests will be performed at fixed intervals during follow-up.

    <time_frame>baseline, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive testing will be performed at baseline, at three, six and twelve months follow-up using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R). The HVLT-R is one of the components used to form the core set of cognitive tests recommended to use in oncology trials. This test measures immediate memory span, provides a learning curve, measures both short-term and longer-term retention, and allows for a comparison between retrieval efficiency and learning. This version includes 3 learning trials of a 12-word list, an interval of 20 minutes a delayed recall, and a recognition trial consisting of the target words interspersed with distractor words. The score on the recognition trial is the total number of correct response. This measure has adequate psychometric properties and 6 multiple forms.</description>

    <measure>Decrease in specified neurocognitive test results using the Trail Making A and B, in full cohorts</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive testing will be performed at baseline, at three, six and twelve months follow-up using the Trail Making A and B. This test is one of the components used to form the core set of cognitive tests recommended to use in oncology trials. This is a test of visual conceptual and visuomotor tracking. It measures psychomotor speed and aspects of executive function. It is given in two parts, A and B. The subject must first draw lines to connect consecutively numbered circles on one work sheet (part A) and then connect the same number of consecutively numbered and lettered circles on another worksheet by alternating between the two sequences (part B). The subject is urged to connect the circles as fast as possible</description>

    <description>Neurocognitive testing will be performed at baseline, at three, six and twelve months follow-up using the Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA). The COWA is one of the components used to form the core set of cognitive tests recommended to use in oncology trials. This test measures speeded verbal fluency and aspects of executive function. In this test, subjects are asked to generate as many words as possible in 1 minute beginning with &quot;B&quot;, &quot;D,&quot; and &quot;H&quot;. It has two forms.</description>

    <measure>Decrease in neurocognitive test results using using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) III Digit Span and WAIS III Digit Symbol, in full cohorts</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive testing will be performed at baseline, at three, six and twelve months follow-up using the WAIS III Digit Span and WAIS III Digit Symbol. These added cognitive tests are also chosen based on their proven sensitivity to measure change in neuro-oncology patients. The subtest of the WAIS-III (Digit Span) involves forward and backward repetitions of series of digits and provides measures of concentration. This measure has adequate psychometric properties.
The subtest of the WAIS III (Digit Symbol) involves a symbol substitution task that requires visual-motor coordination, motor persistence, and sustained attention. The test is used as a test for information processing speed. The task consists of pairing numbers to nonsense symbols as quickly as possible.</description>

    <measure>Decrease in neurocognitive test results using the Grooved Pegboard, in full cohorts</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive testing will be performed at baseline, at three, six and twelve months follow-up using the Grooved Pegboard. This added cognitive test is also chosen based on its proven sensitivity to measure change in neuro-oncology patients. This test measures motor speed and dexterity and is an adjusted version of the Purdue Pegboard test. The test consists out of plywood with 2 columns of 30 holes and a zinced bowl filled with metal pegs above each column. Subjects are offered one minute to put as many pegs as possible into the holes. The test has two different trials: dominant hand only and non-dominant hand only.</description>
