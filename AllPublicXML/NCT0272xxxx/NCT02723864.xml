  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The drug cisplatin treats certain cancers when given with other chemotherapy drugs.
      Researchers think combining cisplatin with 2 other drugs could block proteins that support
      cancer cell growth. The other drugs are ABT-888 (veliparib) and VX-970. They want to test if
      this drug combination slows the growth of cancer and is safe.

      Objectives:

      To test the safety and tolerability of VX-970 and veliparib combined with cisplatin in people
      with advanced refractory solid tumors. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of these
      drugs.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with:

        -  Solid tumors that have progressed after treatment or for which no treatment exists

        -  Normal organ and marrow function

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  CT scan or MRI

        -  Blood and urine tests

      Participants will get the study drugs in 3-week cycles:

        -  Cisplatin in a vein on 1 or 2 days

        -  VX-970 in a vein on 2 days

        -  Veliparib by mouth twice a day on 6 days

      In each cycle, participants will have 5 physical exams and blood tests 5 times.

      In some cycles, participants will have CT scans or MRIs.

      In cycle 1, participants may have 2 tumor biopsies. A small piece of tissue is removed by
      needle.

      Participants will keep a study diary. They will write when they take the drugs and if they
      have side effects.

      Participants will stay in the study as long as they tolerate the drugs and their tumors are
      not getting worse.

      Participants will have a phone call about a month after their last dose.

      Background:

        -  Ataxia-telangiectasia-related (ATR) protein kinase is central to the DNA damage response
           and homologous recombination, activating a series of phosphorylation cascades,
           culminating in cell cycle arrest to allow time for DNA repair. ATR additionally
           facilitates homologous recombination repair through modulation of the p53-replication
           protein A (p53-RPA) complex bound to ssDNA during the DNA repair process.

        -  Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) plays a pivotal role in base-excision repair of
           single strand breaks formed either due to direct genotoxic stress or during the
           processing of double strand breaks. PARP also plays a role in alternative end joining,
           which may contribute to combination activity. PARP-1 binding to sites of DNA damage
           results in activation of its catalytic activity and generation of chains of poly
           (ADP-ribosyl)ated polymers, which serve as docking sites for recruitment of DNA repair
           proteins.

        -  Veliparib (ABT-888) is a potent PARP 1/2 inhibitor with clinical evidence of
           potentiation of antitumor activity in combination with cisplatin in BRCA mutation
           carriers and patients with sporadic triple-negative breast cancer.

        -  VX-970 is a potent ATR inhibitor, with IC(50) of 20 nM and antitumor activity across a
           broad range of cell lines in combination with DNA damaging agents. Preclinical studies
           show VX-970 synergizes with cisplatin to induce DNA damage and antitumor activity. The
           addition of PARP inhibitor veliparib with ATR inhibitor VX-970 allows for impairment of
           DNA repair, the induction of a BRCA null phenotype, and potentiation of the antitumor
           activity of cisplatin.

      Primary Objective:

      -To establish the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination of VX-970 and veliparib in combination with cisplatin in patients with advanced
      refractory solid tumors

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of the combination of VX-970, veliparib, and cisplatin on markers
           of DNA damage and apoptosis

        -  To assess antitumor activity of the combination

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors for which all standard therapy
           known to prolong survival has failed in the metastatic setting, or for which standard
           therapies do not exist

        -  Patients must have had no major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior
           to entering the study

        -  Patients must have adequate organ function

      Study Design:

        -  Initially VX-970 will be administered intravenously on Days 2 and 9 of each 21-day
           cycle. Veliparib will be administered orally twice a day (q12 hours +/- 1 hour) for Days
           1-3 and 8-10 of each 21-day cycle. Cisplatin will be administered at 40 mg/m2
           intravenously on Day 1 (and Day 8 from DL3 onwards) of each 21-day cycle.

        -  As of Amendment I (12/7/2017), patients who have been on study for at least 6 cycles may
           have cisplatin administration held or discontinued at the discretion of the PI, Dr.
           Chen, in recognition of the cumulative neurotoxicity seen with cisplatin treatment. If
           cisplatin is not administered during a cycle VX970 will be administered on Days 1 and 8
           of that cycle.

        -  The escalation portion of the trial will follow a standard 3+3 design, whereby patients
           will be dose escalated in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting toxicity is observed

        -  Once the MTD is established, up to 15 additional patients will be enrolled to an
           expansion phase at the MTD. Mandatory tumor biopsies will be obtained in the expansion
           phase to assess PD endpoints

               -  The effects of VX-970 and veliparib on the developing human fetus are unknown.
                  For this reason and because cisplatin is known to be teratogenic, women of
                  childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
                  or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the
                  duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completing study
                  treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
                  her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating
                  physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree
                  to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
                  participation, and for 6 months after completion of administration of study
                  agents.

               -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
                  because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with VX-970. In
                  addition, these subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
                  with marrow-suppressive therapy.

               -  Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets or capsules. Nasogastric or G-tube

          -  Patients with known active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded
             from this clinical trial. Patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained
             stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks following treatment of brain metastases
             are eligible to participate at the discretion of the principal investigator.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             untreated infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients required to be on any of the concomitant medications are excluded.

          -  Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because
             the effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown.
