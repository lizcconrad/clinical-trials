      STUDY TITLE:

      A Multiple Site Study to Evaluate the Irritation and Sensitization Potential of Repeat
      Applications of Rotigotine Transdermal System, 1 mg/24 hr Versus Neupro (Rotigotine
      Transdermal System), 1 mg/24 hr in Healthy Volunteers

      TEST DRUG / INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:

      Rotigotine Transdermal System, 1 mg/24 hr

      INDICATION STUDIED:

      Bioequivalence - Irritation and Sensitization

      STUDY DESIGN:

        -  Multiple-site, randomized, multiple-application, evaluator-blinded, controlled study

    <description>The primary endpoint of cumulative irritation was the measurement of the combined &quot;Dermal response&quot; and &quot;Other Effect&quot; total irritation scores recorded during the 21 day continuous application period (i.e. the total irritation score for a specific subject was the sum of the irritation scores recorded on Days 2 through 22 for each patch type). Because the cumulative irritation scores did not display a normal distribution, the primary analysis was a comparison of the overall median of the observed total irritation score of the Test patch against the Reference patch. The Per Protocol Population for Irritation (PPPI) was used for the primary analysis</description>

    <description>The primary analysis of sensitization used the Per Protocol Population for Sensitization (PPPS) and compared the number and percentage (%) of reactions indicating potential sensitization (irritation score greater than or equal to 2 at 48 or 72 hours post-removal, along with the Investigator's assessment) observed with each patch type</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and non-pregnant female volunteers. All subjects were healthy,
             non-smoking male and female (nonpregnant) volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65,
             who were demonstrated to be generally healthy by screening medical and medication
             history, physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and FSH
             levels (if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Reported receiving any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Day 1 patch
             application.

          2. Reported a clinically significant illness during the 28 days prior to Day 1 patch
             application (as determined by the Investigator[s]).

          3. Reported a history of allergic response(s) to rotigotine or related drugs.

          4. Reported a history of sulfite sensitivity.

          5. Demonstrated a clinically relevant finding, as determined by the clinical
             Investigator(s), on the screening ECG, such as a second- or third-degree
             atrioventricular block or complete bundle branch block, or arrhythmias.

          6. Reported a history of asthma, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, syncope, or
             dyskinesia. At the discretion of the Principal Investigator, subjects with a history
             of asthma or mild asthma not requiring regular treatment could have been included.

          7. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 or &gt;145 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 or &gt; 95
             mmHg at screening measured in supine position after 5 minutes rest; heart rate &lt; 50 or
             &gt; 100 at screening.

          8. Reported a history of narrow angle glaucoma.

          9. Reported the use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, reserpine, methyldopa,
             antipsychotics, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, clozapine, olanzapine,
             quetiapine, metoclopramide, or risperidone within 3 months of enrollment.

             investigative sites were acceptable.

         14. Reported a history of conditions that would significantly influence the immune
             response (e.g. primary or acquired immunodeficiencies such as HIV positive or AIDS, or
             generalized drug reaction, neoplasms such as lymphoma or leukemia, moderate or severe
             rheumatoid arthritis or active systemic lupus erythematosus).

         15. Demonstrated an obvious difference in skin color amongst application sites, presence
             of a skin condition, excessive hair (subjects that agreed to have their hair clipped
             short [not shaved] prior to patch application were eligible), scar tissue, recent
             sunburn, tattoo, open sore, body piercing, or branding at the intended sites of
             application that would interfere with placement of study articles, skin assessment or
             reactions to drug.

             or exaggerate responses to the patches or that would alter inflammatory or immune
             responses to the patches within 21 days prior to Day 1 patch application (e.g.
             cyclosporine, tacrolimus, systemic or topical corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs, immune
             globulin, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG], monoclonal antibodies, radiation therapy).

         18. Reported the use of any anti-inflammatory medication, including ibuprofen and
             Celebrex, within 72 hours of Day 1 patch application, with the exception of steroid
             nose drops and/or eye drops.

         19. Reported the use of antihistamines or topical drugs at the patch site within 72 hours
             of Day 1 patch application.

         25. Demonstrated a positive pregnancy screen (females only). Subjects with a positive
             result at screening were to be excluded from the study. Subjects with a positive
             result during the study were to be withdrawn.

         26. Reported smoking or using tobacco products or was currently using nicotine products
