  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect additional data on safety and performance of Phasix™
      Mesh in subjects requiring VHWG Grade 3 midline hernia repair.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 85 subjects, at approximately 12 sites across Europe will be enrolled and
      treated to study the use of Phasix™ Mesh. All treated subjects will be followed for 2 years
      post-implantation.

Occurrences at the surgical site will be assessed by physical examination at each study visit through 3 months.

    <description>Proportion of subjects with hernia recurrence. Hernia recurrence rates will be assessed by physical examination (or if standard of care via CT/MRI or ultrasonography) at each study visit through 24 months. A recurrent hernia will be defined as any hernia identified or confirmed by the investigator, during any study follow-up visit, in approximately the same position as the hernia repaired in the study procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical Site Infections</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of subjects with surgical site infections. Infections at the surgical site will be assessed by physical examination at each study visit through 24 months. If an infection is suspected, a routine culture, obtained via each site's standard protocol, should be obtained to determine cell count and type (i.e. yeast, gram positive or gram negative bacteria, or other). If genus and species of the culture are identified as part of the routine practice at the site, that information should be recorded. Classification will follow the CDC guidelines for superficial, deep and organ/space surgical site infections.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be diagnosed with incisional midline hernia.

          -  Subject has a VHWG Grade 3 hernia (as defined in the protocol).

          -  Size of hernia ≥ 10 cm2.

          -  Subject must be willing to undergo a planned retro-rectus hernia repair (onlay allowed
             as an exception when retro-rectus placement cannot be achieved; using absorbable
             suture) with or without Component Separation Technique.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with &gt; 4 previous repairs of the hernia under observation.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35 kg/m2.

          -  The subject is on, or suspected to be placed on, chemotherapy medications during any
             part of the study.

          -  The subject has peritonitis.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (if documented in the subject's
             record).

          -  The subject has cirrhosis of the liver and/or ascites.

          -  Subject is American Society of Anesthesiology Class 4 or 5.

          -  Complete removal of existing mesh from a prior hernia repair (in the same affected
             area) is not possible.

          -  The hernia repair requires more than a single piece mesh (with adequate overlap beyond
             the margins of the defect on all sides).

          -  Subject has intact permanent mesh adjacent to the current hernia to be repaired.

          -  Subject's hernia repair requires intraabdominal mesh placement.

          -  Surgical technique requires surgical bridge repair as the sole repair.

          -  Subject has any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude the
             use of the study device, or preclude the subject from completing the follow-up
             requirements.

          -  Subject is pregnant or has plans to become pregnant during the study period or is
             currently breastfeeding.

          -  Subject has an alcohol/substance abuse problem or has had a relapse within 12 months
             of the screening visit.

          -  Subject was involved in another interventional clinical study in the last 30 days
             prior to ICF signature.

          -  Subject is part of the site personnel directly involved with this study.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy of less than 2 years at the time of enrollment.

          -  Subject has a known sensitivity to Phasix™ Mesh or component materials (patients with
             known allergies to tetracycline hydrochloride or kanamycin sulfate should be avoided).
