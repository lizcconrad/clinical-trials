  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 24-hour urine pilot study was conducted as part of the 2013 NHANES to test the feasibility
      of implementing a 24-hour urine collection as part of NHANES in 2014.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 24-hour urine pilot study was conducted March - June 2013 in three NHANES locations. A
      random half-sample of non-pregnant US adults, aged 20-69 who were examined in the NHANES
      mobile examination center were selected. Participants received instructions, started and
      ended the urine collection in a urine study mobile examination center (UMEC), and answered
      questions about collection. A random half of participants who collected a complete 24-h urine
      were asked to collect a second 24-h urine. Urinary sodium, potassium, chloride, and
      creatinine excretion were analyzed.

      Participation rates in two other post-examination components, the Physical Activity Monitor
      and the Dietary Recall, were monitored to determine whether collecting a 24-hour urine had an
      effect on response rates for the two components.
