  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiaiton (APBI)
      before a lumpectomy is performed. By administering the APBI before the lumpectomy, a smaller
      volume of breast tissue may be exposed to radiation. The APBI method used in this study is 3D
      (three dimensional) conformal external beam irradiation. 3D-conformal external beam
      irradiation uses an X-ray beam to deliver the radiation dose. Traditionally, CT imaging is
      used to plan treatment. In this study, an MRI will be used. Approximately five to eight weeks
      after completion of the APBI, the cancer will be surgically removed.

      This study will examine the feasibility, complication rates, cosmetic results and local
      control rate of 3D-CRT confined to the region of the lumpectomy cavity for patients with
      Stage I and IIa (less than or equal to 3 cm) carcinoma of the breast (non-lobular histology)
      treated with APBI using 3D-CRT before lumpectomy. This study also will test the feasibility
      of MRI-based treatment planning for preoperative accelerated partial breast irradiation and
      compare dosimetric data from treatment planning with patients treated on a previous
      institutional post-op APBI protocol. It will also look at overall survival rates. Correlative
      studies include measuring the changes in tumor gene expression and immune response to
      radiation therapy and correlate this with pathologic response.

    <measure>Postoperative Complication Rates following Preoperative APBI</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative complications (the primary endpoint of the study) will be defined as any complication occurring within three months of surgery. These will be measured by CTCAE.
The complication rate measured on this study will be compared to a historical control of 32% of patients. This will be measured on an individual patient level. A surgical complication rate that exceeds 31% will be considered unacceptable and result in a negative study. A postoperative complication rate of 14% or less will be considered a successful demonstration of the safety of this treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rates of Re-excision</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The need for surgical re-excision after the initial lumpectomy because of close or positive margins will be determined by the treating surgeon and radiation oncologist. For any patient with a positive margin, re-excision is required unless technically not possible (i.e. poor anesthesia risk for the patient, inability to resect additional breast tissue at the site of the positive margin). The re-excision rate and rate of partial/complete response with be estimated with exact confidence intervals, and compared to historical controls using Chi-Square or Fisher's exact tests.</description>

    <description>Selected patients will undergo a radiation planning procedure utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Once this is completed, patients will receive five radiation treatments given every other day. After 28 days (four weeks), patients will have another MRI scan to compare tumor response to the radiation therapy. Following the MRI scan, roughly five to eight weeks later, patients will have a lumpectomy and possibly a sentinel lymph node biopsy. After surgery, tests will be performed on the tumor tissue to determine if genes expressed in the sample have changed. Following surgery, patients will receive chemotherapy and/or antihormone therapy at the discretion of the patient and physician.</description>

             radiation therapy.

          -  Prior breast augmentation, including breast implants, is allowed.

          -  Patients with a prior history of contralateral breast cancer will be considered
             eligible if they completed all treatment (including anti-endocrine therapy) more than
             five years prior to registration.

          -  Patients must not have a prior treatment of malignancy diagnosed or treated within the
             past five years, with the exception of non-melanomatous skin cancer, carcinoma in situ

          -  Interested patients must meet with a medical oncologist prior to study entry to
             determine if Oncotype testing is recommended. If recommended and patient is amenable
             to the possibility of receiving chemotherapy, there must be adequate biopsy tissue for
             testing. If adequate tissue is not available for the Oncotype testing, patients who
             are very interested in participation may undergo additional biopsies. If a patient
             plans to refuse chemotherapy regardless of a high Oncotype results and elects to forgo
             the test, they will still be eligible for enrollment.

          -  Patients must have had estrogen and progesterone receptor analysis performed on the
             biopsy specimen prior to study entry according to current ASCO/CAP Guideline
             Recommendations for hormone receptor testing. Testing for her2 neu expression must
             also be performed and recorded prior to study entry.

          -  Appropriate stage and pre-treatment evaluation for protocol entry, including no
             clinical evidence for distant metastases, based upon the following minimum diagnostic
             workup:

               -  History/Physical examination, including breast exam (inspection and palpation of
                  the breasts) with documentation of weight and Zubrod Performance Status of 0-2
                  within 28 days prior to study entry.

               -  Right and left mammography within 60 days of diagnostic biopsy establishing
                  diagnosis.

               -  Evaluation of the axilla by ultrasound and biopsy of all enlarged or abnormal
                  appearing lymph nodes within 28 days prior to study entry.

               -  Clip placed within the biopsy proven breast cancer, with verification of
                  placement by mammogram.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  AJCC clinical T3, N1-3, M1, stage IIB, stage III or stage IV breast cancer

          -  Prior invasive non-breast malignancy (exceptions include non-melanomatous skin cancer,
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or prior contralateral breast cancer as described in
             3.1.11) unless disease free and off treatment for a minimum of five years prior to
             study entry.

          -  Multifocal breast cancer

          -  Modified Bloom-Richardson Grade 3 disease

          -  Estrogen receptor negative disease

          -  Invasive lobular carcinoma

          -  Purely non-invasive breast cancer (i.e. ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in
             situ)

          -  Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma

          -  Paget's disease of the nipple

          -  Male breast cancer

          -  Prior history of radiation therapy to the chest in the region of the ipsilateral
             breast that would result in overlap of radiation fields.

          -  Patients having received or having planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy or concurrent
             chemotherapy. A recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy will not preclude
             eligibility. However, if a patient has an Oncotype score that would lead to a
             recommendation for systemic chemotherapy (see section 3.1.13), and chemotherapy is
             planned to be given in the neoadjuvant setting, the patient would then be ineligible
             for enrollment.

          -  Patients who are unable to undergo MRI. This could include patients with a severe
             allergy to gadolinium contrast or patients with renal function insufficient to receive
             contrast (GFR less than 30). Patients who have a minor allergy (for example, skin rash
             or hives) to gadolinium contrast may still be considered for enrollment. These
             patients would have to receive prophylactic prednisone and diphenhydramine per MCW
             department of radiology protocol. Such cases should be reviewed with the principal
             investigator and radiology co-chair prior to enrollment.

          -  History of connective tissue disorder, including lupus, dermatomyositis and
             scleroderma.

          -  Zubrod performance status of 3 or greater

          -  Known BRCA mutation

          -  Medical, psychiatric or other condition that would prevent the patient from receiving
             the protocol therapy or providing informed consent.

          -  Patients, who under the best estimates of the treating radiation oncologist, have a
             life expectancy of 10 years or less.

          -  Patients who are pregnant.

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within
                  the last 6 months;

               -  Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months;

               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration;

               -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days before
                  registration;

               -  Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects;
                  note, however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation
                  parameters are not required for entry into this protocol
