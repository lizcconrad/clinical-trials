      This study aims to determine if a marijuana (MJ) Approach Avoidance Task (AAT) intervention
      reduces cannabis use compared to a control condition containing no active components of AAT.
      Adolescent heavy MJ users (N=40, ages 16-21) will be randomly assigned to MJ-AAT (n=20) or
      control condition (MJ-Sham, n=20) for three weeks. The MJ-AAT includes six sessions designed
      to reduce action tendencies to approach marijuana. The MJ-Sham includes six MJ-AAT-sham
      conditions. Substance use and cognitive assessment will identify changes in MJ use patterns
      and mechanisms of treatment outcomes. Additionally, using an functional magnetic resonance
      imaging marijuana cue reactivity task, we will determine differences in neural response in
      reward regions before and after 3 weeks of either AAT or sham treatment.

    <description>Approach Avoidance Training (AAT) is a novel computerized procedure that modifies implicit approach tendencies by training individuals to selectively avoid drug- related stimuli, thereby overriding habitual approach tendencies. Participants are randomized to either the treatment or sham condition. Treatment duration involves 6 training sessions of approximately 15 minutes each (400 trials). AAT requires minimal training and involves only a computer and a joystick, in which participants are either pulling or pushing the joystick when different marijuana or non-marijuana images are displayed with either yellow (pull) or blue (push) border.</description>
