  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Debio 1450 is being developed for the treatment of staph (staphylococcal) infections. How
      fast and completely an antibiotic penetrates into bone is used to determine how effective it
      might be to treat infections related to bones or joints. Since bone has fewer blood vessels
      than other tissue (for example lung tissue or the skin), drugs have a harder time getting
      into them. It is important to find out how much of the antibiotic can get into the bone to
      help patients with bone infections.

    <description>Participants will receive 3 oral administrations of Debio 1450 at a dose of 240 mg approximately 12 hours apart. The last dose should be given approximately 2, 4, 6 or 12 hours prior to surgery with 3 patients each to be dosed at each of these time points.
If the surgery is delayed by more than 12 hours postdose, the patients could receive up to 2 additional administrations (approximately 12 hours apart) to ensure that the last dose is administered between 2 and 12 hours before the surgery.</description>
