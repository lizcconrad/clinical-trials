  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is commonly associated with obesity, metabolic
      syndrome and type 2 diabetes. NAFLD, in patients with type 2 diabetes, has been shown to be
      associated with lipid abnormalities (such as hypertriglyceridemia and decreased
      HDL-cholesterol) and increased cardiovascular risk. Such lipid abnormalities
      (hypertriglyceridemia and decreased HDL-cholesterol) are very frequent in patients with type
      2 diabetes. Moreover, NAFLD is a risk for further development of cirrhosis (estimated between
      3 and 5%).

      Animal studies have shown that liraglutide is able to decrease liver fat content, but the
      effect of liraglutide on liver fat content in patients with diabetes remains unknown.

      In addition, human studies with liraglutide have shown significant modification of plasma
      lipids, such as reduction of plasma triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol. However, the
      mechanisms responsible for these liraglutide induced lipid modifications are not yet known.

      Because increased in liver fat content and hypertriglyceridemia are associated in patients
      with type 2 diabetes, it seems interesting to study the effect of liraglutide on both liver
      fat content and lipid metabolism using gold-standard methods (proton-spectroscopy for liver
      fat content assessment and kinetic study with stable isotope to study lipoprotein
      metabolism).

      This is a monocentric study. Fatty liver content will be performed by proton-spectroscopy in
      patients with type 2 diabetes (n=120) before and after a 6 month period of liraglutide
      therapy (1.2 mg/day).

      Moreover, an in vivo kinetic study will be performed with stable isotopes (13C leucine) in 10
      patients among the 120 patients with type 2 diabetes (n=10) before and after a 6-month period
      of liraglutide (1.2 mg/day) therapy. Each kinetic study will be performed during a 2-day
      hospitalization

      For the main study, 3 visits will be performed:

        -  a first visit at T0, before starting the treatment with liraglutide, including clinical
           and biological measurements and liver fat content assessment by proton-spectroscopy

        -  a visit at 3 months including clinical and biological measurements

        -  and a visit at 6 months including clinical and biological measurements and liver fat
           content assessment by proton-spectroscopy

      For the kinetic substudy, performed in 10 patients, a kinetic study with stable isotope will
      been performs during a 48h-hospitalization before starting the treatment with liraglutide and
      after 6 month-treatment with liraglutide
