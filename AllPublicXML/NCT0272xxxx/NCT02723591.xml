    <textblock>
      This study will compare the incidence of a two-part composite endpoint consisting of de novo
      donor specific antibody (DSA) formation or a designation of &quot;immune activation&quot; (IA) on
      peripheral blood molecular profiling in patients maintained on twice daily, immediate-release
      tacrolimus versus those maintained on Astagraf XL in the first two years post-transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, two year, prospective, randomized, multi-center, open-label trial
      examining long-term kidney transplant outcomes through the use of an adaptive design and a
      two-part, composite surrogate endpoint. Specifically, it is designed to compare the effects
      of twice daily, immediate-release tacrolimus and once daily Astagraf XL on DSA formation and
      the development of a peripheral blood molecular profile indicating the presence of immune
      activation (IA) in de novo kidney transplant recipients during the first two years following
      transplantation. For the purposes of this study, IA will be defined as a molecular signature
      indicating either clinical acute rejection (cAR) or subacute rejection (subAR).

      Patients will be screened prior to surgery and randomized 1:1 to receive immediate-release
      tacrolimus, administered twice daily, or Astagraf XL, as a component of a standard
      immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consisting of corticosteroids (if given per
      institutional protocol) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (or Myfortic® equivalent).
      Investigators are encouraged to start subjects on the randomized study treatment (immediate
      release tacrolimus or Astagraf XL) within 48 hours of transplantation (pre-transplant
      administration of study treatment is not allowed). However, if medically indicated per the
      treating physician's discretion, initiation of study treatment may be delayed for up to seven
      days post-transplant.

             as defined by a subject meeting any of the following criteria*: a) positive virtual
             crossmatch, b) positive T- or B-cell crossmatch by National Institutes of Health (NIH)
             antiglobulin lymphocytotoxicity method** , c) .Positive T- or B-cell flow cytometry
             crossmatch defined by the Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) criteria used by the
             center's HLA lab for their local proficiency testing.,** d) An Mean Fluorescence
             Intensity (MFI) greater than or approaching 1000 using flow cytometry/Luminex-based,
             specific anti-HLA antibody testing.

               -  * Patients are eligible to enroll with a negative virtual crossmatch if used in
                  lieu of a physical crossmatch, if, use of such is required to obviate the accrual
                  of excessive ischemia time. However, continued participation is predicated on the
                  performance of the physical crossmatch within 48 hours of transplant. If the
                  physical crossmatch is positive, the subject will be discontinued.

               -  ** If b or c above are positive secondary to a suspected positive
                  auto-crossmatch, that is not exclusionary as long as a and b above are not met.

          -  Receipt of desensitization, antibody-removal, anti-B-cell, or anti-plasma cell therapy
             in the 90 days preceding the transplant procedure.

          -  Planned initiation (prior to transplant) of desensitization, antibody-removal,
             anti-B-cell, or anti-plasma cell therapy within 7 days of the transplant procedure.

          -  Donor or recipient with known hepatitis C infection (Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody
             positive), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (HIV antibody positive), acute
             hepatitis B infection (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) positive, anti-Hepatitis B
             Virus Core (HBc) positive, Immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc positive, anti-HBs
             negative) chronic hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive, anti-HBc positive, IgM
             anti-HBc negative, anti-HBs negative), or equivocal hepatitis B status (HBsAg
             negative, anti-HBc positive, anti-HBs negative). Patients (donor or recipient) who
             have normal liver function tests (LFT) and who are either hepatitis C positive with a
             negative viral load or have natural or vaccine-acquired immunity from hepatitis B are
             not excluded by this criterion.

          -  Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

          -  Subject has a current malignancy or history of malignancy (within the past 5 years),
             except non-metastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or
             carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix that has been successfully treated.

          -  Recipient of multi-organ or dual kidney transplants (inclusive of current transplant
             and any prior non-renal transplants). Note: Patients with prior kidney transplants are
             eligible.

          -  Recipient of an en bloc, pediatric deceased donor kidney from a donor less than 5
             years of age AND weighing less than 20 kg.

          -  Prior graft loss secondary to Cytomegalovirus (CMV) or BK nephropathy.

          -  Prior history of invasive organ disease in the presence of CMV or BKV or clinically
             significant CMV viremia.

          -  History of clinically significant BK viruria.

          -  Any condition which makes the subject unsuitable for study participation.

          -  Planned complete steroid avoidance (Steroid initiation and subsequent taper /
             withdrawal will be allowed and will be under the purview of the treating physician).

          -  Planned receipt of post-transplant prophylactic HCV treatment.
