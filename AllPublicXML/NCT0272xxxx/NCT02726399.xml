  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare any good and bad effects of using ramucirumab along
      with the usual trastuzumab and chemotherapy to using the usual chemotherapy and trastuzumab
      alone.

    <description>This will be a single arm study of ramucirumab 8mg/kg administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 + trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose; 6 mg/kg maintenance) administered intravenously every 21 days. On subsequent cycles for all patients capecitabine 850mg/m2 will be added, taken orally twice a day for fourteen days (days 1 through 14) followed by a 7 day rest period, in addition to cisplatin 80mg/m2 administered as an IV infusion every 21 days. Each cycle consists of 21 days.</description>

             and/or amplification as determined by next generation sequencing assay,
             immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH+ is defined
             as HER2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0). MSKCC confirmation of HER2 status is not mandatory prior
             to enrollment and treatment on study. For patients with outside HER2 testing, if
             sufficient tissue is available HER2 testing will be repeated at MSKCC for purpose of
             analysis and will not impact the patient's eligibility.

          -  Available archival tumor tissue should be submitted to MSKCC for IMPACT analysis, but

             is &gt;2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate &lt;2g of protein in 24
             hours to allow participation in this protocol).

          -  The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by International
             Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5, and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds
