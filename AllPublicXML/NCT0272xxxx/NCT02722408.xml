             to any study-specific procedure;

          -  Male or female ≥17 years of age at time of consent;

          -  Diagnosis of HoFH by genetic confirmation (including compound heterozygosity) or a
             clinical diagnosis based on either (1) a history of an untreated LDL-C concentration
             &gt;500 mg/dL (12.92 mmol/L) together with either appearance of xanthoma before 10 years
             of age, or evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in both parents or,
             if history is unavailable, (2) LDL-C &gt;300 mg/dL (7.76 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated
             lipid-lowering drug therapy;

          -  Currently on a stable, low-fat, low-cholesterol diet in combination with a
             pre-existing, regulatory-approved, not excluded lipid-lowering therapy (i.e., statins,
             monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid
             sequestrants, or nicotinic acid, or any combination thereof) at a stable dose for at
             least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit;

          -  Fasting LDL-C value &gt;130 mg/dL (3.36 mmol/L) at the Screening Visit;

          -  Female patients must not be pregnant or lactating. Women of child-bearing potential
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and negative urine
             dipstick on Day 1 prior to dosing in order to qualify for the study. Women who are
             surgically sterile or are clinically confirmed to be post-menopausal (i.e., documented
             amenorrhea for ≥1 year in the absence of other biological or physiological causes) are
             not considered to be of child-bearing potential; and

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use acceptable methods of contraception
             throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study
             drug. For this study, double-barrier contraception is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other forms of primary hyperlipoproteinemia and secondary causes of

             ULN; or alkaline phosphatase &gt;2 × ULN based on appropriate age and gender normal
             values). Patients with bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN and history of Gilbert's syndrome may be
             included; reflexive direct bilirubin testing will be used to confirm Gilbert's
             syndrome;

          -  Moderate (Grade B) or severe (Grade C) chronic hepatic impairment according to the
             Child Pugh classification;

             [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], autoimmune hepatitis, liver failure, liver cancer),
             history of liver transplant, or known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV);

          -  Abnormal urinalysis (proteinuria greater than trace or any male or non-menstruating
             female with greater than trace hematuria), confirmed by reflexive urine
             protein:creatinine ratio testing;

          -  Uncontrolled thyroid disease: hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism as defined by thyroid
             stimulating hormone (TSH) below the lower limit of normal or &gt;1.5 × ULN, respectively,
             at the Screening Visit. If controlled, treatment should be stable for at least 3
             months prior to the Screening Visit;

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c

             of prolonged QT or unexplained sudden cardiac death;

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as sitting systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg, and confirmed by repeat measurement;

          -  Currently receiving cancer treatments or, in the Investigator's opinion, at risk of
             relapse for recent cancer;

          -  Use of fibrate lipid-lowering agent 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit;

          -  Hypersensitivity to or a history of significant adverse reactions to any fibrate lipid
             lowering agent;

          -  Use of apheresis (LDL or plasma) 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit;

          -  Previously treated with gemcabene;

          -  Participation in another clinical study of an investigational agent or device
             concurrently or within 1 month prior to the Screening Visit, or use of an
             investigational agent within 1 month or 5 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer,
             prior to the Screening Visit; or

          -  Any other finding which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the
             patient's safety or participation in the study.
