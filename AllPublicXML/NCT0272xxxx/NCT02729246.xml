    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this project is to further explore the metabolic effects and the
      mechanisms underlying the improvement in glucose homeostasis following bariatric surgery. The
      project will involve both prevention and treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and both
      pre-diabetic as well as diabetic subjects with obesity will be included. This part of the
      project focuses on patients with manifest T2D and they will be assigned to surgical and
      non-surgical intervention, respectively, in a strictly controlled and randomized manner.
