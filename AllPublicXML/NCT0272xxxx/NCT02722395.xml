    <textblock>
      This study is a research and development initiative established to explore the use of
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for managing organ motion of the liver in cancer
      patients planning procedures for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a potential role to systematically implement MRI to establish appropriate workflow
      of the implementation for tumor motion management in liver SBRT. Compared to CT, MRI has many
      significant advantages for radiotherapy planning, including superior tumor and soft-tissue
      contrast, flexible imaging orientation, freedom from radiation exposure and real-time
      imaging. MRI solely based liver SBRT will allow for more precise delineation of target
      volume, less uncertainties in treatment planning, better motion management, and potentially
      better treatment outcome
