      This study aims to:

      I. Develop and pilot test the effectiveness of a Hope Promotion Program compared with the
      standard treatment protocol, in hope, comfort and quality of life, based on a population of
      palliative patients followed at Oncology day care unit.

      II. Evaluate perceptions and acceptability of Hope Promotion Program among palliative
      patients submitted to the intervention program.

      Background: Hope is essential in the experience of living with advanced chronic disease.
      Maintaining hope in situations of physical, psychological, spiritual and social suffering
      requires expertise and can be very difficult to achieve without the help of professionals,
      leading to hopelessness, despair and desire to hasten death (Rodin et al., 2007;Breitbart,
      2000; Monforte-Royo, et al., 2012) The research team has designed an intervention program -
      Hope Promotion Program (HPP) to increase hope, comfort and quality of life in palliative
      patients. HPP consists of a three session's individual interventions carried out by the
      researcher in patients homes. The first session includes viewing the film Hopeful Living,
      produced by the research team, inspired by Duggleby et al, (2007) which features palliative
      patients, caregivers and health professionals describing their experiences of hope. The
      second session consists of patients' expression of feelings and emotions related with
      experience of living with a chronic advanced disease and the choice of a hope activity from
      the Hope activity book - a collection of hope activities specially designed for people living
      with an advanced chronic disease. The third session includes a relaxation activity and a plan
      to include hope exercise in patients' activities of daily living.

      This project was designed according to the literature review of hope interventions and have
      the potential to become part of palliative care interventions evidenced based.

      Aims: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility and collect
      preliminary data on the effectiveness of the Hope Promotion Program for persons in palliative
      situation residing at home.

      Moreover this project will allow to a) Obtain relevant information about hope, comfort and
      quality of life of palliative patients; b) Tailor therapeutic strategies to individual needs;
      c) increase hope, comfort and quality of life in patients at the end of life.

      Sample: Patients with a chronic advanced disease in palliative situation, recruited from
      Oncology day care units of two district hospital in the centre of Portugal. Inclusion
      criterion for participants are: a) 18 years of age and older, b) Portuguese speaking, c) have
      cognitive capacity to participate in the study (MMSE&gt;15) and d) have agreed to participate in
      the study. An interview with a nurse precede the inclusion in the study to explain the study
      and obtain written informed consent.

      Design: This study is designed as a mix-methods randomized clinical trial (Quantitative
      +Qualitative) design. Patients eligible, are randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1)
      treatment (Hope Promotion Program delivered by a nurse in three sessions during one week), 2)
      usual care group.

      In all groups, demographic information and measures of hope (Herth Hope Index), quality of
      life (McGillQOL), Comfort (Hospice Comfort Questionnaire) will be collected by a trained
      research nurse at baseline, day 15 and one month. Participants in group 1 (treatment group)
      will be asked to describe what they were thinking about when doing the hope activities on day
      15 and one month using qualitative interviews. At one month all participants will be
      interviewed using open ended audiotaped questions to help evaluate the program and study
      procedures.

    <measure>Hope measured by the Portuguese version of Herth Hope Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at day 15 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>Hope is measured by the Portuguese version of Herth Hope Index for chronic conditions (HHI-PT-DC). The HHI-PT-DC is a 10 item (1-4 point) Likert scale that delineates two sub-scales of hope: a) temporality, trust and interconnection, b) positive readiness and expectancy. The HHI-PT-DC takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Summative scores range from 10-40, with a higher score denoting greater hope.</description>

    <measure>Comfort measured by Portuguese version of Hospice Comfort Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at day 15 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort is measured by Portuguese version of Hospice Comfort Questionnaire, based on holistic comfort questionnaire, developed by Kolcaba (HCQ-PT-DC). This instrument is composed by 26 items (1-6 points) Likert-scale that addresses the three states of comfort: relief, ease and transcendence. The higher the score, the higher the subjects' reported comfort.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life measured by the Portuguese version of McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL-PT-DC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at day 15 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life is measured by the Portuguese version of McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL-PT-DC). The MQOL-PT-DC is a quality of life assessment measure reflecting 4 domains of quality of life: physical health, psychological symptoms, existential well-being, and support. The MQOL-PT-DC is comprised of 16 items, assessed in a self-rating numerical scale (0-10) and Single Item Scale (0-10) to assess subjective quality of life. Higher scores indicates better QOL.</description>
