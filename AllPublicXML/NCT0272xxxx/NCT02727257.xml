  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the Investigators explore two questions: if the attentive reaction times
      differs in parkinsonian patients from health controls and if an intensive, focused and
      aerobic rehabilitation program (Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment - MIRT)
      tailored mainly for motor problems, could have a specific positive effect on multiple choices
      Reaction Times (RTs) as an indirect marker for an effect on attentional-executive frontal
      circuits. The hypothesis is that the MIRT could have a positive effect on the top-down
      control mechanisms, since the continuous feedback given by physiotherapist during exercises
      and the use of cues and devices (such as treadmill plus and stabilometric platform),
      stimulate the selective attention processes that enable goal-directed, internally-driven
      decision, helping the patients to overcome externally-driven decision based on stimulus
      salience and novelty

      Objective: To evaluate the attentive performances in Parkinsonians in comparison with healthy
      controls and the effect of motor-cognitive rehabilitation program on attention.

      Methods: 103 Parkinsonians (stage 2,5-3 H&amp;Y) hospitalized for a 4-week Multidisciplinary
      Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment and 34 healthy controls were enrolled. All subjects
      underwent three different attentive tasks: visual reaction times, auditory reaction times and
      multiple choices reaction times tasks. To evaluate the effect of rehabilitation on attention,
      patients performed the same battery at discharge. To investigate the effects of MIRT on motor
      functions and quality of life we also assessed UPDRS III, Timed Up and Go test and
      Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire.

    <description>The task consisted of 40 trials. The target was a number (1, 2, 3) whose presentation, on the centre of the screen, was randomized. Each number was associated to a different response buttons . In each single trial subjects had to press as quickly as possible the response button associated with the number that appeared on the screen. We evaluated the accuracy of response and recorded the time between the appearance of target and the subject's response.</description>

    <measure>Simple Choice Reaction Time task</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The task consisted of 40 trials. In each single trial, the subjects had to press the response button as quickly as possible when a red circle appeared on the screen. The appearance of targets was mixed to a variable number of distractors consisting in single green circles. Targets and distractors could appear in different positions of the screen at irregular intervals (1-3 seconds). Distractors remained on the screen for 500 ms, while the target disappeared with the subject's response. We evaluated the accuracy of response and recorded the time between the appearance of target and the subject's response.</description>

    <measure>Auditory Reaction Time task</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The task consisted of 40 trials. In each single trial the subjects had to press a response button as quickly as possible at the presentation of the target that consisted of an acoustic stimulus (intensity of 94 dbA) presented at irregular intervals (1-3 seconds). The stimulus ended after the subject's response. The times between the presentation of the target and the subject's response were recorded.</description>

    <description>MIRT consists of a 4-week physical therapy that entails four daily sessions, five days a week, in a hospital setting. The first session comprise cardiovascular warm-up activities, relaxation, muscle-stretching, exercises to improve the range of motion of spinal, pelvic and scapular joints, exercises to improve the functionality of the abdominal muscles, and postural changes in the supine position. The second session includes aerobic exercises to improve balance and gait using a stabilometric platform, treadmill plus, crossover and cycloergometer. All the exercises are aerobic. The third is a session of occupational therapy to improve autonomy in day living activities. The last session includes one hour of speech therapy.</description>
