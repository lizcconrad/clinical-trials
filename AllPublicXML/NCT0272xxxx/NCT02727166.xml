  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with gas-related complaints exhibit impaired handling of intestinal gas loads and we
      hypothesized that inulin would have a beneficial effect. Aim: to determine the effect of a
      prebiotic chicory-derived inulin-type fructan on the tolerance of intestinal gas. Methods.
      Placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized and double-blind trial study. Subjects with
      abdominal symptoms and reduced tolerance of intestinal gas (selected by a pre-test) will
      receive either inulin (8 g/d, n=18) or maltodextrin as a placebo (8 g/d, n=18) for 4 wk. A
      gas challenge test (4 h jejunal gas infusion at 12 mL/min while measuring abdominal symptoms
      and gas retention for 3 h) will be performed before and at the end of the intervention phase.
      Gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits (using daily questionnaires for 1 wk) and fecal
      bifidobacteria counts will be measured before and at the end of the intervention.

    <description>Effect of inulin intake (change from baseline with inulin versus placebo) on the tolerance of the gas challenge test, measured as the perception score of digestive sensations during the gas challenge test. At each time point, the highest score instead of the mean or cumulative scores will be computed for comparisons; these scores will be averaged over the last 60 min of the test in each subject; the differences between basal and intervention periods (inulin or placebo) will be calculated.</description>
