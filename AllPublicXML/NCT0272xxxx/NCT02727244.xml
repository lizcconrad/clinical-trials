      This study is aimed to elucidate the association between Pain Catastrophizing Scale Score and
      Postspinal Headache in Patients Underwent Cesarean Section With Spinal Anesthesia. Patients
      were asked to fill the questionnaire booklet including Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Beck
      Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory before elective cesarean section in
      preoperative room in operating theater. In postoperative second and fourth day, patients will
      call by phone and be asked to have headache or any complaints. The intensity of headache will
      evaluate by using visual analog scale. Age, gender, and visual analog scale scores will be
      recorded.
