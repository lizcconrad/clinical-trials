      The objective of this protocol is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the Relaxation
      Response Resiliency Program (3RP), a psychotherapy treatment providing a variety of mind body
      skills and interventions to decrease medical and mental health symptoms and build resilience,
      in Spanish-speaking World Trade Center (WTC) survivors, and to examine its clinical
      effectiveness to reduce Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and lower
      respiratory symptoms (LRS) and improve psychosocial functioning.
