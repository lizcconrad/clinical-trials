  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver cancer. It is the 6th most common
      malignancy and the 3rd killers of all tumors worldwide with an incidence of 626,000 new
      patients a year. The intermediate stage of HCC is controlled by radiological interventions
      such as Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) or Radioembolization. Although 90Y
      radioembolization is increasingly being used in clinical practice, there is no high quality
      clinical evidence to justify this. To date, no prospective studies have been performed
      comparing both treatment modalities (TACE vs 90Y) in a randomized setting. This randomized
      controlled trial is designed to prospectively compare TACE and 90Y for treatment of patients
      with unresectable (BCLC intermediate stage) HCC. This will be done by recruiting 75 patients
      in each arm from. Investigators will compare between the two groups the time to progression
      (TTP) as the primary outcome and also examine time to local progression (TLP) as well as
      other factors like overall survival, response to therapy, toxicities and adverse events,
      quality of life and treatment-related costs.

      Study Rationale:

      Although 90Y increasingly used in clinical practice, there is no high quality clinical
      evidence to justify this. Most of the comparison studies are retrospective. Three studies
      compared TACE with 90Y retrospectively. The first was by Kooby et al in which patients
      treated with TACE were retrospectively compared to those treated with 90Y suggested that both
      treatment modalities have similar effectiveness and safety profiles in patients with
      unresectable HCC. Earlier Carr et al carried out a similar retrospective analysis and
      concluded that Chemoembolization or Radioembolization appeared to be equivalent regional
      therapies for patients with unresectable, non-metastatic HCC. More recently Salem et al
      retrospectively compared 122 HCC patients who received chemo-embolization with 123 patients
      who received Radioembolization and concluded both patient groups had similar survival times.
      Radioembolization resulted in longer time-to-progression and less toxicity than
      chemo-embolization.

      A study on down-staging of HCC beyond Milan criteria compare 90Y with TACE of and concluded
      that 90Y outperforms TACE for down-staging HCC to within transplant criteria.

      TACE-DEB is the standardized form TACE with better efficacy and safety profile and will be
      ideal to use to define the position of 90Y in the of locoregional treatment of HCC.

      To date, no prospective studies have been performed comparing both treatment modalities in a
      randomized setting. This randomized controlled trial is designed to prospectively compare
      TACE and 90Y for treatment of patients with unresectable (BCLC intermediate stage) HCC.

      Known Potential Benefits:

      Chemo-embolization is the standard treatment for intermediate HCC with known efficacy and
      predicted toxicity. The arrival of TAC-DEBs made TACE more efficient, less toxic and more
      standardized. Y90 Radioembolization is of known efficacy and minimal toxicity base on cohort
      studies. Head to head comparison has never been conducted.

    <description>TACE is a procedure in which a catheter is introduced into the branches of the hepatic artery supplying the tumor. Embolic material and chemotherapeutic agents are deployed through the catheter directly into the tumor vasculature. This technique potentially enhances the cytotoxic effect by inducing ischemia and retention of the therapeutic agent in the vicinity of the tumor.
The drug-eluting beads (DEBs) enable standardization of TACE since DEBs act as both an occluding agent as well as a drug-loaded carrier, achieving local ischemia and cytotoxic death of the tumor with one device.</description>
