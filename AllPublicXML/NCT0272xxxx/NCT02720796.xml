  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent or metastatic sarcoma will be consented to develop a patient derived
      xenograft (PDX or TumorGraft) model of their tumor to perform drug sensitivity testing. The
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of the patient derived xenograft (PDX) model
      in predicting patient clinical response to the same drug treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  15 years of age or older

          -  Patients with metastatic sarcoma who have had no more than one prior systemic
             treatment for metastatic disease

          -  Patients with recurrent sarcoma at relapse

          -  Patients with confirmed histological diagnosis of sarcoma or suspected diagnosis of
             sarcoma. Some specific subtypes of sarcoma are NOT eligible (Gastrointestinal Stromal
             Tumor (GIST), carcinosarcoma, sarcomatoid mesothelioma, and metastatic phyllodes
             tumor)

          -  If initial suspected diagnosis of sarcoma, must have sarcoma diagnosis confirmed prior
             to proceeding with PDX drug sensitivity testing

          -  Must have measureable disease for computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) evaluation following biopsy or surgery to obtain tissue for PDX
             development.

          -  No plan for concurrent chemoradiation, for target lesions that will be used for drug
             treatment correlation with PDX

          -  Fresh tumor tissue available for PDX development

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1

          -  Life expectancy exceeds 6 months

          -  Plan to receive systemic therapy

          -  Informed consent
