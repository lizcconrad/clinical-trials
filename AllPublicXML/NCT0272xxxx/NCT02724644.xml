    <measure>Percentage of Composite Responders of at Least 2-Level Improvement of Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of composite responders defined as subjects with an improvement from baseline of at least 2-levels of severity on each, the Clinician-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) and Patient-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR-PCSS), at Day 71 in the ITT population. The CR-PCSS is a photonumeric scale that was used by the Investigator to evaluate cellulite ranging from 0 (none), 1 (almost none), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). The PR-PCSS is a photonumeric scale that was used by the subjects to evaluate cellulite ranging from 0 (none), 1 (almost none), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). A 2-level improvement on each scale for example would represent a change from a 4 (severe) to a 2 (mild). In order to be considered a responder a subject needs to have at least a 2-level improvement on both scales.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>On Day 71, the Investigator determined the degree of improvement from baseline in the treated area using the 7-point I-GAIS.

The CR-PCSS is a photonumeric scale that was used by the Investigator to evaluate cellulite ranging from 0 (none), 1 (almost none), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). The PR-PCSS is a photonumeric scale that was used by the subjects to evaluate cellulite ranging from 0 (none), 1 (almost none), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). A 2-level improvement on each scale for example would represent a change from a 4 (severe) to a 2 (mild). In order to be considered a responder a subject needs to have at least a 2-level improvement on both scales.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Composite Responders of at Least 1-Level Improvement of Severity</title>
        <description>Percentage of composite responders defined as subjects with improvement from baseline of at least 1-level of severity on each, the Clinician-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) and Patient-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR-PCSS), at Day 71 in the ITT population. The CR-PCSS is a photonumeric scale that was used by the Investigator to evaluate cellulite ranging from 0 (none), 1 (almost none), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). The PR-PCSS is a photonumeric scale that was used by the subjects to evaluate cellulite ranging from 0 (none), 1 (almost none), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). A 1-level improvement on each scale for example would represent a change from a 4 (severe) to a 3 (moderate). In order to be considered a responder a subject needs to have at least a 1-level improvement on both scales.</description>
