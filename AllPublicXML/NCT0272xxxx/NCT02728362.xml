      To investigate the functional outcomes and prevalence and severity of knee pain for patients
      undergoing suprapatellar nailing of tibial shaft fractures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Suprapatellar nailing...

      Participants will be followed for 10 years prospectively. Follow up visits will occur at 2
      weeks, 6weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years and 10 years.

      Interim analysis will be done at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years with final analysis occuring at 10
      years.

      Primary and secondary endpoints in patients undergoing suprapatellar nailing of tibial shaft
      fractures are:

        1. To evaluate the long term presence of knee pain

        2. To evaluate the long term functional outcomes
