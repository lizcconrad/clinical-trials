    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a study to compare two methods of closing the stump of the appendix
      during an emergency excision of the appendix using a keyhole approach. One similarly designed
      study has been undertaken in another institution but there were not enough patients recruited
      to the study to allow meaningful conclusions to be drawn.

      Any patient over the age of 16 years whom the investigators suspect to have acute
      appendicitis will be considered for recruitment to the study. During their exploratory
      keyhole surgery, if the surgical team feels that excision of the appendix is indicated then
      the patient will be randomly allocated to either polymer clips or endoloops to the part of
      the procedure where the stump (base) of the appendix is closed.

      The main aim is to determine if polymer clips shorten the duration of the operation. The
      investigators will also determine if there is a difference between the rates of
      complications, the time spent in hospital and the number of times the participants had to be
      readmitted to hospital within 30 days.

      The investigators propose to perform a randomised control trial within NHS Tayside comparing
      two forms of appendiceal stump closure in emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy. A previous
      RCT examining this topic could have been better designed, with a small trial population and
      the absence of a power calculation.

      All patients over 16 years old undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy for acute appendicitis will
      be eligible for recruitment to the trial and be consented prior to theatre.
      Intra-operatively, when the decision to perform an appendicectomy is taken, participants will
      be randomised to either the application of polymer (Locaclip) clips or endoloops to the
      appendiceal stump for closure during laparoscopic appendicectomy. The primary outcome will be
      operative time, while secondary outcomes include post-operative complications length of
      hospital stay and re-admission rate within 30 days. Participants will require no formal
      follow-up, either in the out-patient clinic or telephone consultations.

      Statistical analysis will predominantly use Fisher's exact test to determine any
      statistically significant differences between each intervention arm, whilst group homogeneity
      will be analysed for other important patient parameters.

      The investigators hypothesise that the operative time will be less in the polymer group
      compared to the endoloop group, while no significant difference will be seen in
      post-operative complications or other secondary outcomes between the two cohorts. The results
      of this RCT will add to the evidence-base for the use of polymer clips in appendiceal stump
      closure and potentially support its use for routine clinical practice. It is anticipated that
      it will take one year to recruit participants for the study and a further 30 days to complete
      follow up for the last participant recruited.
