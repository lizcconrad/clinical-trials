  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to estimate the duration of hepatic progression-free
      survival (HPFS) in participants treated with bland embolization (BE), transcatheter arterial
      Lipiodol chemoembolization (TACE), and embolization by drug-eluting beads (DEB). The primary
      hypothesis is that chemoembolization will be nearly twice as durable as bland embolization;
      thatis, the hazard ratio for HPFS will be 1.76 or better.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants 18 years and older;

          -  Biopsy-proven neuroendocrine tumor with tumor burden dominant in the liver.

          -  Measurable metastasis to liver with at least one dimension ≥ 1.0 cm. Known
             extrahepatic disease should be limited to lymph nodes of less than 2 cm and/or bone
             metastases.

          -  Liver tumor burden less than or equal to 70%.

          -  Not a candidate for surgical resection based on unresectability, anatomy, anesthesia
             risk, patient preference.

          -  Symptoms uncontrolled by somatostatin analogues OR morphologically progressive tumor
             by RECIST 1.1 criteria in the liver OR baseline tumor burden &gt;25% of the liver volume.

          -  There must be no plans for the patient to receive other concomitant therapy while on
             this protocol treatment (other than Sandostatin or BIS-Phosphanate therapy).

          -  Presence of hepatopetal flow

          -  Performance status 0-2 on Zubrod Performance Scale (see Appendix V);

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl;

          -  Serum Bilirubin ≤ 2.0

          -  Serum albumin ≥ 3.0

          -  Platelet count &gt; 50,000/ul (corrected if needed)

          -  INR ≤ 1.5 (corrected if needed)

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             sign a study specific informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women may not participate due to the embryotoxic effects of
             protocol treatment. Women/men of reproductive potential may not participate unless
             they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.

          -  Prior hepatic arterial therapy or hepatic radiation therapy. Prior surgical resection
             or ablation of liver metastases is acceptable. Patients must be at least one month

          -  Active infection (Symptomatic bacterial and fungal infection - newly diagnosed and/or
             requiring treatment);

          -  Choledochoenteric anastomosis; transpapillary biliary stent, or sphincterotomy of
             duodenal papilla

             previous contrast reaction, not mitigated by appropriate pre-medication).

          -  Contraindications to arteriography and selective visceral catheterization:

               1. severe allergy or intolerance to contrast media, narcotics, sedatives, or
                  atropine.

               2. bleeding diathesis not correctable by usual forms of therapy.

               3. severe peripheral vascular disease precluding catheterization.

          -  Contraindications to hepatic artery embolization:

               1. high risk of hepatic failure, indicated by the constellation of greater than 50%
                  liver replacement by tumor, LDH&gt;425 mU/ml, SGOT(AST)&gt;100mU/ml. and bilirubin &gt;2
                  mg./dl.

               2. portal vein occlusion without hepatopedal collateral flow demonstrated by
                  angiography; or portal hypertension with hepatofugal flow.
