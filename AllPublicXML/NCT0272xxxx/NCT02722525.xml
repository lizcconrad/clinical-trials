      Learning about the impact of anti-androgen treatment has on cardiac function in patients with
      prostate cancer may help plan treatment and help patients live more comfortably. This pilot
      clinical trial will utilize cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before a patient starts
      hormone therapy and after 4 to 7 months of hormone therapy. The objective is to measure the
      impact of hormone therapy (anti-androgen treatment) on cardiac function in patients with
      prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the impact of a minimum of 4 months of full androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
      on cardiac and skeletal muscle structure and performance using novel cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance (CMR) approach.

      OUTLINE:

      Study participants will undergo a treadmill stress CMR focused on cardiac muscle comprised of
      resting MRI over 10-15 minutes followed by treadmill exercise until peak stress. Patients
      then undergo MRI and gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid
      [DTPA]) perfusion imaging immediately after exercise and after a 6-8 minute recovery period.
      Within 24 hours of treadmill CMR exam, patients also undergo skeletal muscle phosphorus
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PMRS) while at rest, during, and in the recovery phase of
      resistive lower extremity exercise which patients complete over 30 seconds. Both procedures
      are performed before initiation of ADT treatment (baseline) and 4-7 months after initiation
      of ADT treatment.

          -  Have a calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) =&lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2

          -  Are not free of unstable angina, arrhythmia, or severe systemic disease that would
             make moderate intensity exercise participation unsafe

             defibrillator, neurostimulator, any other medical metallic implant, claustrophobia,
             inability to lie flat for 30 minutes, and weight exceeding 300 pounds; if an MR
             contraindication is discovered during scanning that was overlooked during the
             screening process, the procedure will be stopped immediately and the subject will be
             removed from the scanner

          -  Are receiving any form of renal replacement therapy or have a calculated glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.75 m²; results of serum creatinine testing will be
             reviewed for calculation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR); patients without a serum
             creatinine level drawn within the prior 3 months will have this drawn upon enrollment

             safe and adequate test performance, and inability to provide consent; the relative
             contra-indications include left main coronary stenosis, moderate stenotic valvular
             heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities, tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias, atrial
