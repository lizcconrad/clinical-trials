      The proposed study examines the effect of oral naltrexone on self-injurious behavior (SIB) in
      adolescents and adults of normal intelligence. It is designed as a pilot study and will
      provide preliminary data for a larger scale clinical trial if found to be effective in the
      pilot study.

They will switch to placebo for weeks 8-10, then return to naltrexone for weeks 11-13, then placebo for weeks 14-16 (i.e., A-ABAB double crossover design, participants act as own controls). Study drug and placebo will be encapsulated so as to appear identical.</description>
