  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive respiratory support is routinely provided to extremely preterm infants following
      disconnection from mechanical ventilation, in the form of continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). However, these modes remain
      sub-optimal due to lack of synchronization and upper airway defensive mechanisms that
      potentially hinder their effectiveness. Non-invasive Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist
      (NIV-NAVA) is a novel mode that may overcome some of these problems but has not been
      investigated in this population. Investigators hypothesize that there will be significant
      differences in cardiorespiratory behavior in extremely preterm infants receiving CPAP, NIPPV
      and NIV-NAVA during the immediate post-extubation period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of extremely preterm infants are mechanically ventilated through the use
      of endotracheal intubation. However, clinicians try to avoid intubation due to the
      complications that may arise from being mechanically ventilated such as ventilator associated
      pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary hemorrhage, air leak etc. In order to the prevent these
      complications, clinicians accelerate weaning and provide non-invasive respiratory support.
      The most commonly used type of non-invasive respiratory support following extubation is nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). NCPAP has been shown to improve oxygenation,
      reduce airway resistance, increase tidal volume, stabilize chest wall and maintain functional
      residual capacity. In addition to NCPAP, nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation
      (NIPPV) has become a popular choice as a post-extubation respiratory support mode. However,
      there is a lack of knowledge regarding the effects of synchronization between the infant's
      own spontaneous respiratory efforts and ventilator inflations.

      Synchronization, especially during non-invasive ventilation, is difficult to achieve in
      preterm infants due to their rapid respiratory rates, short inspiratory times, periodic
      breathing, leaks and small tidal volumes. Previous studies have used devices such as an
      abdominal capsule to allow for synchronization while the infant is receiving NIPPV. The
      abdominal capsule itself is prone to incorrect placement, time delays and ineffective
      synchronization. Neurally Activated Ventilatory Assistance (NAVA) is a new technology that
      can be used during invasive and non-invasive ventilation. In this novel mode, the electrical
      activity of the diaphragm, called EAdi, is detected be electrodes inserted at the tip of a
      specialized nasogastric tube. The EAdi represents the patient's inherent neural respiratory
      drive. The ventilator assists each spontaneous breath by delivering pressure that is linearly
      proportional to the EAdi. The mechanical breath is initiated at the start of diaphragmatic
      contraction and maintained until the EAdi is at 60 to 70% of the peak pressure generated.
      Therefore, the inspiratory time, expiratory time and peak inflation pressure are all
      controlled and determined by the patient, providing patient-ventilator synchrony.

    <measure>Differences on cardiorespiratory behaviour in extremely preterm infants receiving CPAP, NIPPV and NIV-NAVA</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-extubation period (30 minutes after extubation)</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiorespiratory signals (ECG, thoraco-abdominal movements, oxygen saturation and TcPCO2), and ventilator signals (pressure and EAdi waveforms, tidal volume, MAP, PIP, PEEP, and FiO2) will continuously be measured throughout the recordings. Analysis of these signals will be performed offline. From these cardiorespiratory signals, behaviour will be analyzed by calculations of: cardiorespiratory variability, respiratory pauses, thoraco-abdominal asynchrony, respiratory movement artifacts and regular breathing pattern.
Cardiorespiratory behavior will be calculated using the instantaneous power estimate of all respiratory and cardiac signals computed. To this end, each of the continuous metrics will be squared and averaged over a symmetric, two-sided window of length. For example, the correlation between respiratory and heart rates will be estimated by averaging the product fmax*hmax over the same window.</description>

    <measure>Differences on in patient-ventilator interaction in extremely preterm infants receiving CPAP, NIPPV and NIV-NAVA</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-extubation period (30 minutes after extubation)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-ventilator interaction which will be analyzed by calculating the following parameters: Trigger delay, cycling off delay, number of breaths with premature cycling off, asynchrony index, wasted inspiratory efforts, relationship and proportionality between ventilator assist and patient respiratory demand.
Despite the different units of measure for the aforementioned parameters, these values together will represent an accurate description of the interaction between the patient and the ventilator. These parameters will compared between the three modes.</description>
