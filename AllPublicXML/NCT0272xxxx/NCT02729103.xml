    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate treatment patterns, mortality, healthcare resource utilization, and
      costs in patients with prostate cancer with bone metastases (primary objectives).
      Additionally, this study will evaluate opioid/analgesic use among lines of therapy in this
      patient population (secondary objective). The study is descriptive in nature and is meant to
      provide a greater understanding of the patterns of therapy observed in real-world clinical
      practice (in the absence of clear guideline recommendations with regards to treatment
      sequencing), to contribute to a greater understanding of the major cost drivers (thus
      better-informing payers), and to examine real-world mortality in such patients.

    <description>Part 1 - Assessment of treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilization and costs. The study cohort will include all patients with prostate cancer with incident bone metastases during the index period (1 June 2013 to 1 July 2014) based on a large database encompassing a broad sample of the commercially insured U.S. population. The first date of bone metastases diagnosis or first date of treatment indicative of bone metastases (whichever occurs first) will be designated as the index date. All patients must have no diagnosis of other cancers, no diagnosis of bone metastases or a claim for a treatment indicative of bone metastases, and no skeletal-related events (SREs) in the 12-month pre-index period. Additionally, all subjects must be continuously enrolled for at least 12 months before and at least 6 months after the index date.</description>

Unlike in Part 1, there will be no required minimum follow-up time after the index date (in order to assess mortality).</description>
