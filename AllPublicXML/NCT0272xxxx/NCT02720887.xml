  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nanoparticles (NP) are defined as particles whose size is no greater than 100 nanometers.
      However, their impact on health remains little evaluated.

      Placental transfer of NP has been proven in many studies in vitro and in vivo in animals, and
      toxicity in the fetus has been studied in many animals. The investigators seem interesting at
      first to establish the mineralogical load in the amniotic fluid in humans.

      The first objective of this study is to determine the mineralogical NP load, quantity and
      composition, in the amniotic fluid in pregnant women.

      The analysis will be done on 100 amniotic fluid samples and 100 blood samples. Particle size
      analysis will be performed by a technique of dynamic light scattering, which permits the
      distribution by volume or by number of NP according to their size. Parallel to the different
      chemical species present in the sample must be measured by atomic emission spectrometry with
      inductively coupled plasma.

      The results of this study will be useful for further studies on the fetal toxicity of NP in
      humans.
