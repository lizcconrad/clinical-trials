  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The guideline-recommended standard of care for patients who have experienced a heart attack,
      heart failure, or other coronary event or procedure is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation
      (CR). Despite proven benefits, traditional CR is severely underutilized. Moreover, what is
      typically lacking from traditional CR programs is effective psychosocial risk management.
      This represents a critical gap in care given the well-documented psychosocial needs of this
      patient population.The objective of this feasibility study is to conduct a pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) versus usual care in
      CR-eligible cardiac patients. Randomization will be stratified within two strata based on
      participation in CR (yes/no) among CR-eligible patients. The primary goals of this pilot
      study are to: 1) obtain estimates of treatment effects and variability; 2) evaluate
      recruitment and retention strategies; and 3) examine the safety of the MBSR protocol in
      CR-eligible patients.

      Objectives:

      The objective of this feasibility study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) versus usual care in CR-eligible cardiac
      patients. Randomization will be stratified within two strata based on participation in CR
      (yes/no) among CR-eligible patients. The primary goals of this pilot study are to: 1) obtain
      estimates of treatment effects and variability; 2) evaluate recruitment and retention
      strategies; and 3) examine the safety of the MBSR protocol in CR-eligible patients.

      Design and Outcomes:

      The study design is a randomized controlled trial with randomization in two strata. The
      primary outcome will be a change (improvement) in heart rate variability (HRV) as assessed by
      a 24-hour Holter monitor worn by patients three times throughout the study (pre- and
      post-intervention and 9-month follow-up). Both time domain (SDNN and RMSSD) and frequency
      domain (Total power, Low Frequency power, High Frequency power) variables will be assessed.
      HRV is a well-established method to assess the autonomic nervous system. Secondary outcomes
      will include changes in stress, depression, anxiety, quality of life, physical functioning
      and cardiovascular risk factors. All participants will undergo a baseline assessment,
      followed by randomization to the treatment or control condition, and three follow-up
      assessments, at 3, 6, and 9 months after randomization. The 3-month follow-up will occur
      immediately post-intervention. The baseline, 3-month and 9-month (final) follow-up
      assessments will be in-person and will include questionnaires on stress and emotions, quality
      of life, a short physical performance battery, a blood draw to assess lipids, high
      sensitivity C-Reactive Protein and hemoglobin A1c as well as the 24-hour Holter monitor to
      assess HRV. The 6-month follow-up assessment will be by telephone only and include brief
      assessments of moods, stress, and symptoms. The investigators anticipate the pilot study will
      be completed in 18 months.

      Interventions and Duration:

      Upon enrollment, participants will be randomized into two groups, the intervention group
      (MBSR) or the control group (no MBSR). Randomization will occur separately for those enrolled
      in CR and those not enrolled in CR. For those in the stratum that attends CR, the control
      condition will consist of CR only and usual care, whereas for participants in the stratum
      that does not attend CR, the control condition will consist of usual care. All participants
      in both strata will received standard printed materials on healthy lifestyles and stress
      management. The intervention lasts for 8 weeks and will occur within the first 12 weeks (3
      months) after randomization. The standard outpatient Phase II CR program offered within the
      Fairview Hospital system is a traditional exercise-based program that includes an intake
      visit and up to 24 1-hour monitored exercise sessions (1-3 times per week for 8-24 weeks,
      individualized to patient needs and therapy goals) and up to 8 or 9 1-hour educational
      sessions. Patients participating in CR who are randomized to the intervention group will
      participate in the same standard outpatient Phase II CR as those individuals randomized to
      the control condition within this stratum, plus an 8-week MBSR course. The MBSR course is
      taught per a standard protocol in a group setting and consists of eight 2.5-hour weekly
      sessions and one 6.5-hour retreat; the MBSR course will be led by trained facilitators from
      the University of Minnesota Center for Spirituality and Healing.

      Sample Size and Population:

      The targeted enrollment is 72 participants, with 36 randomized to participate in MBSR across
      the two strata and 36 randomized to the control condition (no MBSR) who will receive usual
      care (this includes CR for those who have opted to enroll in CR). The investigators will
      recruit CR-eligible cardiac patients from three sites within the Fairview Hospital system
      that offer CR (Ridges in Burnsville, Southdale in Edina, and University of Minnesota
      Riverside Campus in Minneapolis), as well as through electronic health records, clinic visits
      with health care providers, advertisement and flyers located at clinics and the CR locations,
      and inclusion of the study on www.studyfinder.umn.edu.

    <description>Time domain and frequency domain variables will be assessed via 24-hour Holter monitoring at baseline, 3-month follow-up and 9-month follow-up. HRV is a well-established method to assess the autonomic nervous system, and has been shown to be a predictor of hard outcomes in cardiac patients. Given the deranged autonomic milieu in these patients, HRV is an appropriate surrogate end point for improved outcomes in this cohort.</description>

    <description>The primary intervention is an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course, taught in 8 weekly 2.5-hour group sessions, and one all-day (6.5 hours) retreat. MBSR is taught per a standard protocol in a group setting and includes presentation of key MBSR constructs, meditation and breathing techniques, gentle yoga and Tai Chi poses, shared discussion time among participants and brief readings and home practice between sessions. Participants also will continue with usual care and receive standard educational materials on healthy lifestyles and stress management.
Note: This study will recruit patients who are eligible for traditional exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Randomization will be stratified based on whether or not patients are actively enrolled in CR at the time of the study. Within each stratum, participants will be randomized to either the intervention (MBSR) or control (no MBSR) condition.</description>
