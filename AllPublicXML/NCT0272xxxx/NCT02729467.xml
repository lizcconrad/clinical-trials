  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of itraconazole, a strong cytochrome P
      (CYP)3A4 and p-glycoprotein (PgP) inhibitor, and rifampicin, a CYP3A4, uridine
      5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), and PgP inducer, and an inhibitor of organic
      anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP), on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      JNJ-53718678 in healthy adult participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, fixed sequence, Phase 1 study in healthy adult
      participants to study the effects of itraconazole and rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics,
      safety, and tolerability of a single dose of JNJ-53718678. This study will be conducted in 2
      separate panels, with 14 participants in Panel 1 and 16 participants in Panel 2. The study
      consists of following phases: Screening (28 days), Treatment phase (11 days) and Follow-up
      (10 to 14 days after the last study drug intake). Blood samples will be collected for
      evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Participants
      will be assessed for safety and tolerability throughout the study.
