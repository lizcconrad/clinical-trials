  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will be comparing two approaches to the femoral block. The first or
      classical approach and one that is the most popular in our institution is used by combining
      ultrasound guidance and neurostimulator to do the block. The second is performed with the
      ultrasound alone aiming at the inferolateral aspect of the femoral artery with the needle and
      injecting. The primary endpoint of the study is the sensitive cutaneous block distribution
      using both techniques.

    <description>After performance of a femoral nerve block, ice will be applied on the skin to plot the anesthetized area at times 15, 30 and 45 mn. The sensation will be compared on a scale from 0 (no sensation) to 2 (no anesthesia) with the contralateral leg. An area in cm2 will be calculated for each of the patients and the two techniques will then be compared.</description>
