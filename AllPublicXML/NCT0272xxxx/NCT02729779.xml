  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is potentially disabling for the elderly, and physical exercises are
      considered the best treatment for this problem. The Pilates method has been proven effective
      in the improvement of pain and function in patients with low back pain. However, the evidence
      about the effectiveness of Pilates method in the treatment of elderly patients with low back
      pain is scarce. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the
      Pilates method compared to aerobic exercise in elderly with chronic non-specific low back
      pain. This randomized controlled trial with two arms and blinded assessor will include 74
      patients aged between 65 and 85 years, of both sexes, complaining of chronic non-specific low
      back pain persisting for more than three months and pain intensity greater than 3 points in
      the Pain Numerical Rating Scale. The elderly will be randomized into two groups: Pilates
      Group (n = 37) with exercises based on Pilates method; and Aerobic Group (n = 37) with
      aerobic exercises, stretching and relaxation. Both groups will hold treatment twice a week
      with duration of 60 minutes for eight weeks. The primary outcomes will be: pain intensity and
      general disability assessed eight weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes will be: pain
      intensity and general disability evaluated six months after randomization; global impression
      of improvement, specific disability and dynamic balance, muscle strength of the gluteus
      maximus, gluteus medius and lateral hip rotators and pressure pain threshold evaluated eight
      weeks and six months after randomization. We expect that the results of this study contribute
      to the clinical decision-making with respect to pain reduction and, consequently, improving
      balance and functionality of elderly with chronic low back pain.

    <description>Elderly will be submitted to a specific exercise program of modified Pilates method performed in the mat and apparatus. In the first session, participants will receive basic guidance on the Pilates training and activation of the power house. The session will be divided in: global warming and stretching (5 minutes), Pilates exercises for upper and lower limbs, abdomen and spine (45 minutes), global stretching (5 minutes) and local relaxing massage (5 minutes).The session will consist of a minimum of 5 exercises and a maximum of 15 Pilates exercises. The elderly will receive 16 individual sessions with duration of 60 minutes, twice a week, with a total of eight weeks of treatment.</description>

    <description>The Aerobic Group will be submitted to an exercise program with global stretching (for lower and upper limbs and column with two repetitions and 30 seconds of maintenance in each segment) for 10 minutes, walking on a treadmill for 20 to 40 minutes and relaxing massage for 5 minutes. The intensity of the effort during walking on a treadmill will be based on a combination of heart rate (based on the percentage of maximum heart rate: 208 - (0.7 x age)) and rate of perceived effort assessed by the Borg scale. Exercise will be performed respecting the fraction of 50-75% of maximum heart rate and levels between 12 to 13 (moderate intensity) of the Borg scale. The elderly will receive 16 individual sessions with duration of 60 minutes, twice a week, with a total of eight weeks of treatment.</description>
