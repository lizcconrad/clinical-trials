  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of craniofacial nerve stimulation
      for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized at enrollment into either a delayed or immediate continuation
      group. The immediate continuation group will immediately continue with the stimulation after
      a 30-day trial period and will be monitored for a total of 12 months. The delayed activation
      group will have their device turned off after the 30-day trial period for the next 3-months.
      At the 3-month visit, both groups be evaluated and the delayed activation group will have
      their devices reactivated.

      Subjects will have neuropathic pain of various etiologies, including trauma, surgery or
      post-herpetic infections. Stimulators will be placed at the site target of the painful area,
      including the epifascial plane under the skin but above the muscles in the vicinity of the
      targeted branches of; A. Branches of Trigeminal Nerves in the Ophthalmic, Maxillary, or
      Mandibular B. Sensory branches of Facial Nerves C. Branches of the Occipital Nerves (Greater
      and/or Lesser) D. Branches of the Cervical Plexus (Superficial and/or Deep)

    <description>The Halo Craniofacial Nerve Stimulator System is a wirelessly powered neurostimulator for pain in the face or head (not for headaches or migraine). This technology includes an implanted stimulator with an embedded receiver. The energy source is a small, external, rechargeable transmitter, which is worn by the patient. The transmitter sends the therapy program and power through the skin to the receiver.</description>
