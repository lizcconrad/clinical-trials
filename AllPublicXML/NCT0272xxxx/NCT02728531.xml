  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the established role of high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) combined with rituximab, along
      with recent data showing the encouraging efficacy of bendamustine, the investigators seek to
      integrate the synergistic effects of these medicines in alternating cycles as induction
      therapy prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Based on prior experience with
      bendamustine and rituximab (BR) based induction therapy, the investigators seek to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of stem cell mobilization in this pilot study

    <description>Bendamustine on Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5.
In Cycle 1, rituximab on Day 1 or 2 at the investigator's discretion. Given on Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 6.
On Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, cytarabine will be administered every 12 hours for a total of 4 doses.
Growth factor will be administered subcutaneously within 72 hours of completion of each even-numbered cycles of chemotherapy.
Leukapheresis will begin when the total WBC ≥ 5000/ μL and continue daily until collection of ≥ 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg (with a maximum of 5 courses of apheresis).
Standard of care peripheral blood autologous stem cell harvest will proceed per institutional guidelines and begin during Cycle 6 following rituximab and cytarabine therapy, when the total WBC ≥ 5000/ μL. Collection will continue on a daily basis until collection of ≥ 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg.</description>

          -  Severe concurrent illness, which would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Subjects with serologic status reflecting active viral hepatitis B or C infection are
