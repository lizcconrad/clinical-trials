  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety in improving ovarian function of polycystic
      ovarian syndrome in adults. Half of patients will receive Dong's extra-point acupuncture
      therapy, while the other half will receive Diane-35 as the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both Dong's extra-point acupuncture therapy and Diane-35 could improve the symptom of
      patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, but until now there is no definite evidence to
      indicate acupuncture could play the same role in improving ovarian function. So we design
      this study to observe the change of follicular development, ovary size and sex hormone(
      testosterone, follitropin, luteinizing hormone) before and after the acupuncture treatment,
      and do the noninferiority comparison with Diane-35 to definite the efficacy and advantage of
      acupuncture.
