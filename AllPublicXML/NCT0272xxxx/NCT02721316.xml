        -  the spontaneous use of emergency care

        -  the death rate from suicide and other causes

        -  the cumulative duration of hospitalization for suicidal behavior

        -  The patient's quality of life

        -  the number of patients lost to at the end of search

      Studying patient compliance with intensive nursing monitoring program.
