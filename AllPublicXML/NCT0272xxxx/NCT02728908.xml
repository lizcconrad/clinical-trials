      An open study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of a microwave-based device to detect
      traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (TICH), by comparing measurements on trauma patients with
      confirmed vs excluded TICH
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open study will enrol trauma patients admitted to the Trauma Unit, Department of Surgery
      at Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Sahlgrenska. It will compare patients where TICH has been
      confirmed by CT (group A) to patients where CT has ruled out TICH (group B). Patients will be
      asked to participate in the study as early as possible after admission and CT scan. After
      physical examination, checking inclusion/exclusion criteria, and after informed consent has
      been acquired, the baseline microwave-based measurement will be performed. The diagnostic
      procedure is estimated to take 15 min; whereof total subject measurement time will be less
      than five minutes. Follow-up microwave measurements will be performed in conjunction with any
      follow-up CTs performed as part of the standard of care, during the hospitalized treatment
      period. If no follow-up CTs are performed as part of the standard of care, only the baseline
      microwave measurement will be performed.

      Safety will be followed throughout the study, and a safety follow-up will be performed 12
      hours after the last microwave-based investigation is finalized.
