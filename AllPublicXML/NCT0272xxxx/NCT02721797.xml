  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is an inherited disease of collagen, found in connective
      tissues, such as skin. EDS patients suffer from joint and skin problems (skin
      hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility) along with a large range of other disorders,
      including, delayed wound healing with atrophic scarring, easy bruising, tissue fragility,
      gastrointestinal and gum problems. There are many different types of EDS, with different
      mechanisms of action, and not all of these are well understood. This study will used advanced
      microscopy techniques called atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy
      (SEM) to analyse the changes in collagen as a result of EDS, compared to normal collagen.
      These changes will be viewed at the micron and nanoscale level (between 1,000 to 100,000 x
      magnification), and will focus on the differences in collagen construction through a process
      called cross-linking. These changes could potentially help clinicians understand the root
      cause of EDS symptoms, and provide a deeper knowledge of cross-linking disorders in collagen.
      Increasing our knowledge of how collagen is affected in EDS patients, may lead to improved
      treatment options for patients.
