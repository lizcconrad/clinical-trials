      Evaluate the effects of using an intra-oral camera (IOC) during supportive periodontal
      therapy (SPT), on the psychological, behavioral and clinical parameters of patients with
      gingivitis, outlined by evidence and a theory-based framework.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A group of 78 adult patients with gingivitis receiving an SPT was randomized into two groups:
      IOC and control.

      Bleeding on Marginal Probing (BOMP), self-reported dental hygiene behaviors, and
      psychological determinants of behavior change (outcome expectancies, self-efficacy and
      planning) and IOC opinion were evaluated one week before or during the consultation and four
      months later.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The gingival condition was assessed using the BOMP (Bleeding on Marginal Probing) index , as described by Van der Weijden et al. (1994).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>In this index, bleeding is scored during 30 seconds of probing using a 3 point scale from 0 to 2 (0 - no bleeding, 1 - point bleeding, 2 - excess bleeding).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dental Hygiene (Flossing and tooth-brushing habits)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess dental hygiene, two questions were asked on brushing and flossing habits. Individual scores for brushing and flossing were calculated and a composite score was also computed for both (referred to as Dental Hygiene). A 5 point Likert-scale was used. Item example: In the last two weeks/four months how often have you flossed your teeth?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring Health Behavior Change: Health Action Process Approach Model (HAPA, Schwarzer, 2008)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures adapted to oral health from previous studies with the HAPA model (Godinho et al. 2015) were used. All the psychological variables were evaluated using a 7 point Likert-type scale, ranging from totally disagree (1) to totally agree (7).</description>

    <description>Dental appointment, one hour and included activities that are normally part of a SPT consultation (Bardet et al. 1999), as well as specific behavior change techniques, such as the use of reinforcement, goal-setting and feedback as described by Newton and Asimakopoulou (2015). Special attention was given to patient communication and words such as 'cleaning' and 'hygiene' were replaced by therapeutic synonyms (e.g. inflamed areas and controlling the inflammation). In this group, the device SOPROCARE® by Acteon was used in the examination and diagnosis and also for the establishment of therapeutic goals, strategies and skills.</description>

    <description>Dental appointment, one hour and included activities that are normally part of a SPT consultation (Bardet et al. 1999), as well as specific behavior change techniques, such as the use of reinforcement, goal-setting and feedback as described by Newton and Asimakopoulou (2015) and considered crucial to the accomplishment of long term behavior change. Moreover, special attention was given to patient communication and words such as 'cleaning' and 'hygiene' were replaced by therapeutic synonyms (e.g. inflamed areas and controlling the inflammation) in order to focus patients´ attention on the varied facets of oral health care and increase their perception of the treatment needs. In this group, the device SOPROCARE® by Acteon was not used.</description>
