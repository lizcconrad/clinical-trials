  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the CryoBalloon™ Full Ablation System for the ablation of human
      esophageal epithelium in patients scheduled to undergo esophagectomy for reasons unrelated to
      the objective of the study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcomes for the study are the safety and treatment effect of the CryoBalloon™
      Ablation System. An Esophagectomy will be performed as scheduled following the ablation
      procedure; histopathological analysis of surgically-resected specimens will be performed.
