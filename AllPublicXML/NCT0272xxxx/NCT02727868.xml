  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of the impact of environment on the incidence of cancer is a major public
      health issue. Increased knowledge in this area is necessary for the implementation of primary
      prevention means with appropriate preventive measures but also to the implementation of
      secondary prevention measures with targeted screening actions.

      Among the environmental exposures that may lead to cancer, mutagenic environments are of
      major importance, and the causal link between environmental genotoxicity and cancer has been
      established for a long time. It is also well established that susceptibility to mutation is
      highly variable among individuals. This is explained by genetic polymorphisms of genes
      involved in metabolism and in genome stability.

      The identification of biomarkers of exposure to mutagenic environments is necessary for
      assessing the impact of an environment in humans. Some studies in animals have shown that the
      PIG-A gene may be a biomarker of exposure to a mutagenic environment. In particular, a
      significant increase in erythrocyte PIG-A mutants has been demonstrated in rats after a
      genotoxic exposure to cisplatin, but it has so far not been evaluated in humans. One study of
      healthy volunteers shows that the frequency of PIG-A mutated cells in humans can be estimated
      efficiently and reliably.

      The PIG-A gene meets all the necessary criteria for a sentinel gene for tracking of
      spontaneous somatic mutation frequency or induced a mutagenic environment: ubiquitous
      expression, phenotypic change linked to a mono-allelic mutation viability of mutated cells ,
      spectrum off inactivating mutations (deletions, substitutions, chromosomal rearrangements).
      Finally, the detection of the disappearance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol on the plasma
      membrane is easily achievable by flow cytometry.

Between the two groups of patients at T0 then,
Within each group between T0 (before exposure), T1 (in process), T2 (end of treatment) and T3 (in therapeutic monitoring post) using non-parametric tests on paired and unpaired.</description>

    <description>Determining the frequency of micronucleated binucleate cells in culture will be performed on the samples at T0 and T3 each patient of both groups. The frequency distribution of micronucleated cells will be compared within each group between T0 and T3 using non-parametric tests on paired series.
A difference shall be considered significant if p &lt;0.05.</description>
