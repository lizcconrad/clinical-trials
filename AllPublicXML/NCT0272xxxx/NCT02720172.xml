  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this two-group randomized controlled trial is to gather preliminary
      evidence on the efficacy and safety of early postoperative exercise for improving disability,
      pain, and general physical health in patients after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion
      (ACDF) surgery. Our central hypothesis is that an early home exercise program (HEP) performed
      within the first six weeks after surgery will decrease disability and pain and improve
      general health, through increases in physical activity and self-efficacy and reductions in
      fear of movement. The results of our randomized trial will advance research on postoperative
      management for patients with cervical spine surgery and provide evidence in line with a
      value-based healthcare approach for optimizing outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Surgical treatment of a cervical degenerative condition (cervical stenosis,
             spondylosis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, disc herniation) using anterior cervical
             discectomy and fusion procedure;

          2. English speaking due to feasibility of employing study personnel to deliver and assess
             the study intervention; and

          3. Age older than 21 years (younger individuals do not typically have a cervical
             degenerative condition)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients having surgery secondary to trauma, fracture, tumor, infection, or spinal
             deformity;

          2. Patients undergoing cervical corpectomy;

          3. Diagnosis or presence of severe psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia or other
             psychotic disorder, including but not limited to Brief Psychotic disorder and
             Delusional disorder;

          4. Documented history of alcohol and/or drug abuse;

          5. Patients having surgery under a workman's compensation claim; and

          6. Unable to provide a stable telephone or physical address
