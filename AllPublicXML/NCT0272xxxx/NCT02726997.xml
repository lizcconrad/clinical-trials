  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving the
      combination of MEDI4736 (durvalumab), carboplatin, and paclitaxel to patients with high-grade
      epithelial non-mucinous ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Researchers
      also want to learn how the study drug combination may affect DNA and RNA (the genetic
      material in cells) and proteins.

      This is an investigational study. Durvalumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Paclitaxel and carboplatin are FDA
      approved and commercially available. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are
      designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      This study has 2 parts: a safety lead-in and Phase 2.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to either
      the Safety Lead-in or the Phase 2 portion, depending on when you join the study. Up to 12
      participants will be enrolled in the Safety Lead-in, and up to 24 participants will be
      enrolled in Phase 2.

      If you are enrolled in the Safety Lead-in, the dose of durvalumab you receive will depend on
      when you join this study. The first 4 participants will receive the first dose level of
      durvalumab and be enrolled one at a time, every 3 weeks. Each new participant or group of up
      to 6 participants enrolling after that will receive either the same dose as the previous
      participant or group or a lower dose of either durvalumab or chemotherapy. This will continue
      until a tolerable and appropriate dose of durvalumab and chemotherapy is found.

      If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive durvalumab at the highest dose that was
      tolerated in the Safety Lead-in.

      Study Drug Administration:

      For all participants, the study drugs are given in 2 steps called Primary Therapy and
      Maintenance.

      In the Primary Therapy part of the study, each cycle is 21 days. You will receive the study
      drugs on the schedule below for 3 cycles before and then 3 cycles after your planned surgery
      (6 cycles total).

        -  You will receive paclitaxel by vein over 3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-6.

        -  You will receive carboplatin by vein over 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6.

        -  You will receive durvalumab by vein over 1 hour every 2 weeks in Cycles 1-6.

      After that, you may begin the Maintenance Phase. In this phase, cycles are 28 days long. You
      will receive durvalumab alone every 2 weeks for 7 more cycles (28 weeks). It will continue to
      be given by vein over 1 hour.

      Study Visits during Primary Therapy:

      At Week 1 of Cycles 1-6:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. In Cycles
           1-3, this blood will also be used for biomarker tests. The biomarker tests in this study
           may include genetic biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and may be
           related to your reaction to the study drug.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function (Cycles 1 and 6 only). In Cycle 1, an
           EKG will be performed within 1 hour before the start of the study drug infusion and then
           at least 1 more time in the 3 hours after the end of the infusion.

      At Weeks 2 and 3 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At Weeks 2 and 3 of Cycles 2-6, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      After Cycle 3, you will temporarily stop receiving the study drugs as you prepare for the
      surgery.

      At your visit before surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker tests.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      You will sign a separate consent form for the surgery that explains the procedure and its
      risks. During the surgery, tumor tissue will be collected for biomarker and genetic testing.
      All samples will be stored at MD Anderson for an unlimited amount of time for testing related
      to this study.

      At your visit after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At all visits during this part of the study except the day of surgery and the visit after
      surgery, you will complete 1, 2, 5, or all 7 study questionnaires. You will be told how many
      to complete each time. When you only complete 1 questionnaire at several of the visits, it
      should take about 10-15 minutes.

      Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed:

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the routine blood sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test.

        -  Part of the routine blood sample will be used for blood clotting tests.

      Study Visits During Maintenance Therapy:

      At Week 1 of Cycles 7-13:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker tests.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  You will complete 6 of the study questionnaires.

      At Week 3 of Cycles 7-13 blood (about 1 tablespoon) will drawn for routine tests.

      Every 12 weeks, you will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      At every other visit during Cycles 7-12 and at Weeks 1 and 4 of Cycle 13, you will complete
      1, 6, or all 7 study questionnaires. You will be told how many to complete each time.

      Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed:

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the routine blood sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test.

        -  Part of the routine blood sample will be used for blood clotting tests.

      Interviews:

      You will have 2 interviews with the study staff: before you receive any treatment and after
      you have completed at least 2 cycles of treatment before your tumor reduction surgery and
      after you have begun receiving maintenance therapy with durvalumab alone. Each interview may
      take 25-45 minutes.

      During the interviews, you will be asked questions about any symptoms you had during the time
      when you were diagnosed, symptoms you are currently having, and any symptoms you had when you
      received previous treatments for cancer. During the second interview, you will be asked how
      your symptoms have changed since the first interview.

      The interviews will be held over the phone or in a private conference room and will be
      digitally recorded. The study staff will transcribe (create a text copy of) the interview and
      will not record your name, medical record number, or any other identifying information. The
      electronic files and transcription of the interview will be stored securely.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 6 cycles of the study drug combination and up to 7 more cycles of
      durvalumab alone. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After your last study drug dose:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker tests.

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  You will complete 6 of the questionnaires.

      Follow-up:

      At 30 days after your last durvalumab dose:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests. If you can become
           pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a pregnancy test.

        -  You will complete 6 of the questionnaires.

      At Month 2 after your last durvalumab dose, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      At Month 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At Months 4, 6, 8, and 10, you will be asked how you are doing. This may also be done at
      Month 9, depending on how long you took durvalumab and the reason you stopped it. The study
      staff will tell you if you have this 9-month visit.

      At the Month 12 and then every 6 months, depending on how long you took durvalumab and the
      reason you stopped it, blood (about 3 tablespoons) may be drawn for routine tests.

      As often as the doctor thinks is needed, you will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status
      of the disease. This will depend on how long you took durvalumab and the reason you stopped
      it.

      If you choose not to return for follow-up visits, you can instead receive follow-up phone
      calls at Months 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after your last durvalumab dose and then every 2 months
      starting at Month 12. You will be asked how you are doing. The calls should take about 10-15
      minutes.

             choice of the patient, tubal ligation, vasectomised partner, barrier methods (eg, cap
             plus spermicide, sponge plus spermicide, diaphragm plus spermicide, or male condom
             plus a spermicide), intrauterine device methods (eg, Copper T or
             Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system), or hormonal methods (eg, any registered
             and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational
             agent) and that is administered via the oral, subcutaneous, transdermal, intrauterine,
             or intramuscular route as an implant, hormone shot or injection, combined pill,
             minipill or patch. All methods of contraception should be used in combination with the
             use of a condom by their male sexual partner for intercourse.

         22. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
