    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of the study is to identify potential biomarkers, immune gene expression
      signatures, and co-stimulatory pathways that may be used to understand the effect of immune
      checkpoint inhibitors on gynecologic cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial gynecologic malignancies are tumors of müllerian origin, which include ovarian,
      endometrial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, and account for &gt;70,000 new
      diagnoses and &gt;22,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. Treatment typically
      consists of a thorough cytoreductive and staging surgery in combination with platinum/taxane
      chemotherapy. Newer approaches adding anti-angiogenic therapies to chemotherapy have resulted
      in moderate improvements in recurrence free survival. However, despite these aggressive
      treatments, the majority of women with advanced stage at diagnosis will experience relapse.
      Unfortunately, relapsed disease is incurable and women ultimately die of their disease
      despite maximal efforts at cancer control using subsequent chemotherapy or targeted agents.
      There has been significant interest in incorporating immune checkpoint therapies in the
      treatment of gynecologic malignancies, especially given the durable remissions associated
      with these therapies in the treatment of melanoma and early indications of durable responses
      in recurrent ovarian cancer. At this time, little is known about whether or how to combine
      chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapies, and immunologic therapies for maximal benefit.
      Understanding the tumor microenvironment, particularly immune and angiogenic factors that
      contribute to tumor survival, as well as the changes that occur in response to immunotherapy
      is critical to identify favorable biomarker profiles which could lead to improved prognostic
      outcomes and inform the development and sequencing of therapies to maximize benefit.

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         11. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding.

         15. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         16. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         17. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. NOTE:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
