  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project aims to assess the feasibility of conducting Functional Communication
      Training in the UK with a small sample of young children (aged under 9) in an NHS setting.
      Three delivery formats will be assessed in order to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting
      FCT via different delivery methods within an NHS context. Participants will be four children
      aged under 9 who have an identified intellectual / developmental disability and display
      either self-injury, property destruction, or aggression at home. In addition, one family
      carer per child will be coached to implement the intervention, either following researcher
      intervention, or from the beginning. Data will be collected on challenging behaviour,
      communication responses, family carer confidence in managing behaviour, fidelity of
      intervention implementation, family quality of life, and acceptability of the intervention.
