      This is a proof-of-concept, open label study, to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and exploratory efficacy of 2.5 mg AIR DNase TM administered once daily for
      28 days via inhalation to Cystic Fibrosis subjects who have previously been treated with
      Pulmozyme®.

      This multicenter study will be conducted in approximately 10 sites and will enroll up to 15
      subjects.
