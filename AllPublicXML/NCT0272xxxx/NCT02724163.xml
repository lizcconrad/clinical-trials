      The main purpose of this study is :

        1. To establish which number of doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (up to a maximum of 3 doses)
           is tolerated and can be safety delivered in combination with cytarabine plus
           mitoxantrone or liposomal daunorubicin in induction

        2. To compare mitoxantrone (anthracenedione) &amp; cytarabine with liposomal daunorubicin
           (anthracycline) &amp; cytarabine as induction therapy.

        3. To compare a single dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with the optimum tolerated number of
           doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (identified by the dose-finding study) when combined with
           induction chemotherapy.

        4. To compare two consolidation regimens: high dose cytarabine (HD Ara-C) and fludarabine &amp;
           cytarabine (FLA) in standard risk patients.

        5. To compare the toxicity and effectiveness of two haemopoietic stem cell transplant
           (HSCT) conditioning regimens of different intensity: conventional myeloablative
           conditioning (MAC) with busulfan/cyclophosphamide and reduced intensity conditioning
           (RIC) with fludarabine/busulfan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MyeChild 01 is an international phase III clinical trial in children with acute myeloid
      leukaemia (AML); a disease with significant mortality. It will compare two induction
      chemotherapy regimens: mitoxantrone and cytarabine (current standard treatment) with
      liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine. This will test liposomal daunorubicin, which is
      believed to be less cardiotoxic than similar conventional drugs, although this is unproven.
      Patients responding well to induction chemotherapy are eligible for a randomisation of two
      consolidation regimens: high dose cytarabine (current standard treatment) or fludarabine and
      cytarabine (FLA); a regimen commonly used in patients with relapsed disease, testing whether
      FLA is more effective in front line therapy than standard consolidation treatment. Patients
      with cytogenetic features associated with a higher risk of relapse and those responding
      sub-optimally to induction treatment are candidates for haemopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) and are eligible for a randomisation comparing two HSCT conditioning regimens:
      myeloablative conditioning (MAC) (current UNited Kingdom (UK) standard) or reduced intensity
      conditioning (RIC). HSCT has not consistently shown benefit in high risk patients because the
      mortality associated with the procedure has outweighed the advantage from a reduction in
      relapse risk. This will test whether reducing the intensity of conditioning improves survival
      by reducing transplant related deaths without increasing the relapse rate. The trial
      incorporates a dose finding study for gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The aim is to identify the
      optimum tolerated number of doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (up to a total of 3 doses), which
      can be safely combined with either of the induction chemotherapy regimens and then to compare
      this number of doses with one dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The intensity of treatment will
      be directed by cytogenetics/molecular genetics and response assessed by minimal residual
      disease (MRD) levels measured by flow cytometry and molecular methodology.

             idarubicin (FLA-Ida) off trial.

          -  Patient is in complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)
             defined as &lt;5% blasts confirmed by flow cytometry/ molecular/FISH in a bone marrow
             aspirate taken within 6 weeks prior to randomisation to R4.

          -  Patient meets one of the following criteria and is a candidate for HSCT as per the
             protocol:

               -  High risk after course 1 (all patients with poor risk cytogenetics and patients
                  with intermediate risk cytogenetics who fail to achieve CR/CRi).

               -  Intermediate risk cytogenetics with MRD &gt;0.1% after course 1 and 2 measured by
                  flow. If no flow MRD marker of sufficient sensitivity is identified, a molecular
                  MRD marker with a sensitivity of &gt;0.1% may be used.

               -  Good risk cytogenetics with flow MRD &gt;0.1% confirmed by a decrease in molecular
                  MRD of &lt;3 logs or rising transcript levels after course 3 despite treatment
                  intensification (FLA-Ida) and after discussion with the Clinical Co-ordinators.

          -  Availability of a 9-10/10 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched family or unrelated
             donor or 5-8/8 matched cord blood unit with an adequate cell dose as defined by the
             protocol section 17.1.

          -  Written informed consent from the patient and/or parent/legal guardian.
