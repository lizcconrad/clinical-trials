      The purpose of this research study is to investigate how social standing in a game of
      Monopoly may influence behavior.

      Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires/surveys and health measures will be
      collected throughout the study visit. These health measures will include: blood pressure,
      heart rate, height/weight, waist circumference, percent body fat, resting metabolic rate, and
      salivary cortisol. Breakfast will be provided and then a 40-minute game of Monopolyâ„¢ will be
      played, and lunch will be provided after the game. Participants will be given an
      accelerometer to measure movements, and a food diary to be used for a 24-hour period. Once
      the 24-hour monitoring period has been completed, the participants will be finished with the
      study activities. The accelerometer and food diary will be returned by either bringing them
      to the investigators or mailing the items back to the investigators.
