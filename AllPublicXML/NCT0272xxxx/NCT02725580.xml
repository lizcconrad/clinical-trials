    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is the first human, open-label, single dose study of
      self-complementary AAV9 carrying the CLN6 gene delivered one-time intrathecally inserted by a
      lumbar puncture into Batten CLN6 Disease subjects. One cohort of patients with Batten CLN6
      Disease, with confirmed diagnosis, will undergo gene transfer. A minimum of twelve patients
      will be enrolled into the cohort.

      The proposed clinical trial is the first human, open-label, single dose study of
      self-complementary AAV9 carrying the CLN6 gene under the control of a hybrid CMV
      enhancer/chicken-β-actin promoter (scAAV9.CB.CLN6) delivered one-time through an intrathecal
      catheter inserted by a lumbar puncture into the interspinous into the subarachnoid space of
      the lumbar thecal sac. All twelve patients will receive a dose equivalent to (1.5 x10^13 vg).
      This will be administered premixed with 2.5 mL of the contrast Omnipaque™ at a concentration
      of 180 mgI/mL of the contrast via a 10 mL syringe and a Spinal Needle. If no clinically
      significant improvement without toxicity is observed, the possibility of adding an additional
      escalation cohort at a higher dose will be discussed with the FDA, DSMB and relevant
      oversight regulatory agencies.
