    <textblock>
      A no-cost intervention may improve adherence with a recommendation for higher-quality,
      lower-cost care for patients with critical illness endorsed by a collaborative of critical
      care societies. The investigators propose prompting consideration of functional outcomes.
      This trial will help establish the impact of the intervention on practice patterns including
      proxy engagement and elements of shared decision-making.
