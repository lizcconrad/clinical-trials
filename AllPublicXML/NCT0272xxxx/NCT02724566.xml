  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies have demonstrated in mouse models that (PYR1)-apelin-13 exerts a
      glucose-regulating action in vivo. The (PYR1)-apelin-13 effect on insulin sensitivity in
      healthy overweighed volunteers has been previously assessed in a phase I clinical trial
      (APELINS study; NCT02033473). The APELINS-2 clinical trial aims to expand the initial proof
      of concept to the population targeted by future innovative insulin-sensitizing therapies:
      patients living with type 2 diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin sensitivity is measured using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp method.
      The hypothesis of the investigators is that a continuous (pyr1)-apelin-13 infusion improves
      insulin sensitivity of type 2 diabetic patients compared to placebo infusion.

      This study could bring new elements for understanding the pathophysiology of insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans and could lead to the development of
      innovative therapies in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
