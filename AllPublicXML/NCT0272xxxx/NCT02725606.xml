  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics(PK)/pharmacodynamics(PD) of single subcutaneous injection of GW003 in breast
      cancer patients. Moreover, the efficacy will be assessed preliminary.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an single-center, open-label, randomized, active-controlled phase I study evaluating
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of single subcutaneous injections of GW003
      in the breast cancer patients.GW003 is recombinant human serum albumin/human
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(I)fusion protein .It is a long-acting
      G-CSF(Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor). In this study, participants will be
      administered a single dose of GW003. Every subject will only accept one dose. In addition to
      tolerability and safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, preliminary efficacy and
      immunogenicity of GW003 will be evaluated as well.
