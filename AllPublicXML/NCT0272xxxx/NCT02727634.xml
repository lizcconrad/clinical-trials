  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart is essentially a hydraulic pump which ensures adequate delivery of blood through
      generating pressure and forward flow of blood. The energy delivered by the heart is
      uncommonly measured clinically, and todays gold standard involves placing a plastic catheter
      into the lung arteries. The investigators have developed an ultrasound based approach to
      calculate this energy without the need for catheters through the heart. This novel approach
      is called ultrapower. Ultrapower involves the instantaneous multiplication of the cardiac
      output and the arterial blood pressure. The study aims to use the ultrasound based approach
      to investigate Cardiac Power in the coronary artery bypass graft population.

    <description>The intervention is a comparison between two methods of calculating the heart's energy delivery, cardiac power, measured in watts. A tertiary measurement is calculation of arterioventricular coupling. All patients will have cardiac power output calculated through the use of Doppler echocardiography. The echocardiography based cardiac output will be done through the velocity time integral of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). This will be compared against total power as measured by our Ultrapower approach which involves instantaneous doppler measurement of cardiac output through LVOT multiplied with simultaneous radial artery pressure. This and ejection fraction (for calculation of ventriculoarterial coupling) will be recorded at rest in neutral position preoperatively, directly post operatively and the day after operation. Directly postoperatively the power measurements will also be repeated in Trendelenburg and anti Trendelenburg position.</description>
