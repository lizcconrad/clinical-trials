  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if pembrolizumab (also called MK-3475)
      can help control the disease in patients with advanced cancer.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of certain
      types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, however it has not been approved for
      advanced cancer. In this study it is being used for research purposes only. The study doctor
      can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 250 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on your disease type. There will be 10 groups enrolled on this study for the 10
      different disease types being tested. Up to 25 participants will be enrolled in each of the
      10 disease groups.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day study cycle.
      The time between doses may increase if you have side effects.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy
           test.

      Every week until Week 9, every 2 weeks between Weeks 9 and 54, and then every 4 weeks after
      that until Week 81 or your treatment ends, whichever comes first, you will complete a
      questionnaire about your health and how you are feeling. This questionnaire will be either
      emailed to you or you will receive a phone call and an automated voice system will ask you
      these questions.

      Between Days 15-21 of Cycle 1:

        -  If the doctor thinks it is possible, you will have a tumor biopsy performed for PD
           testing.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy
           test.

      Every 9 weeks for 6 months and then every 12 weeks after 6 months (if the doctor thinks it is
      needed):

        -  You will have a CT scan, MRI, or bone scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for tumor
           marker testing.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 4 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn to check how well your blood clots and to check
           your thyroid function (every 3 cycles only).

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests (every 3 cycles only).

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy
           test.

      If your doctor thinks it is needed, these tests may be performed more often.

      Stopping Pembrolizumab:

      If the cancer has not gotten worse after 24 months on study, you will stop taking study
      therapy. You will complete a safety follow-up visit and then your disease status will be
      monitored every 8 weeks by imaging scans. If at any point during this time the cancer gets
      worse, you may be eligible to receive an additional 12 months of treatment with pembrolizumab
      during the Second Course. When you stop taking the study drug you will be asked to come in
      for a safety follow-up visit about 30 days later or before you start a new treatment for the
      cancer, whichever comes first.

      Second Course Treatment:

      If you stop taking the study drug because the disease goes away, and the disease comes back
      later, you may be able to start taking the study drug again. This will be known as &quot;Second
      Course Treatment&quot;.

      Depending on your tumor type, tumor marker data will also be collected for this study.

      Repeated Tests If The Disease Gets Worse:

      If the imaging scans shows that the cancer may have worsened, you may be asked to have
      another imaging scan at least 4 weeks later to confirm. The study doctor will discuss your
      options during the period between scans, which may include the following:

        -  Continue to receive treatment with the study drug or;

        -  Have study drug held until the time of the follow-up scan or;

        -  Discontinue from the study and instead receive an FDA approved drug.

      You may be eligible to receive treatment with a different investigational drug.

      If you decide to stay in the study until the confirmation scan, you will not be eligible to
      receive any of these other drugs until the worsening of the disease is confirmed.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 24 months, as long as the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest. If the disease gets worse after you have completed 24 months of
      treatment and stopped treatment, you may continue taking the drug for up to 12 months if your
      doctor thinks it is best. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if intolerable
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      End of Treatment Visit:

      After your last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the
      following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing.

        -  You will have a CT scan, MRI, or bone scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for tumor
           marker testing.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy
           test.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is possible, you will have a tumor biopsy performed for PD
           testing.

        -  If this visit happens before Week 81, you will complete a questionnaire about your
           health and how you are feeling.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Within 30 days after your last pembrolizumab dose:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check how well your blood
           clots, and thyroid function tests.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Every 9 weeks after your last pembrolizumab dose:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT scan, MRI, or bone scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for tumor
           marker testing.

      Every 12 weeks after your last dose of pembrolizumab, you will be contacted by phone to ask
      how you are doing. The call should take about 15-20 minutes.

          2. Be &gt;/= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Only Cohort 9 and Cohort 10 can have
             evaluable disease (non-measureable lesions). Tumor lesions situated in a previously
             irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such
             lesions. Patients may have bone metastatic disease evaluable according to tumor
             evaluation criteria best suitable and accepted for the tumor type evaluated.

          4. Have one of the following advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) solid tumor
             indications, that has progressed following standard therapies, where standard
             therapies are available: 1) Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 2) Small cell
             malignancies of non-pulmonary origin 3) Adrenocortical carcinoma 4) Medullary renal
             cell carcinoma 5) Carcinoma of unknown primary 6) Penile carcinoma 7) Vascular sarcoma
             8) Germ Cell Tumor 9) Paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma 10) Other rare tumors (except
             those tumor types listed in Exclusion #19/20)

          5. Have failed prior treatment within 6 months of consent date.

          6. Have biopsiable disease. Subjects must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy.
             Tumor lesions used for biopsy should not be lesions used as RECIST target lesions. In
             Cohort 9: Paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma or Cohort 10, where there is prominent bony
             disease, biopsies may not be possible due to the nature of the disease.

          7. Be willing to provide archival tissue. If archival tissue is not available, a newly
             obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion will be obtained. Newly-obtained
             is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of
             treatment on Day 1. In Cohort 9: Paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma or Cohort 10, where
             there is prominent bony disease, biopsies may not be possible due to the nature of the
             disease.

          8. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          9. Demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 28
             days of treatment initiation. Hematological: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
             &gt;/=1,000/mcL; Platelets &gt;/=75,000/mcL, Hemoglobin &gt;/=9 g/dL or &gt;/=5.6mmol/L without
             transfusion or EPO dependency (within 7 days of assessment). Renal Serum creatinine OR
             Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of
             creatinine or CrCl) &lt;/=1.5X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR &gt;/=60 mL/min for subject
             with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5X institutional ULN.

         10. CONTINUED FROM #8: Hepatic: Serum total bilirubin &lt;/=1.5X ULN OR Direct bilirubin &lt;/=
             ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT)
             &lt;/=2.5X ULN OR &lt;/=5X ULN for subjects with liver metastases, Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL.
             Coagulation: International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) &lt;/=1.5X ULN
             unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within
             therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants, Activated Partial Thromboplastin
             Time (aPTT) &lt;/=1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as

             therapy is permitted. Stable regimens of hormonal therapy i.e. for prostate cancer
             (e.g. leuprolide, a GnRH agonist), ovarian, or breast cancer are not exclusionary.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          3. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).

          4. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          5. Has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a
             previously administered agent. a. Note: Subjects with &lt;/= Grade 2 neuropathy are an
             exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. b. Note: If subject
             received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or
             complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

          6. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer, and
             diseases for which the treatment could reasonably include Pembrolizumab and are not
             part of the excluded tumor type list or not eligible for the phase I trial.

          7. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          8. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone
             daily or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of Pembrolizumab. Note:
             corticosteroids given within 24 hours of an imaging study for purposes of
             pre-medication in patients with hypersensitivity to radiologic contrast agents are
             allowed.

          9. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

         10. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         11. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         13. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

         18. Is participating in Cohort 10 and has melanoma; non-small cell lung cancer;
             hepatocellular carcinoma; Merkel cell carcinoma; colon or rectal adenocarcinoma; anal
             canal squamous cell carcinoma; pancreas adenocarcinoma; esophageal squamous cell
             carcinoma or adenocarcinoma (including GE junction); biliary tract adenocarcinoma
             (gallbladder and biliary tree but excluding ampulla of vater cancers); carcinoid
             tumors; neuroendocrine carcinomas (well or moderately differentiated pancreatic
             neuroendocrine tumor); ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer; triple negative breast
             cancer; ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma;
             endometrial carcinoma; cervical squamous cell cancer; vulvar squamous cell carcinoma;
             small cell lung cancer; mesothelioma (malignant pleural mesothelioma); thyroid cancer
             (papillary or follicular subtype); salivary gland carcinoma; nasopharyngeal carcinoma;
             glioblastoma multiforme; leiomyosarcoma;

         19. CONTINUED FROM #18: prostate adenocarcinoma; gastric adenocarcinoma; or small bowel
             malignancy.
