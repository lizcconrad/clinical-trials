  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to combine a single infusion of Ketamine with 7-days of trauma
      focus psychotherapy to relieve post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms more
      effectively. This treatment has the potential to produce a significant therapeutic effect
      that otherwise would take months to occur.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the current research findings on the therapeutic effectiveness of trauma focus
      psychotherapy and of ketamine, combining the two treatments may yield a promising new rapid
      7-day treatment for PTSD. As PTSD symptoms' structure is comprised of several unique clusters
      which include re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing/depression and hypervigilance the
      investigators hypothesize that by combining Ketamine with prolonged exposure (PE) the
      investigators can address these symptoms clusters more effectively. This treatment has the
      potential to produce a significant therapeutic effect that otherwise would take months to
      occur by tapping on the enhanced neuroplasticity and the antidepressant effect of ketamine
      (which lasts between 24hrs to 7 days), to promote rapid changes in learning and memory using
      prolonged exposure therapy within this unique &quot;window of opportunity&quot;.

      During the first visit participants will undergo a clinical interview to establish a PTSD
      diagnosis and other eligibility criteria. If found eligible participants will be invited to
      take part in this 7-day rapid treatment trial for PTSD.

      On the first therapy visits, participants will be educated about the psychological treatment
      that will be provided and the potential benefit of ketamine to enhance the psychotherapy
      outcomes.

      On the second day of the study, participants will receive an infusion of ketamine and will
      undergo an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and will receive the second psychotherapy
      session.

      On days 3-6 participants will attend a 60-90 minutes psychotherapy session to address their
      PTSD symptoms.

      Day 7 will include another MRI scan and the last psychotherapy session.

      Participants will be asked to come back for a follow up evaluation of their PTSD symptoms 30
      and 90 days post discharge.

    <description>After the reactivation of the scripted memories during PE on day 2, the ketamine infusion procedure will begin inside the MRI. A physician will oversee and administer the ketamine infusions. A nurse will accompany the subject throughout the study sessions, from the insertion of bilateral cannula for drug infusion and blood sampling, to the recovery following ketamine infusion. Whilst subjects undergo the infusion, their heart rate and blood pressure will be constantly monitored. The participant will receive a steady state ketamine infusion of 0.50 mg/kg/hour. The infusion will continue for 40 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between the ages of 21-55 years. This age range was chosen to fit with
             prior samples in which no adverse effects of ketamine have been observed. Adults in
             the 18-20 ranges have been eliminated because previous experience indicates that they
             often lack the maturity to participate effectively in similar protocols. Females will
             be included if they are not pregnant and agreed to utilize a medically accepted birth
             control method (to include oral, injectable, or implant birth control, condom,
             diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, abstinence, or partner
             with vasectomy) or if post-menopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically sterile.

             screening.

          -  No more than mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) according to a modified version of the
             Brief TBI Screen (Schwab, et al., 2006).

          -  Must not have a medical/neurological problem or use medication that would render
             ketamine unsafe by history or medical evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnostic history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or
             schizoaffective disorder or currently exhibiting psychotic features as determined by
             the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) (First, et al. 2010); dementia or
             suspicion thereof, are excluded. Other DSM Axis I disorders are permitted as long as
             they are not considered primary disorders.

          -  Patients with a history of antidepressant-induced hypomania or mania as determined by
             open-ended psychiatric interview.

          -  Serious suicide or homicide risk, as assessed by evaluating clinician; A serious
             suicide risk will be considered an inability to control suicide attempts, imminent
             risk of suicide in the investigator's judgment, or a history of serious suicidal
             behavior, which is defined using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
             (Posner et al., 2011) as either (1) one or more actual suicide attempts in the 3 years
             before study entry with the lethality rated at 3 or higher, or (2) one or more
             interrupted suicide attempts with a potential lethality judged to result in serious
             injury or death.

          -  Substance abuse or dependence during the 6 months prior to screening as determined by
             the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID).

          -  Any significant history of serious medical or neurological illness.

             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedure.

          -  A positive pre-study (screening) urine drug screen or, at the study physician's
             discretion on any drug screens given before the scans.

             child-bearing potential at screening or prior to any imaging day.

          -  Positive HIV or Hepatitis B tests. This test will take place at the screening visit.
             Subjects will be invited back to the Yale Depression Research Program either for their
             next study visit or for a HIV/Hep debriefing session. A study physician will inform
             them in person of the results. They will be given access to counselling and advised of
             the appropriate next steps.

          -  Has received either prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC) centrally active medicine or
             herbal supplements within 60 days of enrollment into the study. Subjects who have

             the opinion of the principal/co-investigator, the medication received will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.
