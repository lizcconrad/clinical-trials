      Objective of this study are to compare the interface pressure by applying ordinary elastic
      bandage (OEB) and CPG-EB. In addition, investigators compared the percentage of patients who
      could apply the optimal pressure with OEB and CPG-EB.

    <textblock>
      For treatment of venous ulcer, it was shown that compression bandaging of 35-45 mmHg
      sub-bandage pressure at the ankle was shown in several studies to be safe and effective.The
      efficacy of compression bandage considerably depends on the applied pressure and it is
      therefore largely dependent on the individual applying bandages. The lower pressure leads to
      treatment failure while the higher pressure leads to skin complication.

      The use of objective devices to proof that the bandage is sufficiently applied is not
      available for every patients. To help the patients to apply the bandage with optimal
      pressure, investigators developed the customized pressure guide elastic bandage (CPG-EB) by
      using sub-bandage pressure guidance.

      Objective of this study are to compare the interface pressure by applying ordinary elastic
      bandage (OEB) and CPG-EB. In addition,investigators compared the percentage of inexperienced
      staffs who could apply the optimal pressure with OEB and CPG-EB.

    <description>Investigators developed the customized pressure guide elastic bandage (CPG-EB). The experienced nurse applied the elastic bandages to each patient with sub bandage pressure monitoring. The target pressure was 35-45 mmHg. Measurements of the pressure applied by bandages was performed at point B1 corresponding to the height where the Achilles' tendon turns into the gastrocnemius muscle with Picopress (MicroLAB Elettronica, Ponte S. Nicolo, Italy). If the target pressure 35-45 mmHg was achieved, the circular ink stamp was applied into the entire bandages. The markers in CPG-EB had elliptical shape when they were not stretched. They turned into circular shape when they were stretched.
For the OEB, Bandaging was applied by spiral methods. Three EB were applied with 50 % stretching and 50% overlapping from foot to just below knee level.</description>
