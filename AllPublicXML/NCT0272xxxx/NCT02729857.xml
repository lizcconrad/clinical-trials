        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 - 30 years of age

          -  Healthy or diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (mutation in gene coding
             for LDL-receptor). FH subjects can be included if they are:

               1. Untreated

               2. Treated with low dose statin (&lt;20 mg atorvastatin, &lt;10-20 mg simvastatin or &lt;5-10
                  mg rosuvastatin)

               3. Treated with high dose statin and willing to use low dose statin during the last
                  4 weeks prior to both study visits (total 8 week period)

               4. Treated with high dose statins and willing to discontinue statin treatment during
                  the last 4 weeks prior to both study visits (total 8 week period)

          -  BMI 18.5 - 30 kg/m2

          -  Stabile weight the last three months prior to the first study visit (weight change
             less than ± 5 % of body weight)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CRP &gt;10 mg/L

          -  TG &gt;4 mmol/L

          -  Comorbidities including diabetes type I and II, coronary heart disease, haemophilia,
             anaemia, gastro intestinal disease, renal failure and hyperthyroidism

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  Allergic or intolerant to gluten or egg

          -  Not willing to stop using n-3 fatty acid supplements during the last 4 weeks prior to
             both study visits

          -  Using medications affecting lipid metabolism or inflammation, except statins for FH
             subjects

          -  Hormone treatment (except contraception and thyroxin (stabile dose last 3 months))

          -  Donating blood 2 months within or during study period

          -  Tobacco smoking

          -  Large alcohol consumption (&gt;40g daily)
