      This Study will assess the stability of the ProLung China Test classification algorithm when
      used as an adjunct to CT scan. This Study will assess whether there are any potential safety
      concerns of the ProLung China Test when used to evaluate patients with a positive CT scan for
      lung cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female, age 18 to 80.

          2. Subject has undergone CT scan of the lung(s) that indicates one or more nodules or
             lesions.

          3. Subject's pulmonary nodule or lesion is greater than 4mm and smaller than 50mm. Size
             is determined by the largest nodule or lesion dimension identified from CT imaging.

          4. Subject must be able to receive a ProLung China Test within 30 days of abnormal CT
             within 14 days prior to the tissue biopsy or surgical resection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has an implanted electronic device in the chest. Subject receiving therapy for
             suspected chest infection such as fungal infection or tuberculosis.

          2. Subject with diagnosed malignancy other than lung cancer who has 2 or more suspicious
             pulmonary nodules.

          3. Subject has received an invasive medical or surgical procedure within the thoracic
             cavity within 30 days prior to the ProLung China Test or within the previous 14 days
             for a bronchoscopic procedure.

          4. Subject presents with an anomalous physical or anatomical condition that precludes
             ProLung China Test measurement.

          5. Subject will have undergone unusually strenuous exercise within 24 hours.

          6. Subject who has significant systemic diseases such as uncontrolled diabetes, advanced
             heart failure, or a recent myocardial infarction, or other medical condition such as
             severe morbid obesity that in the judgment of the Principal Investigator would make
             him/her unsuitable for the Study.
