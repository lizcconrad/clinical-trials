    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of daily consumption of a margarine
      enriched with plant sterol esters and fish oil on fasting triglycerides (TG) concentrations.

      The study also aims to investigate the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting total
      cholesterol (TC), Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), High-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C) and non-HDL-C.

      At last, the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting apolipoprotein concentrations
      will be explored.

      enriched with plant sterol esters and fish oil on fasting TG concentrations.

      The study also aims to investigate the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting TC,
      LDL-C, HDL-C and non-HDL-C.

      At last, the effect of plant sterols and fish oil on fasting apolipoprotein concentrations
      will be explored. This exploratory objective will only be analyzed if a relevant treatment
      effect on fasting triglycerides concentrations is observed.
