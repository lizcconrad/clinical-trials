    <textblock>
      &quot;Poor corneal epithelialization problem&quot; can be found in a lot of ocular surface disorders,
      including limbal insufficiency, dry eye, chemical burn and neurotrophic disorders. Delayed
      corneal epithelialization under any circumstances can lead to corneal infection, corneal
      melting, corneal opacity, pain or blurred vision. It is thus important to develop
      pharmacological methods to promote corneal epithelial wound healing in those patients.
      Previously, various epitheliotrophic growth factors, autologous serum, cord blood serum, etc.
      have been proved to be effective in promoting corneal epithelial wound healing. However,
      those topical agents have the drawbacks including the difficulties during preparation,
      expensive price, non-standardized quality and the risk of contamination during preparation.
      It will be clinically important to find other blood derivatives which are effective,
      convenient for use, stable in quality and being cheap.

      During the recent few years, various&quot; platelet related blood derivatives&quot; have been proved to
      contain a lot of epitheliotrophic growth factors, and can promote wound healing. Among those
      products, &quot;platelet lysate&quot; has the benefits of being commercially available. It can avoid
      the complicated producing procedure, and has stable quality. Although platelet lysate has
      been widely used in various medical fields, especially in culturing mesenchymal stem cells,
      its potential in promoting corneal epithelial wound healing has not been proven. The purpose
      of this project is to explore the possibility of using platelet lysate to treat patients with
      poor corneal epithelialization problem, and compare its epitheliotrophic ability with other
      blood derivatives. The cultured human corneal epithelial cell line will be used for all
      experiments, and will be cultured with media containing different blood products: (1) control
      group without blood derivatives, (2) fetal bovine serum, (3) human serum, (4) platelet lysate
      commercial product—UltraGro, (5)platelet lysate commercial product---PlatMax. MTS assay will
      be used to measure proliferation ability. &quot;Scratch-induced directional wounding assay&quot; and
      &quot;Boyden chamber chemotaxis assa&quot; will be used to measure cell migration. Scanning electron
      microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) and
      immunohistochemistry with junctional proteins will be used to measure cellular
      differentiation. Through these experiments, the investigator aim to understand whether
      platelet lysate can replace other blood derivatives, and be used for treating patients with
      corneal epithelialization problem.

      Beside, current medications in dry eye are all manufactured, transported and used in the form
      of liquid form. However, it is more disturbing in transporting, commercializing, storing and
      the limitation of expiration date for current medications compared with powder form
      medications. Therefore, improving the convenience of utilizing and storage without at the
      expense of the efficacy of blood-derivatives has become a critical issue. Our study also
      aimed at trying to produce platelet-related derivatives (including platelet lysate) and human
      serum into the form of dry powder and resuspended it with preservative-free artificial tears.
      The investigator would compare the epitheliotrophic ability of the liquid form of blood
      derivatives and the powder form of blood derivatives.

      Since human serum is needed for comparison , the investigator proposed this IRB to collect
      human serum from healthy volunteers。

    <description>The purpose of this project is to collect the human serum as a control group, and to explore the possibility of using &quot;platelet lysate&quot; to treat patients with poor corneal epithelialization problem, and compare its epitheliotrophic ability with other blood derivatives. Besides, the investigator would also compared the efficacy of dry powder of platelet lysate and other blood derivatives.
The cultured human corneal epithelial cell line will be used for all experiments, and will be cultured with media containing different blood products:
control group without blood derivatives,
fetal bovine serum,
human peripheral blood serum
platelet lysate commercial product—UltraGro
platelet lysate commercial product---PlatMax.
the dry powder of human peripheral blood serum resuspended with artificial tear The investigator will evaluate the effects of these blood derivatives.</description>
