  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) provides intravenous nutritional supplementation for infants unable
      to absorb adequate enteral nutrients secondary to insufficient intestinal length or function.
      In early PN-associated cholestasis, the dose of traditional soy based lipid is limited to 1
      g/kg/day which often limits the growth capacity of parenteral nutrition-dependent infants.
      Inadequate growth is directly related to poor neurological outcomes, failure to facilitate
      mechanical ventilation, and less growth of the neonate's already damaged intestine.
      Ultimately, these outcomes can lead to severe disability and death. To mitigate these
      deleterious effects and optimize growth, parenteral nutrition-dependent infants with
      cholestasis who are not adequately growing on 1 g/kg/day of soy-based lipid emulsion must
      have a greater intake of lipids to meet their needs for weight, length, and head
      circumference growth.

      SMOFlipid contains a mixture of 4 different lipid sources: soybean oil which provides
      essential fatty acids, olive oil which is high in monounsaturated fatty acids that are less
      susceptible to lipid peroxidation than polyunsaturated fatty acids, medium-chain
      triglycerides which show a faster metabolic clearance than long-chain triglycerides, and fish
      oil which provides the supply of omega-3 fatty acids. The utility of Omegaven and soy-based
      lipid emulsion is limited as these are restricted to 1 g/kg/day in cholestatic infants.
      SMOFlipid is safe to be provided at the usual goal infusion amount of 3 g/kg/day. Because
      this product includes both omega-6 and omega-3 lipids, it provides the benefits of the
      omega-3s for the liver and provides more than enough omega-6s to meet essential fatty acid
      requirements. Its use in situations in which growth is inadequate in babies who must be
      restricted to 1 g/kg/day can be expected to improve their growth and likely markedly increase
      their chances of both a good neurological outcome and survival.

      The aim of this research study is to determine if the unique formulation of SMOFLipid will
      cause less hepatic inflammation compared to soy only intralipids.

      The neonates who are being treated at the University of Florida Health Neonates Intensive
      Care Unit and are anticipated to need more than 21 days of intravenous nutrition will be
      considered as potential subjects. These subjects will receive the unique formulation of
      SMOFLipid

      The following data will be collected from the subject's EMR by members of the research team:

        -  Lab values that evaluate liver function

        -  Growth parameters like head circumference, length, weight

        -  Medical/surgical history

        -  Time to resolution of bilirubin, time to liver transplant, time to death

        -  Length of hospital stay

        -  Rates of blood infections

      Subjects will remain on SMOFlipid until weaned from PN.

In addition, the following monitoring for effects of SMOFlipid will be performed: total days of parenteral nutrition, maximum conjugated bilirubin, time to resolution of bilirubin, time to liver transplant, time to death, positive blood cultures, rates of increase in weight, length, and head circumference, time dependent changes in liver function tests, including triglycerides, and length of hospital stay.
SMOFlipid: SMOFlipid contains a mixture of 4 different lipid sources: soybean oil which provides essential fatty acids, olive oil which is high in monounsaturated fatty acids that are less susceptible to lipid peroxidation than polyunsaturated fatty acids, medium-chain triglycerides which show a faster metabolic clearance than long-chain triglycerides, and fish oil which provides the supply of omega-3 fatty acids.</description>

            <description>Subjects with cholestasis will receive 3 G/kg/day of intravenous SMOFlipid daily until parenteral nutrition (PN) is discontinued. In addition, the following monitoring for effects of SMOFlipid will be performed: total days of parenteral nutrition, maximum conjugated bilirubin, time to resolution of bilirubin, time to liver transplant, time to death, positive blood cultures, rates of increase in weight, length, and head circumference, time dependent changes in liver function tests, including triglycerides, and length of hospital stay.
SMOFlipid: SMOFlipid contains a mixture of 4 different lipid sources: soybean oil which provides essential fatty acids, olive oil which is high in monounsaturated fatty acids that are less susceptible to lipid peroxidation than polyunsaturated fatty acids, medium-chain triglycerides which show a faster metabolic clearance than long-chain triglycerides, and fish oil which provides the supply of omega-3 fatty acids.</description>
