  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a public health project with the aim to treat overweight in children
      9-11 years of age. After the first consultation the children are randomized to either
      continue the treatment at The Child Obesity Clinic, Child Department or to have the following
      2-3 consultations on distance with Lync. Last visit for all children is on the Child Obesity
      Clinic after approximately 12 months. Follow up after at least 1 years will be performed.

      This superiority study is a randomized trial with two independent treatment arms. The target
      for the enrollment is 50% in each of the two treatment groups.

      With 60 patients in each group, the study has 80% statistical power at 5% significance level
      to detect an average difference between the treatment groups in the intra-individual change
      in the BMI Z-score that is 0.51 x the standard deviation in the intra-individual change.
      Previous data from the investigators own group suggest that a reasonable estimate of the
      standard deviation in the intra-individual change in the BMI Z-score following intervention
      is 0.42. Thus, the study has 80% statistical power at 5% significance level to detect a
      difference in the intra-individual change in the BMI Z-score that is 0.51 x 0.42 = 0.21 on
      average. The study will with the present funding end its follow up in June 2017.
