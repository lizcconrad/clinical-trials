      To compare the tocolytic efficacy oxytocin receptor antagonist (Atosiban) with that of
      calcium channel blockers (Nifedipine) among women with multiple gestation who present with
      threatened preterm labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth remains the principal cause of early neonatal death. Infants born preterm
      (before 37 weeks' gestation) often suffer significant immediate morbidity and need lengthy
      stays in neonatal intensive care units. Moreover, there is a significant risk of long-term
      neurological morbidity in a proportion of the survivors. Patients with a multiple gestation
      are at significant risk for preterm labor and delivery as approximately 60% of all those
      pregnancies will be delivered preterm.

      A number of oxytocin receptor antagonists have been developed, and of these, three, atosiban,
      barusiban and retosiban have been investigated in humans as tocolytic agents. To date, only
      atosiban is in use outside of clinical trials. Atosiban is an oxytocin receptor antagonist
      which was specifically developed for the treatment of preterm labor. Early reports of the use
      of Atosiban for tocolysis showed promise both in vitro and in animal studies, and preliminary
      studies in pregnant and non-pregnant humans suggested a very low incidence of maternal side
      effects .

    <description>After random allocation to a treatment group, women will receive Atosiban as follows:
Atosiban was given as a single loading intravenous dose, 6.75 mg in 0.9% sodium chloride solution, followed by an intravenous infusion of 300 micrograms/min in 0.9% sodium chloride solution for the first 3 hours and then 100 micrograms/min for another 45 hours. The choice of the dose regimen for Atosiban was consistent with the recommendations of the product labeling.</description>
