  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cochlear implant is an electrical hearing aid that restores the perception of surrounding
      sounds and speech intelligibility in profoundly deaf patients. During surgery, the
      labyrinthine break necessary for insertion into the cochlea of the implantable part may cause
      a malfunction of the vestibular system which can induce dizziness, balance and perception (of
      the gravitational vertical) disorders. Vestibular compensation and new sonic interactions
      could alter the balance control and the visual and postural spatial orientation perceptions.

      The usual treatment includes the monitoring of the patient's quality of life, of the
      vestibular function and of hearing. This study adds an assessment of spatial orientation and
      of posture.

    <description>The same assessment will be performed 4 times (3 days before surgery, 3 days, 45 days, and one year after surgery).
The measure is the average difference between the gravitational vertical and the tilt of the platform (in degree) over 20 trials.</description>

The area covered by the centre of pressure in static posturography (eyes open and eyes closed) is calculated during trials within a specific and controled sound environment [quiet - implant OFF, quiet - implant ON, white noise (70 dB) - implant ON, the semantic content (70 dB) - implant OFF]</description>
