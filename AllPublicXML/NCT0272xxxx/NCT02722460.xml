      The aim of the study is to determine surrogate markers for prognostication of unfavorable
      outcome (death or persistent vegetative state) in cardiopulmonary arrest survivors. These
      patients are comatose. Conscious patients are unsuitable for prognostication.

      The aim of the study is to determine surrogate markers for prognostication of unfavorable
      outcome (death or persistent vegetative state) in cardiopulmonary arrest survivors. These
      patients are comatose. Conscious patients are unsuitable for prognostication.

      This will be a prospective mono-center survey (Department of Intensive Care Medicine,
      University Hospital Bern), evaluating the survival and neurological outcome after cardiac
      arrest. The study will be performed in cooperation with the Department of Neurology and
      Neuroradiology, University Hospital Bern.

      Inclusion: all patients surviving resuscitation after cardiac arrest older than 18 years.
      Detailed medical and neurological examination including 6-lead continuous EEG, 10/20 EEG and
      somatosensory evoked potentials, standard blood tests including Neuron-specific Enolase (NSE)
      and cerebral MRI will be assessed during the first 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Structured
      telephone interviews to determine outcome parameters (Cerebral Performance Category CPC,
      modified Ranking Scale mRS) will take place at day 30, after 3 and 12 month.

      The results of the registry could identify early comatose patients after cardiac arrest with
      no chance of a good neurological recovery and regain consciousness to avoid unjustified
      expectations of relatives and prolonged life-sustaining therapies. A good neurological
      recovery is defined as a CPC of 1 and 2 or a mRS 0-2. An unfavourable neurological outcome
      will be defined as persistent vegetative state and death (CPC 4 and 5, mRS 5-6).
