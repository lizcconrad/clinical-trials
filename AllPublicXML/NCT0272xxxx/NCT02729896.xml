  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of
      obinutuzumab + Atezo + Pola in participants with relapsed or refractory FL and rituximab +
      Atezo + Pola in participants with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The study will include an
      initial dose-escalation phase designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for
      Pola in this treatment combination, followed by an expansion phase in which Pola will be
      given at the RP2D. All participants will receive induction treatment with obinutuzumab +
      Atezo + Pola for 6 cycles. FL participants achieving a complete response (CR), partial
      response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at the end of induction (EOI) will receive maintenance
      treatment with obinutuzumab + Atezo and DLBCL participants achieving a CR or PR at EOI will
      be eligible to receive consolidation treatment with rituximab + Atezo.
