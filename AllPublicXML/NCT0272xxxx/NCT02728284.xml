  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate newer methods of performing cardiovascular
      MRI (CMR) that will provide new kinds of information related to the interplay between the
      cardiac and the respiratory cycles, such as the interaction between the left ventricle and
      the right ventricle during respiration . The primary statistical objective is to provide
      preliminary indications of the relative utility of the investigational imaging software in
      terms of image quality and suitability for routine clinical use. Image quality will be
      expressed in terms of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) and
      subjective Likert-type qualitative assessments independently provided by each of multiple
      blinded readers for each image. Suitability for routine use will be assessed in terms of
      imaging time and a binary indicator of whether, in the opinion of the investigator, adverse
      procedural complications (not expected) were encountered during a given imaging session.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be selected as they are scheduled for clinical MR examinations.

          -  Subjects will be selected on the basis of their willingness and ability to
             participate, on their comprehension of the informed consent document, on their
             likelihood of completing the study, and on the clinical appropriateness of the
             investigational technique for a given patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  electrical implants such as cardiac pacemakers or perfusion pumps

          -  ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial
             hearts, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or
             steel implants

          -  ferromagnetic objects such as jewelry or metal clips in clothing

          -  pre-existing medical conditions including a likelihood of developing seizures or
             claustrophobic reactions, and any greater than normal potential for cardiac arrest.
