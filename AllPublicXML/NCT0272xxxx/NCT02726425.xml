      This study evaluates the comparative effectiveness of a diabetes self management (DSM) group
      medical visit in the virtual world (Second life) verses a face-to-face format, aimed to
      increase physical activity and improve glucose control among Black/African American and
      Hispanic women with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the US is disproportionately high among minority
      women. In order to participate as partners in healthcare, DM patients need self-management
      education and support. Diabetes self-management (DSM) support is effective in helping DM
      patients make good choices and achieve clinical goals but is difficult to deliver in medical
      practice settings. Virtual reality technology can assist DM patients and their clinical teams
      with DSM support by providing effective educational tools in an engaging, learner-centered
      context that fosters self-efficacy and skill proficiency. Our prior work demonstrated that
      virtual worlds, like Second Life (SL), are suitable for supporting DSM education for
      patients. SL, an Internet-based virtual world, is an example of an immersive,
      three-dimensional environment which supports social networking and interaction with
      information.

      The investigators now aim to enhance the existing diabetes curriculum using a medical group
      visit design to study whether the Women in Control virtual world group medical visit leads to
      similarly effective health and educational outcomes compared to face-to-face group medical
      visits. The investigators aims are to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of the
      comparative effectiveness of a virtual world DSM group medical visit format vs. a
      face-to-face DSM group visit format to increase physical activity and improve glucose control
      among Black/African American and Hispanic women with uncontrolled DM at six month follow up,
      and to conduct a qualitative, ethnographic study of participant engagement with the virtual
      world platform during the virtual world group sessions, between group sessions, and following
      completion of the eight-week curriculum to characterize learners' self-directed interactions
      with the technology platform and assess the correlation of these interactions with DSM
      behaviors and diabetes control.
