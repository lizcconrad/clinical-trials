  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT), is considered the standard treatment of locally advanced
      rectal cancer with a positive impact on locoregional control and survival.However, patients
      with T4 rectal cancer show high risk of local recurrence after conventional treatment.
      Therefore investigators designed a prospective Phase II study on patients with locally
      advanced rectal cancer or locally recurrences, to evaluate the efficacy in terms of
      pathological response and resectability of concomitant boost RT (55 Gy/5 weeks) with
      concurrent Raltitrexed and Oxaliplatin (Tom-Ox) chemotherapy.

      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT), is considered the standard treatment of locally advanced
      rectal cancer with a positive impact on locoregional control and survival. However, patients
      with T4 rectal cancer show high risk of local recurrence (LR) after conventional treatment.
      This was a prospective Phase II study on patients with locally advanced rectal cancer or
      locally recurrences, to evaluate the efficacy in terms of pathological response and
      resectability of concomitant boost RT (55 Gy/5 weeks) with concurrent Raltitrexed and
      Oxaliplatin (Tom-Ox) chemotherapy. The primary aim was to assess the pathological complete
      response rate. Key secondary aim was the resectability. Secondary aims were evaluation of
      treatment-related acute and late toxicity, local control, disease-free survival and overall
      survival (OS). The follow-up period of each subjects started after the radiochemotherapy
      treatment and ended after a maximum of 36 months of observation or until death.

    <time_frame>8 weeks after chemo-radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Pathologic responses of the primary tumours were defined according to the Mandard regression grading system: grade 1 was recorded when no tumour cells remained in the primary tumour and lymph nodes (pCR); grade 2 was characterized by the presence of rare residual cancer cells scattered through the fibrosis; grade 3 was characterized by an increase in the number of residual cancer cells, but fibrosis still predominated; grade 4 showed residual cancer outgrowing fibrosis; and grade 5 was characterized by an absence of regressive changes. Good responders were defined those patients with a pathologic response with Mandard G1 or G2 and poor responder patients with Mandard G3, G4 or G5.</description>

    <description>Patients received concomitant boost RT (55 Gy/5 weeks) with concurrent Tom-Ox chemotherapy. The concurrent chemotherapy consisted of 15 min intravenous infusion Raltitrexed (Tomudex ®) 3 mg/m2 and a two-hours intravenous infusion of Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin ®) at 130 mg/m 2, 20 min after raltitrexed, on days 1, 17, 35.</description>

    <intervention_name>Radiotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Radiotherapy was applied as conformal 3-D technique and was delivered with photon energies of 10 - 15 MV. The beams were delivered by an Elekta Precise Linac equipped with standard multi leaf collimators (MLC). A daily online check of isocenter position was performed using portal imaging, with set-up correction in case of displacement &gt; 0.5 cm in any direction. Radiation dose delivered to PTV2 was 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) with a concomitant boost dose to the PTV1 of 10 Gy with accelerated fractionation at 2.2 Gy/fraction, five consecutive days for week.</description>
