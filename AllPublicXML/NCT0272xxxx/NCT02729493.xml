  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat the patients who have relapsed or
      refractory liver cancer with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been
      genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)that will bind to tumour
      cells that express the EPCAM protein on the cell surface.The study will determine if these
      modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells.The trial will also
      study the safety of treatment with CAR-T,how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body and
      the impact of this treatment on survival.

      This is a single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      CAR-T for Liver Cancer.The study will be conducted using a phaseⅠ /Ⅱ disign.The study will
      have the following sequential phases:Part A(screening leukapheresis,cell product
      preparation,and cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B(treatment and follow-up).The follow-up
      period for each paticipant is approximately 35 months after the final CAR-T infusion.The
      total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years.A total of 25 patients
      may be enrolled over a period of 3 years.
