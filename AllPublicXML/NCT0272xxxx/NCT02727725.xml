  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The purpose of this study is to show that the novel TRAMINER (T(Rho) and Magnetization
           Transfer and Inversion Recovery) sequence provides at least as good visualization and
           detection of sub-endocardial scarring, fibrosis, and acute infarction as the current
           gold standard Inversion Recovery (IR) Turbo-Flash sequence.

        -  The hypothesis is that the TRAMINER sequence has the same or higher sensitivity in
           detecting small sub-endocardial scarring than the inversion recovery segmented gradient
           echo sequence known as IR-Turbo Fast low angle shot (IR Turbo-Flash), which is the
           accepted current gold standard for the detection of myocardial viability.
