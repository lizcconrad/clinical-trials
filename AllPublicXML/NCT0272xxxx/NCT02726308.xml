      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the most common and distressing side effects
      following Laparoscopic cholecystectomy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the operating room, standard monitors included electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial
      blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were connected. All
      patients received standardized anesthetic technique. At the end of surgery, gastric contents
      were suctioned via an orogastric tube before extubation. Atropine and neostigmine (1/2.5 mg)
      was given slowly I.V. to antagonize the residual neuromuscular block. Then, the trachea was
      extubated. Then, patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit in a stable
      condition. Patients were allowed to drink liquids as soon as requested.

    <description>A nurse, who was unaware about the groups to which the patient belonged, evaluated patients at 0, 6, and 24 h after surgery for any symptoms of nausea, retching, or vomiting. PONV is classified as early, if occurring up to 6h after surgery, or late, if occurring between 6 h up to 24 postoperatively.
A Verbal Descriptive Scale (VDS), was used to assess the severity of PONV: no PONV (grade 0), mild PONV (grade 1), moderate PONV (grade 2) and severe PONV (grade 3)</description>
