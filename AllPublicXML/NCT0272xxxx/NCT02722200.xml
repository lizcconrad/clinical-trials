      The purpose of this study is to examine if glucocorticoids will change neural activation in
      regions of the corticolimbic-striatal system that regulate feeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis tested in this study will be to determine if that in response to food
      cues, glucocorticoids will change neural activation in regions of the corticolimbic-striatal
      system that regulate feeding. It is anticipate that these changes will correlate with hunger
      ratings and food intake. Further, this research will also examine if glucocorticoids will
      increase the basal metabolic rate and alter multiple systemic appetite-regulating hormones
      compared to saline. It is expected that these changes will correlate positively with hunger
      ratings and food intake as well.

    <measure>Change in Brain Response to Food Imagery</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Brain response to images of food either during hydrocortisone infusion or saline infusion will be measured through fMRI. Brain response is operationally defined as the change in functional MRI-measured blood oxygen levels in specific regions of the brain between the resting state and intervention state. The fMRI sequences last anywhere from 1-5 min. Total scan time will be approximately 90 minutes. The slices taken with each sequences equal 25-75.
The outcome is a comparison between the resting oxygen levels and oxygen levels during the interventions. BioImage Suite software is used to categorize if there is a significance between the two levels at a p &lt; 0.05.</description>

    <measure>Average Hunger Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Average hunger rating will be captured using the Visual Food Cue Task. This standardized method presents a series of images consisting of high calorie food, low calorie food, and non-food pictures presented randomly across four runs during the fMRI session. Each picture will be presented only once in a randomized order for each participant.
Participants will be instructed to rate their &quot;hunger&quot;, &quot;liking&quot; and &quot;wanting&quot; of the item on a 9-point Likert scale utilizing a 4-key button box. The hunger, wanting, and liking scales are all rated on a scale of 1-9, 1 being the least and 9 being the most. These scores are presented as an average across measurement points during the fMRI. Every time a food image is shown, the rater provides a rating of hunger, wanting and liking of it- people will be shown approximately 40-60 photos.</description>
