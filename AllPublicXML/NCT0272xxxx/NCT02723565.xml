      This study will evaluate the heart, lungs and diaphragm of patients who fail a trial of
      spontaneous breathing to determine the physiological mechanism of weaning failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transition to unassisted breathing after invasive ventilation often proves challenging,
      with over 40% of patients failing their first attempt of unassisted breathing. Persistent
      ventilator dependence predisposes patients to nosocomial complications and increases the
      economic burden of critical illness. Ventilator-dependence results from an imbalance between
      the load and capacity of the respiratory muscle pump. Patients who fail a trial of
      spontaneous breathing commonly exhibit excess respiratory loads secondary to weaning-induced
      pulmonary edema, atelectasis or dynamic hyperinflation. Many patients who are dependent on
      the ventilator also show a striking loss of pump capacity due to diaphragm dysfunction.
      Though each of these mechanisms respond to specific interventions, it is often difficult for
      physicians to discern which mechanisms are at play at the bedside. Bedside ultrasound is a
      potentially useful means of evaluating cardiac, pulmonary and diaphragm function during
      weaning failure. It is readily available, highly feasible and already widely employed in
      clinical practice. As yet, no study has evaluated the accuracy and feasibility of combining
      echocardiography with lung and diaphragm ultrasound to comprehensively evaluate the
      physiological mechanisms of weaning failure. The objectives of this study are to establish
      the utility of a rapid thoracic ultrasound exam to diagnose mechanisms of ventilation
      liberation failure and to assess the relationship between cardiothoracic variability during
      spontaneous breathing and different physiological mechanism of weaning failure.

    <description>Mechanisms responsible for weaning failure will be diagnosed by field experts using clinical data collected from the chart along with physiological measurements (respiratory mechanics, maximal inspiratory pressure, markers of pulmonary edema including changes in serum total protein and BNP and central venous pressure). The diagnosis derived from a pre-specified ultrasound-based classification system will be compared to the gold standard expert-derived diagnosis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients over 18 years of age receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for at least
             24 hours

          -  patients who fulfill standard criteria for readiness for a trial of spontaneous
             breathing (no or minimal sedation, patient awake and interactive; minimal
             vasopressor/inotrope requirements (Norepinephrine &lt; or = 0.1, Dopamine &lt; 10,
             Vasopressin/Epinephrine off); fraction of inspired oxygen &lt; or = 50%; spontaneous
             inspiratory efforts as indicated by patient-triggered breaths; positive end-expiratory
             pressure &lt; or = 10 cm H20)

          -  patients who fail a trial of spontaneous breathing (transient reduction of ventilator
             support for any duration up to 2 hours as per local ICU practice - typically PS 5 with
             PEEP 5 OR CPAP 5 OR T-piece)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with a coagulopathy (INR &gt; 2.5, platelet count &lt; 30x10^6/L) or previously
             diagnosed bleeding diathesis or are receiving anticoagulant drugs at therapeutic doses
             (ie. excluding venous thromboembolic prophylaxis)

          -  patients with a contraindication to nasogastric tube insertion (esophageal varices,
             upper GI tract surgery, facial trauma, etc.)

          -  patients receiving extra-corporeal life support
