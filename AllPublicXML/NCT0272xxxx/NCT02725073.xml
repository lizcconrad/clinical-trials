      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a way of producing tissue necrosis with light after prior
      administration of a photosensitizing agent. The most important advantages include the
      possibility of combining PDT with other target therapies and repeat the process as needed
      with a favorable outcomes. The combination of diverse therapeutic modalities is one of the
      new strategies to enhance oncologic treatments for pancreatic cancer. In order to overcome
      the limitations of each treatment modalities and to prevent the development of resistance,
      the application of PDT combined with target therapies, without increasing the toxicity for
      the patient, is being widely investigated.

      PDT has been only extensively studied for the treatment of various superficial skin cancers
      in the Europe but not available in the United States and Japan due to the overlapping
      treatment fields. In Korea, the use of first-generation and second-generation
      photosensitizers are part of the study of Gastroenterology, Dermatology, Otolaryngology, and
      Gynecology.

      Recently, although the investigators have introduced PDT using novel photosensitizers has not
      yet been used for the treatment of pancreatic cancers. This study aim to determine the safety
      and efficacy of photodynamic therapy with a novel photosensitizer in locally advanced hilar
      cholangiocarcinoma.

    <description>Photolon (Belmedpreparaty, Minsk, Republic of Belarus), was administered intravenously at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg at 3 hours before illumination. After advancing a catheter (7 F inner sheath of a plastic stent delivery catheter [MAJ-1419; Olympus America, Center Valley, Pa., USA]) across the biliary stricture using a 0.035-in guidewire, the cylindrical diffuser is inserted into a catheter at the level of the stricture to be treated. Photoactivation (660 nm with a light dose of 100-150J/cm2, and fluence of 0.8-1W/cm2; UPL- FDT; LEMT Research &amp; Development Private Unitary Enterprise, Minsk, Republic of Belarus) is performed</description>
