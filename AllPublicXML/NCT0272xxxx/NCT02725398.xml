  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal cancer has developed into a serious health problem in China. 80%-90%
      patients were detected at middle and later stage. The five-year survival rate for advanced
      cancer patients is less than 10%. The main reason of the bad clinical diagnosis and treatment
      is that the present technical method is difficult to achieve early diagnosis. Endoscopy with
      biopsy is still the main method for confirming gastrointestinal cancer. But it is limited to
      identify early tumors and it leads to the low diagnostic rate of early tumors and the poor
      overall therapeutic effect.

      Confocal laser endoscopy (CLE) can obtain pathologic information of lesion in real time and
      improve the diagnostic rate of early tumors. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy(pCLE)
      is a new technology recently. Since its laser probe is applicable to all conventional
      endoscopes, pCLE greatly increased its clinical application. However, gastrointestinal
      motility has greatly influence on pCLE imaging quality and inspection effect owing to the
      poor stability of the small probe manipulation. Scopolamine (654-2, in China) is clinically
      used to inhibit bowel peristalsis, but its effect is still not ideal and its side effects are
      common.

      Buscopan can more effectively relieve gastrointestinal spasm, and its side effects is fewer.
      It has been reported that Buscopan can more effectively relieve gastrointestinal spasm,
      facilitate scope insertion and improve patients' comfort during endoscopy.Buscopan may make
      the endoscopic physicians to observe easily and effectively improve the diagnostic rate.
      Buscopan may effectively inhibit duodenum motility and facilitate the ERCP operation.It has
      not been reported in the literature whether Buscopan can be used on pCLE examination to
      improve imaging quality and the detection accuracy of the lesion.

      Hence, the investigators plan to develop a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      study, the effect of Buscopan on gastrointestinal imaging quality and diagnosis accuracy with
      probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, in order to confirm the practical application
      value of Buscopan in pCLE examination.

      Patient selection, grouping, and operating process:

      Subjects were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criterion from the volunteers
      eligible for this trial who are inpatient or outpatient applying for pCLE examination in the
      endoscopy center of Xijing Digestive Disease Hospital. Patients were divided into three
      groups: Buscopan (BSP), Scopolamine (654-2) and physiological saline (NS) control group,
      according to the ratio of 1:1:1. Operators were blind to random grouping,and patients were
      unclear to accept Buscopan, 654-2 or NS drugs before operation. All endoscopy operation
      should be completed by clinical experienced endoscopists (WKC or LSH) by using gastroscopy、
      colonoscopy and enteroscopy, respectively GIF-H260、CF-H260、SIF-260 (Olympus Medical Systems,
      Tokyo, Japan).

      Operating process: Preoperative preparation are basically the same to conventional
      endoscopy.Patients ingested mucosal surface anesthesia and defoaming agent 30 minutes before
      endoscopy,and accepted the fluorescein sodium allergy test intravenously (2%, 1 ml) 20
      minutes before endoscopy, established venous pathway. Negative patients could accept pCLE
      examination. First to use standard white light to observe, to record spasm score,to observe
      the lesion. It is administered by endoscopic nurse which is respectively Buscopan (BSP,
      20mg), Scopolamine (654-2,10mg), physiological saline (NS), recorded blindly. Then to inject
      10% fluorescein sodium 5ml (Guangzhou Baiyun Shan Ming Xing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.)
      intravenously,to start button to scan by pCLE. To scan in the order of the back of
      endoscopy,to indicate each observation position by pCLE, to do targeted biopsy by pCLE if met
      lesion. During the examination,spasm scores (2 minutes,20 minutes after administering drug)
      and operation time were recorded. Visual analogue scale (visual field stability and patient
      comfort) level was given after the examination. To record whether related complications
      happen and positively process. To evaluate the quality of each imaging according to Kiesslich
      pCLE image quality analysis method and diagnostic accuracy combining with the pathologic
      diagnosis(through the target biopsy, pathological examination, comparative calculation).
