    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are testing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      in breast cancer survivors. In this pilot study, the investigators want to learn if it is
      feasible to use this device in memory rehabilitation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy between 40 and 65 years of age with

             participation with or without current endocrine therapy.

          -  Self-reported new onset since initiation of treatment cognitive dysfunction as

               1. Do you think or feel that your memory or mental ability has gotten worse since
                  you completed your breast cancer treatment?

               2. Do you think that your mind isn't as sharp now as it was before your breast
                  cancer treatments?

               3. Do you feel like these problems have made it harder to function on your job or
                  take care of things around the home?

             including seizure disorder, a dementing condition, or other neurological illness
             (multiple sclerosis, history of cerebrovascular accident, etc.)

          -  Participants with untreated depression or anxiety as assessed by self-report and
             review of medical history;
