      The current Rethinking Clinical Trials (REaCT) trial will compare two schedules(12- vs.
      4-weekly) of bone-targeting agents (BTAs) to evaluate quality of life, pain and skeletal
      events within the Canadian Health Care System. This study will use an &quot;integrated consent
      model&quot; that involves &quot;oral consent&quot; rather than a written informed consent writing process as
      the study is comparing standard schedules and not a new administration schedule.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone metastases are common in patients with advanced breast and prostate cancers. Skeletal
      metastases can be associated with reduced Quality of Life (QoL), pain and skeletal-related
      events (SREs) (defined as pathological fractures, surgery/radiotherapy to bone, spinal cord
      compression and hypercalcaemia). Maintaining QoL while avoiding or delaying SREs are the main
      goals of therapy. Patients therefore receive bone-targeted agents (e.g. pamidronate,
      zoledronate and denosumab) which are typically given every 4 weeks. However, this 4 week
      dosing is based on convenience so the treatment could be given concurrently with
      chemotherapy. The half-life of these drugs in the bone is many months or even years. Hence
      studies have been performed evaluating 12-weekly therapy. These have confirmed similar
      palliative outcomes in the 4 vs 12-weekly groups for both breast and prostate cancer
      patients. However, there remains clinical equipoise about which dosing interval physicians
      prescribe. The current trial will compare these two schedules of bone-targeting agents (12-
      vs. 4-weekly) to evaluate quality of life, pain and skeletal events within the Canadian
      Health Care System. This study will use an &quot;integrated consent model&quot; that involves &quot;oral
      consent&quot; rather than a written informed consent writing process as the study is comparing
      standard schedules and not a new administration schedule.

    <description>We will perform a cost utility analysis alongside this pragmatic randomized controlled trial. The cost effectiveness of 4-week compared to 12-week BTA will be assessed in terms of the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the perspective of health care system. Resource use and health utility will be measured from the trial at the follow up interviews. Health utility values would be estimated from the study questionnaires.</description>
