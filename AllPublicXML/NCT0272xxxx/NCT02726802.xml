  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the self-report functional outcome measures, medical readiness and
      healthcare utilization (overall cost of imaging, prescription medications for pain, and
      follow-up visits) of soldiers with musculoskeletal injuries first seen by a physical
      therapist versus primary care provider.

    <measure>Self-Report Medical Readiness Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of 6 questions that ask the patient to rate their ability to perform various soldier/deployment-related tasks. This will provide way of measuring the soldier's perceived status of medical readiness before and after episodes of medical care.</description>

    <measure>Medical Profile Status</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The medical profile is the Army's assessment of a soldier's overall medical readiness, i.e.: deployability. A profile for musculoskeletal injury can be temporary (T) or permanent (P) and deployable (2) or non-deployable (3). The profile is used to limit the soldier's activities to accommodate their injury or complaint. Evaluating the medical profile status in this study will serve as a way to measure the subjects' medical readiness.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults over age 18

          -  Musculoskeletal injury or complaint &lt; 3 months since onset

          -  Active duty service member, reachable by phone/e-mail within 3 months of initial
             encounter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject currently has a permanent profile for any reason OR subject has a temporary
             profile for a body part in the same half of the body as the current complaint OR
             solider is pending physical examination board (PEB) or undergoing/pending medical
             examination board (MEB)

          -  Individuals undergoing PEB/MEB are made aware that the end-state of the process
             includes a certain percentage of government monetary compensation based on their
             physical or mental disability, i.e, higher disability equates to greater pay. Because
             of this, individuals may be motivated to demonstrate worse outcomes as it may result
             in a higher disability &quot;rating&quot;. For this reason, these individuals will be excluded
             from the study.

          -  Subject has been treated previously for the same condition within the past 3 months

          -  Subject has history of surgery for the same body part within the past 24 months
