    <textblock>
      The IBSEN III study will investigate the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in South
      Eastern Norway and describe the clinical course of the disease. The investigators will map
      newly diagnosed and treatment naive IBD patients at various levels (epidemiological,
      clinical, psychosocial and nutritional as well as immunological, genetic, epigenetic and
      microbial) as a basis to improve targeted and individualized treatment and care. The
      investigators will include incident IBD patients at all local- and university hospitals in
      the South Eastern Health Region in 2016-2018 and follow-up prospectively for five years. The
      investigators will use standardized and validated registration methods allowing comparability
      with previous national and international IBD cohorts, link data to national health registries
      and collect blood, feces and biopsies for bio banking.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Ulcerative colitis:

        Diagnostic criteria (at least three out of four criteria present):

          1. A history of diarrhea and/or pus in stools for more than 4weeks or repeated episodes.

          2. Macroscopic appearance at endoscopy of continuous mucosal inflammation affecting the
             rectum in continuity with some or the entire colon.

          3. Microscopic features on biopsy compatible with UC,

          4. No suspicion of CD on small bowel X-ray, ileocolonoscopy or biopsy.

        Crohn's disease:

        Diagnostic criteria (at least two of four criteria present):

          1. History of abdominal pain, weight loss and/or diarrhea for more than three months.

          2. Characteristic endoscopic findings of ulceration (aphthous lesions, snail track
             ulceration) or cobble stoning or radiological features of stricture or cobble stoning.

          3. Histopathology consistent with Crohn's disease (epitheloid granuloma of Langerhans
             type or transmural discontinuous focal or patchy inflammation).

          4. Fistula and/or abscess in relation to affected bowel segments.

        Inflammatory bowel disease, type unclassified (IBDU) :

        Patients with evidence on clinical and endoscopic grounds for chronic inflammatory bowel
        disease affecting the colon, without small bowel involvement, and no definitive
        histological or other evidence to favor either CD or UC.

        Pediatric patients:

        Will be diagnosed according to the Porto-criteria and defined as:

        Pediatric onset IBD ≤ 16 years Early Onset IBD (EOIBD) &lt; 10 years Very Early Onset IBD
        (VEOIBD) &lt; 6 years Infantile (and toddler) IBD &lt; 2 years Neonatal IBD &lt; 28 days

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Other causes of acute or chronic bowel inflammation must be excluded, i.e. infectious
             colitis, radiation colitis, diversion colitis, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, graft
             versus host disease, diverticular colitis, medication associated colitis, ischemic
             colitis, microscopic colitis, enema associated colitis.
