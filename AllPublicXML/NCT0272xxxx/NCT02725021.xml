    <textblock>
      A two armed randomized trial is evaluating the effect of the medical-student-delivered
      school-based intervention Education Against Tobacco on the smoking behavior of adolescents in
      7-11th grade of secondary school. The primary endpoint is the change in smoking prevalence
      between the two groups.
