    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label,non randomized, multi-center, phase 1/2b (dose escalation
      followed by expansion part) study evaluating clinical safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics
      of PQR309 in combination with standard dose of eribulin in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic HER2-negative (escalation part) and Triple Negative Breast Cancer (expansion
      part).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The primary objective of the escalation part is to assess the maximum tolerated dose
           (MTD) of PQR309 combined with the standard eribulin dose in patients with HER2 negative
           breast cancer following a &quot;modified&quot; 3 by 3 design.

        -  For the expansion part the objective is to evaluate efficacy of PQR309 in combination
           with eribulin in patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer

        -  Once the MTD of continuous daily PQR309 dosing has been established, intermittent
           schedules of PQR309 (&quot;2 days on/ 5 days off&quot; or &quot;Monday / Thursday&quot;) will be evaluated.
