      Microcirculation is very crucial to evaluate the organ function those working properly in
      human body. The aim of the present study is to assess the effects of brachial plexus block on
      microcirculation using pefusion index and capillary filling time. A total of 50 patients
      whose planned to underwent surgery are performed brachial plexus block using ultrasound, and
      pefusion index, heart rate, blood pressure, capillary filling time are measured at 0, 10th
      and 20th minutes interval and at postoperative 24th hours. All measures will be recorded.
