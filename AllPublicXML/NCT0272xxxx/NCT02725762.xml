    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if photobiomodulation is an effective
      treatment of Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and vision loss associated with the
      disease.

      The LumiThera LT 300® Light Delivery System is a stationary desktop instrument used to emit
      energy in the visible and near infrared spectrum. The LT-300® is designed for the
      ophthalmologist to use in the treatment of the eye with photobiomodulation (PBM), a process
      by which cellular mechanisms are induced by light. PBM is being utilized in many indications,
      such as wound healing, soft tissue injuries, joint pain, myofascial pain, nerve injuries,
      muscle fatigue for temporary improvement in blood flow and reduction in inflammation. The
      mechanism of PBM at the cellular level has been ascribed to the activation of mitochondrial
      respiratory chain components resulting in stabilization of metabolic function and initiation
      of a signaling cascade, which promotes cellular proliferation and cytoprotection. The LT-300®
      will provide a preset treatment of PBM to the subject's eye and retinal tissue through the
      open and closed eyelid.

      Approximately 30 subjects meeting the eligibility requirements of the study will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard of care treatment for Dry AMD plus PBM treatment
      with the LT-300 system, or standard of care treatment for Dry AMD plus Sham treatment with
      the LT-300 system. Subjects randomized to each group will receive two 3-week treatment
      sessions (9 treatments per session) and follow-up visits extending to one year. The primary
      objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PBM with respect to visual
      and anatomical outcomes of subjects with Dry AMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of both gender

          -  Patients must have dry macular degeneration in the study eye

          -  Best corrected visual acuity between 20/40 and 20/200

          -  Patients must be competent to sign and have signed a consent form before study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Visually significant cataracts.

          -  Presence of a visually significant posterior capsule if prior cataract surgery has
             been performed.

          -  Any visually significant disease process in any ocular structure that would affect
             vision unrelated to macular degeneration.

          -  A patient can be enrolled if only one of their eyes meets the criteria. The other eye
             may be treated but not included in the study; for example advanced geographic atrophy.

          -  Patients with severe clinically significant disease or unstable medical disorders
             including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurological, endocrine, gastrointestinal,
             CNS or life threatening disease or current malignancy at the discretion of the
             investigators

          -  Patients who are non-ambulatory or bed ridden

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or of childbearing potential as effects of PBM on the
             developing human fetus are unknown.

          -  Patients with a history of Epilepsy
