  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect and store samples and health information for current
      and future research to learn more about the causes and treatment of blood diseases. This is
      not a therapeutic or diagnostic protocol for clinical purposes. Blood and bone marrow as well
      as health information will be used to study and learn about blood diseases by using genetic
      and/or genomic research. In general, genetic research studies specific genes of an
      individual; genomic research studies the complete genetic makeup of an individual.

      It is not known why many people have blood diseases, because not all genes causing these
      diseases have been found. It is also not known why some people with the same disease are
      sicker than others, but this may be related to their genes. By studying the genomes in
      individuals with blood diseases and their family members, the investigators hope to learn
      more about how diseases develop and respond to treatment which may provide new and better
      ways to diagnose and treat blood diseases.

      Primary Objective:

        -  Establish a repository of DNA and cryopreserved blood cells with linked clinical
           information from individuals with non-malignant blood diseases and biologically-related
           family members in order to conduct genomic and functional studies as outlined in the
           secondary objectives.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Utilizing the biorepository, investigators aim to:

        -  Identify novel mutations that associate with disease status in individuals with
           unexplained non-malignant blood diseases.

        -  Identify modifier genes in individuals with defined monogenic non-malignant blood
           diseases.

        -  Identify genetic variants associated with treatment outcomes and toxicities for
           individuals with non-malignant blood disease.

        -  Use transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to investigate biomarkers for sickle
           cell disease (SCD) progression, paint events and the long-term cellular and molecular
           effects of hydroxyurea therapy.

      Participants will be individuals (proband) receiving therapy or expert consultation regarding
      a non-malignant hematologic disorder. We propose to use genomics, trancriptomics, proteomics
      and metabolomic analysis coupled with family linkage studies to identify causal mutations in
      individuals with undefined hematologic disorders and to characterize genetic modifiers of
      defined monogenic blood diseases.

      A detailed medical history will be obtained, including demographic information for each
      proband. For each identified biologically-related family member, a medical history
      questionnaire will be obtained. The family history and pedigree will be reviewed in
      conjunction with a geneticist/genetic counselor. The implications of genetic testing will be
      explained. If participants consent for future contact, this will take place annually for
      updates on medical and family history.

      All probands will provide peripheral blood samples, and probands who are undergoing a bone
      marrow aspirate/biopsy for clinical purposes will provide additional aspirates. Biological
      family members will provide peripheral blood samples as a source for DNA.

    <description>Germ-line DNA samples from study participants will be extracted and analyzed in order to identify inherited genetic aberrations associated with hematologic disorders. Specific modalities of genomic testing will be case specific. Relevant tests may involve SNP arrays to assess copy number variation, WGS, WES, targeted sequencing of specific candidate genes, RNA-sequencing, X-chromosome inactivation studies, ChIP sequencing and/or other tests. Genetic linkage analyses may be performed using a variety of technologies including high-density SNP arrays, WGS and specific analysis of selected target genes in validation studies.</description>
