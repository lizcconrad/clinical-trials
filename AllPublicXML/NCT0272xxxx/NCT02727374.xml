  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fear to fall has been proven to be a risk factor affecting those geriatric patients who have
      previously suffered a fall. In this work it is assessed the effectiveness of a physiotherapy
      and psychological combined intervention, aimed at reducing the fear to fall in the
      aforementioned patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the main consequences of falling is the fear to fall again. This involves changes in
      the elderly behaviour which leads to a reduction of the physical activity, higher need of
      cares, reduction of the quality of life and risk of social isolation. In this framework, this
      works is aimed at performing a treatment to reduce the fear to fall in those geriatrics
      patients with previous falls, based on the combination of physical activity, health education
      and cognitive-behavioural psychological treatment targeted to this effect. The reason is that
      literature points at combined treatment use to present higher effectiveness
