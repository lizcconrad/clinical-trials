  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Commercial one and two-stage factor VIII assays may not detect some clinically significant
      inhibitor antibodies. The purpose of the proposed study is to standardize and validate a
      platelet-based factor VIII activity assay with greater sensitivity to clinically important
      inhibitory antibodies. Investigators will evaluate the platelet-dependent inhibitory activity
      vs. conventional inhibitory activity in stored patient plasmas and correlate to bleeding
      histories

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Factor VIII activity assays are used to diagnose hemophilia A, to monitor treatment of these
      patients, to determine when inhibitory antibodies against factor VIII have developed, and to
      evaluate the activity of engineered pharmaceutical factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity
      has been measured with one and two-stage assays for more than fifty years. However, all
      existing assays have major shortcomings that are recognized by the FDA, the International
      Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis, and pharmaceutical companies. The major deficiencies
      that have been identified are: 1) Factor VIII activity levels do not predict the risk of
      bleeding in patients with inhibitory antibodies. The degree of inhibition in these assays is
      less than required to explain patient bleeding. 2) The assays are only accurate over a range
      of 1 - 100% of normal factor VIII activity, while values of 0.1 - 1% are also clinically
      important. 3) The different approved assays give discrepant values for recombinant
      pharmaceutical factor VIII products, with a range of 2-fold difference between assays. This
      can lead to clinically important differences in dosing of factor VIII products from one
      region to another with corresponding risk of thrombosis or bleeding.

      The preliminary data identify an additional deficiency of commercial assays that has not been
      anticipated. Commercial one and two-stage assays may not detect some clinically significant
      inhibitor antibodies. Thus, the purpose of the proposed studies is to standardize and
      validate a platelet-based factor VIII activity assay with greater sensitivity to clinically
      important inhibitory antibodies.
