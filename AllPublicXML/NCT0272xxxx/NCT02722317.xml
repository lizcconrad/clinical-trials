      The intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of violence. Although man is
      the main author of violence, it is essential include actions to help him in order to produce
      a more effective result, because it is believed that he is able to recognize and take
      responsibility for the violence, using different forms of express. However, these actions
      have difficulties in evaluating its results. These research aims to analyze the relapse of
      violence after participation in a batterer intervention program. The investigators realized a
      case study in a batterer intervention program in the city of Brasília, capital of Brazil, 167
      men were invited and 86 accepted to participate of the research. It was used the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention - Follow up questionnaire, adapted to be used in Brazil. All
      the participants answered the same questionnaire, and the participant exclusion criteria was
      less or more than 3 months of participation at the program or committed other types of
      violence. The participants were recruited and interviewed by the investigators, during the
      year of 2015 (from March until December), in the Center for Assistance to Family and
      perpetrators of Domestic Violence (NAFAVD). The participants answered questions about
      socioeconomic characteristics, the relapse of violence, use of drugs, and about the batterer
      program. The benefit of participate of the study is help to improve the programs to prevent
      intimate partner violence, and public policy about this issue, and the risk is to remember
      something that happened during the interview, so the participants could stop the participate
      when they want.
