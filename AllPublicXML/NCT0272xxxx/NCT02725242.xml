    <measure>Change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) that is 6 items of self-administered and 1 item of FEV1%. It has 7-point scale (=no impairment, 6= maximum impairment for symptoms and rescue use; and 7 categories for FEV1%). Scores range between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Asthma Controlled Test (ACT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>1. Asthma Controlled Test (ACT); grouped in five domains; frequency of shortness of breath, general asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, and overall self-assessment of asthma control. 5-point scale (for symptoms and activities: 1=all the time to 5= not at all; for asthma control rating: 1=not controlled at all to 5=completely controlled). The scores range from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control. An ACT score &gt;19 indicates well-controlled asthma</description>
