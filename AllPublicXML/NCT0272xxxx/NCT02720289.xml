    <textblock>
      This study compares a video-based social learning method to the traditional didactic method
      as a new way to teach caregivers about child passenger safety, including how to install a car
      seat. Half of the caregivers will attend the video-based social learning class, while the
      other half will attend the traditional didactic class. The investigators hypothesize that the
      video-based social learning method will lead to an equal or greater increase in caregiver
      child passenger safety proficiency when compared to the traditional didactic method.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of child passenger safety education,
      however, there is limited research identifying an optimal teaching method.

      Social learning teaching methods are beneficial in promoting health-behavior change. The
      social learning theory hypothesizes that people learn and change their behavior by
      observation and modeling. The video used in the social learning method shows parents as role
      models methodically teaching proper car seat installation in a vehicle.

      Traditionally, child passenger safety education classes are didactic in design, relying on
      lecture formats and live demonstrations. The didactic method includes verbal instructions
      from a child passenger safety technician about car seat installation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>5-Item Car Seat Installation Demonstration Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will install a car seat in their vehicle prior to, and immediately following, the intervention. A child passenger safety technician observing the installation and blinded to the intervention, will use this measure to evaluate the 5 areas of installation: direction, location, mechanism (seatbelt or lower anchors), harness position, and tether use. Participants will only be evaluated on installation demonstration areas relevant to their vehicle and car seat. Each item is scored correct or incorrect. Correct car seat installation is defined as all applicable items marked correct.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>5-Item Confidence in Car Seat Installation Ability Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported confidence in ability to correctly install a car seat with one question each for the 5 areas of installation: direction, location, mechanism (seatbelt or lower anchors), harness position, and tether use. Administered prior to, and immediately following, the intervention. The five question 10-point Likert scale assessment is scored 1-10 (1 = not confident; 10 = very confident). Confidence is defined as a 9 or 10 on the Likert scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>15-Question Car Seat Installation Knowledge Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported objective knowledge test with questions about the four steps for child passenger safety (rear facing seat, forward facing seat, booster seat, and seat belt/shoulder harness) and the LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) system. The test contains true/false, multiple-choice, and fill in the blank questions. Each question is worth 1 point for a total of 15 points. Adequate car seat knowledge is defined as 10 or more questions correct.</description>
