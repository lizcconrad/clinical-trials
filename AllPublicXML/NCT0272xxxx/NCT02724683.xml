  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether drainage with the usage of a fine,
      patient-controlled vascular catheter inserted into abdominal cavity is a feasible, safe and
      effective method in the management of symptomatic malignant ascites. Complications' rate of
      the procedure and patients' quality of life, nutritional status and experience on the
      treatment are main endpoints.

      Patients with symptomatic, refractory malignant ascites (MA) will be eligible for the study.
      In case a cancer treatment is not effective against ascites, or no target, systemic treatment
      is possible patients will be eligible for percutaneous placement of a vascular catheter into
      abdominal cavity followed be drainage performed in a regular basis when required, at home or
      ambulatory. Adult patients with every malignant disease, female and male, and coexisting
      symptomatic MA can be recruited.

      Clinical, quality of life (QOL) and quality of the procedure data will be collected. The
      study is planned to be a multiinstitutional. A template is provided to collect essential
      clinical data concerned with a patient, malignant disease, procedure performance and
      complications. QOL and patients' experience on the treatment is to be evaluated with formal
      questionnaires - EORTC C15-PAL and FACIT-TS-G - permission to use granted from EORTC and
      FACIT respectively. Additionally, a nutrition monitoring will be performed (if possible and
      feasible) in patients with MA and drainage.

      Data will be saved in a computer, secured data base for calculations. A cohort of 150
      patients is planned to be collected. Duration of the study will depend on how many
      institutions will participate, and how fast patients will be recruited.
