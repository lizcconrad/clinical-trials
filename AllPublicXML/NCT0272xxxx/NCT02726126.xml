  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seventy five patients, aged 18-50 years, ASA I and II undergoing elective single level lumber
      laminectomy under general anesthesia were included in this randomized controlled double-blind
      study. Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups 25 each, C group patients received
      transdermal placebo patch, TDF group (50μg/h) and TDM group (7 mg). Assessment of
      postoperative pain, sedation, hemodynamic variables such as HR and MAP, postoperative
      monitoring of arterial SpO2 and side effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting, pruritis, respiratory
      depression and hemodynamic instability) were done 30 minutes, 1, 2, 6 and 12 hours
      postoperatively. Postoperative Patient`s and Surgeons` satisfaction, Intraoperative bleeding
      and plasma cortisol (µg / dl) postoperatively were also assessed.

        This study was designed to be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel study
        in which the patients, investigators, anesthesiologists and the surgeons were blinded to
        the given treatment. This study was conducted in Ain-Shams university hospitals, from March
        2013 to April 2015 on 75 patients aged between 18 and 50 years old of both sex of ASA
        physical status I and II of 70-90 kg body weight and height 160-180 cm undergoing elective
        single level lumber laminectomy under general anesthesia. The study protocol was approved
        from the institutional ethical committee and written informed consent was obtained from all
        the patients.
