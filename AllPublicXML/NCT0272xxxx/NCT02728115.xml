  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellavita HD is a stem-cell therapy for Huntington's Disease. This is a first-in-human, dose
      escalation study in which participants with Huntington's Disease will receive 3 intravenous
      injections and will be followed for 5 years to evaluate safety and preliminary evidence of
      effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, dose escalation, non-randomized phase I study in which participants
      with HD will receive three intravenous injections of one of two doses of the investigational
      product, one every month for three months. Safety evaluation data will include report of all
      adverse events (including type, frequency, intensity, seriousness, severity, and action taken
      related to the investigational product study), changes in vital signs, physical examination
      and medical evaluations, changes in laboratory or serology tests and electrocardiogram (ECG),
      and incidence and classification of benign and malignant neoplasms. Preliminary evidence of
      efficacy will be evaluated by clinical improvement of motor, cognitive and behavioral
      degradation through Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and inflammatory
      markers: IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 (interleukin IL) e TNF-alpha (tumoral necrosis factor
      alpha); CNS improvement will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The
      immunological response of HD product over the administration period will be evaluated by CD4+
      and CD8+ proliferation and inflammatory markers release. Additionaly, the prognosis of the
      disease throughout the study will be verify through the measurement of levels of
      Neurofilament protein (NF-L) in peripheral blood.
