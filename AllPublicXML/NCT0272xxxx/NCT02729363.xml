  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to improve the self-management of pain and stress in adult outpatients with
      sickle cell disease (SCD) by determining the feasibility of a self-managed guided relaxation
      (GR) stress reduction intervention using a tablet-based mobile device. Currently, opioid
      analgesics are primarily used to treat SCD pain while self-managed behavioral modalities such
      as GR, are rarely used. Little is known about the effects or mechanisms of GR on pain and
      stress, in adults with SCD. Emerging evidence from the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)
      axis theory offer insights for understanding the mechanisms. Adding GR as a supplement to
      analgesic therapies will address the paucity of self-management strategies for controlling
      pain in SCD. GR is a simple and cost-effective non-drug intervention that could reduce pain
      and stress in outpatients with SCD. GR is an intervention where outpatients with SCD are
      directed to listen to and view audio-visual recordings while they visualize themselves being
      immersed in that scene.

      The investigator will recruit adult outpatients with sickle cell disease (SCD) from the
      University of Florida Health Hematology Clinics and conduct study visits in a research room
      located at the College of nursing.

      The investigator will stratify participants on worst pain intensity (&lt;=5 and &gt;5) and randomly
      assign 15 adults to attention control (stress/pain tracking; 12-min SCD experience
      discussion) and 15 adults to experimental (stress/pain tracking; 12-min GR video clip)
      groups.

      The immediate intervention effects will be examined for pain (primary) and stress (secondary)
      outcomes. Vital signs for determining relaxation responses (mediators) will be collected
      immediately before and after the 12-min interventions.

    <description>Physiological markers of relaxation (pulse, respiration, finger temperature) will be measured using a standard vital sign measuring device. We will estimate intervention effects using regression analysis. We expect to observe trends for the immediate GR effect in terms of decreases in relaxation indicators (respiration rate, heart rate) and increases in skin temperature.</description>

    <description>Attention Control Group: This intervention is a 12-minute sickle cell disease experience discussion. In this computer-based discussion, patients talk about their sickle cell disease experience. The audio-taped questions and onscreen directions were programmed for self-administration. Subjects' responses will be captured via the microphone so that Data Collectors are not involved in this discussion process, and it is equivalent to the guided relaxation activity.</description>
