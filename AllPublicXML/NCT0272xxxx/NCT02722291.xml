  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at presbyopic patients that do not require magnifying glass at close
      rage. The purpose of this study is to investigate the functional and physiological changes in
      eye induced by pinhole glass.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distant visual acuity (logMAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects performed this examination while wearing multiple pinhole and without wearing pinhole with one week apart in random order after baseline study</time_frame>
    <description>Distant visual acuity were measured using Snellen chart (Precision Vision, La Salle, IL, USA) at 4 m.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>BUT</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects performed this examination while wearing multiple pinhole and without wearing pinhole with one week apart in random order after baseline study</time_frame>
    <description>fluorescein is instilled into the subject's tear film and the subject is asked not to blink while the tear film is observed under a broad beam of cobalt blue illumination</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Near point of accommodation (NPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects performed this examination while wearing multiple pinhole and without wearing pinhole with one week apart in random order after baseline study</time_frame>
    <description>Near point of accommodation (NPA) was measured using Donder's push-up method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The fusional convergence</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects performed this examination while wearing multiple pinhole and without wearing pinhole with one week apart in random order after baseline study</time_frame>
    <description>With the subject watching the 20/30 sized fixation target at 40 cm, we take the base-out bar prism on the subject's right eye. While gradually increasing the extent of the prism, the first point that the subject noticed diplopia was defined as the break point.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stereopsis</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects performed this examination while wearing multiple pinhole and without wearing pinhole with one week apart in random order after baseline study</time_frame>
    <description>Stereopsis was checked with the Randot Stereotest (Stereo Optical Co., Chicago, IL, USA).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reading speed (letters per second)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects performed this examination while wearing multiple pinhole and without wearing pinhole with one week apart in random order after baseline study</time_frame>
    <description>Reading speed was evaluated using the famous Korean traditional fairy tale book. This Korean book was printed black-and-white with 10-font size.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Photopic pupil size (baseline, mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects performed this examination while wearing multiple pinhole and without wearing pinhole with one week apart in random order after baseline study</time_frame>
    <description>Pupil size under photopic conditions (85 cd/m2) was measured using a WASCA Analyzer (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
