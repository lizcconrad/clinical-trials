  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a result of chronic inflammation compounded by an inability to clear mucoid
      secretions. Inflammation results in progressive destruction of the normal lung architecture,
      in particular the elastic fibers of bronchi. Currently there is no effective drug for
      bronchiectasis. This study intends to carry out an open, single-center, non-randomized, self
      control phase I/II clinical trial. During the treatment, bronchial basal cells (BCCs) will be
      isolated from patients' own bronchi by bronchoscopic brushing and expanded in vitro. Cultured
      cells will be injected directly into the lesion by fiberoptic bronchoscopy after lavage.
      After six-month observation, the investigators will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the treatment by measuring the key indicator-- the CT imaging of dilated bronchi as well as
      four secondary indicators including the pulmonary function, laboratory factor level,
      incidence of acute exacerbation and the patients' self-evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a term for irreversible lung damage resulting from recurrent episodes of
      infection and inflammation. Bronchial basal cells (BCCs) have been proven with stem cell
      activity to regenerate bronchi and repair lung damage. In this single-center, non-randomized,
      self control phase I/II clinical trial, patients' own BCCs will be grown in laboratory before
      injected to the damaged part of lung tissue. Transplanted BCCs have the potential to
      replenish the bronchial epithelium and reconstruct respiratory architecture.
