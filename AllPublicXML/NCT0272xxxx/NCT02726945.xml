  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal study. The study will examine the safety and efficacy of autologous
      adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells processed with the GID SVF-2 device for
      pain, function and stiffness in the knees of osteoarthritic subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is the main form of arthritis and affects over 20 million people in the United
      States. In the knee it can cause severe pain, reduced functionality and increased stiffness
      thus, a treatment that would reduce pain, increase function and reduce stiffness would be of
      benefit to many people.

      This study will collect and disassociate adipose tissue and inject the stromal vascular
      fraction into the knee of the same patient. The study is controlled, randomized and
      double-blinded with 2 SVF treatments (high and low dose) and a placebo control.
