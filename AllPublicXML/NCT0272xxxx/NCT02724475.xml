  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most-common cancer worldwide and the second
      most-common cause of cancer mortality. Liver resection is the first-line curative treatment
      for huge HCC. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates after hepatic resection were range from
      25% to 45% and the incidence of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) for intermediate and
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients were as high as 60%-90%. At present, there is no
      effective treatment for patients with PVTT. Laser ablation (LA) showed a good performance in
      eliminating the PVTT and the three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) with γ Ray
      (γ-knife) can also be used to treat patients with PVTT. But there still lack of
      evidence-based research to compare the clinical outcome of 3D-CRT with γ Ray and LA. In view
      of this, we aim to implement a randomized controlled study to find out an effective treatment
      for intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients with PVTT based on
      evidence-based research.
