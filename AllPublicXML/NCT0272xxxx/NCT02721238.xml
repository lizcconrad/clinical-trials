  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive cirrhotics who present to emergency department of Institute of Liver &amp; Biliary
      Sciences with documented or suspected sepsis induced hypotension will be randomized to
      receive either human albumin infusion over 3 hours or plasmalyte as per requirement. At
      admission, all patients will undergo physical examination and baseline investigations to
      identify site of sepsis. The aim of study is to compare the efficacy of using 20% human
      albumin versus plasmalyte in resuscitation of the patient that is attainment of mean arterial
      pressure above 65 mm of Hg at three hour after intervention and sustenance of mean arterial
      pressure above 65 mm of Hg at 6th hour. The randomized patient will be administered 20%
      albumin (0.5-1.0 gm/kg) for 3 hours, or plasmalyte at the rate of 30ml/kg. After the
      intervention changes in MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure), lactate level, urine output, incidence
      of complications, duration of ventilator, ICU (Intensive Care Unit) stay and mortality after
      one week will be studied.
