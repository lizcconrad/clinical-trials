    <textblock>
      This study intends to compare the combination of general anesthesia (GA) and single-shot
      bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) by ropivacaine in the patients undergoing
      off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery ( OPCAB) with traditional general anesthesia (GA)
      perioperative management of patients, committed to reducing patient's physical and
      psychological stress by surgical trauma, achieve the purpose of fast recovery, in order to
      establish an more effective perioperative management during off-pump coronary artery bypass
      surgery, improve patients' satisfaction and to accelerate postoperative rehabilitation
      safely.

      This study intends to compare the combination of general anesthesia (GA) and single-shot
      bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) by ropivacaine in the patients undergoing
      off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery ( OPCAB) with traditional general anesthesia (GA)
      perioperative management of patients, committed to reducing patient's physical and
      psychological stress by surgical trauma, achieve the purpose of fast recovery, in order to
      establish an more effective perioperative management during off-pump coronary artery bypass
      surgery, improve patients' satisfaction and to accelerate postoperative rehabilitation
      safely. Patients included in the study (approximately 60 cases) will be randomly divided into
      PVB(T2/3+T5/6)+GA experimental group (A), PVB(T3/4)+GA experimental group (B)the conventional
      GA control group (C). All groups received the preoperative preparation, anesthesia and
      postoperative treatment according to the traditional manner, the group A of patients has been
      received bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB T2/3+T5/6) by ropivacaine(0.3%,10ml*4),
      group B will received bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB T3/4)by
      ropivacaine(0.3%,20ml*2).,while the group C will received the conventional general anesthesia
      management without block.
