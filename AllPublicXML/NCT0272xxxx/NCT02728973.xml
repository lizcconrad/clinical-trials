  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) was first proposed by Kehlet in Copenhagen Denmark,
      this is a new concept for the integration of the latest study of the surgical, anesthesia,
      and nursing. The purpose of optimization measures, reduce patient trauma stress, promote
      early rehabilitation of patients. The investigators plan to compare the feasibility, clinical
      effectiveness, and cost savings of an ERAS program with traditional treatment program at a
      major teaching hospital in China.The investigators will apply ERAS plan or traditional
      treatment regimens in the treatment of 100 cases of colorectal cancer patients, respectively.
      And data Compare the two programs about the incidence of postoperative complications,
      postoperative hospital stay, cost of hospitalization, and readmission rate will be collected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major colorectal surgery usually requires a hospital stay of more than 12 days. Inadequate
      pain management, intestinal dysfunction and immobilisation are the main factors associated
      with delay in recovery. This study aims to assess the short and medium term results achieved
      by an enhanced recovery program based on previously published protocols. This prospective
      study will be performed at a major hospital in China, involved 200 patients. All patients
      underwent elective colorectal resection for cancer are divided into enhanced recovery program
      group or conventional treatment group. The main elements of this program were: preoperative
      advice, no colon preparation, provision of carbohydrate-rich drinks one day prior and on the
      morning of surgery, goal directed fluid administration, body temperature control during
      surgery, avoiding drainages and nasogastric tubes, early mobilization, and the taking of oral
      fluids in the early postoperative period. Perioperative morbidity and mortality data will be
      collected and the length of hospital stay and protocol compliance recorded.
