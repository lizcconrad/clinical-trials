    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further develop the integrated Eating Aversion Treatment
      (iEAT) manual, which is designed to address chronic food aversion in children with chronic
      food refusal. This study will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the iEAT manual when
      it is used in the home home environment with caregivers.

      The purpose of the current study is to further develop the integrated Eating Aversion
      Treatment (iEAT) manual and address the unmet needs of many children with chronic food
      refusal by providing a technology-based treatment that makes it easy for parents to
      understand how to duplicate the models of institutional care. The study seeks to expand upon
      this treatment by introducing the manual and procedures in an electronic form to be
      implemented by caregivers in a home environment.

      The study team aims to enroll 20 participants with chronic food refusal and formula or
      feeding tube dependence. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the iEAT manual
      intervention with the technology supported manual or a control group (10 participants per
      group). The intervention with the iEAT manual will involve 10 biweekly outpatient
      appointments of about 45 minutes in length. Target behaviors will be assessed during each
      treatment meal. Participants will be assessed pre-treatment and at a one month follow-up to
      assess long term effects. Parents in the control group will provide a food diary once a
      month, for 5 months. Those assigned to the control group will be able to cross-over to
      receive the iEAT treatment manual following completion of post-study measures. Screening,
      collecting data for outcomes measures, and the intervention will be conducted at the each
      participant's home. Data will be collected on parent compliance with the treatment manual and
      child food acceptance, nutritional intake, and refusal behaviors.

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale is a seven-point scale measuring overall change from baseline. Scores will be ranked from 1 (Very Much Improved) through 4 (Unchanged) to 7 (Very Much Worse). Scores of &quot;Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; will be used to define positive responses; all other scores will indicate negative responses.</description>

    <description>The iEAT manual guides caretakers in increasing the volume of food consumed by the child. The manual involves a touch screen application that collects and stores data on key behaviors and provides the feeder with direction for structuring treatment meals. Sessions will be 45 minutes long and occur biweekly for 10 sessions over 5 months. Two meals each day will be completed at home as part of the treatment of the feeding problems.</description>

    <description>The psychoeducation condition will involve 6 appointments (once monthly for 5 months and 1 session during the post-treatment assessment). Each appointment will include curriculum related to feeding concerns such as the etiology of feeding problems, meal structure, appropriate food selection, mealtime problem behaviors, and generalization of appropriate feeding behaviors. Each session will last approximately 45 minutes.</description>
