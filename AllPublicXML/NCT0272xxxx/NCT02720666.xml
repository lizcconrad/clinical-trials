  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open and single-center Phase I clinical research on patients with advanced
      pancreatic cancer, for evaluating their adverse reactions or tolerance to K-001, so as to
      determine the safe and reasonable dosage and dosing regimen.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to past experience to toxicology studies and clinical test, K-001 at a dose of
      2700mg/day has a good safety profile for human body. Upon observation, pancreatic cancer
      patients receiving a medication at 2160mg/day (1080mg BID) have had good therapeutic
      efficacy, no sign of significant toxicity.

      Dosing regimen:

      Phase I clinical test: maximum dose of monotherapy at 2700mg/day. Four groups of repeated
      administration of monotherapy, at least 3 patients for each group.

      Group A: 2700mg/d (1350mg BID); Group B: 3240mg/d (1620mg BID); Group C: 3780mg/d (1890mg
      BID); Group D: 4320mg/d (2160mg BID). Twice a day, to be taken with warm water on an empty
      stomach; 4 weeks' administration for each group.

      In case of severe adverse reactions associated with the test drug, or if half of the
      participants show adverse reactions at Ⅲ level and above, the test should be terminated. The
      maximum dosage not causing the above-described situation shall be considered as the maximum
      tolerated dose or the biologically effective dose. After the test, continuous medication
      shall be given upon request from patients.

    <description>The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of K-001 will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one patient out of three experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria, version 4.0. If none of the patient experiences DLT, the maximum dose in the trial (4320mg/d) will be defined as MTD and the biologically effective dose.</description>
