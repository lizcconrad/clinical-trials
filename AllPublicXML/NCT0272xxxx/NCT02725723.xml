  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal stenosis is a prevalent diagnosis, which is handled in a heterogeneous manner by
      clinicians. Moreover, when using steroidal epidural injections, successful treatment is
      currently defined as the satisfaction of the patient from the treatments, a subjective and
      non-quantifiable indicator.

      In this experiment, the investigators aim to evaluate thermographic images as an objective
      method for assessing the efficacy of steroidal epidural injections, the most common invasive
      treatment for pain associated with spinal stenosis
