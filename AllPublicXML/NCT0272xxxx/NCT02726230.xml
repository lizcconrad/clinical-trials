  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ananya was funded by BMGF to reduce maternal, newborn, and child mortality; fertility; and
      child undernutrition in Bihar, India. Ananya involved multi-level interventions designed to
      build front line health worker (FLW) capacities and reach to communities and households, as
      well as to strengthen public health facilities and quality of care to increase maternal and
      neonatal care and health behaviors, and thus survival. From 2012 to 2014, eight focal
      districts in western and central Bihar.received Ananya, while 30 districts did not. Data were
      collected from mothers of infants 0-11 months at baseline and mothers of infants 0-23 months
      at 2 year follow-up, from comparable public health blocks in Ananya and Control districts to
      assess Ananya effects on quality and quantity of FLW home visits, postnatal health behaviors,
      and among older infants/toddlers, complementary feeding and vaccination. Difference in
      difference analyses were used to assess Ananya outcome effects in this quasi experimental
      study.

    <description>The Ananya program was developed and implemented via a partnership of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Government of Bihar as a means of improving reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) outcomes in the state, in particular focusing on improving health behaviors and service utilization in the final trimester of pregnancy and early postpartum period. Ananya was designed as a series of supply- and demand-side efforts to improve health. Efforts were focused on strengthening outreach services in quantity and quality, improving quality of facility services, and mobilizing communities to improve health behaviors. The Ananya program included training, mobilizing, and monitoring of government frontline health workers (FLWs, including anganwadi workers- AWWS, auxiliary nurse midwives- ANMs, and community health workers-ASHAs) to increase quantity and quality of home visits for RMNH screenings and services, and media messages to increase demand for services.</description>
