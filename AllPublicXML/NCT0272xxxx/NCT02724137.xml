    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Determine whether the Physical Therapy (PT) &amp; Fitbit® intervention should proceed to a
           full-scale clinical trial. This decision will be based on three hypotheses: Treatment
           promise (Hypothesis 1A): People in the PT &amp; Fitbit® will walk 1250 more steps/day and
           spend 7 min/day more in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than the control
           at discharge and at 6 months and 12 months, Safety (Hypothesis 1B): &lt; 5% will have
           adverse events because of the intervention, A research assistant will collect data on
           adverse events that occur from the time of randomization until the last follow-up visit
           3 months after discharge from PT. An adverse event is any unfavorable or unintended
           diagnosis, sign, symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the study intervention,
           which may or may not be related to the intervention. Adverse events include any new
           events not present during the pre-intervention period or events that were present during
           the pre-intervention period which have increased in severity. Major adverse events, such
           as infection, re-hospitalization or development of new comorbidities will also be noted.
           Recruitment (Hypothesis 1C): 75 recruited, 90% to complete trial, and 85% complete visit
           at 6 months and 12 months.

        2. To evaluate the short- and long-term adherence of the PT &amp; Fitbit® intervention.
           Short-term Adherence (Hypothesis 2A): 90% of subjects in the PT&amp; Fitbit® group will wear
           the Fitbit® and participate in goal setting and behavioral counseling while in PT.
           Long-term Adherence (Hypothesis 2B): 75% of PT &amp; Fitbit® will wear the Fitbit® at 6
           months and 12 months.

        3. To quantify changes in potential underlying mechanisms for increased physical activity.
           (Hypothesis 3): Change in self-efficacy for physical activity, walking endurance and
           participation in daily activities will be associated with improvements in physical
           activity.

        4. To assess intervention fidelity (Hypothesis 4): (4a) using the electronic medical
           record, the treating PT will check off that they 1) reviewed physical activity recorded
           by the Fitbit® and 2) discussed step goals for all study subjects randomized to the
           intervention group. (4b) treating PTs will be asked to audio record five-intervention
           interactions/week using a digital audio recorder. A research assistant will then assess
           whether the PT 1) reviewed physical activity and 2) discussed step goals. Lastly, the
           duration of the intervention will be noted.

    <description>The goal is to investigate how consistent the physical activity intervention is provided to the patients. Consistency will be measured using two methods. The first is to use the EMR to check if current steps/day were recorded by the treating PT. The second is to use the digital audio recording in a subset of patients to evaluate if steps/day from the past week were reviewed by the treating PT, and if a step goal was discussed for the next week. This time frame is open-ended by design. The goal is to model current physical therapy practice, in which a patient after total knee replacement goes to outpatient physical therapy and receives physical therapy services based on a timeframe planned out by their treating physical therapist. Treatment is then discontinued based on the patient's clinical presentation (ie functional mobility, strength gains, range of motion gains, patient specific goals, etc).</description>

The treating physical therapist reviews Fitbit® recorded steps from the previous week and together with the patient sets a new step goal. The physical therapist discusses barriers to meeting step goals are discussed. Self-reward for meeting step/goal is set weekly. Participants in this group will also receive 1-month phone calls for 6-months after completing physical therapy rehabilitation to discuss physical activity, set monthly step count goal, barriers to overcoming goal and to continue to develop a reward system for when the participant achieves their step count goal.</description>
