  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-reported outcomes are commonly used in healthcare. Examples include validated
      symptom-based questionnaires and health diaries. In the field of Female Pelvic Medicine and
      Reconstructive Surgery there are many questionnaires and diaries that have been validated for
      a paper-based administration. As technology is incorporated into delivery of medical care and
      research, investigators need to consider how to collect data electronically while ensuring
      that this new format is equivalent to the paper questionnaires they rely on. In this study,
      the investigators aim to validate a series of validated questionnaires and symptom diaries
      administered via the web and smartphone for a more streamlined care for the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health questionnaires and health diaries are two forms of patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
      commonly used in healthcare. Health questionnaires are often used as intake logs, discerning
      and recording the symptoms and severity of a problem at the time of presentation. Health
      diaries, in contrast, are ongoing logs which allow for mindful attention to symptoms and
      monitoring of response to therapy. Unfortunately, both types of PRO forms are often
      under-utilized or uninterpretable because they are collected on paper. Within urogynecology,
      PRO scales such as the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI), Pelvic Floor Impact
      Questionnaire (PFIQ), Bristol Stool Chart, Bladder Diaries and others are used ubiquitously.
      Their impact, however, is diminished by poor compliance and recall bias. The move towards
      electronic PRO measures would be endorsed by patients (who can track and interact with their
      data), physicians (who can track progress and study group outcomes) and by regulators (who
      want to ensure accurate and reproducible data collection). Electronic PRO tools, particularly
      on the patient's own device, would allow for increased rate of reporting through mobile
      availability, time stamping of data to prevent recall bias and reduction in data entry
      mistakes and costs.

      Study Procedures After informed consent is obtained, demographic data will be collected.
      Subjects will be administered the questionnaires either in paper or web-based or smartphone
      form based on a random number block scheme. At least two weeks later but prior to treatment
      they will complete the other form of the questionnaire. This can occur at their next office
      visit or can be completed at home. Subjects will be emailed and/or called by research staff
      to remind them to complete the second set of questionnaires.

        This is a prospective validation study. Subjects will be recruited at their visit to the
        Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery offices and clinics at Columbia and
        Cornell. Demographic information will be collected at the initial visit/enrollment
        including age, race, parity, and presenting complaint.

        Questionnaires will be administered based on a randomization scheme. These include:

          -  Pelvic Floor Disorders Inventory short form (PFDI-20)

          -  Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7)

          -  Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-12)
