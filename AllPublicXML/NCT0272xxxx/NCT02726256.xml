  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has consistently increased and type 2 diabetes can cause
      many types of vascular complications. Diabetes develops due to glucose intolerance. Early
      detection and intervention in the stage of glucose intolerance makes it afford to prevent
      overt diabetes and its complications. This study was designed to make a cohort of korean
      patients with glucose intolerance to construct a long term database about clinical
      characteristics of these patients.
