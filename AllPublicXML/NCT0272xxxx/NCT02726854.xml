      The main research purpose Evaluation of objective response Apatinib second-line treatment of
      advanced pancreatic cancer (ORR) and the rate of progression free survival (PFS).

      Objective to study the objective and exploratory secondary research To observe the Apatinib
      in second line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer disease control rate (DCR), patients
      with overall survival (OS) benefit, treatment effects on quality of life (QOL) score and drug
      safety evaluation, To investigate the relationship of apatinib as second-line treatment of
      advanced pancreatic cancer and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor(VEGFR) in the serum

      The purpose of this study is to determine what effects apatinib has on advanced pancreatic
      cancer patients after failure of first-line chemotherapy cannot tolerate second-line
      chemotherapy or unwilling to receive second-line chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer
      patients.To investigate the relationship between apatinib as second-line treatment of
      advanced pancreatic cancer and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor(VEGFR) in the serum.

      This study choose the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an JiaoTong University were unable to
      tolerate the failure of first-line chemotherapy for second-line chemotherapy or unwilling to
      receive second-line chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer patients as the research object, the
      clinical data of clinical subjects age and sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group （ECOG）
      score, tumor stage, pathological type, pathological grading, giving apatinib treatment,
      during the treatment of blood monitoring in patients with CA199 levels, imaging findings,
      assessment of tumor related symptoms and adverse events, and the expression of VEGFR in blood
      was measured by ELISA method, the curative effect evaluation of the end of the 2 cycle of
      treatment, patients with effective evaluation to oral apatinib, through the statistical
      analysis of the data of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), the rate of
      progression free survival (PFS) expression of CA199 content in serum and serum VEGFR levels
      of the relevant indicators,. Explore Apatinib for the curative effect and safety of the
      second-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, and to explore the relationship between
      the serum VEGF expression level.
