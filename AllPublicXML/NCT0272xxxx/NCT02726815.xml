      Primary Objective

      The aim of this research study is to develop a comprehensive inventory of symptoms that occur
      in children with advanced cancer who are receiving a specialist palliative care service.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess correlation between parent, child and nurse scores on the Memorial Symptom
           Assessment Scale (MSAS).

        -  To identify symptom prevalence in children with advanced cancer as identified by the
           child/young person (CYP), nurse and parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child
           and nurse).

        -  To identify whether there are any symptoms missing from the age appropriate MSAS as
           identified by the CYP, nurse and parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and
           nurse).

        -  To identify whether any items on the age appropriate MSAS are not relevant to the
           population being studied (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).

        -  To identify which symptoms cause the most distress as identified by the CYP, nurse and
           parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).

        -  To identify degree of severity of each symptom as identified by the CYP, nurse and
           parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).

        -  To identify which symptoms occur most frequently as identified by the CYP, nurse and
           parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).

        -  To assess the trends between phase of illness and symptom profile, severity and
           distress.
