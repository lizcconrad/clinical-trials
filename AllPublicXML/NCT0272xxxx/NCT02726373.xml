      Objective: To compare effects of an intermittent and continuous walking program on walking
      endurance and fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).A randomized crossover
      prospective method was used.The intervention consisted of eight 6-minute-long walks (2x/week
      for 4 weeks). The continuous condition consisted of 6 continuous minutes of walking. The
      intermittent condition consisted of three 2-minute bouts with 2-minute rests. After a 4-week
      detraining period, participants performed the second training condition.
