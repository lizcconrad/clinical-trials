    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending
      oral doses of ASP4345 in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, this study will evaluate
      the pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending oral doses of ASP4345 in patients with
      schizophrenia.
