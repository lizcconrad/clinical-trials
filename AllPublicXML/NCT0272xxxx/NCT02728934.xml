  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the proportion of patients with an infusion reaction
      in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with Golimumab Intravenous (IV) or Infliximab.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, noninterventional (no treatment medication provided by the study),
      observational (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe the patients and measure
      their outcomes), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study of Golimumab IV and
      Infliximab in RA patients. The study allows for an anticipated 2-year enrollment period and a
      3-year study duration for each patient. No interventions will be given to patients as a part
      of this study. This study will be conducted in the US, at rheumatology-based clinical
      practices and will enroll adult RA patients who meet all entry criteria. The primary endpoint
      of this study is the proportion of patients with an infusion reaction through Week 52.
      Patients will be enrolled in a 1:1 ratio to initiate treatment with either Golimumab IV or
      Infliximab. Patients' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The CDAI is a validated measure of disease activity consisting of the sum of 4 clinical variables: tender joint and swollen joint count based on a 28-joint assessment, patient global assessment, and the physician global assessment of disease activity based on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10. The CDAI has a range from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The change in CDAI over time and proportion of CDAI responders will be used to evaluate effectiveness.</description>

          -  Patient previously received Golimumab IV if planning to receive Golimumab IV in this
