  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigate the value of unipolar and bipolar electrograms (EGM) for predicting the
      successful ablation site for idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmia (OTVA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to evaluate the predictive value of using reversed polarity in
      adjacent bipolar EGMs (bi-RP method) and unipolar EGM with QS morphology (uni-QS method) for
      identifying successful ablation site, and evaluate the feasibility of enhancing uni-QS
      method's performance by using its morphology characteristics such as descending slope and
      symmetry.
