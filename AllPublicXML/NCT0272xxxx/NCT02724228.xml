      This is a Phase 2, Open-Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety,
      Tolerability, and Efficacy of BMN 111 in Children with Achondroplasia. The primary objective
      is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of daily SC injections of BMN 111 in
      children with ACH who have completed two years of treatment in the 111-202 study.
