    <textblock>
      This single site study is designed to describe and measure the efficacy of oral versus
      vaginal dosing of TFV-based products, specifically emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate oral tablets (Truvada) vs tenofovir intravaginal rings (IVR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare an investigational intravaginal ring containing tenofovir (TFV) with
      an FDA approved medication in tablet form called Truvada®. It will assess and compare the
      ability of the tablet and intravaginal ring to prevent HIV transmission (human
      immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS).

      The study will enroll healthy, non-pregnant, HIV negative, premenopausal women (aged 18-50,
      with regular menstrual cycles) who are not at risk of pregnancy.

      The enrollment goal is for 20 participants to complete the study.

      Participants will be assigned to use one of the study products: oral tablet or intravaginal
      ring. Participants will take the oral tablet each day for 14 days or wear the intravaginal
      ring all day and night for 14 days/nights. Blood, genital fluid samples and genital tissue
      samples (biopsies) will be taken at two visits. These sample collections will take place
      before and after use of the assigned study product. The samples will be tested to:

        1. Determine the levels of drug in the blood and genital tissue samples

        2. See if the samples taken from the vagina and cervix after use of study product, provides
           protection from HIV in the laboratory

        3. Ensure that the laboratory test used to measure HIV infection in the samples performs
           well when used repeatedly.

      In addition this study will also evaluate the returned TFV rings to see whether they were
      used as instructed.
