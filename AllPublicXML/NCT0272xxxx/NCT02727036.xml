    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized control trial is to compare the effect of pumpkin seed oil
      2g/day with pumpkin seeds given as a dose of 1½ teaspoons/ 4.1 grams a day to provide 2g of
      lipid (equivalent to 2 grams of oil) on BP (systolic and diastolic), endothelial function,
      serum lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, and menopausal symptoms in
      postmenopausal women.

      At the onset of menopause CVD rates increase in women. A beneficial effect of pumpkin seed
      oil on blood pressure has been observed in postmenopausal women. More than 1 in 3 female
      adults have some form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is affected by blood pressure.

      Pumpkin seed is a good source of phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens are compounds found in plants
      and are comparable to human estrogen, capable of producing estrogenic effects. Studies in
      post menopausal women have demonstrated that pumpkin seed oil, at a dose of 2g per day for 12
      weeks can decrease blood pressure and reduce menopausal symptoms.
