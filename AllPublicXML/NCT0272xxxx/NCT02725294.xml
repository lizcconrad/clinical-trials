      This observational study will examine the care-seeking behaviors of Veterans with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to see whether patients' perceived need for care or lack
      of access to care leads to delays in getting care for COPD exacerbations. Participants will
      complete a baseline in-person visit and receive calls every two weeks for one year to monitor
      for COPD exacerbations. Detailed information about each exacerbation and time to care will be
      obtained. A sample of participants and their caregivers will participate in more in-depth
      interviews. Approximately half the participants will also use a remote inhaler monitor to
      record their albuterol inhaler use to see if this approach can identify early exacerbations.
      Results from this study will be used to develop an intervention that will assist Veterans in
      the early identification, evaluation, and treatment of exacerbations, and will be integrated
      with the VA primary care team.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prompt treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations with oral
      steroids and/or antibiotics, ideally within 3 days of onset of symptoms, can decrease the
      severity and duration of exacerbations and may reduce the risk of COPD hospitalizations. This
      observational study will examine Veterans' care-seeking behaviors and will focus on patients'
      perceived need for care and perceived access to care and whether these factors delay seeking
      care for COPD exacerbations, increasing the risk for hospitalizations. This study will also
      evaluate one approach of identifying early exacerbations through the use of a remote inhaler
      monitoring system.

      This observational cohort study will enroll 410 Veterans with COPD at high-risk for
      exacerbations and follow every patient for 1 year. The Specific Aims are: 1) Examine the
      barriers to seeking care for COPD exacerbations or worsening breathing; 2) Test the use of a
      real-time remote inhaler monitor to identify early exacerbations.

      All participants will attend one in-person baseline visit to complete spirometry and baseline
      questionnaires. Participants will be contacted every 2 weeks for 1 year using an interactive
      voice response system that will screen for COPD exacerbations with 4 yes/no questions.
      Participants with a positive screen will be called back by research staff to obtain
      additional detailed information on the exacerbation and how it was treated. Data analysis
      will examine where access to care and baseline factors are associated with a delay in
      treatment.

      The 410 participants will be enrolled at two sites: VA Puget Sound in Seattle, WA and the VA
      Eastern Colorado in Denver, CO. For Aim 1, approximately 60 participants who reported a COPD
      exacerbation (either hospitalized, seen in the emergency department, treated as outpatients,
      or did not seek treatment) will participate in an in-depth semi-structured interview by a
      trained research staff to understand how they responded to their worsening symptoms and
      decided whether to seek care. When available, the caregivers for these Veterans will be
      interviewed to obtain their perspective on the exacerbation event.

      In Aim 2, 200 participants from Aim 1 will use an inhaler monitor with their albuterol
      inhaler during the 12-month follow-up period, which will transmit data in real-time about
      their daily inhaler use. Data analysis will measure ability of a change in albuterol use to
      predict patient reported COPD exacerbations to determine the appropriate cut-offs that can be
      used in a future intervention trial.

      These aims will provide detailed information on how best to intervene to ensure prompt
      identification and treatment of COPD exacerbations. New health care delivery approaches will
      assist Veterans in early identification of exacerbations and provide early access to care
      that can be integrated into the VA primary care, emergency medicine and pulmonary specialty
      care settings.
