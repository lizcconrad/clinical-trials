    <textblock>
      Balloon predilatation of the aortic valve has been regarded as an essential step during the
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure. However, recent evidence suggested
      that aortic valvuloplasty may be harmful and that high success rate may be obtained without
      prior dilatation of the valve. We hypothesize that TAVI performed without predilatation and
      using new generation balloon expandable prothesis is associated with a better net clinical
      benefit in comparison with procedure performed with pre dilatation.

      Background Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now the standard of care for
      inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and an accepted alternative to
      surgery for high-risk patients. Despite a high procedure success rate (&gt; 95%), TAVI remained
      associated with complications directly related to the technique (stroke, aortic
      regurgitation, vascular access bleeding) or to co morbidities frequently associated with
      aortic valve disease in elderly and frail patients. Reducing periprocedural complications is
      thereby the key for the future use of TAVI in lower-risk patients.

      Methods/design The transcatheter aortic valve implantation without prior balloon dilatation
      (DIRECTAVI) trial is a randomized controlled open label trial that include 240 patients
      randomized to TAVI performed with prior balloon dilatation of the valve (control arm) or
      direct implantation of the valve (test arm). The trial tests the hypothesis that the strategy
      of direct implantation of the balloon expandable SAPIEN 3 prosthesis is non-inferior to
      current medical practice using predilatation of the valve. The primary endpoint is related to
      immediate procedural success criteria and secondary end points include complications at
      30-day follow-up (VARC 2 criteria). A subgroup analysis evaluates neurological ischemic
      events with cerebral MRI imaging (25 patients in each strategy group) performed before and
      after the procedure.

      In conclusion, we hope that the study will provide robust evidence of safety and efficiency
      of TAVI performed without prior dilatation of the aortic valve using the balloon expandable
      SAPIEN 3 THV and will allow the interventional cardiologist to use this strategy in everyday
      practice.
