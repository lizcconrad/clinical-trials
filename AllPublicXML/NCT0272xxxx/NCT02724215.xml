  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) will be screened for
      sleep apnea (SA) to investigate if SA is associated with impaired blood pressure control and
      worse clinical outcome early after SAH.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted with non-traumatic SAH will be consented and screened for sleep apnea
      within 48 hours after hospital admission. Blood pressure and clinical outcome will be
      monitored throughout ICU treatment and hospital stay, respectively. Diagnosis of sleep apnea
      will be confirmed on follow-up 3-6 month after SAH by sleep apnea screening (portable
      cardiorespiratory monitoring and out-of-center polysomnography, respectively).
