    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two rounds of mass drug
      administration (MDA) with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAp) + single low dose (SLD)
      primaquine for reducing seasonal malaria transmission in Shehias considered hotspots on
      Unguja Island, Zanzibar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design: This is a cluster-randomised controlled study with two arms: an intervention
      arm with two rounds of MDA with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAp) + single low dose (SLD)
      primaquine, and a control arm with no MDA.

      Study site and study population: The study will be conducted in 16 hotspot Shehias (8 Shehias
      randomly allocated to each arm), in three districts (West, Central and South districts) in
      Unguja Island, Zanzibar. Hotspot Shehias [Shehia being the smallest administrative structure
      in Zanzibar] are defined as Shehias with an annual malaria incidence of &gt;0.8%, calculated as
      the number of confirmed malaria infections notified at health facilities and during active
      case detection in 2015 / Shehia projected population for 2015. The study population will
      include all consenting residents of the selected Shehias, reaching approximately 24000
      people.

      Study implementation: Two rounds of MDA with DHAp (D-ARTEPP, Guilin Pharmaceutical (Shanghai)
      Co., Ltd., China) and SLD (0.25mg/kg) primaquine (Primaquine, Remedica Ltd.,Cyprus ) will be
      conducted approximately four weeks apart in the intervention Shehias, at the anticipated
      lowest point of malaria transmission prior to the onset of malaria transmission associated
      with the main rains in April-June 2016. The first drug dose including DHAp and SLD primaquine
      will be given under supervision whenever possible; the other two doses of the standard once
      daily DHAp regimen will be taken unsupervised at home. Labelled packets containing all three
      doses will be left with the head of household with clear instructions for individuals not
      present at the time of the household visit.

      Study objectives: The primary objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of two
      rounds of MDA with DHAp + SLD primaquine for reducing seasonal malaria transmission in
      Shehias considered hotspots on Unguja Island, Zanzibar. The secondary objectives of the study
      include determining MDA coverage, compliance, and safety after one and two rounds of DHAp +
      SLD primaquine.

    <description>MDA compliance, i.e. the proportion of the population that have taken one, two or all three doses of DHAp + SLD primaquine, will be evaluated in a subset of the population by post-MDA surveys conducted seven days after the initiation of each MDA round. The post MDA surveys will include both a questionnaire and finger prick blood sampling for measuring piperaquine blood concentrations.</description>

    <description>A brief questionnaire will be conducted in a subset of the population during post-MDA surveys conducted seven days after the initiation of each MDA round. The questionnaire will include specific questions regarding adverse events such as vomiting, nausea, gastrointestinal upset, rash and fatigue. Severe adverse events, especially symptoms of haemolysis, will be captured at health facilities where haemoglobin and dark urine (representing haemolysis) will be measured and reported using the pharmacovigilance forms and the Primaquine Roll Out Monitoring Pharmacovigilance Tool (PROMPT) developed by the Global Health Group at University of California San Francisco.</description>
