    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active IgG4-RD

          -  Compatible pattern of organ involvement consistent with IgG4-RD that cannot be
             attributed to other causes

          -  Histopathologically-proven diagnosis of IgG4-RD

          -  Peripheral blood plasmablast count &gt;900 cells/mL and/or elevated IgG4-RD levels during
             screening

          -  Able and willing to complete the entire study according to the study schedule

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of a clinically unstable/uncontrolled disorder, condition or
             disease other than IgG4-RD that, in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a risk
             to the patient safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion

          -  Malignancy within 5 years (except successfully treated in situ cervical cancer,
             resected squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or prostate cancer with no
             recurrence ≥3 years following prostatectomy)

          -  Presence of recurrent or chronic infections, defined as ≥3 infections requiring
             antimicrobials over the past 6 months prior to screening

          -  Active infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with parenteral antimicrobials
             within the 60 days prior to randomization or oral antimicrobials within the 21 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Patient is taking &gt;40 mg of prednisone QD

          -  Prior use of rituximab (or other B cell depleting agents) within 6 months of
             enrollment. Prior use of any B cell depleting agent greater than 6 months from
             enrollment is allowed if the CD19+ B cell count is within the normal reference range
             during screening

          -  Use of any investigational agent within 5 half-lives of the agent (or 6 months if the
             half-life is unknown) prior to enrollment

          -  Immunosuppressive agent use within the three months prior to enrollment

          -  Has received live vaccines within 2 months of enrollment

          -  Patient is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled
             in the study, up to end-of-study visit

          -  Unable or unwilling to partake in the follow-up assessments or required protocol
             procedures
