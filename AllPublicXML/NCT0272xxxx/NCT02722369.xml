  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether the combination of gemcitabine/carboplatin with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
      is associated with an improved clinical outcome (progression free and overall survival)
      compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomised, phase II trial which aims to compare the combination of
      hydroxychloroquine and gemcitabine/carboplatin versus standard carboplatin/etoposide
      chemotherapy, as first line treat in patients with stage IV disease.

      The standard first line chemotherapy treatment remains a platinum-based chemotherapy and this
      has been unchanged for 20 years. Novel active treatment approaches are urgently needed to
      improve survival in SCLC.

      Patients are randomised to one of two treatment arms; carboplatin/etoposide or
      gemcitabine/carboplatin/hydroxychloroquine.
