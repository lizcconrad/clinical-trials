  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has the aim to assess the effectiveness of the Buteyko method as an adjunct
      therapy in the treatment of children with asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children from 7 to 12 years old with asthma diagnose will be included. Children in the
      intervention group will perform 6 sessions (twice a week) of treatment with the Buteyko
      Method. Children assigned to the control group will receive, along with their parents,
      educational interventions in relation to asthma. The investigators will assess quality of
      life by the PAQLQ (Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), pulmonary function
      (spirometry) and the six-minute walk test. Vital signs, pulmonary auscultation and oxygen
      peripheral saturation will also be assessed during the tests. In addition, information will
      be collected on the numbers of hospitalizations, occurence of absence in school due to
      exacerbation of the disease, asthma symptoms and Beta2-agonists usage .
