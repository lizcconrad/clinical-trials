          3. Ankle sprain must have occurred &lt;48 hours prior to Screening.

          4. Subject must have a baseline self-evaluated pain score of &gt;50 mm on a 100 mm VAS while
             bearing weight on the affected ankle.

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             Screening and be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control from the day of

         17. Subject has a history of severe cardiac, renal, or hepatic impairment within 12 months
             prior to Screening that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the

         19. Subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to flurbiprofen, aspirin, other
             NSAID(s), or any excipient in the IP.

         20. Subject has any systemic or dermatologic disorder that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase the risk of AEs.

         21. Subject has a history of uncontrolled chronic or acute concomitant disease that, in
