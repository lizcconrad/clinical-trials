  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to improve the self-management of pain, stress, and
      cognitive/affective symptoms that may result in adult inpatients with sickle cell disease
      (SCD) by determining the feasibility of a self-management guided relaxation (GR) stress
      reduction intervention using a tablet-based mobile device. Currently, opioid analgesics are
      primarily used to treat SCD pain while self-managed behavioral modalities such as GR, are
      rarely used, particularly, in inpatient settings. Little is known about the effects or
      mechanisms of GR on pain, stress, and cognitive/affective symptoms in adults with SCD
      hospitalized with pain. Emerging evidence from the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis
      theory offer insights for understanding the mechanisms. Adding GR as a supplement to
      analgesic therapies will address the dearth of self-management strategies for controlling
      pain in SCD. GR is a simple and cost-effective non-drug intervention that could reduce pain
      and stress in inpatients with SCD. GR is an intervention where inpatients with SCD are
      directed to listen to and view audio-visual recordings while they visualize themselves being
      immersed in that scenario.

      The purpose of this research study is to see if a new computerized stress reduction program,
      called PAINReportIt Guided Relaxation Intervention, can be used to teach people who have
      sickle cell disease (SCD) how to track their stress and pain daily and use guided
      audio-visual relaxation exercises to help them reduce their stress and pain. To obtain
      preliminary data for a larger trial, 30 adult inpatients with SCD admitted with SCD pain will
      be recruited.

      The investigators will stratify patients on worst pain intensity (&lt;=5 and &gt;5) and randomly
      assign 15 adults to Attention Control (12-min SCD experience discussion on Day 1 and daily
      stress/pain tracking on Days 2-4) and 15 adults to Experimental (12-min GR video clip on Day
      1 and daily stress/pain tracking and GR on Days 2-4) groups.

      Immediate effects on pain, stress, and relaxation responses after the 12-min session will be
      examined. Patients will continue the trial for additional 4 days, with self-management on
      Days 2-4 and posttest on Day 5 while hospitalized to test short-term effects.

      During Days 2-4, the experimental group will choose and watch any of six video clips (2 min,
      5 min, 8 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min lengths) at least once a day; and at stress onset
      and as often as they need. We will investigate mechanisms by which GR produces its effects in
      adult inpatients with SCD.

    <description>PAINReportIt® Composite pain index (CPI): A a multidimensional representation of pain calculated by averaging the individual proportional scores for each of the four pain dimensions: (1) number of pain sites; (2) pain intensity; (3) total pain rating index (from the McGill Pain Questionnaire [MPQ], pain quality); and (4) pain pattern score. The scores for the CPI range from 0 to 100. We will estimate intervention effects using linear regression.</description>

    <description>Physiological markers of relaxation (pulse, respiration, finger temperature) will be measured using a standard vital sign measuring device. We expect to observe trends for the immediate GR effect in terms of decreases in relaxation indicators (respiration rate, heart rate) and increases in skin temperature.

An overall perceived stress index (PSI) score for each scale is computed by subtracting 30 from the raw score and dividing it by 90, yielding scores that range from 0 to 1. Higher scores indicate greater perceived stress recent. We will analyze data using linear regression.</description>

    <description>This intervention is a 12-minute guided audio-visual relaxation intervention delivered at the baseline (Day 1) visit to determine the immediate effects of guided relaxation intervention on stress and pain in inpatients with sickle cell disease. The GR intervention also includes six video clips, ranging from 2 to 20 minutes in length to determine the short-term (Day 5) effects of guided relaxation intervention on stress and pain.</description>

    <description>Attention Control Group: This intervention is a 12-minute sickle cell disease experience discussion. In this computer-based discussion, patients will discuss their experience of having sickle cell disease. The audio-taped questions and onscreen directions were programmed to be self-administered. Subjects' responses will be captured via the microphone so that Data Collectors are not involved in this discussion process, and it is equivalent to the guided relaxation activity.</description>
