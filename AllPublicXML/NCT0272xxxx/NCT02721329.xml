  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that APAP with SensAwake improves wake-after sleep onset compared to APAP
      without SensAwake in a patient population with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and
      Insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with OSA and Insomnia will be enrolled into this randomized study to receive
      treatment with APAP with and without SensAwake. Baseline data will be collected for one week
      prior to CPAP initiation, followed by two treatment periods on each study arm of four weeks
      each.
