      An open label, non-comparative bridging study to evaluate the safety of GCFLU® (seasonal
      influenza vaccine) administered intramuscularly in healthy Vietnamese volunteer aged from 3
      years old

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A bridging study to evaluate safety of seasonal influenza vaccine GCFLU® pre-filled syringe
      inj. One dose (0.5 ml) after exposure administered intramuscularly. The study conducted in
      Ben Luc District of Long An province, in which 120 healthy Vietnamese volunteer aged from 5
      year old will be enroll to the study. All subject will receive only one dose (0.5 ml) vaccine
      in Day 0.

      Study variables will be collected to determine and provide the evidence for the safety of
      GCFLU®, include:

        -  Local and systemic adverse event (AE) in 30 minutes after vaccination.

        -  Local and systemic AE in 7 days after vaccination

        -  Unsolicited AE over 21 days after vaccination.

        -  Serious adverse event (SAE) after vaccination and in 21 days of observation periods
           Study protocol has been reviewed and approved by Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City
           (HCMC) Institutional Review Board (IRB), Vietnam Ministry of Health - Independent Ethics
           Committee (IEC) and Vietnam Minister of Health.
