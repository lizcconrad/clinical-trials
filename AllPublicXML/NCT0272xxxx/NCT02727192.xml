  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance in adults, with
      prevalence expected to rise significantly the coming decades. The occurrence of AF is
      associated with significantly increased mortality as well as morbidity of which
      cerebrovascular accidents is the most important. Unfortunately treatment options remain
      limited. Anti-arrhythmic drugs are widely used but have limited efficacy and the potential
      for toxicity and adverse events are recognized. Recent year's catheter ablation of AF
      continues to gain acceptance for symptomatic treatment, but recurrence rate are high with
      need for continuous medication. Thus there is a need to better understand what causes
      development and triggers episodes of AF as well to introduce new treatment options.
      Cardiometabolic factors such as obesity, inactivity and sleep apnea (SA) have therefore
      gained interest. Many patients with AF have chronic sleep apnea, and in the present study we
      want to explore the interaction between SA and AF. The hypothesis of the present study is
      that SA may trigger AF and that treatment of SA will reduce the overall burden of AF as well
      as reduce the recurrence of AF after pulmonary vein ablation. To test the hypothesis we will
      implant a Reveal device that continuously records the hearts rhythm of 100 patients with
      paroxysmal AF and concomitant SA. Initially the influence of SA on onset of AF will be
      examined, and the patients will then be randomized to treatment of SA or not and the
      influence on total AF burden recorded both before and after ablation.

      For the present project we have established a research team from 2 different university
      hospitals. This team, including high ranked, internationally renowned scientist from both
      clinical and basic sciences, will make a framework for PhD candidates and will ensure the
      patient cohort. Patients with paroxysmal AF and SA will be examined with an extensive
      diagnostic battery including advanced cardiac imaging tools allowing a proper description of
      the heart. Then a Reveal that continuously monitor the rhythm of the heart will be inserted,
      allowing the influence of SA, physical activity, inflammatory parameters, and other external
      variables on total AF burden to be examined. The patients will then be randomized to
      treatment of SA with a CPAP or not, and the AF burden recorded 5 months before ablation and 6
      months after.

      The present investigations carried out, are expected to results in better understanding of
      the interaction between AF and SA and may lay the scientific basis for better diagnostic and
      therapeutic approaches for patients with AF. In addition, given the advantage of continuous
      Reveal® recording of the patient's heart rhythm, the present study will examine possible
      triggers of AF such as activity level and inflammatory substances, and examine the role of
      structural abnormalities in the heart as assessed by echocardiography and MRI for the
      triggering of AF episodes. An overall aim is therefore a better phenotyping of the patient
      which could aid in a more person-specific treatment approach, with direct consequences both
      for the individual patient and for the society.

    <description>All patients receive a loop recorder, Reveal Linq, Medtronic. The Device is implanted subcutaneously and continously records single-lead ECG. Patients are randomized to either intervention Group (CPAP or ASV) or Control. The primary endpoint is a reduction in total burden of AF as measured by loop recorder after 5 months of intervention, pre ablation. The study is Powered to detect a 25% reduction in total burden of AF.</description>
