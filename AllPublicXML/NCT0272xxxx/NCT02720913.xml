  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COR-KNOT technology (LSI SOLUTIONS, Victor, New York USA) was developed to replace suture
      tying with a faster procedure during surgery. While preclinical studies confirmed the speed
      of COR-KNOT use, no clinical studies have quantitatively compared the speed of suture
      fixation delivered by the COR-KNOT device with the speed of conventional hand-tied knots.
      COR-KNOT is expensive, costing 189 $ per application. Given this added expense, it is
      important to quantify the time-saved by application of this technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COR-KNOT device was developed to make suture fixation faster and save operative time.
      With a single squeeze of the lever, the device remotely and automatically secures sutures
      with a titanium fastener, while also simultaneously trimming excess suture tails. This device
      has been accepted by cardiac surgeons for the recognized benefits of time savings,
      simplicity, and reliability.

      While the device presents ergonomic advantages during minimally invasive cardiac surgery, it
      enjoys widespread use in sternotomy-based, standard heart surgery. The relative cost of the
      device as a function of time saved has not been assessed. The purpose of this trial is to
      determine the relative time savings and cost of COR-KNOT compared to standard hand-tied knots
      in patients undergoing mitral/tricuspid ring annuloplasty repairs via traditional open heart
      surgery. Valve repair surgery is a common setting for COR-KNOT use and therefore serves as an
      appropriate procedure for evaluation of the technology.

      The investigators propose a prospective, randomized trial in patients undergoing mitral or
      tricuspid ring annuloplasty repair to 1) Determine the time require per knot for COR-KNOT
      versus standard hand-tied knots and 2) Quantify the relative cost of COR-KNOT versus that of
      standard, hand-tied knots. Data from this study will enable the investigators to determine
      the cost-benefit of using COR-KNOT technology in cardiac surgery.
