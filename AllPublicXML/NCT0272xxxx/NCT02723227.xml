      The investigators have partnered with financial coaching organizations to establish what the
      investigators have termed a &quot;Medical-Financial Partnership (MFP)&quot; that offers financial
      coaching to improve financial and mental health. The investigators will evaluate the MFP's
      impact on family economic strain and parental stress.

      Financial coaching is a new tool in the field of community development, but it has already
      demonstrated significant financial impact in a number of studies, including one randomized
      trial conducted by the Urban Institute. Financial coaching improves participant financial
      literacy, budgeting, saving for financial emergencies, and debt level. The investigators'
      project will help clinicians and the field of community economic development understand
      health and well-being through a new economic lens and assess the health-related impacts of
      the emerging field of financial coaching. The investigators have partnered with financial
      coaching organizations to establish what they have termed a &quot;Medical-Financial Partnership
      (MFP)&quot; that offers financial coaching to improve financial and mental health. The
      investigators will evaluate the MFP's impact on parental strain and stress.

      Community-based participants will be recruited from South Los Angeles and randomized to
      receive either monthly financial coaching plus access to referral for social services
      (intervention) or access to referral for social services alone (control). Inclusion criteria
      include having dependents under age 18, having some form of income, and having a tax
      identification number (social security number or Individual Tax Identification Number).
      Participants will be surveyed quarterly regarding their economic strain using the Family
      Economic Strain Scale and their individual stress using the Parenting Stress Index.
