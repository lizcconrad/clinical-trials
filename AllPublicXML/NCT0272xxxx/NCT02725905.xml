  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eight U.S. medical schools will be participating in the study: Weight Management Counseling
      in Medical Schools, also known as MSWEIGHT. This is a five-year randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) designed to compare the efficacy of two approaches to learning weight management
      counseling: 1)traditional education (TE) and; 2) multi-modal educational intervention (MME).

      The study aims are to refine and compare the efficacy of MME to TE on observed student weight
      management counseling skills measured through the primary outcome, the Objective Structured
      Clinical Examination (OSCE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eight U.S. medical schools are matched and then randomized to one of two educational
      interventions, MME or TE.

      Schools randomized to TE represent &quot;usual care&quot; and will continue the current curriculum. The
      MME arm will build upon the traditional usual curriculum at the medical school. The MME is a
      multi-modal educational intervention of a series of interactive learning components focused
      on integrated weight management counseling. This MME intervention for weight management
      counseling uses the 5As model based on the updated American Heart Association (AHA) /American
      College of Cardiology (ACC) /The Obesity Society (TOS) and updated NHLBI guidelines.

    <description>The primary outcome is the OSCE, the standard method for evaluating medical students' skill level at U.S. medical schools. The investigators will compare the efficacy of MME to TE on weight management counseling skills assessed among two separate 3rd year student classes (pre and post MSWeight implementation). MME and TE students will be compared regarding the mean score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean self-efficacy score on 5As will be calculated as the mean of student's self-reported skill level (1=not at all skilled through 4=very skilled) on 7 items regarding patient counseling skills.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Three Years</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived self-efficacy skill on 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) will be assessed longitudinally as 1st Year medical students and then again as 3rd Year medical students. The investigators will compare the difference in self-efficacy between MME and TE. Mean self-efficacy score on 5As will be calculated as the mean of student's self-reported skill level on 7 items about patient counseling skills.</description>

The investigators will compare the percentage of students reporting moderately skilled to very skilled in patient counseling skills in MME and in TE. Percentage of students reporting on self-efficacy will be calculated on 7 items about patient counseling skills.</description>
