  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators observed that during the Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL)
      non-pharmacological methods used for reducing the level of the pain and anxiety among the
      patients with the urinary stones are not sufficient and the effectiveness of these methods is
      controversial. There are very few studies, which investigated the effects of music on the
      pain and anxiety during ESWL. In addition, any randomized clinical trial related to the use
      of stress ball for relaxation and distraction on the reduction of pain and anxiety during
      lithotripsy has not been found in the relevant literature. Investigators also evaluated that
      further evidence-based studies are necessary. Thus, investigators aimed to investigate the
      effectiveness of stress ball and music for reducing the pain and anxiety of the patients
      during ESWL in this study.

    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL), used commonly in urinary stone treatment, can
      cause pain and anxiety for patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of
      use of music and stress ball to reduce pain and anxiety during lithotripsy. This was a single
      center parallel-randomized controlled trial. The study sample consisted of a total of 120
      patients who applied to lithotripsy unit of urology clinic in a training and research
      hospital in Turkey between April and September 2014. The patients were randomly divided into
      three groups. The patients in group-I (control group) were not interfered, while group-II was
      given stress ball into their palms in order to squeeze and group-III was listened to the
      music chosen by themselves with a headset during the lithotripsy procedure. Data were
      collected using the Patient Information Form, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and State Trait
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI-SA).
