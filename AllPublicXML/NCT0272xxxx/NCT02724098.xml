      The aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered
      dexmedetomidine in healthy volunteers. The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously
      administered dexmedetomidine will be calculated. In addition, the investigators will report
      the effects of subcutaneously administered dexmedetomidine on plasma catecholamine levels,
      vital signs such as systemic blood pressure, heart rate and sedation. The investigators will
      also monitor the local and systemic safety and tolerability of subcutaneously administered
      dexmedetomidine.
