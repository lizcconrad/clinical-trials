  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a common occurrence that occurs in the incidence of
      8-10% of births. Since the duration until delivery is important in avoiding the risk of
      complications, several studies have been performed in order to understand what is the
      preferred way to manage this condition of PROM in women that are not in active labor. In the
      largest random study that has been performed 20 years ago, there was found an advantage for
      labor induction with oxytocin over labor induction with Prostaglandin or waiting. However,
      the most important component - the BISHOP score, that affects the decision of the labor
      induction way, was not reported and was not taken into consideration.

      Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a common occurrence that occurs in the incidence of

      complications, several studies have been performed in order to understand what is the

      the most important component - the BISHOP score, that affects the decision of the labor
      induction way, was not reported and was not taken into consideration.

      Therefore, the aim of the study is to compare randomly the perinatal outcomes in women with
      PROM and low BISHOP between women who undergo labor induction with Oxytocin and women who
      undergo labor induction with Prostaglandin E2.

    <description>Women that arrive to women's ER and diagnosed with rupture of membranes in week 34+0 and onward, are not in active labor and with Bishop score lower than 7.
Those who agreed to participate in the study after signing an informed consent form will undergo the following steps:
Verification rupture of membranes and gestational age.
Choosing the treatment group Intravenous oxytocin from red envelope, randomly.
Collecting basic and obstetric data, laboratory results and physical examination, monitoring and sonar.
Induction according to departmental protocol of each delivery way.
