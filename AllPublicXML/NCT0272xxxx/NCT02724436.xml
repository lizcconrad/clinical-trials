  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most-common cancer worldwide and the second
      most-common cause of cancer mortality. Liver resection is the first-line curative treatment
      for huge HCC. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates after hepatic resection were range from
      25% to 45%. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the major treatment option for the
      unresectable primary or secondary liver malignancies. Yittrium-90 (Y-90) is a pure
      beta-emitter, without any toxic effect or immune rejection. There are ample data that support
      the use of Y-90 microspheres for primary and metastatic liver tumors. The aim of our study
      was to compare the clinical outcome of radioembolization with Y-90 and TACE and provide a new
      strategy for the treatment of intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with portal
      vein thrombus by conduting a randomized trial.
