    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of rapid tests for hematocrit and clotting function in women
      undergoing surgery for placenta accreta. Half of participants will have these rapid tests
      performed during surgery to guide blood product transfusion and the other half will have
      standard lab tests performed to guide transfusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta has become an increasingly common pregnancy complication. Serious
      complications are common in patients with placenta accreta, including hemorrhage, transfusion
      of blood products, abdominal organ injury, bladder surgery, and ICU admission. Hemorrhage, or
      excessive blood loss, is the most common complication and often results in impaired ability
      for the body to form blood clots normally.

      The development of rapid testing of hematocrit and clotting function may allow for earlier
      identification of patients who have severe blood loss and development of clotting
      abnormalities. The investigators are testing whether use of this technology in patients
      undergoing surgery for placenta accreta, with earlier identification of patients with severe
      blood loss or clotting abnormality, will result in a lower need for transfusion and fewer
      complications.
