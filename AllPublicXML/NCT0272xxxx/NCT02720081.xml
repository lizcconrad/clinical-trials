  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of adding
      MK-1029 to montelukast in adults with persistent asthma that is uncontrolled while receiving
      montelukast alone. Participants will have a specific genetic marker for clinical efficacy of
      MK-1029. The primary hypothesis is that when added to montelukast, treatment with MK-1029 is
      superior to placebo, as demonstrated by an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second
      (FEV1), measured as the average change from baseline at the end of Week 4 and Week 6 of
      treatment.
