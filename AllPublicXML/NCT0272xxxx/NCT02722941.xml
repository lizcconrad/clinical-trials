    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about ways to prevent or delay relapse of multiple
      myeloma (MM). This study will determine the best dosing schedule of LBH589 maintenance
      therapy as well as the safety (side effects) and tolerability of LBH589 maintenance therapy
      after autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

    <measure>Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) per Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will calculate RDI for each cohort. Relative dose intensity (RDI) represents the ratio of the amount of a drug actually delivered [actual dose intensity (DI)] to the amount planned (planned DI). The purpose of calculating RDI is to evaluate whether the planned DI of a chemotherapy treatment was actually achieved which may suggest the feasibility of planned treatment regimen. There are multitude of reports demonstrating a correlation between RDI and survival in cancer treatment. RDI = (total dose received by the patient = mg)/(planned full dose of drug = mg).</description>

Serum M- component (absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL)

Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M protein levels and without measurable disease by free light chain (FLC) levels, bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute percentage must be ≥ 10% )
Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
