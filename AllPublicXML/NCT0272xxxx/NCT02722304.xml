        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ≥18 years of age at the time of screening

          2. Endogenous plasma Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (A1PI) level &lt;8 μM at any time during
             the Screening period for treatment-naïve participants, or following 4-weeks minimum
             wash-out from previous augmentation therapy in treatment-experienced participants. The
             screening plasma A1PI level may be repeated if a participant obtains an exclusionary
             value that is suspected to be due to inadequate washout of A1PI).

          3. Participant has documented A1PI genotype of Pi*Z/Z, Pi*Z/Null, Pi*Malton/Z,
             Pi*Null/Null, or other rare genotypes (except PI*MS, PI*MZ, or PI*SZ).

          4. Clinically evident mild-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

             than temporary for acute COPD exacerbation, or supplemental oxygen (O2) with
             continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], or bi-level positive airway pressure
             [BiPAP]).

         11. Participant has contraindications for CT (e.g. body weight and/or body size exceeding

             inability to lie flat in the CT scanner, claustrophobia, metal prosthesis or pacemaker
             in the chest wall or upper extremity that would impact lung density assessment).

         12. Participant is unwilling or unable to modify bronchodilator medications for 6 hours
             for short acting β2 agonists, 24 hours for long-acting β2 agonists, and 48 hours for
             long acting anticholinergics prior to the scheduled quantitative CT scan.

         13. Known severe immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (ie, IgA level &lt; 8 mg/dL at screening).

         14. Known history of hypersensitivity following infusions of human blood or blood
             components (eg, human immunoglobulins or human albumin).

         15. Presence of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at the screening

         16. The participant has a clinically significant medical, psychiatric, or cognitive
             illness, is a recreational drug/alcohol user, or has any other uncontrolled medical
             condition (eg, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled hypertension)
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect participant's safety or
             compliance or confound the results of the study.

         17. Participant has been exposed to another IP within 28 days prior to enrollment or is
             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational
             device during the course of this study.
