      Prospective, multi-centre, randomized, open-label, parallel comparisons to evaluate

        -  the incidence of bleedings (COSTA-Bleed) and

        -  the incidence of ischemic and bleeding events (COSTA-Outcome) following a therapy with
           the abluminal sirolimus coated bio-engineered stent (COMBO stent) in association with
           short-term single antiplatelet therapy as compared to a guidelines-based strategy in
           patients with coronary artery disease with an indication for chronic oral anticoagulant
           therapy.

      The COSTA trials are investigator-initiated studies aimed at comparing the clinical outcome
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a COMBO-stent based strategy associated
      with short-term antiplatelet therapy with a guidelines-based therapy in patients with an
      indication for chronic oral anticoagulation. The study is organized as a national,
      multi-centre prospective, randomized trial. The duration of the follow-up is 15 months.

    <description>The OrbusNeich COMBO Bio-engineered Sirolimus Eluting Stent (COMBO Stent) consists of a 316L stainless steel alloy abluminally coated with a biocompatible, biodegradable poly-mer containing sirolimus. Covalently attached to the surface of the stent is a layer of murine, monoclonal, anti-human CD34 antibody. The antibody specifically targets circulatory CD34+ cells (endothelial progenitor cells) thus favoring endothelialization.</description>

             transfusion of at least two units of blood, or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area
             or organ) including life-threatening bleeding episode (symptomatic intracranial
             bleeding, bleeding with a decrease in the haemoglobin level of at least 5g/dL or
             bleeding requiring transfusion of at least 4 units of blood or inotropic agents or
             necessitating surgery); Anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;10g/dL) or thrombocytopenia including

             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause
             non-compliance with the protocol or confound the data in-terpretation or is associated
             with a limited life expectancy;

          -  Patient has received an organ transplant or is on a wait-ing list for an organ
             transplant;

          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to antiplate-let or anticoagulant agents

             the production of Human Anti-Murine Antibodies (HAMA);

             with the patient's optimal participation in the study;

          -  Current participation in another investigational drug or device study except for
             non-interventional registries;

          -  Patients not willing or able to comply with the protocol requirements or considered
             unreliable by the Investigator concerning the requirements for follow up during the

        Angiographic exclusion criteria:

          -  Vessel diameter &lt;2 und &gt; 5mm;
