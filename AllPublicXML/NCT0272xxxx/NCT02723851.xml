  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) is still the leading cause of death in the western world.
      Early warning (chest pain) signs of an acute MI are often misinterpreted and disregarded. In
      average it takes between 2-3 hours from the beginning of the chest pain. The damage to the
      heart in these 2 hours is critical and often irreversible. Thus an early warning test or
      device is highly warranted.

      Corsens has developed a noninvasive device using several sensors applied to the chest and a
      detection system able to recognize the ischemic origin of chest pain. This clinical study is
      intended for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Corsens technology while use for
      myocardial infarction detection

        data that was already recorded in previous study from non-MI patients hospitalized for
        routine elective catheterization will be used.
