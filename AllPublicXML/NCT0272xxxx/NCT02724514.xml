    <textblock>
      Breast lymphedema (swelling due to fluid) is a common complication of breast cancer therapy.
      Unlike lymphedema in the arm, breast lymphedema is not as well-known and has not been
      studied. At present, no objective and standardized tools exist to evaluate breast lymphedema.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of ultrasound analysis and bio-impedance
      to determine if it is possible to measure the extent of the fluid in the breast.

    <textblock>
      Breast lymphedema (swelling due to fluid) is a common complication of breast cancer therapy.
      Limited research has been conducted on the frequency of breast lymphedema with most studies
      reporting the incidence as ranging from 33 to 48%. Women with breast lymphedema describe
      breast fullness, heaviness and pain associated with breast swelling and changes that impacts
      how the breast looks (cosmesis) and also impacts their quality of life.

      At present, no objective and standardized tools exist to evaluate breast lymphedema and
      correlate it with tissue fluid and fibrosis, and their relationships to local symptoms,
      cosmesis and quality of life.

      The goal of the study is to assess and compare photographic, ultrasound and the breast
      composition in newly diagnosed breast lymphedema, and to assess the use of breast massage to
      manage breast lymphedema. Developing non-invasive image-based methods may enable researchers
      to map the extent of lymphedema, monitor its progression and evaluate therapies. This may
      allow for improved quantitate measures to be undertaken to better assess future strategies
      intended to prevent or improve the management of this treatment complication.

      Patients participating in this study will have ultrasound scans before and after the massage.
      They will also be asked to complete a questionnaire.
