  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin (Jardiance)速 is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)-Inhibitor, which is a
      new treatment option developed for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. The SGLT2 is
      expressed in the proximal tubule and reabsorbs approximately 90 percent of the filtered
      glucose. The inhibition of SGLT2 results in renal excretion of glucose with subsequent
      osmotic diuresis. This mechanism could result in a therapeutic effect in patients with
      hypotonic hyponatremia as in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
      secretion (SIAD). Because patients with SIAD usually have several comorbidities and different
      medications, studies investigating the physiological effects are difficult to interpret.
      Therefore a model to study the possible physiological effect of SGLT2-inhibitors in hypotonic
      hyponatremia as in SIAD is needed.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether empagliflozin (Jardiance)速 has an effect on
      serum sodium levels of healthy volunteers with induced hypotonic hyponatremia.
