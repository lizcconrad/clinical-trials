    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this work is to use a prospective cohort study to examine
      patient-specific but shoulder-extrinsic factors and how they influence the results of rotator
      cuff surgery. There are undoubtedly many factors that play a role in patient outcome,
      however, this project will focus on three: the effect of gender on outcome, the effect of
      mood disorders and coping style on outcome, and the effect of patient height and reach on
      outcome after rotator cuff surgery. It is hypothesized that these factors will have a
      significant influence over outcomes.
