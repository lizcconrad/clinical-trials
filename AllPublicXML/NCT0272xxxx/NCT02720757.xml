  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this NIS is to measure changes in physical functioning, a surrogate
      for physical activity and exercise capacity, in COPD patients on treatment with Spiolto®
      Respimat® in routine daily treatment after approximately 6 weeks.

      A secondary objective is to evaluate the patient's general condition (physician's evaluation)
      from Visit 1 (baseline visit at the start of the study) to Visit 2 (final visit at the end of
      the study, approx. 6 weeks after Visit 1), as well as patient satisfaction with Spiolto®
      Respimat® at Visit 2.

          3. Patients diagnosed with COPD and requiring long-acting dual bronchodilation (LAMA +
