      To evaluate the safety and treatment effect of the CryoBalloon™ Full Ablation System for the
      ablation of human esophageal epithelium in patients scheduled to undergo esophagectomy
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcomes for the study are the safety and treatment effect of the CryoBalloon™
      Ablation System. An esophagectomy will be performed as scheduled following the ablation
      procedure; histopathological analysis of surgically-resected specimens will be performed to
      determine the treatment effect.
