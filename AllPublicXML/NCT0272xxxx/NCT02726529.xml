    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to find out how well a new nutrition program works for
      elementary school students and their families. This program is called Brighter Bites.
      Brighter Bites is a school-based program that teaches students and their parents about the
      importance of eating fresh fruits and vegetables and how to prepare them in tasty, healthy
      ways. This project is being carried out at six elementary schools in Houston, Texas. Up to
      600 first grade students and their parents/guardians are expected to join this project.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change intake of servings of fruits and vegetables for the child as assessed using the parent-reported food frequency questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Child dietary intake was measured using the parent-reported Block Kids Food validated screener to assess children's intake by food group, with outcomes measured in number of servings. The focus of this tool is on intake of fruit and fruit juices, vegetables, potatoes (including French fries), whole grains, meat/poultry/fish, dairy, legumes, saturated fat, &quot;added sugars&quot; (in sweetened cereals, soft drinks, and sweets). A secondary analysis produces estimates for intake of sugary beverages (both kcal and frequency). Individual portion sizes are asked. This screener takes about 10-12 minutes to complete. Servings of fruits and vegetables consumed are cumulatively reported.</description>
