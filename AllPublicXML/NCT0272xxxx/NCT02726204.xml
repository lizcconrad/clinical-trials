    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how the cable-driven arm exoskeleton (CAREX) can
      assist task performance during 3D arm movement tasks under various experimental conditions in
      healthy individuals and patients with stroke. This study is designed to test motor learning
      with the robotic rehabilitative device CAREX under three conditions in healthy subjects and
      subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis.

    <description>CAREX will compensate for the gravity of the subject's arm, i.e. subject can move their arm to a specific position and relax all the arm muscles, CAREX will hold the arm in that configuration</description>

    <description>CAREX will push subject's arm to a pre-specified path. If the arm is not in the path, CAREX will generate some force that is proportional to the distance between the hand and the path. The subject will feel like having a spring connected between his hand and the path</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for stroke population:

          -  Radiologically verified unilateral stroke at least 4 months previously.

          -  Right-handed subjects with or without right hemiparesis (as robot is built for right
             arm alone).

          -  Preserved passive range of motion at all upper limb joints.

          -  Spasticity &lt;3 on the modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).

          -  Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete the protocol; ability to
             comply with the protocol as assessed by the investigator; must be English speaking
             since the assessments are in English.

        Exclusion Criteria for stroke population.

          -  History of surgery or other significant injury to either upper extremity causing
             mechanical limitations that preclude task performance.

          -  Previous neurological illness such as head trauma, prior stroke ( as we are recruiting
             subjects with first unilateral stroke), epilepsy, or demyelinating disease.

          -  Complicating medical problems such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes with signs
             of polyneuropathy, severe renal, cardiac or pulmonary disease, or evidence of other
             concurrent neurologic or orthopedic conditions precluding the subject from complying
             with the study protocol.

          -  Severe upper extremity spasticity suggested by an Ashworth score of &gt;3 at any joint,
             or restriction of full passive range of motion.

          -  Evidence of alcohol, drug abuse or other relevant neuropsychiatric condition such as
             psychotic illness or severe depression.

        Inclusion Criteria for control population.

          -  No previous stroke or any other previous neurological injury.

          -  Right-handed subjects without any weakness or hemiparesis (as robot is built for right
             arm alone).

          -  Preserved passive and active range of motion at all upper limb joints.

          -  No increase in muscle tone in response to passive range of motion. A score of zero on
             Ashworth Scale (MAS).

          -  Able to achieve full score on upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Scale (66/66)

          -  Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete the protocol; ability to
             comply with the protocol as assessed by the investigator; must be English speaking
             since the assessments are in English.

        Exclusion Criteria for control population.

          -  History of surgery or other significant injury to either upper extremity causing
             mechanical limitations that preclude task performance.

          -  Previous neurological illness such as head trauma, prior stroke, epilepsy, or
             demyelinating disease.

          -  Complicating medical problems such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes with signs
             of polyneuropathy, severe renal, cardiac or pulmonary disease, or evidence of other
             concurrent neurologic or orthopedic conditions precluding the subject from complying
             with the study protocol.

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at
             significant risk, confound the study results, or interfere significantly with the
             subject's participation in the study.

          -  Severe upper extremity spasticity suggested by an Ashworth score of &gt;3 at any joint,
             or restriction of full passive range of motion.

          -  Evidence of alcohol, drug abuse or other relevant neuropsychiatric condition such as
             psychotic illness or severe depression.
