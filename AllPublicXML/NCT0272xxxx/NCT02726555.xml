  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-dose statin regimen achieves merely 6% of decrease in low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, whereas the risk of side effects increased largely. The
      investigators' previous pilot study (NCT01686451) has suggested that red yeast rice was of
      similar lipid-lowering efficacy while was associated with less fatigue than statins. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with red
      yeast rice and low-dose atorvastatin in persons with mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease and who qualified for statin therapy according to national guidelines.

    <textblock>
      Both Red Yeast Rice and Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications are often prescribed for
      secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The investigators' previous pilot study
      (NCT01686451) has suggested that red yeast rice was of similar lipid-lowering efficacy while
      was associated with less fatigue than statins. The aim of this study is to compare the
      efficacy and safety of combined therapy with red yeast rice at 1.2 g/day and atorvastatin at
      10 mg/day with atorvastatin at 20 mg/day in persons with mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease and who qualified for statin therapy according to national guidelines.

      This study will enroll individuals with established mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease and who do not currently take lipid-lowering medications. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive combined therapy with red yeast rice at 1.2 g/day and
      atorvastatin at 10 mg/day or atorvastatin at 20 mg/day for 24 weeks. Study visits will occur
      at screening, baseline, week 4, week 8, week 16, and week 24. Blood will be collected for
      laboratory testing, and standardized questionnaires will assess noncardiovascular endpoints.
      Pill count will be used to assess adherence of treatment. Medication side effects will be
      monitored and tests of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and
      creatine phosphate kinase (CPK) will be performed. Medication efficacy will be assessed and
      test of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) will be performed.
