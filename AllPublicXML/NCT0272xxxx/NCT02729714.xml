  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, suvorexant, is safe and effective in
      treating symptoms of insomnia in people with Parkinson's Disease. It is anticipated that a
      total of 20 subjects, 30 to 80 years of age, with Parkinson's Disease and symptoms of
      insomnia will participate in the study at this site
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of suvorexant specifically in a cohort of 20
      Parkinson's Disease patients between the ages of 30 and 80 (inclusive) who have a complaint
      of insomnia. After informed consent is given, potential subjects will be screened to ensure
      they meet eligibility criteria. This will include an overnight polysomnogram, which will
      serve both as a baseline and a screening polysomnogram. Active drug will be suvorexant 10 mg
      orally at bed time with an optional up-titration to 15 mg orally at bedtime after 2 weeks.
      The first treatment period will be 4 weeks long, in which subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive active drug or matching placebo. At the end of treatment period 1, subjects will
      undergo efficacy assessment with repeat polysomnogram and clinical scales. This will be
      followed by a 2-week washout period with placebo; this period only will be single-blinded, as
      subjects only will be blinded to treatment. Subjects will then be crossed over into the
      alternate treatment group, which will once again be double-blinded; those on active treatment
      for period 1 will be switched to placebo, and those on placebo in period 1 will be switched
      to active treatment. Treatment period 2 will also be 4 weeks long, and at the end of this,
      subjects will undergo final assessment with polysomnogram and clinical scales.
