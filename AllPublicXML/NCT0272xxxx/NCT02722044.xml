    <measure>Usability of the Auto-injector (AI) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The primary usability measure was the participant rating captured in the PRE- and POST-Self-injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) modules at Week 4. The PRE-SIAQ module is a 7-item questionnaire that investigates feelings about injections, self-confidence (regarding self-administration), and satisfaction with self-injection. The POST-SIAQ module is a 27-item questionnaire that assesses feelings about injections, self-image, self-confidence (regarding self-administration), pain and skin reactions during or after injection (injection-site reactions), ease of use of the self-injection device, and satisfaction with self-injection. Participants rated each item of the SIAQ on a 5-point (or 6-point) semantic Likert-type scale, where a score of 1 corresponds to a participant's worst experience and a score of 5 (or 6) corresponds to a participant's best experience. Item scores were transformed to obtain a score ranging from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience) for each item.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Injection Site Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>32 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An injection site reaction is defined as pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, induration/swelling, and other. If an injection site reaction was observed, a physician was to characterize and document the reaction as an adverse event (AE). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that started or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study medication, until study completion/withdrawal or within 30 days following the last treatment for early withdrawn participants.</description>

        <title>Usability of the Auto-injector (AI) at Week 4</title>
        <description>The primary usability measure was the participant rating captured in the PRE- and POST-Self-injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) modules at Week 4. The PRE-SIAQ module is a 7-item questionnaire that investigates feelings about injections, self-confidence (regarding self-administration), and satisfaction with self-injection. The POST-SIAQ module is a 27-item questionnaire that assesses feelings about injections, self-image, self-confidence (regarding self-administration), pain and skin reactions during or after injection (injection-site reactions), ease of use of the self-injection device, and satisfaction with self-injection. Participants rated each item of the SIAQ on a 5-point (or 6-point) semantic Likert-type scale, where a score of 1 corresponds to a participant's worst experience and a score of 5 (or 6) corresponds to a participant's best experience. Item scores were transformed to obtain a score ranging from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience) for each item.</description>

        <description>The usability measure was the participant rating captured in the PRE- and POST- SIAQ modules at Baseline. The PRE-SIAQ module is a 7-item questionnaire that investigates feelings about injections, self-confidence (regarding self-administration), and satisfaction with self-injection. The POST-SIAQ module is a 27-item questionnaire that assesses feelings about injections, self-image, self-confidence (regarding self-administration), pain and skin reactions during or after injection (injection-site reactions), ease of use of the self-injection device, and satisfaction with self-injection. Participants rated each item of the SIAQ on a 5-point (or 6-point) semantic Likert-type scale, where a score of 1 corresponds to a participant's worst experience and a score of 5 (or 6) corresponds to a participant's best experience. Item scores were transformed to obtain a score ranging from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience) for each item.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Injection Site Reactions</title>
        <description>An injection site reaction is defined as pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, induration/swelling, and other. If an injection site reaction was observed, a physician was to characterize and document the reaction as an adverse event (AE). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that started or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study medication, until study completion/withdrawal or within 30 days following the last treatment for early withdrawn participants.</description>
