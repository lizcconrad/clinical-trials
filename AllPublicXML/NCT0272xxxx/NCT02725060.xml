      The purpose of this study is to see if some people with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
      have higher levels of immune proteins (autoantibodies) directed against receptors of the
      autonomic nervous system, and if these autoantibodies make a difference in their POTS
      symptoms. The investigators also want to see if the levels of these autoantibodies stay the
      same over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a debilitating disorder resulting from cardiovascular
      autonomic dysfunction, has many causes and is very difficult to treat effectively. The
      investigators have identified the presence of autoantibodies (immune proteins) directed
      against some receptors of the autonomic nervous system that can cause patient's symptoms on
      standing.

      The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that patients with POTS harbor
      functional autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors that lead to an excessive tachycardia
      characteristic of POTS. For this purpose, this study will define the prevalence, burden, and
      the in vivo physiological significance of these adrenergic antibodies in a well-phenotyped
      and representative cohort of patients with POTS and a matched cohort of healthy control
      subjects, and will characterize the stability of these autoantibodies over time in affected
      POTS patients.

    <description>On up to 3 study days, POTS patients and control subjects will have several tests to assess autonomic function and to detect the presence of autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors. The following tests will de done but in some participants it may not be necessary to do all of them. The investigator will discuss with each participant which particular tests will be done in each particular case:
Posture study with blood samples for autoantibody testing
24-hour heart rhythm and blood pressure monitoring
autonomic function tests
Quantitative Axonal Sudomotor Reflex Testing
Total blood volume assessment
Pharmacologic testing with phenylephrine
Pharmacologic testing with isoproterenol
Cardiac output with rebreathing
Assessment of splanchnic capacitance
Microneurography</description>
