    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this this randomized interventional study is to determine if increased
      level of home-based rehabilitation coupled with a pre-TAVR consultation visit in
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients will improve functional status and quality of
      life and will decrease hospital readmission.
