      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of Sensi Peel®, Rejuvenating
      Serum, and the C&amp;E Strength Max skin care products in subjects who undergo full facial
      rejuvenation, with a botulinum neurotoxin A and/or hyaluronic acid filler, in improving the
      appearance of the skin, patient satisfaction with aesthetic appearance, and the projected
      first impressions.

      The secondary objective of this study is to examine patient satisfaction with the continuous
      use of Sensi Peel®, Rejuvenating Serum, and the C&amp;E Strength Max products.
