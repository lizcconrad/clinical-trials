  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine if altered renal function affects the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of gepotidacin, which will inform if dosing recommendations based upon renal
      impairment are required. The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of
      gepotidacin administered as a 750 milligram (mg) intravenous (IV) dose in normal healthy
      subjects compared with subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and with
      subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD). This is a Phase I, nonrandomized, open-label,
      parallel-group, multi-center, multi-part study. In Part 1, up to 16 subjects with normal
      renal function will be matched to approximately 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment,
      and approximately 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and/or subjects with ESRD not on
      hemodialysis for a total of approximately 32 subjects. In Part 2 (optional), approximately 4
      to 8 subjects with normal renal function (if enrolled), approximately 4 to 8 subjects with
      mild renal impairment, and approximately 4 to 8 subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis will be
      enrolled for a total of approximately 12 to 24 subjects. The duration from Screening to the
      Follow-up Visit will be approximately 44 days for Part 1 and approximately 50 days for Part
      2.
