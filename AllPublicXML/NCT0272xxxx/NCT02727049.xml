    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to:

        1. determine the normal or existing dynamic biomechanics of college athletes and

        2. test the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative medicine in the treatment of athletic
           injuries.

      Motion capture using Vicon systems allows researchers to quantify characteristics of a body
      such as the range of motion of the hip or shoulder during an athletic technique such as
      kicking or shooting a basketball into the basket. The quantified information has been used
      before to better understand human mobility and performance. Osteopathic manipulative medicine
      (OMM) is manual medicine applied to joints, muscles, and connective tissue with a goal of
      improved body functions. Research demonstrating effectiveness of OMM on the musculoskeletal
      and associated connective tissue systems health includes, among others, prospective clinical
      trials of OMM for treatment of neck pain, low back pain, and acute first- and second-degree
      ankle sprains.

      Volunteers for the study will be recruited through their Athletic director, coach, or
      physician by an announcement made verbally or via email. The motion capture will be performed
      under Matthew Cornelius, MS using the Vicon Bonita Motion Capture system in the Fine Arts
      Department of NYIT. Following the motion capture, body biomechanics will be analyzed to
      determine the range of motion of each joint in sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes as
      well as the timing and sequence of the movements. The motion analysis will be compared to the
      Sports Physical exam, including the general, structural/neuromusculoskeletal, and central
      neurological (ImPACT) exams. The comparison will add validity to the physical exam. In
      addition, determining if the quantitative, 3-dimensional motion analysis can be correlated
      with information from the physical exam with regards to restrictions to motion may be useful
      for athletes to optimize their abilities in the future. If during the course of the athlete's
      training and competition season s/he sustains an injury, s/he will be evaluated by the NYIT
      athletics physician, who will randomly assign the injured athletes to either the 'standard of
      care without OMM' or 'standard of care with OMM' cohorts when medically appropriate. OMM will
      be performed by an NYITCOM physician specializing in family medicine and OMT or
      neuromusculoskeletal systems and OMM. &quot;Return to play' time and
      post-intervention/post-control quantitative motion analysis of biomechanics during the
      athletes demonstration of the same athletic maneuvers as before the injury.
