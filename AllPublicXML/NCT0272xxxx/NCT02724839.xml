  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design, pilot, and tweak a series of peer-led group nutrition
      sessions for primary care patients aged 6 -12 years who are overweight or obese and who want
      to eat healthier and be more active.

    <textblock>
      In addition to the group nutrition sessions, the investigators will give a Fitbit to each of
      a parent and child dyad, which will be used to track and motivate their activity. The
      investigators hypothesize an improvement pre-post in children's physical activity levels,
      self-efficacy and intentions for physical activity, self-reported consumption of fruits,
      vegetables, and child quality of life, and a decrease in consumption of sugar-sweetened
      beverages and fast and snack-food, and TV/ videos screen time

    <description>The intervention will consist of 6 nutrition group sessions co-led by parent and a professional from the community who will rotate at each session. Group nutrition sessions will consist of a facilitated discussion of benefits and barriers to healthy eating, a short lesson led by the content expert, and a fun game or activity to reinforce the lesson. Two non-concurrent phases of the study will compare the efficacy of the group sessions when offered biweekly (first phase) and monthly (second phase). Participants will participate in only one phase.</description>
