  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient/Population: Women over the age of 18, who are not pregnant and are undergoing benign,
      robotic-assisted gynecologic procedures at Lutheran General Hospital.

      Intervention: Decreasing the angle of Trendelenburg for the procedure Control: Steep
      Trendelenburg, which is the usual standard of care, to the limit of the operative bed, which
      is 30 degrees.

      Outcome: Outcomes will include the mean angle of Trendelenburg in the experimental arm and
      the difference in Trendelenburg between the two arms. Additional outcomes included will be
      end tidal Carbon dioxide, peak airway pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and
      arterial Carbon dioxide. Secondary outcomes will include operative time, blood loss and
      conversion to laparotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For any patient undergoing robotic-assisted benign laparoscopic procedures at Lutheran
      General Hospital were eligible to participate. Each subject was randomized to steep or a
      decreased angle of Trendelenburg. While under anesthesia an arterial line would be placed to
      monitor vital signs. At specific time points throughout surgery, all vital signs were
      measured including End Tidal CO2, peak airway pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate
      and arterial CO2 as well as operative time, blood loss and conversion to laparotomy.

      The arterial line was removed at the conclusion of the case, and all variables will be
      compared between the two cohorts.
