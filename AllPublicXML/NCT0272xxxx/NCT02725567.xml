      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of ivacaftor treatment, and PK of
      ivacaftor and metabolites in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are &lt;24 months of age at
      treatment initiation and have a CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene gating
      mutation

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CF by sweat chloride value or CF mutation criteria.

          -  Must have 1 of the following 9 CFTR mutations on at least 1 allele: G551D, G178R,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any illness or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might

             drug to the subject

          -  Colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status

          -  Participation in a clinical study involving administration of either an
             investigational or a marketed drug within 30 days or 5 terminal half-lives before
             screening

          -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;9.5 g/dL at screening
