      To assess the safety and efficacy of the BARD LTX DCB for treatment of stenosis or occlusion
      of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll patients presenting with claudication or ischemic rest pain due to
      stenotic lesions in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery and a patent outflow artery
      to the foot. After successful pre-dilatation, subjects determined by the investigator not to
      require stenting based on defined angiographic criteria will receive the BARD LTX DCB. .
