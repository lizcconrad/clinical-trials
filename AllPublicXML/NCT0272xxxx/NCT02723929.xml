  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound (TUS) on pain perception and
      functional limitations in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when
      compared to sham stimulation.
