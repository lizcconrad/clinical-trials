  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and find the response rate of combining the
      dietary supplement, curcumin, with the standard of care, FDA-approved chemotherapy drug
      5-fluorouracil (5FU, Adracil) and see what effects (good and bad) that the combined
      treatments have on colon cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Confirm clinical safety and identify clinical response rate of combination treatment with
      curcumin and 5FU in chemorefractory CRC patients. To determine whether curcumin
      administration induces systemic alterations in inflammatory and epigenetic biomarkers in
      patients with chemoresistant metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). To correlate altered
      biomarker findings with clinical response according to RECIST V1.1 and survival criteria.
