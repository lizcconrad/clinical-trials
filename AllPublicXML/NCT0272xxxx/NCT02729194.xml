  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib is an orally administered multi-kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR (vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor), PDGFR (platelet derived growth factor) and c-kit, which
      are critical to growth and proliferation of neoplastic cells. Pazopanib has been FDA approved
      for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clear cell component. Conventional Pazopanib
      dosing WITHOUT FOOD is with an initial dose of 800 mg by mouth daily. Investigators
      hypothesize that administration of pazopanib with low fat meal would be safe and feasible
      with secondary implications of higher pazopanib levels; potentially translating into greater
      anti-tumor efficacy in advanced renal cell cancer, with significant cost savings. In the
      proposed pilot study, investigators seek to test the feasibility and practicality of this
      approach and gather preliminary data on adverse effects and the safety profile. Investigators
      hope to ameliorate any potential for greater toxicities with a dynamic dosing design that
      incorporates adverse events from each cycle into dosing for the next cycle and a structured
      symptom specific plan.
