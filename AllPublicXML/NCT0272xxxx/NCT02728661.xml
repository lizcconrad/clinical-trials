      PACE is a patient-centered weight loss program that was developed specifically for knee
      replacements based on input from stakeholders, including knee replacement patients, physical
      therapists, and orthopedic surgeons. In this pilot study, participants undergoing knee
      replacement will be randomized to either start a weight loss program before surgery (PACE) or
      after surgery (Delayed PACE). Both programs will receive a 14-week intervention and complete
      assessments at baseline (up to 6 weeks prior to surgery), 12 weeks after surgery, and 26
      weeks after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that half of patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis (OA) will need a
      total knee replacement (TKR) during their lifetime. Of patients who need a TKR, 80-95% are
      overweight or obese. While patients are encouraged to lose weight, limited, if any, guidance
      is provided to achieve recommended weight loss. Many patients perceive that TKR is a
      necessary precursor for the initiation of weight loss. Yet, 66% of patients actually gain
      weight by 2 years after surgery. Patients undergoing TKR not only face unique barriers (i.e.,
      pain, mobility limitations, motivation) to weight loss, but also have to balance pre- and
      post-operative concerns from physicians, surgeons, and rehabilitation specialists. To best
      accommodate the needs of both patients (pre- and post-TKR) and healthcare professionals
      (i.e., surgeon, physical therapist), patient and stakeholder engagement and activation is
      imperative in the development of a patient-centered weight loss intervention. Investigators
      completed 20 interviews with patients pre- and post-TKR and identified weight loss barriers,
      preferred intervention components (e.g., delivery method, contact frequency, self-monitoring
      modality) and patient-reported outcomes (e.g., physical function, pain) viewed as critical by
      patients. Investigators developed a patient-centered weight loss program (PACE) guided by
      these results and additional input from stakeholders to meet the needs of patients and
      healthcare professionals. PACE is a randomized pilot study comparing weight loss and
      patient-reported outcomes between PACE (program starting up to 6 weeks pre-TKR to 12 weeks
      post-TKR) and Delayed PACE (program starting 12 weeks post-TKR to 26 weeks post-TKR).

    <description>PACE participants will begin up to 6 weeks prior to their scheduled TKR and continue until 12 weeks after their TKR. Participants will be given personalized weight, dietary, and physical activity goals. Participants will be encouraged to monitor their dietary intake and physical activity using their preferred method of self-monitoring. Participants will have regular contact with their coaches either in-person or over the telephone on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, based on preference during the first 14 weeks (from up to 6 weeks pre-op to 12 weeks post-op). Further, participants may opt to receive regular text messages or emails from coaches if they prefer. At 12 weeks, PACE participants will enter a maintenance period and not have any contact with coaches.</description>
