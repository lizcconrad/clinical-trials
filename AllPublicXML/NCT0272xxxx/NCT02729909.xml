  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of 24
      ug of lubiprostone twice daily (BID) for 4 weeks in participants with chronic idiopathic
      constipation (CIC) compared with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called lubiprostone. Lubiprostone is being tested to
      treat people who have chronic idiopathic constipation. This study will look at the frequency
      of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) in people who take lubiprostone compared to placebo.

      The study will enroll approximately 204 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) equally to one of the two treatment groups, which will
      remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Lubiprostone 24 μg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule with breakfast and one capsule with dinner
      each day throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record each time they have a
      SBM and all details of each SBM (including the consistency of the stool and the difficulty
      they have in passing it) in a diary.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Mexico. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 8 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted
      by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) Frequency at Week 1 of Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>A SBM is defined as any bowel movement (BM) that does not occur within 24 hours after rescue medication use (laxative, suppository, or enema). Participants will be given a diary to complete at home where they will record all details of each SBM including the consistency of the stool and the difficulty they have in passing it.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SBM Frequency at Weeks 2, 3 and 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>A SBM is defined as any BM that does not occur within 24 hours after rescue medication use. Participants will be given a diary to complete at home where they will record all details of each SBM including the consistency of the stool and the difficulty they have in passing it.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Have a SBM Within 24 Hours After First Dose of Study Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after the first dose of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>A SBM is defined as any BM that does not occur within 24 hours after rescue medication use. Percentage of participants who have an SBM within 24 hours after the first dose will be assessed and derived from the data on SBMs collected in the participant diary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Degree of Straining</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, the mean degree of straining will be averaged for all SBMs in a given week. The degree of straining for each SBM will be collected in the participant diary. The degree of straining will be scored on a 5-point scale where: 0=No straining, 1=Mild straining, 2=Moderate straining, 3=Strong straining or 4=Very strong straining with higher scores indicating more severe straining.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Degree of Stool Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, the mean stool consistency score will be averaged for all SBMs in a given week. The mean degree of stool consistency for each SBM will be collected in the participant diary based on the Bristol Stool Chart. The Bristol Stool Chart is a medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories where: 1=Hard and round (difficult-to-pass), 2=Sausage-shaped but hard stool, 3=Sausage-shaped stool with cracks on the surface, 4=Sausage-shaped, soft stool with smooth surface, or coiled stool, 5=Soft, half-solid (and easy-to-pass) stool with clear crease, 6=Unshaped, loose stool with small, irregular-shaped pieces, or mushy stool or 7=Watery stool without solid pieces (entirely liquid).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Abdominal Symptoms Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly abdominal symptoms of bloating and discomfort upon waking in the morning will be scored weekly on a 5-point scale where: 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe or 4=Very severe, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. Assessment of weekly abdominal symptoms will be recorded in the participant in the diary.</description>
