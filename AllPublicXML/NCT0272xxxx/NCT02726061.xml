  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an interactive, multimedia computer-based depression
      treatment program (Dartmouth Research Problem Solving Therapy; DrPST). DrPST is based on an
      evidence-based psychotherapy called Problem Solving Therapy in which depressed patients
      identify problems in their lives and work through a structured format for solving these
      problems. The investigators have subjected DrPST to Phase 1-3 feasibility, acceptability and
      efficacy trials which have been positive and without adverse events. The purpose of the
      current study is to make DrPST available through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the Faculty and Employee Assistance Program (FEAP) at
      Dartmouth College in order to assess the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness under
      naturalistic conditions.

      Objective: To assess the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of DrPST under
      naturalistic conditions.

      Hypotheses:

      H1: Greater than 50% of participants referred to DrPST will complete at least 4 treatment
      sessions.

      H2: Participants will report that DrPST is acceptable as a stand-alone treatment for
      depression.

      H3: On average, participant's self-reported depression severity scores on the PHQ-9 will
      decrease over time.

      Procedures:

      Consecutive employees and faculty members receiving evaluations in the EAP programs of
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) and Dartmouth College and identified as being
      depressed and as potentially able to benefit from using DrPST will be referred to the
      program. DrPST will be loaded onto laptops in the Health Information Library at DHMC and in
      the FEAP clinic at Dartmouth College.

      Materials: Laptop computers containing the DrPST program.

      Data Collection:

      All study data will be automatically collected by the DrPST program. Evaluation data (i.e.,
      the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item Depression Scale; PHQ-9) scores and acceptability of
      the program) will be collected at each session. Information entered into the program as part
      of using DrPST (e.g., the types of problems worked on, success with solving the problems,
      satisfaction with effort, compliance with homework, obstacles encountered) will also be
      automatically stored. Users will be assigned an anonymous ID code that will enable their use
      of the program. . Evaluation measures and work performed while using DrPST will be stored to
      the laptop for later retrieval by the investigators. The laptops will be secured on site.
      Only age and gender will be collected. No identifying information (e.g., name, address, dob,
      SS#) will be collected. All entered data will be stored according to the assigned ID.
