  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All subjects completing the randomized treatment period in Protocol NS2014-1 will discontinue
      study drug and be asked to provide consent to be followed in this 6-month study, at their
      final safety visit. The study will consist of an enrollment visit, followed by bi-monthly
      in-clinic visits with monthly telephone visits between in-clinic visits.

      Following completion of the NS2014-1 final study visit procedures, Subjects will be offered
      the opportunity to enroll in this longitudinal observational cohort protocol to monitor their
      depression and to assess durability of effect and long-term safety of NSI-189.

      The Enrollment Visit begins when informed consent is signed.The duration of the follow-up
      period will be up to 6 months, until the start of a new antidepressant treatment. Subjects
      who provide consent will be seen for in-person visits every 8 weeks, with bi-monthly phone
      visits occurring between in-person visits. Safety assessments and efficacy assessments will
      be performed at each visit. No study drug will be taken during the Longitudinal Observational
      Cohort study.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine the durability of effect of NSI-189 phosphate compared to placebo in subjects with Major Depressive Disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5TH EDITION). Durability of effect is defined as the time until the start of a new antidepressant treatment (ADT).</description>

    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the continued Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) response and remission rates of subjects treated with NSI-189 to those of subjects assigned to placebo. Response is defined as a 50% or greater reduction from baseline to endpoint on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Remission is defined as an endpoint MADRS total score of 10. The duration of 50% or greater reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score sustained following treatment will be noted.</description>
