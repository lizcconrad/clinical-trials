  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of volasertib in two dosing schedules of
      intravenous volasertib as monotherapy or in combination with azacitidine in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after hypomethylating agents (HMA) treatment failure.
