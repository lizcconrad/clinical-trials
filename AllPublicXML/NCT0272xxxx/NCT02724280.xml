    <textblock>
      H. pylori infection plays a very important role in gastric carcinogenesis, progressing from
      chronic gastritis through atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and finally
      cancer. It is difficult to diagnose H. pylori related gastritis and gastric atrophy on the
      basis of endoscopic findings. Histology is currently considered to be the gold standard for
      detecting H. pylori infection. The reliability of detecting H. pylori infection
      histologically depends on the site, number, and size of gastric biopsy specimens. The blind
      biopsy sampling of normal appearing mucosa has the risk of missing pathology and sampling
      errors. Most studies conclude that as well as on expertise in staining and visualizing the
      bacteria. Considerable error also occurs in identifying gastric atrophy using blind biopsy
      sampling, and neither the original nor the revised version of the Sydney system reliably
      identifies more than half the cases in patients with confirmed gastric atrophy.

      NBI is the most widely used system among several available image enhanced endoscopy systems.
      However, this technique has limitations such as dark imaging of distant lesions because of
      narrow-band illumination. Blue Laser Imaging (BLI) was developed to compensate for these
      inherent limitations of NBI. BLI uses narrow-band laser light combined with white light. This
      combination results in a bright image of the digestive mucosa, enabling the detailed
      visualization of both the microstructure and the microvasculature. However, BLI still is not
      able to obtain sufficient brightness for distant lesions. The newly developed Linked Color
      Imaging (LCI) system (FUJIFILM Co.) creates clear and bright endoscopic images by using
      short-wavelength narrow-band laser light combined with white laser light on the basis of BLI
      technology. This system can obtain bright endoscopic images even at a distant view because
      LCI has more intense white light than the short-wavelength narrow-band laser light.
      Short-wavelength narrow-band laser light enhances the vessels on the mucosal surface and the
      patterns of the mucosa, which means that BLI enables a clearer visualization of microvascular
      structures than does LCI. In contrast, LCI enhances differences in hue, in the red region of
      the spectrum, through digital processing. This makes red areas appear redder and white areas
      appear whiter. Thus, it is easier to recognize a slight difference in color of the mucosa.
      Therefore, LCI may facilitate the detection of H. pylori infection and gastric atrophy.
      Further studies are needed to confirm the utility of LCI.

        Two groups patients with the indications for gastroduodenoscopy will be selected randomly.
        Functional dyspepsia will be considered according to the Rome III. Criteria. It will
        include Epigastric pain Syndrome defined as located pain or burning in the upper abdomen,
        at least once a week, intermittent, not generalized, not relieved by defecation and without
        criteria of gall bladder or sphincter of Oddi pathology; and Postprandial distress Syndrome
        defined as the presence of one or both conditions including nagging feeling of postprandial
        fullness after normal volume meals, several times a week and early satiety that prevents
        the completion of a regular meal, several times a week. The criteria must be present in the
        last three months and have started at least 6 months before diagnosis.
