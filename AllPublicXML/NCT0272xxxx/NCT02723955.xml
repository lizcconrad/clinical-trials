  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3359609 is an anti-Inducible T cell Co-Stimulator (ICOS) receptor agonist antibody
      intended for the treatment of cancers of different histology. This is a first-time-in-human
      (FTIH), open-label, multicenter study designed to investigate the safety, pharmacology, and
      preliminary antitumor activity in subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors with the
      aim to establish recommended dose(s) of GSK3359609 for further exploration as monotherapy and
      in combination with pembrolizumab or other immune therapies or anticancer therapies. The
      study is comprised of two primary parts, each composed of two phases: Part 1: GSK3359609
      monotherapy with Part 1A as dose escalation phase and Part 1B as cohort expansion phase; Part
      2: GSK3359609 combination therapy with Part 2A pembrolizumab combination dose escalation
      phase/safety run-in and Part 2B cohort expansion phase. GSK3359609 combinations with
      chemotherapy will only consist of safety run-in cohorts. Each part and phase of the study
      includes a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. The primary
      objective of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose or
      the maximum administered dose of GSK3359609 alone or in combination.

             if the subject is on a stable dose.

          -  Condition requiring treatment with strong inhibitors/inducers of cytochrome p450 (CYP)
             3C4 within 7 days prior to first dose of chemotherapy (requirement applies to subjects

             asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases, or otherwise stable chronic liver disease
             per investigator assessment).

          -  Recent history (within the past 6 months) of acute diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel

             live vaccine within 4 weeks.

          -  Receipt of any live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  History or evidence of cardiac abnormalities.

          -  History of (current and past) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (for past
             pneumonitis exclusion only if steroids were required for treatment), interstitial lung
             disease, or organizing pneumonia. Note: post-radiation changes in the lung related to
             prior radiotherapy and/or asymptomatic radiation-induced pneumonitis not requiring
             treatment may be permitted if agreed by the investigator and Medical Monitor.

          -  Recent history (within 6 months) of uncontrolled symptomatic ascites or pleural
             effusions.

          -  Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder, or other
