  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of Kalydeco®
      (ivacaftor) in US CF patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation &lt;18 years of age and to describe
      the long-term safety and effectiveness of Kalydeco in CF patients with the R117H-CFTR
      mutation overall and in patients ≥18 years. The long-term safety and effectiveness of
      Kalydeco will be examined in totality through the evaluation of the primary outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient follow-up (i.e., collection of outcomes data after treatment initiation) in the
      Non-Interventional Cohort will be at least 36 months. The study also includes retrieval of
      retrospective data entered into the registry for 36 months before the initiation of Kalydeco
      treatment, from patients matched for Non-Interventional Cohorts. This will permit a
      within-group comparison of outcomes before and after Kalydeco treatment for effectiveness and
      safety. The interventional cohort will not be utilized.
