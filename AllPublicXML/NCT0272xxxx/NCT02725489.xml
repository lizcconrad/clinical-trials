  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about Vigil and durvalumab in advanced
      women's cancers: 1) how much of Vigil in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) can be given
      with an acceptable level of side effects, 2) the effects of Vigil and durvalumab in
      combination (good and bad), 3) if Vigil will cause changes in cancer cells that may help
      durvalumab attack the cancer, and 4) whether or not Vigil and durvalumab will slow your
      cancer or stop your cancer from getting worse.

      Combining Vigil with durvalumab will allow the former to induce (or increase) the
      infiltration of activated T cells into tumors, and in addition, to enhance PD-L1 (programmed
      cell death ligand 1) expression. Consequently, the response rate of historically low or
      un-responsive cancer will be increased with the combination of Vigil and anti PD-L1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the
      combination of Vigil autologous tumor cell immunotherapy and durvalumab PD-L1 inhibitor in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic women's cancers, inclusive, but not limited to
      breast, ovarian, cervical, uterine, fallopian, primary peritoneal, and endometrial regardless
      of the number of prior therapies.

      Patients undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy, palliative resection,
      thoracentesis of malignant pleural effusion, or others) will have tumor tissue procured for
      manufacture of Vigil immunotherapy. This will be a 2-part study. The first part will be a
      safety run-in comprised of 2 cohorts that will use a 3 + 3 design to determine the Vigil dose
      in Part 2. Patients in Cohort 1 will receive a low dose of Vigil (1x10^6 cells/intradermal
      (ID) injection) in combination with durvalumab (1500 mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes)
      every 4 weeks. Patients in Cohort 2 will receive Vigil at 1x10^7 cells/ID injection and
      durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. If needed, patients in
      Cohort -1 will receive Vigil at 1x10^5 cells/ID injection and durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg)
      IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. The enrollment of the first two patients in each Cohort of
      Part 1 will be staggered by 2 weeks. In Part 2 of the study, patients meeting study
      eligibility criteria will receive Vigil at the dose determined in Part 1 and durvalumab
      (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks.

      After Vigil manufacturing has occurred, Study Enrollment eligibility will be confirmed by the
      study site. Radiological assessment of tumor response or alternative assessments of disease
      status should be performed at screening, Cycle 3 and every 2 cycle thereafter, and end of
      treatment (EOT) using RECIST 1.1 and investigator assessment as applicable. Tumor biopsy for
      correlative studies including but not limited to scoring of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte
      (TIL) and PD-1 / PD-L1 expression analysis should be obtained at tissue procurement and at
      Cycle 3, and optional biopsies thereafter if the patient has accessible tissue. Peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for correlative studies should be obtained at pre-procurement,
      and prior to study regimen administration at Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 5 and EOT. Patient
      survival will be followed for 1 year after last dose of either Vigil or durvalumab.
