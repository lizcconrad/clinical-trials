      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KRN23 after its 48-week
      once every 4 weeks repeated subcutaneous administration to Japanese and Korean patients with
      Tumor-Induced Osteomalacia or Epidermal Nevus Syndrome by a multicenter, open-label,
      intraindividual dose adjustment study
