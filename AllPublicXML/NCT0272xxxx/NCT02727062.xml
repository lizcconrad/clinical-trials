      This research is being done to evaluate whether or not the Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App (a
      smartphone application) is a feasible and valid tool to assess pain from radiation sores
      (also referred to as &quot;mucositis&quot;) when treating head and neck cancers with radiation. The
      mobile app will be designed to help people better understand the pain from the radiation
      sores.

      OVERVIEW: This is a single-arm, interventional, supportive care clinical trial for patients
      with tumors involving the oral cavity, oropharynx, or unknown primary expecting to receive at
      least a 50 Gy dose of definitive radiation therapy. This will generate preliminary data to
      test the feasibility, validity and the clinical usefulness of the smartphone pain App in
      recording and reporting radiation-induced oral mucositis pain.

      OM PAIN APP (DESCRIPTION): The Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App (the App) is a smartphone
      application that was designed to permit patients to key in pain severity, using a visual
      analog 0-10 scale. The App is programed with an alarm to prompt the patient to record pain
      severity at prescribed intervals daily and through spontaneous patient input. Data collected
      on each patient's smartphone can be backed up wirelessly to a central server where the data
      can be analyzed remotely or data can be viewed on the device. The software is capable of
      generating a time-weighted measure of pain, total area under the pain cure (AUC), a summary
      measure that integrates serial assessments of a patient's pain over the duration of the
      study.

      DAILY INTERVENTION: Subjects will receive a preprogrammed alarm four times a day from their
      smartphones prompting them to directly enter OM pain levels on the device. Patients may
      submit as many pain entries as they wish beyond the four minimum levels. Data recording will
      not commence until radiation starts. Because symptoms of mucositis do not commence typically
      until the third week of radiation therapy, and no sooner than week 2, recordings from week 1
      will be used for baseline data. Recording of data will cease four weeks after the end of
      radiation therapy at which time mucositis symptoms typically start to resolve and pain
      symptoms substantially abate.

      ACCELEROMETER: Each patient will be issued an accelerometer and will be encouraged to wear it
      continuously during the study period. To help determine whether decline in physical activity
      is associated with severity of pain, physical activity will be assessed directly with
      accelerometers (activity monitor). Participants will wear an accelerometerduring sleep and
      waking hours, but not while bathing, starting one week prior to the start radiation therapy.
      Accelerometer output data will be obtained in 1-minute epochs that will be then summed to
      provide raw daily average activity units, which will be subsequently divided by 1000 for
      clarity. Data will by synced weekly by the study coordinator to a computer connected to a
      central server.

    <measure>Validity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare pain scores from the OM Pain App, as determined by area under the curve (AUC) measurement, in patients at high risk for severe oral mucositis (radiation plus concurrent chemo--RT/CT) versus patients at low risk for severe oral mucositis (radiation alone--RT). Because patients with severe oral mucositis experience worse pain than patients with mild mucositis, RT/CT patient would be expected to have significantly higher AUC than patients who receive RT alone. The validity of the OM Pain App will also be tested by comparing a standardized pain assessment tool (Brief Pain Inventory-BPI) and the OM Pain App to discriminate pain in subgroups determined by severity of pain scores, dose of radiation, and anatomic site of disease.</description>
