  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety and pharmacokinetics study of MK-4280 as monotherapy and in combination with
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with metastatic solid tumors for which there is no
      available therapy which may convey clinical benefit. Part A of this study is a dose
      escalation design in which participants receive MK-4280 as monotherapy or MK-4280 in
      combination with pembrolizumab. Part B is a dose confirmation design to estimate the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) for MK-4280 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants
      with advanced solid tumors.

             (irRECIST) 1.1 criteria.

          -  Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Scale.

          -  Demonstrates adequate organ function

          -  If female of child-bearing potential, is willing to use an adequate method of

          -  If male with a female partner(s) of child-bearing potential, must agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through
             120 days after the last dose of study drug. Males with pregnant partners must agree to

             partner.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the first dose of study drug, or has not recovered to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 0 or 1 from the AEs due to cancer therapeutics
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier (this includes participants with previous
             immunomodulatory therapy with residual immune-related [ir]AEs).

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study

          -  Is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while on study.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy

             skin, superficial bladder cancer or in situ cervical cancer, or other in situ cancers.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis.

          -  Has had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal
             antibody.

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.

          -  Has an active infection requiring therapy.

          -  Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

          -  Has had a prior stem cell or bone marrow transplant.

          -  Has a known history of or screens positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
             active chronic or acute Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the study.

          -  Is a regular user as determined by investigator judgment (including &quot;recreational
             use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or has a recent history (within the last year) of substance
             abuse (including alcohol), at the time of signing informed consent.

          -  Has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A participant who is clinically stable
             following treatment for these conditions (including therapeutic thoraco- or
             paracentesis) is eligible.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Has clinically significant heart disease that affects normal activities.

          -  Has had major surgery in the past 4 weeks.

          -  Has received a live-virus vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study drug.
