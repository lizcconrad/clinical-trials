      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (which will be the dose
      recommended for a Phase 2 study), safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile (study of
      movement of the drug within the body, including absorption and distribution) of the study
      drug, BNC101 when administered intravenously as a single agent or in combination with
      chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed at least 1 or 2
      lines of chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed written Informed Consent

          2. Age &gt; 18 years

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0 - 1.

          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal cancer patients who have failed
             at least 2 lines of chemotherapy (monotherapy treatment cohorts) or at least 1 line of
             chemotherapy (combination treatment cohorts) for metastatic disease, and in the
             opinion of both physician and patient it is not unreasonable to try experimental
             therapy. Adjuvant FOLFOX within the last 6 months is considered a line of therapy. A
             maintenance strategy post 1st line treatment is not considered as an additional line
             of therapy.

          5. Patients must have accessible tumor lesions amenable to biopsy which would not put the
             patient or their treatment at risk. Patients in monotherapy escalation cohort 3 and

             agree and are willing to provide 2 serial tumor lesion biopsies (a minimum of 2 fresh
             cores/punches preferred whenever possible). Biopsies can be from liver metastases, in
             lieu of the primary tumor. The presence of tumor tissue in fresh biopsies is to be
             certified by a trained pathologist using appropriate extemporaneous histology or
             cytology procedures. Refer to Appendix 6 for biopsy procedures.

          6. All AEs of any prior chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy, must have resolved to
             Grade ≤ 1.

          7. Measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST version 1.1.

             institutional ULN (for subjects with hepatic involvement &lt; 5 x institutional ULN but
             cannot be associated with elevated bilirubin).

        diarrhea) that are completely resolved for at least 2 weeks prior to starting study
        treatment is allowed.

        17. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of
        childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective

             or pleural effusion) that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior
             to study entry.

          9. Any uncontrolled medical or psychiatric risk factors which would contraindicate the
             use or impair the ability of the patient to provide informed consent, receive protocol
             therapy or may impose excessive risk to the patient.

         10. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases, unless previously treated and well-controlled
