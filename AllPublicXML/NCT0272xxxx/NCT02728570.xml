  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have hypothesized that dietary flavonoids reduce insulin resistance and
      subclinical inflammation secondary to reductions in intestinal inflammation and permeability
      and that these events are mediated through alterations in gut microbiota composition. To test
      this hypothesis, 30 overweight/obese men and women will be provided two well-controlled diets
      that are identical in macronutrient content (Protein, 17% en; Fat, 30% en; Carbohydrate, 53%
      en), but differ markedly in flavonoid content (Low Flavonoid Diet, 10 mg/1000 Kcals; High
      Flavonoid Diet, 340 mg/1000 Kcals). All meals for both diets will be prepared and fed for 6
      weeks each in a randomized cross-over design with endpoints determined in duplicate during
      the last week of each diet period.
