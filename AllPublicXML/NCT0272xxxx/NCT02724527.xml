  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cavosonstat (N91115) is being studied as a potential novel therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF),
      and this study assesses a target population of patients who are heterozygous for F508del-CFTR
      and a gating mutation that is approved for treatment with ivacaftor (G551D, G1244E, G1349D,
      G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R).

      Assess the effect of Cavosonstat (N91115) on lung function when added to preexisting
      treatment with ivacaftor in adult patients with CF who are heterozygous for F508del-CFTR and
      a gating mutation that is approved for treatment with ivacaftor (G551D, G1244E, G1349D,
      G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R).
