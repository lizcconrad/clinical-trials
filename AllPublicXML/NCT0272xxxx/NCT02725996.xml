      To prove that the efficacy and safety of 'NK group' is superior to 'non-treatment
      group(Control group)' in patient undergone curative resection(RFA or operation) for
      hepatocellular carcinoma in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No adjuvant therapy has been shown to extend the survival of patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma receiving curative treatment.We investigated whether injections of NK cells
      prolongs recurrence-free survival of patients after curative therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior to the test, patient is fully explained about the purpose/ contents and
             characteristics of the testing medication, and the patient him(her)self, the guardian
             or the legal representative signed on written consent.

          2. Gender unlimited, age from 18 years to 70 years

          3. The patient is diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma by pathological/ radiological
             test and he (she) is in the stage of I or II. (refer to the attached file 10).
             Hepatocellular carcinoma should be shown by radiological test; on dynamic CT, dynamic
             MRI or on angiography.

          4. Child-Pugh Score should be less than 6

          5. No matter how the patient has been treated before, his (her) tumor should be totally
             removed by curative resection (RFA or operation). (based on the agreement date for
             written consent)

          6. Patients must have adequate cardiac function(no cardiac disease, LVEF≥40% ), adequate
             pulmonary function as indicated by room air oxygen saturation of &gt;94%, and adequate
             renal function(Cr≤133umol/L).

          7. Patient's remaining life-time should be expected at least more than 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been transferred by pathological/ radiological test
             (Stage III or Stage IV, refer to the exhibit 10)

          2. The carcinoma has been invaded to main portal vein or major branch hepatic vein

          3. Child-Pugh score is over 6

          4. Patient has serious problem with pulmonary function by sub- investigator's opinion

          5. Patient who has disease history of immune deficiency

          6. Diagnosed as an immune deficiency patient

          7. Patient who has disease history of malignant tumor within 5 years before this clinical
             trial.

          8. Patient who had anti-cancer medication before the clinical trial

          9. Patient has serious allergic-history by sub- investigator's opinion

         10. Patient has serious mental disease by sub- investigator's opinion

         11. Pregnant women, nursing mother or having intention of being pregnant during the
             clinical test

         12. Patient who participated in other clinical trial within 4 weeks before this clinical
             trial

         13. Patient who is incongruent to this clinical trial by sub- investigator's opinion.
