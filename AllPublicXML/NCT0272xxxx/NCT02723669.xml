      An Open Label, Randomized, Two-Arm, Single-Dose, Two-Period, Crossover Study Relative
      Bioavailability Study. The present study is intended to compare and evaluate the relative
      bioavailability of a single 11 gram dose of AR10 (acetylcysteine effervescent tablets for
      oral solution (two 0.5 g and four 2.5 g]), and the reference Listed Drug (acetylcysteine
      solution; oral 20% [200 mg/mL] of American Pharmaceutical Partners) in healthy adult, human
      subjects under fasting conditions. A balanced block randomization schedule will be generated
      before the start of dosing.

          -  Body weight at least 154 pounds (70 kg) and a Body Mass Index no greater than 30
             kg/m2.

          -  Healthy as determined by medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory
             examination performed within 30 days prior to admission for the first period of the
             study.

             intrauterine devices, implantable devices, and barrier methods. If a barrier method is
             chosen, a double barrier (e.g., condom plus foam) is required.

          -  Requirement of special diet preventing consumption of standard, healthy meals during
             the in-clinic portions of the study. In such cases, subject selection will be at the
