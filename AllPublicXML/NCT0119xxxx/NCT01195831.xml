    <description>Investigators made a global assessment of the disease severity by use of a 6-point scale (Clear, Minimal, Mild, Moderate, Severe and Very Severe). Patients with disease severity classified as Clear or Minimal disease after the treatment period (week 4) were rated as having Controlled disease.</description>

    <measure>Patients With Success (Total Sign Score ≤1) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators assessed scalp psoriasis lesions in terms of three clinical signs: redness, thickness and scaliness. For each clinical sign a single score, reflecting the average severity of all lesions on the scalp, was derived according to a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0= best;4= worst). The sum of the three individual scores (redness, thickness and scaliness) constituted a Total Sign Score of the scalp ranging from 0 to 12 (0= best;12= worst). Patients with a Total sign score of 0 or 1 at week 4 achieved &quot;Success&quot;.</description>

        <description>Investigators assessed scalp psoriasis lesions in terms of three clinical signs: redness, thickness and scaliness. For each clinical sign a single score, reflecting the average severity of all lesions on the scalp, was derived according to a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0= best;4= worst). The sum of the three individual scores (redness, thickness and scaliness) constituted a Total Sign Score of the scalp ranging from 0 to 12 (0= best;12= worst). Patients with a Total sign score of 0 or 1 at week 4 achieved &quot;Success&quot;.</description>
