  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we are looking at another type of radiation called proton radiation
      which is known to spare surrounding normal tissues from radiation. The proton radiation will
      be delivered using fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) to improve localization of
      the small tumor target. Proton radiation delivers minimal radiation beyond the area of the
      tumor. This may reduce side effects that patients would normally experience with conventional
      radiation therapy. In this research study, we are looking to determine the effects of
      fractionated proton radiotherapy on long-term hearing preservation and controlling tumor
      growth.

      -  Proton radiation will be delivered daily for approximately 5.5 weeks. Participants will
           be assessed weekly for any side effects they may be experiencing.

        -  Participants will have a follow-up visit 6 months after their last proton radiation
           treatment and then every year from the time of treatment completion for 5 years. The
           following tests and procedures will be performed at these visits: medical history,
           physical exam, MRI scan, comprehensive hearing tests and a questionnaire.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MRI confirmed unilateral vestibular schwannoma within 8 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Measurable disease, defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension

          -  No prior radiotherapy with dose delivered to structures in proximity to the internal
             acoustic canal is allowable

          -  Participants must have baseline &quot;useful hearing&quot; defined at the discretion of the
             treating physician in the irradiated ear

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 60 months

          -  Karnofsky performance status 60 or greater

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             during the interval of irradiation

          -  Able to tolerate the supine position as required for the radiation treatment unit and
             able to tolerate rotation needed for treatment delivery

          -  Willing and able to comply with comprehensive audiologic testing, at baseline prior to
             radiation therapy, at 6 months from treatment completion, and at annual timepoints for
             5 years after completion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had prior radiotherapy, with dose delivered to structures in
             proximity to the internal acoustic canal

          -  Participants with tumors (or residual tumor after surgery) measuring &gt; 3cm in greatest
             dimension

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents

          -  History of adverse reaction to radiotherapy

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are known to cause
             ototoxicity are ineligible

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Individuals with a history of malignancy are ineligible except for the following
             circumstances. Individuals with a history of malignancies are eligible if they have
             been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be a low
             risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are
             eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ,
             and basal cell squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy

          -  Patients with co-existing major ear disease, such as chronic otitis, Menieres disease,
             or otosclerosis
