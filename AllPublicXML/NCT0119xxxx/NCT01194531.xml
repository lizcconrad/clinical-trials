  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natera is recruiting patients for a research study evaluating pregnancy and implantation
      rates in women undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Preimplantation Genetic Screening
      (PGS). PGS is also referred to as Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) for aneuploidy.

      Healthy women undergoing IVF who are between the ages of 35 to 42 years are being recruited
      to participate in a randomized study.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether PGS- testing of embryos created during IVF
      for chromosomal abnormalities, prior to transfer to the uterus- improves pregnancy and
      implantation rates in patients when compared to patients whose embryos are not tested. PGS
      will be conducted using 24 Chromosome Aneuploidy Screening with Parental Support from Natera.

      All subjects who qualify and enroll will receive discounted IVF medications (both TEST and
      CONTROL arms). If you become pregnant during the study, you will receive a small payment for
      providing information about your pregnancy and birth. If you are assigned to the TEST arm of
      the study you will receive free PGS.

      If you meet the criteria below, you may be a candidate for this study. To participate in the
      study you must:

        -  Be a healthy, pre-menopausal female, 35-42 years of age

        -  Have a history of less than 3 consecutive miscarriages and no more than one failed IVF
           cycle

        -  Agree to use Ferring Pharmaceutical products during stimulation

        -  Agree to be randomly assigned to either the arm of the study receiving PGS (TEST arm)or
           the arm receiving no additional testing (CONTROL arm)

      Additional screening will be conducted to determine if you are eligible to enroll.

      All subjects who qualify and enroll will receive discounted IVF medications. If you become
      pregnant during the study, you will receive a small payment for providing information about
      your pregnancy and birth. If you are assigned to the TEST arm of the study you will receive
      free PGS.
