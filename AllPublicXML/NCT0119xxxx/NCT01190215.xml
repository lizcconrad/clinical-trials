        <description>A seroconverted subject for neutralising antibodies was a subject with a minimum 4-fold increase in titre at post-vaccination.
Fluarix vaccine strains were Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Perth/16/09 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008.
At Month 6, only data for the Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) strain were presented for the Havrix Group.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for antibody persistence at Month 6 which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available at Month 6.</population>
