      BACKGROUND: Since 1996 the combination of three or more drugs has been the mainstay of human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. The most important types of drugs are called
      nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) Response to treatment is measured as
      increasing CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load. A major problem is the development
      of resistance. NNRTIs are recommended as part of first-line treatment of HIV in Africa but
      many Africans have a slower NNRTI clearance than Caucasians making them more susceptible for
      development of resistance in case of treatment interruptions. PIs might therefore be a better
      option in an African setting with low adherence.

      AIM: To evaluate two different treatment regimens in HIV-1 infected patients:

      A) A NNRTI (efavirenz/nevirapine) based regimen and B) A PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir)
      based regimen with regard to treatment outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment with a PI will be
      superior to treatment with a NNRTI due to less development of resistance.

      METHODS: Treatment-naïve adult HIV-1 patients enrolled in an existing cohort The West African
      Retrovirus and Acquired Immune Deficiency (WARAID) cohort in Guinea Bissau with CD4+ cell
      count ≤ 350 cells/µL and/or clinical signs of immune suppression (World Health Organization
      (WHO) clinical stage 3 or 4) will be randomised 1:1 to: Treatment A: 2 NRTIs (lamivudine and
      either zidovudine or stavudine) and 1 NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or Treatment B: 2 NRTIs
      (same as in treatment A) and 1 PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir). Primary outcome: Viral load
      suppression &lt;400 copies/ml 12 months after enrolment.

      PERSPECTIVES: Guidelines for treatment of HIV in Africa are more or less a copy of the
      guidelines used in Europe and North America. Genetic differences in pharmacokinetics, more
      women infected in Africa and difficulties ensuring good adherence mean that results obtained
      from Caucasian patients are not directly transferrable to African patients. The results of
      this study will hopefully help guiding the treatment of HIV in Africa in the future. The
      investigators believe the HIV infected people in West Africa deserve the same evidence-based
      medicine as in developed countries.

Pregnant patients and female patients with a child bearing potential will be treated with nevirapine if CD4+ cell count is ≤ 350 cells/mm3 with close monitoring of liver enzymes during the first 12 weeks in patients with CD4+ cell count &gt;250 cells/mm3. Females beyond childbearing age will be treated with efavirenz.</description>
