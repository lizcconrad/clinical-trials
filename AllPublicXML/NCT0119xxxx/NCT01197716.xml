    <textblock>
      The Chest Pain Unit (CPU) register is a nationwide scientific investigation, in which data
      concerning the hospital-stay within the Chest Pain Unit are documented. Furthermore, a
      Follow-up via telephone is conducted after 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of a Chest Pain Unit (CPU) is to clarify unclear chest pain quickly and specifically.
      Present data from Germany, the USA and England prove that the organisation models of a CPU
      lead beside a drastic reduction of mortality also to a cost reduction as well as a shortening
      of the average inpatient hospital stays.

      Therefore it seems reasonable to assign a minimum standard to CPUs. Although there are
      internationally already standards for CPUs up to complete certification programmes, it is an
      explicit wish of the German society for cardiology (DGK) to create an own standard which
      considers on the national circumstances.

      The aim of the CPU register is the internal and external validation of the care quality of
      CPU including Benchmark reports and risk-adjusted comparisons.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients that are admitted to a Chest Pain Unit are included in this register.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Missing informed consent (informed consent can NOT be given in the acute phase of the
        disease, if consciousness is limited at that time; instead the patient will be asked for
        his consent at a later point of time, when he is fully conscious).
