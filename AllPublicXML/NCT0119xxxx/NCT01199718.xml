  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study of oral CX-4945 is designed to test the safety, tolerability, and highest
      safe dose level of this CK2 inhibitor in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated CK2 activity has been associated with malignant transformation and aggressive tumor
      growth. Over expression of CK2 has been documented in multiple types of cancers, including
      multiple myeloma, and inhibition of CK2 represents a potential therapeutic strategy to target
      a specific molecular defect perpetuating many cancers. CX-4945 has demonstrated potent
      inhibition of CK2 enzymatic activity. This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamic effects of CX-4945 when administered to patients with multiple myeloma.
