    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if quantitative Dynamic contrast-enhanced
      magnetic resonance (DCE MR) perfusion imaging accurately quantifies right and left pulmonary
      artery blood flow as compared with phase contrast flow velocity mapping (PC), the current
      gold standard of flow volume measurements.

    <textblock>
      Many conditions of the heart or the lungs lead to differences in how the blood is pumped to
      the lungs. Specifically, some areas of the lung may receive less blood supply than others. We
      would like to do a research study in children and adolescents who have a heart condition or a
      chronic or stable lung condition. We are doing this study to see if measuring the circulation
      of blood in the lungs in children is possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a
      special dye (contrast medium) injection called MagnevistÂ®.

    <description>An MRI is done using the phase contrast flow velocity mapping (PC)technique. Using PC, an imaging slice is prescribed perpendicular to the vessel's course. Within the pulmonary circulation, PC can quantify total pulmonary blood flow and the right / left distribution of the lung blood flow volume.</description>

    <description>Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE MR) perfusion imaging imaging is a non-invasive method to quantify regional pulmonary blood flow. A bolus of gadolinium-containing contrast medium is injected and its passage through the pulmonary circulation traced using a repetitive rapid three-dimensional (3D) T1 weighted angiography sequence.</description>
