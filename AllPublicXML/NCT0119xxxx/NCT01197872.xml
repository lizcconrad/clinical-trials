  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gene Security Network has developed a novel technology called Parental Support (PS) which is
      used for Preimplantation Genetic Screening/Diagnosis (PGS/D) during in vitro fertilization
      (IVF). This technology allows IVF physicians to identify embryos, prior to transfer to the
      uterus, which have the best chance of developing into healthy children.

      This study follows previous IRB approved study IVF008: Clinical Use of Parental Support To
      Detect Single Gene Mutations , which we will refer to as &quot;Phase I&quot;.

      The purpose of Phase I was to validate clinical use of PS to detect specific genetic
      mutation(s) known to cause severe inheritable diseases in embryos produced by at-risk
      couples, while simultaneously testing these embryos for aneuploidy. The Phase I study
      consisted of first of its kind PGS/D testing to detect disease-associated genetic mutations
      together with aneuploidy screening.

      This study, which we will call &quot;Phase II&quot;, will allow patients to continue to access testing
      while clinical data is collected on Phase I. Phase I of the study is nearing enrollment
      targets (40+ participating couples) and Phase I enrollment will be closed while subjects
      complete testing and study data is collected from pregnancies and livebirths. Phase II will
      allow: 1) additional data collection prior to commercial testing launch, 2) eligible patients
      to participate and receive testing.

        Couples in which both parents are carriers or one parent is affected by an inherited
        condition that they are at risk of passing on to their offspring. These couples must be
        planning to use In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        At risk couple (mother and father) who are:

          -  Able to provide laboratory report from commercial CLIA certified laboratory in the
             United States or legitimate non-US laboratory confirming presence of disease
             associated mutation in mother and/or father

          -  Planning to go through IVF and desiring PGD for the specified mutation

          -  Planning to pursue Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) or Amniocentesis if pregnancy
             occurs and willing/able to provide CVS/ Amniocentesis sample to GSN for confirmatory
             testing or provide test results of confirmatory testing performed by an external
             laboratory.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Couples without prior documentation of genetic mutation as specified above

          -  Couples where the male partner is not willing, able, or available to provide a semen
             sample

          -  Unwilling to have CVS/ Amniocentesis

          -  In certain cases, unavailability of child sample or other suitable family member:
             Subjects will not be able to enroll in the study if, in the judgment of the research
             staff, validation is first required on a child (offspring of male and female subject)
             and there is no child or other family member that is a suitable substitute available
             for testing.
