    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and tolerability of four new
      investigational Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccines (Towne-Toledo 1, 2, 3, 4) in healthy male
      volunteers who are CMV negative. CMV is a common virus, infecting 50-80% of adults in the
      United States by the age of twenty-one. CMV does not usually cause illness in adults or
      children. However, CMV can be a cause of deafness and mental retardation in a child if a
      mother is infected during pregnancy. It also can be a serious illness in patients with
      impaired immunity (decreased ability to fight infection).

      A total of thirty six participants will be enrolled. The first 12 participants will be
      randomized into four groups. Four groups will receive one of the four investigational
      vaccines. The four investigational HCMV vaccine candidates will be administered
      subcutaneously to 3 volunteers at 10 pfu (the lowest dose to be used). The safety and
      tolerability of the four investigational HCMV vaccine candidates will be monitored closely
      for a period of 12 weeks following vaccination at this dose. Investigational vaccines that
      are found to be safe and well tolerated at a dose of 10pfu will be administered to 3
      additional individuals at 102 pfu and then at 103 pfu. Safety and tolerability will be
      evaluated at each dose level by monitoring clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters
      and virus detection in the blood, urine, and saliva. After the 12-week safety-monitoring
      period, participants will be followed for the remainder of one year to assess long-term
      safety and immunogenicity of the investigational vaccines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a) Healthy male adult, between the ages of 30 to 50 years with no children &lt;18 years
             of age at home and in a stable sexual or household relationship with an individual who
             must be CMV seropositive, non-pregnant, not planning a pregnancy within one year and
             not currently breastfeeding.

             b) HCMV seronegative. c) HIV seronegative. d) Hepatitis B surface antigen negative. e)
             No evidence of active hepatitis C infection by serologic evaluation. f) HCMV culture
             negative (to be determined by shell vial or routine culture of urine, blood and saliva
             collected at the screening visit).

             g) Agrees to abstain from sex or to use condoms during intercourse for 52 weeks
             following vaccination.

             h) Available by telephone or pager for one year following vaccination. i) Willing and
             able to comply with the requirements of the protocol and to properly complete
             participant diaries.

             j) Signed informed consent and completed social/demographic questionnaire. k) Willing
             to forego blood, bone marrow or whole organ donation for 1year post vaccination.

             l) Willing to forego enrollment in studies of other investigational agents for one
             year following vaccination.
