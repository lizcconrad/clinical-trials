  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently marketed CGM sensors have an approved functional lifetime of up to 1 week.
      Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that GluSense-LTone 2e3 sensors may be used to
      accurately monitor glucose levels for 30 days. The purpose of this study is to assess the
      safety and functionality of the device in human patients for consecutive 15 days.

      GluSense-LTone 2e3 as long term CGM, will require less sensor replacements and calibration,
      meaning less patient interventions, and is therefore will be much more user friendly.
      Moreover, GluSense-LTone 2e3 shows potentially increased accuracy, especially in the
      critically important hypoglycemic range, meaning that better management of patient's
      condition may be attained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GluSense-LTone 2e3 is a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. It is a semi-invasive,
      optical fiber-based device with a lifetime of up to one month. The purpose of this study is
      to assess the safety, accuracy, calibration requirements and effective lifetime of the
      device.

        Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this
        study:

          -  Clinical significant illness that can compromise patient's health during study such
             as:

               -  Significant current heart disease

               -  Significant Liver or kidney disease

               -  HIV infection

               -  Significant allergic disorders

          -  Current or recent significant skin conditions (e.g. eczema, psoriasis,).

          -  Presence of skin markings/ abnormalities around implantation site that will interfere
             with the skin assessment e.g. tattoos, piercings, birthmark, sunburn

          -  Current alcohol or substance use judged by the IP to potentially interfere with
             patient study compliance.

          -  Routine administration of Steroid based medications.

          -  Patients currently taking part in any other clinical trial using an investigational
             product within the last 3 months
