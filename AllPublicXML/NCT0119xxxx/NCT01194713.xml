      Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurodegeneration of the brain in
      the form of neurofibrillary tangles and plaques containing the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta).
      Recent animal studies have shown that extended wakefulness is associated with increased
      production of these Abeta proteins and that sleep leads to a marked fall in their production.

      Aim: The investigators aim to distinguish a similar effect of sleep disturbance on
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta levels in humans, which may point out sleep disturbance as an
      important factor in AD development.

      Methods: a study in 26 healthy male volunteers, measuring CSF Abeta levels during a sleep
      deprivation night and before and after a control night with unrestricted sleep.

      Expected results: The investigators expect sleep deprivation to lead to an increase in CSF
      Abeta levels, as compared to the levels in the control night.
