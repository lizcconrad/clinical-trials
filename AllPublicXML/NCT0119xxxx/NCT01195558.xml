    <textblock>
      Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (Non-24) is a condition experienced primarily by totally
      blind individuals that results in abnormal night sleep patterns and chronic daytime
      sleepiness. This is a research protocol to develop a patient registry of subjects who may
      suffer from Non-24 and who are blind. Subjects participate in the study through a phone
      survey. This registry will be used to better understand, sleep related problems in blind
      individuals, including the investigation of a potential treatment, recruitment for future
      clinical studies, and to provide a forum for raising awareness about Non-24. The survey
      consists of questions regarding the degree of vision impairment and sleep problems that the
      subjects may be experiencing.
