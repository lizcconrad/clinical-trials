      The goal of this observational study is to assess the efficacy of Realize My Success (RMS),a
      website that allows patients and providers to maintain contact via the website. We will
      compare RMS users on a number of different variables with the goal of identifying which
      variables are associated with optimal outcomes (larger weight losses) at one year (and
      potentially beyond). The study has two primary objectives. The first is to assess changes in
      body weight at postoperative year 1 in frequent v. infrequent RMS users. We predict that
      frequent users will achieve significantly greater reductions in weight at 6 and 12 months
      (and beyond) than infrequent users. The second objective is to assess changes in body weight
      at postoperative year 1 in persons who use different features of the RMS site. We hypothesize
      that persons who, on a regular basis, record their food intake, track their physical activity
      and make specific behavioral goals will experience significantly greater reductions in weight
      beginning 6 months after surgery as compared to those who do not use these features of the
      RMS site.

        Participants will be men and women, 18-65 years old, with a BMI of 40-70 kg/m2 (or 35-70
        kg/m2 in the presence of co-morbidities) who have registered in the RMS system and have log
        into the system at least once postoperatively.
