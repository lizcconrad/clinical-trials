  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence has accumulated that systemic and ocular mechanisms, responsible for regulating
      blood flow in the area of the optic disc, such as reduced ocular perfusion pressure, abnormal
      autoregulation and vascular dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of normal
      tension glaucoma (NTG). Defective cardiovascular neuroregulation has been advocated as a
      possible one of the main systemic contributing factors in the etiology of NTG. Based on the
      results of previous studies, the hypothesis has been posed that patients with NTG have an
      impaired diurnal heart rate variability (HRV) or high activity of the sympathetic component
      of autonomic nervous system (ANS) and endothelial dysfunction. Impaired balance of ANS,
      resulting in increased demand for oxygen in the tissues and subsequent low threshold of
      hypoxia in all organs (including the eye) can be an important link in the pathogenetic
      pathway of NTG, making the optic nerve more sensitive to small and short-term changes in
      perfusion pressure and prone to damage even under a statistically &quot;normal&quot; intraocular
      pressure (IOP).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the activity and characteristics of the following
      systems: the central ANS (through a 24-hour analysis of heart rate variability and blood
      pressure), peripheral vascular system (through the analysis of the post-occlusive hyperemia
      reaction within the distal part of left upper limb) and the local retrobulbar circulation as
      measured by color Doppler imaging (CDI) in patients with NTG and healthy volunteers. The
      correlations between all above systems, as well as between them and the structural and
      functional parameters of the optic nerve, and the retina in both groups will be also
      analyzed.

      Fifty patients with NTG and 50 age and gender-matched control subjects will be recruited. All
      patients will be underwent eye examination (medical history, best corrected visual acuity,
      slit-lamp and stereo optic disc evaluation, Goldmann applanation tonometry, central corneal
      thickness measurement , Humphrey central 24-2 threshold perimetry test and optical coherence
      tomography of the optic nerve head, retinal nerve fibre layer and macula. CDI examination of
      the retrobulbar vessels will be performed. 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram and blood
      pressure monitoring will be performed simultaneously. Time- and frequency-domain measures of
      HRV will be calculated. BP will be measured in 20 minutes intervals during the day and 30
      minutes intervals at night. The occlusive provocative test and finger hyperemia will be
      assessed by two-channels laser-Doppler flowmeter.
