      Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen citrate
      may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells

      This phase IIb trial studies how well low-dose tamoxifen citrate works in reducing breast
      cancer risk in radiation-induced cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of a two-year course of low-dose tamoxifen (tamoxifen citrate)
      administered at 5 mg per day on surrogate endpoint biomarkers of breast cancer (BC) risk,
      including: mammographic breast density (MBD), an established radiographic biomarker of BC
      risk; cytomorphology and proliferative index, tissue biomarkers closely linked to BC risk;
      and sex steroid hormones and insulin growth factors, circulating biomarkers of BC risk.

      II. To establish safety and tolerability of this low-dose tamoxifen regimen, assessing both
      objective measures (lipid profiles, clotting factors and bone metabolism markers) and
      patient-reported outcomes.

      III. To examine the modifying effect of demographic, clinical, and molecular characteristics
      on the risk: benefit ratio from this two-year low dose tamoxifen intervention.

      IV. To explore the relationship between this low-dose tamoxifen regimen and clinical measures
      of efficacy (new breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] diagnoses) and toxicity
      (thromboembolic events, reports of hot flashes and gynecological symptoms, liver function
      abnormalities, and other cancer diagnoses).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive tamoxifen citrate orally (PO) once daily for 24 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO once daily for 24 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 10
      years.

    <description>The number of pills taken out of the total prescribed in a 3-month period will be modeled as a random effects binomial regression model. The binomial rates from 8 time points (month 3-24) will be modeled as unstructured mean model with 7 indicator variables as well as polynomial models over time. The random-intercept and the random intercept and slope models will be considered.

The questionnaire will be administered every 6 months. The responses will be treated as normally distributed, as ordinal or dichotomized variable, and the linear mixed effects of general linear mixed model (GLMM) methods will be applied to compare changes between treatment groups. Piecewise models will also be fitted with join point at 6 months, considering linear and curvilinear trajectories between 6 and 24 month time points.</description>

             leukemia, sarcoma, and Wilms tumor occurring in pediatric patients, and lymphoma,
             leukemia, and sarcoma occurring in young adults; primary cancer therapy must have been
             completed at least 6 months prior to registration

          -  Well-defined menopausal status falling into one of the following categories:

               -  Premenopausal, defined as age at registration 45 years old or younger with
                  regular monthly period for at least 6 consecutive months prior to registration

               -  Postmenopausal, defined as continuous absence of menstruation for 12 months OR
                  status-post bilateral oophorectomy OR follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in
                  the postmenopausal range

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN) other than those listed below diagnosed within 2
             years of study entry; patients with the listed indolent or pre-invasive neoplasms may
             be eligible if diagnosed within 2 years and all treatment was completed at least 6
             months prior to registration:

               -  Non-melanoma cancers of the skin

               -  Thyroid cancer

               -  Cervical cancer confined to the cervix or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
                  (CIN)

               -  Superficial or non-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder

          -  For women with a prior history of DCIS or breast IEN, only one breast could have been
             involved and all therapy must have been completed at least 6 months prior to
             registration; in addition women with a prior history of invasive breast cancer may
             also be eligible, as long as only one breast was involved, they were diagnosed at
             least 2 years prior to study entry, and therapy was completed at least 6 months prior
             to study entry

          -  Bilateral breast implants or status-post bilateral prophylactic mastectomy

          -  Evidence of malignant breast disease on any form of breast imaging; the study only
             requires annual mammography; however, annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             is considered standard of care in this patient population (per Children's Oncology
             Group [COG] or National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] follow-up guidelines), and
             breast ultrasound may be indicated if a palpable lesion is detected on screening
             clinical breast exam; abnormal imaging may require additional radiographs and/or
             breast biopsy; patients who are found to have benign breast disease with or without
             atypia may continue on study as long as there is no evidence of malignancy; if there
             is evidence of malignancy, and only one breast is involved, they may be reapproached 6

          -  Baseline categorical mammographic density scored as BIRAD 1, or extremely fatty, in
             both breasts; if the patient has a prior history of IEN (DCIS, LCIS, or atypical
             hyperplasia), the contralateral breast must not have a mammographic density score of
             BIRAD 1; this determination will be made at the local site

          -  Current or recent use (within 6 months of registration or baseline mammogram,
             whichever is first) of any of the following: systemic hormone replacement therapy
             (includes oral or transdermal formulations); Vagifem and Estring, two formulations of
             locally applied vaginal estrogen associated with minimal systemic absorption, may be
             allowed; other estrogen-containing vaginal creams, while not an exclusion, should be
             avoided whenever possible; patients with a history of hormone modifying herbal
             supplements are eligible, but patients will be asked to avoid their use after on study

          -  Current or recent use (within 6 months of registration or baseline mammogram,
             whichever is first) of any of the following: hormonal forms of contraception (includes
             oral, transdermal, implanted, and injectable formulations): selective estrogen
             receptor modifiers; aromatase inhibitors; GnRH analogs; androgens or antiandrogens

          -  Concurrent use of warfarin and strong inhibitors or CYP2D6 will not be allowed

          -  A personal history or a strong family of thromboembolism, including deep venous
             thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE), or cerebrovascular accident (CVA); a
             personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or retinal vein thrombosis will
             also not be allowed; in addition, patients with a condition known to increase
             hypercoagulability, such as Factor V Leiden disease, will be excluded; patients with
             atrial fibrillation will be excluded, due to risk of CVA, but patients with coronary
             artery disease or congestive heart failure without atrial fibrillation will be allowed
             to participate

          -  Current intrauterine pregnancy or plans to become pregnant within two years; in
             addition, currently nursing mothers will be excluded

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2X the institutional norm

          -  Total bilirubin &gt; 2X the institutional norm

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
