    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators will establish the clinical trial technology for
      early evaluation of drug characteristics in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      for haloperidol as a model drug, using positron emission tomography.

      1. Study Design

           This study will consist of two parts. One is &quot;biodistribution study of haloperidol&quot; in
           12 subjects, and the other is &quot;receptor occupancy study of haloperidol&quot; in 12 subjects.
           In the biodistribution study, 18F-haloperidol (10 mCi) will be injected intravenously
           two times into each of the 12 subjects (cross-over design). Whole body PET will be
           conducted after the first haloperidol injection and local brain PET after the 2nd
           haloperidol injection after the 7 day washout period.

        2. Measurement 2.1 The D2 receptor Occupancy of haloperidol.

        3. Test schedule 3.1 Biodistribution study

             -  Whole body PET (day 1)

             -  Brain local PET (day 8) 3.2 Receptor occupancy study

             -  Baseline PET before drug administration (day 1 0h), 6h (day 1 6h), 24h (day 2 0h),
                after the first haloperidol administration (day 1 0h), and 24 h (day 8), 72 h (day
                10), and 168 h (day 14) after the last dosing of haloperidol (day 7 0h).

             -  Drug administration from day 1 through day 7 every 24 hours PK blood sampling (6
                ml, each) prior to the first haloperidol administration (day 1 0h) and 6h (1 day
                6h), 24h (2 day 0h), 48 h (3 day 0h), 96 h (5 day 0h), 144 h (7 day 0h) and, 0.5,
                1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 h (8day 0h), 48h (9day 0h), 72h (10 day 0h) after taking the
                last oral dose of haloperidol
