  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1-year study evaluating hospitalizations and the medical care for the treatment of
      diarrhea from rotavirus infection in children &lt; 5 years of age, conducted in four hospitals
      located in four Brazilian regions. A stool sample from each eligible child passing 3 or more
      loose stools or watery stools within a period of 24 hours and requiring hospitalization or
      rehydration therapy (oral or IV rehydration) will be tested for the presence of rotavirus,
      using standard laboratory procedures (ie, Enzyme Linked Ligand Sorbent Assay, or ELlSA) by
      all participating hospitals.

          <title>The Geographic Distribution of Hospitalizations for Diarrhea That Are Caused by Rotavirus</title>
          <description>Children up to 5 years of age hospitalized for diarrhea were tested for fecal rotavirus as determined by enzyme immunoassay. Diarrhea was defined as the passage of 3 or more soft/liquid feces in a 24-hour period. For each geographic location, the number of hospitalizations for diarrhea that was caused by rotavirus was reported.</description>
          <population>The population analyzed was children up to 5 years of age hospitalized for diarrhea. A total of 190 of the 230 participants had fecal samples analyzed; 27 of these had stool samples positive for rotavirus.</population>
