    <textblock>
      This nested design clinical outcome study of psychiatric case manager education on disease
      state, psychopharmacology of schizophrenia, relapse, motivational interviewing, and the
      process of psychological adjustment post-psychosis (Milestones of Adjustment Post-Psychosis
      Recovery Model-MAPP) will test the following hypotheses:

        1. Medication non-adherence in patients with schizophrenia assigned to case managers who
           receive MAPP training will decrease from their pre-study rate and from the reported
           national average after one year enrollment compared to consumers not enrolled in the
           MAPP arm of the study.

        2. Consumers in the MAPP intervention will have higher Quality of Life Enjoyment and
           Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-Les-Q (53) scores than consumers not enrolled in the MAPP
           at quarterly measures.

        3. Consumers enrolled in the MAPP intervention arm of the study will successfully complete
           the first two phases of the MAPP Recovery Model in one year.

        4. Consumers in the MAPP intervention arm will have greater symptom reductions at quarterly
           data points compared to consumers not enrolled in the MAPP intervention arm.

      52 psychiatric case managers will receive manualized training in the disease state of
      schizophrenia, psychotropic medications, motivational interviewing, and relapse prevention.
      After randomization, 26 case managers will receive additional manualized training in the
      process of post-psychotic adjustment. Outcomes of 130 consumers (5 per case manager) related
      to medication adherence, relapse rates, symptom intensity, and quality of life will be
      evaluated at quarterly intervals over a two-year period. Outcomes of 130 consumers related to
      medication adherence, relapse rates, symptom intensity, quality of life, and progression
      through the phases of postpsychotic adjustment (MAPP-Milestones of Adjustment Post-Psychosis
      Recovery Model) will be evaluated at quarterly intervals via rating scales over a two-year
      period and the two groups compared.
