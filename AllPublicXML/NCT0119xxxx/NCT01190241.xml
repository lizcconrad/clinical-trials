  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to select targeted treatment based on ex vivo kinase activity
      inhibition profiles to targeted agents of tumor tissue from patients with advanced cancer for
      whom no standard treatment is available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific signalling proteins that are important for tumor growth can be targeted by agents.
      These are called targeted agents or targeted treatment. Thus far, it is unclear which
      patients will respond to these targeted agents. It is assumed that responses to these agents
      depend on specific receptor and protein signalling activities in tumor tissues. The
      investigators propose that kinase activity profiling may be a potential clinical diagnostic
      tool to predict tumor response to targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

      The investigators will determine ex vivo kinase activity inhibition profiles of tumor tissue
      to different targeted agents. Tumor tissue from patients with advanced cancer for whom no
      standard treatment is available will be used.

      Patients will be treated with the selected targeted agent and the clinical benefit will be
      determined.
