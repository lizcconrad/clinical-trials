      The investigators wish to evaluate coblation channeling in the treatment of chronic
      tonsillitis.

      The tonsillar crypts play an important role in chronic tonsillitis. They are covered by
      stratified epithelium and may be initiated via the epithelium to mount immune responses to
      various presenting antigens. Go M. et al, investigated the expression and function of tight
      junctions in the epithelium of human palatine tonsils from patients with tonsillar
      hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis. These studies suggested unique expression of tight
      junctions in human palatine tonsillar epithelium, and it was suggested that the crypt
      epithelium may possess an epithelial barrier different from that of the surface epithelium.

      Bacteria within biofilms are resistant to host defenses and antibiotics. The presence of
      bacterial biofilms within the tissue and crypts of inflamed tonsils may explain the
      chronicity and recurrent characteristics of some forms of tonsillitis. There is strong
      anatomical evidence for the presence of bacterial biofilms in chronically diseased tonsils.

      Our hypothesis was that treatment of the crypts and tonsillar tissue may decrease the
      possible antigen-immune system interaction and inflammation.

      The combination of the radio frequency energy and the fluid creates a &quot;plasma&quot; field
      containing highly ionized particles. The ionized particles have sufficient energy to break
      organic molecular bonds that can remove tissue selectively without excessive heat production
      and damage the surrounding tissue. Employing this new technique, the investigators will try
      to eliminate the cause for chronic tonsillitis.

    <description>The combination of the energy and the fluid creates a &quot;plasma&quot; field containing highly ionized particles (coblation). The ionized particles have sufficient energy to break organic molecular bonds that can remove tissue selectively without excessive heat production and subsequent damage to the surrounding tissue. Treatment of the tonsillar crypts and tissue by coblation may decrease antigen and immune system interaction and inflammation.</description>
