      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeat oral dosing of mirabegron on
      ECG (electrocardiogram) measurements.

    <textblock>
      Each subject will be randomized and participate in two 10-day treatment periods during which
      once daily dosing of mirabegron and mirabegron/moxifloxacin placebo or moxifloxacin and
      moxifloxacin/mirabegron placebo will occur followed by a 1-day post-treatment period. Each
      treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at least 12 days from the last dose
      of study drug on Day 10 of Period 1 to Day -4 of Period 2.
