  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who are unable to achieve orgasm compared to women who have normal orgasmic function
      may have different clitoral anatomy and different hormone levels. The investigators
      hypothesis is that women who have difficulty with orgasm may have a clitoris that is closer
      to the vagina and may have higher testosterone levels. Pelvic MRI will be used to observe
      whether clitoral measurements differ between women with normal orgasmic function vs. those
      with anorgasmia.

      Women unable with anorgasmia and those with normal orgasmic function will undergo pelvic MRI
      so that clitoral measurements can be taken and then compared for differences.

    <measure>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The FSFI is a validated index of sexual function, consisting of a total score and six subscales or domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The FSFI total is the sum of the six domain scores, each of which is weighted as noted. The FSFI total score can range from 2 to 36, with higher scores indicating better sexual function. A total score of 26.55 has been identified as the ideal cut point for differentiating between normal sexual function and sexual dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FSFI Desire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) consists of two questions and measures the frequency (almost never to almost always) and level (very low to very high) of sexual desire. Item scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function, and the domain score is weighted by a factor of 0.6, such that the domain score can range from 1.2 to 6.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FSFI Arousal</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The arousal domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) consists of four questions and measures the frequency (almost never to almost always) and level (very low to very high) of sexual arousal; and confidence in becoming aroused (very low to very high confidence) and frequency of satisfaction with arousal (almost never to almost always). Item scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function, and the arousal score is weighted by a factor of 0.3, such that the domain score can range from 0 to 6.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FSFI Lubrication</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The lubrication domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) consists of four questions and measures the frequency of lubrication (almost never to almost always), the difficulty in becoming lubricated (extremely difficult to not difficult), frequency of maintaining lubrication (almost never to almost always), and difficulty in maintaining lubrication (extremely difficult to not difficult). Item scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function, and the lubrication score is weighted by a factor of 0.3, such that the domain score can range from 0 to 6.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FSFI Orgasm</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The orgasm domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) consists of three questions and measures the frequency of orgasm (almost never to almost always), difficulty in achieving orgasm (extremely difficult to not difficult), and satisfaction with the ability to reach orgasm (very dissatisfied to very satisfied). Item scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function, and the orgasm score is weighted by a factor of 0.4, such that the domain score can range from 0 to 6.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FSFI Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) consists of three questions and measures satisfaction (very dissatisfied to very satisfied) with emotional closeness with partner, sexual relationship with partner, and overall sexual relationship with partner. Item scores range from 0 (or 1) to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function, and the satisfaction score is weighted by a factor of 0.4, such that the domain score can range from 0.8 to 6.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FSFI Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The pain domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) consists of three questions and measures the frequency of discomfort or pain during and following vaginal penetration (almost never to almost always), and the level of discomfort or pain (very low to very high). Item scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function, and the pain score is weighted by a factor of 0.4, such that the domain score can range from 0 to 6.0.</description>

    <baseline>
      <population>A sample size calculation determined that with an alpha level of 0.05 a sample size of 13 participants in each arm (N=26) would yield 90% power to detect a mean difference of 5.6 between groups on the FSFI Orgasm subscale. We planned to enroll 40 patients (20 in each arm) to accommodate a predicted dropout rate of approximately 40%.</population>

        <description>The FSFI is a validated index of sexual function, consisting of a total score and six subscales or domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The FSFI total is the sum of the six domain scores, each of which is weighted as noted. The FSFI total score can range from 2 to 36, with higher scores indicating better sexual function. A total score of 26.55 has been identified as the ideal cut point for differentiating between normal sexual function and sexual dysfunction.</description>

        <description>The desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) consists of two questions and measures the frequency (almost never to almost always) and level (very low to very high) of sexual desire. Item scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function, and the domain score is weighted by a factor of 0.6, such that the domain score can range from 1.2 to 6.0.</description>

          <description>The desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) consists of two questions and measures the frequency (almost never to almost always) and level (very low to very high) of sexual desire. Item scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function, and the domain score is weighted by a factor of 0.6, such that the domain score can range from 1.2 to 6.0.</description>
