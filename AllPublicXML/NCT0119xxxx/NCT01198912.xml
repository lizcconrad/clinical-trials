    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, study in patients
      with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps. The objective is to test the
      clinical efficacy of long-term low dose oral doxycycline on wound healing quality after
      endoscopic sinus surgery.
