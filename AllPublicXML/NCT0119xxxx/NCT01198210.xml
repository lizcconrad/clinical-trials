  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate postoperative period after tonsillectomy, , is often difficult. These children
      frequently have severe pain but postoperative airway edema along with increased sensitivity
      to the respiratory-depressant effects of opioids may result in obstructive symptoms and
      hypoxemia. Opioid consumption may be reduced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but
      these drugs may be associated with increased bleeding after this operation.

      Methods: One hundred sixty ASA I-II children 3-12 were randomized four groups of 40 each.
      Group P received a local peritonsillar infiltration of 2 ml saline, group D dexamethsone (0.2
      mg/kg)) , group K ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and group KD combination of ketamine0.5mg/kg
      dexamethasone 0.2mg/kg. All medications were 2 ml in volume which was applied 1 ml per tonsil
      3 min prior to tonsillectomy. Study drugs were marked only with a coded number label. A
      computer-generated table of numbers guided randomization. Modified Hannallah pain scale
      [observational pain scores (OPS)], nausea, vomiting, bleeding, rescue analgesia, sedation and
      Aldrete scores were recorded at first, 15th, 30th and 60th min postoperatively. Patients were
      interviewed on the day after surgery to assess the postoperative pain, nightmares,
      hallucinations, vomiting and bleeding. All the children were premedicated with midazolam
      hydrochloride 0.3 mg/kg) and fentanyl 1micro g/kg intavenously. Anesthesia was induced with
      thiopental 5mg/kg and atracurium0.3mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1.5% and
      nitrous oxide 30% in oxygen. The two surgeon used the same dissection and snare technique for
      all cases and hemostasis done with bipolar cutter. At the end of the surgery neuromuscular
      blockade was reversed by neostigmine 0.03 mg/kg) and atropine 0.01 mg/kg intravenously),
      anesthesia was discontinued and the tracheal tube removed in the operating room when patients
      were deep. After extubation the patients were taken to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU)
      where an nurse who were unaware of the study drug observed the patients. The pain scoring
      observer nurse in PACU was consistent. Time to awaken (from the end of anesthesia until the
      patients opened their eyes on command) and time to the first administration of postoperative
      analgesia were recorded. Pethidine in a titrated dose (total 1 mg/kg) was administered
      intravenously for rapid pain relief to patients with a OPS score &gt; 4 or who were crying
      during two consecutive five minute observation periods until the child was comfortable.
      Postoperative pain during the first 24 h was assessed using a four-point scale: 0 no pain, 1
      mild pain, 2 moderate pain, 3 severe pain by questioning their parents. In the ward the
      standardized postoperative analgesic technique was with acetaminophen supp (40 mg/kg followed
      by three doses of 20 mg/kg at 6-hour intervals to be given as needed for pain. Pethidine in a
      titrated dose (total 1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously for rapid pain relief to
      patients who had pain scale &gt;3.Any supplementary analgesia , nausea and vomiting, bleeding,
      sleep disturbance and nightmares that the child might have had as surgery were assessed
      during a telephone follow up 24 h later.
