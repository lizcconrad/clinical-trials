  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a CCTG sponsored trial in collaboration with UCSD-AVRC investigators to get more
      information about the methods that are used on the internet to provide information on how to
      reduce the risk of giving or getting infections that are often or usually passed from one
      person to another during sexual or intimate contact (sexually transmitted infection (STI)).
      STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. The purpose of this study is to develop
      methods that will allow someone who is living with HIV an easy way that they can get
      information and learn of ways on their own that can decrease their chances of getting
      sexually transmitted infections and ways that they can reduce the chance that they may
      transmit HIV to others.

      Design: CCTG 592 is a randomized, controlled study that will compare the efficacy of
      web-based intervention to reduce high-risk sexual behavior by persons living with HIV AIDS
      (PLWH).

      Duration: 48 weeks

      Sample Size: 200 subjects (100 per arm) that will be randomized

      Study Population: HIV-1-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) at least 18 years of age who
      have a recent history of transmission risk behavior.

      Stratification: Subjects will be stratified based upon their baseline antiretroviral use,
      whether they have a home computer and by site.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed screening antibody test, such as ELISA,
             and confirmed by a second antibody test, such as Western blot, or detectable plasma
             HIV-1 RNA at any time prior to study entry. If an ELISA or Western Blot are not
             available, HIV infection may be documented by two HIV RNA values &gt; 2000 copies/mL,
             drawn at least 24 hours apart. The HIV RNA assays should have been run at a CLIA
             approved laboratory or equivalent.

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Male.

          -  At least one of the following:

          -  An HIV negative or unknown status sexual partner in the past three months.

          -  A sexually transmitted disease in the past 1 year (other than HIV).

          -  More than 2 male partners in past year.

          -  Unprotected anal sex in past 3 month.

          -  Capable of signing written informed consent.
