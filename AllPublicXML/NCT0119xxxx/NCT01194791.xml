      It is a multicenter, single arm treatment, phase II study of the combination in one treatment
      arm with Lenalidomide, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone.

      Subjects who qualify for participation will receive lenalidomide plus dexamethasone and
      cyclophosphamide in 4-week cycles. Subjects will be seen (study visits) every 2 weeks for the
      first 3 cycles of therapy and monthly thereafter.

      Cycles of lenalidomide/dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide will consists of lenalidomide 15 mg by
      mouth for 21 days followed by 7 days rest and 300 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide on days 1 and 8
      plus oral dexamethasone 20 mg/day on days 1-4 and 9-12 given at 4-week intervals. Patients
      will be treated with 6 cycles of therapy with the option to continue beyond as long there is
      evidence of response. In this case the dose of lenalidomide will be the same and the dose of
      the dexamethasone will be administered only on days 1 to 4 of each cycle and the dose of
      cyclophosphamide only day 1 during 6 cycles. After 12 cycles if the patients remaining in
      response, will be treated with 10 mg/day, cyclophosphamide day 1, and dexamethasone will be
      administered on days 1 to 4 of each cycle.

      For the first 3 cycles, patients will be followed for adverse events with hematologic control
      every 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Patients will be required to have a blood work-up
      including total serum protein and serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein studies and a
      clinical visit before each cycle. Organ involvement will be assessed every 4 cycles during
      the first year of therapy. Hematologic response will be assessed every 3 months and organ
      response every 6 months after the first year of treatment.

      Treatment modifications will be based on adverse events graded according to the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 3.0).

      There will be 30 patients enrolled.

      The trial consists of three periods: pre-treatment, treatment and follow up period.

      Pre-treatment phase: include the enrolment visit in order to determine if the patient is
      eligible to participate in the study. The patient will sign the Informed Consent Form to take
      part in the study, and will receive detailed information about the treatment, its benefits
      and risks.

      Treatment phase: include the 12 cycles of 28 days treatment with Lenalidomide,
      Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone as induction therapy followed with low doses of
      Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone during three years until progression or unacceptable toxicity
      levels.

      Follow up phase: Once the clinical trial has finished, patients will be followed during usual
      clinical practice visits where progression, free survival and overall survival will be
      evaluated.

             with investigator criteria.

          -  Diagnosis of symptomatic primary systemic amyloidosis based on tissue Congo red
             positive staining as well as positive immunohistochemical staining for light chains or
             presence of a monoclonal protein in serum and/or urine or clonal bone marrow plasma
             cells

          -  Previously untreated disease

          -  Patients should not candidates for up-front high-dose therapy/stem cell
             transplantation

          -  Serologically measurable disease defined as follows:

        Evidence of a monoclonal light chain in serum and urine by immunofixation Raise of the
        level of circulating free light chains above the ordinary limits and an abnormal
        relationship kappa/lambda.

          -  Performance status ECOG ≤ 2 (see Annex 3).

          -  Laboratory tests results within these ranges:

        Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1 x 10 9/ L. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10 9/ L Serum creatinine
        less than 3.0 mg/dL Serum bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL

        - Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to: Know the teratogenic risks of the
        study drug

        Commit to use contraceptives during the 4 weeks before the start of this study drug
        treatment, during the treatment and also 4 weeks after it, even amenorrheic cases. All of
        it applies always except women committed to maintain sexual abstinence confirming it
        monthly. Some of effective contraceptives are:

        Birth control implant Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device. Depot
        medroxyprogesterone acetate Tubal ligation Sexual intercourse only with a vasectomized
        partner. The effectiveness of vasectomy must be confirmed by two semen analysis; the result
        must be negative Inhibiting ovulation pill progesterone only (for example: desogestrel) if
        it is determined that the patient doesn't use an effective contraceptive method will be
        referred to a skilled health professional to receive advice on contraception, so that they
        can begin to birth control measures.

        It's discouraged combine oral contraceptives in myeloma multiple women cases treated with
        Lenalidomide combined with Dexamethasone due to high venous thromboembolism risk. In case
        these kind of patient were having combined oral contraceptives, she must change to another
        one of list above. Risks of venous thromboembolism will remain during the 3 or 4 weeks
        after discontinue combine oral contraceptives treatment. Concomitant treatment with
        dexamethasone reduces the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids.

        Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are related to higher risks of
        infections at the moment of the implant or when there is metrorrhagia. It should be
        considered prophylactic treatment with antibiotics for neutropenic patients.

        Normally it's discouraged copper intrauterine devices because of the infection risk and
        menstrual blood loss at the moment of the implant for patients with neutropenia or
        thrombocytopenia.

        Women patients must follow all warnings for an effective contraception, even if she is
        amenorrheic.

        Women patients must be aware about effects of pregnancy and go to a health care centre
        urgently in case of pregnancy risk.

        She must take a pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mUl/ml, under medical
        supervision, when the study visits or three days before the visit, when she were 4 weeks at
        least using effective contraceptive methods. This requirement applies for women who
        practice a complete and continuous sexual abstinence. Test should confirm that the patient
        is not pregnant at the time of starting treatment.

        She must take a pregnancy test, under medical supervision, each 4 weeks, even a pregnancy
        test 4 weeks after the end of the study treatment, except in case of a confirmed tubal
        ligation. Pregnancy test should be performed the day of the study's visit or during the
        three days before it. This requirement also applies for childbearing women who practice a
        complete and continuous sexual abstinence.

        - Male patients must: Undertake to use latex condoms during treatment with study medication
        including all periods of interruption of doses, even one week after finishing treatment if
        his partner is a woman of childbearing who doesn't use contraceptive methods.

        Commit not to donate semen during treatment with study medication and even one week after
        finishing treatment.

        - All patients should: Refrain from donating blood during treatment with study medication
        and even one week after finishing treatment.

        Refrain from sharing the study medication with other people and return unused study
