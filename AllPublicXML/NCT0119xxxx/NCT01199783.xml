    <textblock>
      Objective of the study is to test whether Daptomycin (6 mg/kg bodyweight) is non-inferior in
      treatment of severe diabetic foot infections (MRSA) in comparison to antibiotic treatment
      with Vancomycin (effective blood-plasma concentration of 15 mg/l). In case of
      microbiologically confirmed gram-negative co-infection effective antibiotic treatment
      according to microbiologic analysis will be administered upon medical decision in both
      therapy groups. The study will be carried out as a randomized, open label study.
