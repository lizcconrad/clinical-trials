      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes the occur in DNA and identify biomarkers
      related to cancer. DNA analysis of tumor tissue may also help doctors predict how well
      patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying DNA biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with
      osteosarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To comprehensively detect genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic aberrations in tissue
           samples from patients with osteosarcoma that may play a role in chemoresistance and
           metastasis using high-resolution genome-wide technologies.

        -  To identify recurrent genetic mutations involved in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma,
           especially for the development of chemoresistance and metastatic tumors.

        -  To identify and validate these biomarkers for new therapeutic targets for patients with
           osteosarcoma, especially those with metastatic disease and whose tumors are resistant to
           standard chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived tumor tissue and peripheral blood DNA specimens are analyzed for DNA copy number
      profiling, gene expression profiling, DNA methylation profiling, microRNA profiling, and
      genomic resequencing. Clinical data including demographics; date of diagnosis, surgery,
      chemotherapy, recurrence, progression, and death; imaging; toxicity; and pathologic data
      elements associated with the specimens are also collected and analyzed.
