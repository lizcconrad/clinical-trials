  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) using TAXUS stents compared to the costs of coronary artery
      bypass surgery (CABG) in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) in the first
      5 years and then 10 years after intervention. Multivessel PCI or CABG was performed in 114 or
      93 patients, respectively. Clinical outcomes, in terms of incidence of acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI), all-cause death, target vessel revascularization (TVR) and stroke, resource
      use and costs are analyzed prospectively over a 5 and 10-year follow-up (FUP) period. Overall
      costs consist of the baseline costs of the index procedure (PCI or CABG), clinical and
      angiographic procedure-related treatments during the entire FUP. The primary endpoint is
      cost-effectiveness and clinical effectiveness, defined as the reduction of the composite of
      major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).
