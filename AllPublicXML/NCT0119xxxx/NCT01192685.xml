      This a 12- week study (1-4 week screening, 6 weeks treatment, 2 weeks follow-up) outpatient
      open label clinical trial. Twenty-five subjects diagnosed with depression with a Montgomery
      Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRAS) score of 26 or higher, will be enrolled into this
      trial, up to fifty subjects will be consented. The primary purpose of the current study is to
      determine: 1) if changes in electrical activity of the brain measured by EEG in specific
      areas is associated with changes in the blood flow of the brain 2) Which areas of the brain
      show changes in electrical activity and treatment response.

    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has demonstrated efficacy as a treatment for major
      depression. No objective markers have been identified that indicate which patients are most
      likely to respond to TMS therapy. The goal of the present investigation is to determine
      whether an electroencephalographic measure called cordance or a measure of blood flow in the
      frontal brain, as measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can serve as predictors of
      outcome with TMS therapy in depression. Subjects with depression will be treated in this
      study for 6 weeks with TMS. Frontal brain blood flow measured using NIRS will be assessed
      prior to TMS therapy, and repeatedly thereafter. EEG cordance will also be obtained following
      a similar schedule. Measures of depression and other psychiatric disorders will be collected
      prior to, during and for 2 weeks after the completion of TMS treatment. The correlation
      between these measures and the EEG and NIRS measures will then be determined to see if these
      latter measures are predictive of improvement in depression.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the correlations between EEG cordance or task-induced changes in frontal total Hb levels and changes in MADRAS scores between baseline and the last treatment day. Correlations between these measures will be determined between other cordance and total Hb levels obtained after the first week of treatment and MADRAS changes for the last day of treatment. Similar analyses will be conducted for changes in MADRAS scores between baseline and the follow-up visit.</description>

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) will be administered to subjects 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a spectroscopic method that uses the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum (from about 700 nm to 2500 nm), will be used to assess blood flow in the brain.</description>
