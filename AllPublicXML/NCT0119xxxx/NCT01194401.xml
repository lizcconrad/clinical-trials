    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center observational study will assess the long-term efficacy and
      safety of RoActemra/Actemra in daily practice in patients with active moderate to severe
      rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.
      Data will be collected from patients initiated on RoActemra/Actemra treatment according to
      label by decision of the treating physician. Anticipated time for data collection from each
      patient will be 2 years.
