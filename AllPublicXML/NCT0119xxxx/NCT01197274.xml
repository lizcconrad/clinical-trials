      The purpose of this study is to compare the results skin prick tests using simple blood
      lancet (Vitrex®) with DuoTips among mite-sensitized subjects.

    <textblock>
      We intend to compare results of skin prick tests by using simple blood lancet(Vitrex®) and
      DuoTips in terms of wheal size, variability, transfer of allergen and pain level, among
      mite-sensitive subjects.

    <description>Skin prick testing with blood lancet and DuoTip is performed on the back of mite-sensitized person. Allergen(Der p)is placed in 1st and 2nd row whereas histamine is placed in 3rd row. Allergen and normal saline are placed alternately in 4th row. Block randomization were allocated subjects into 2 groups; Group1:blood lancet is performed in 1st row and DuoTip in 2nd row. Group2:DuoTip is performed in 1st row and blood lancet in 2nd row. Blood lancet is applied in 3rd and 4th row in all subjects. A technician performed device applications and another technician who is blinded to device performed all readings. Pain was assessed on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst imaginable pain</description>
