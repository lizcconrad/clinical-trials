      The eyelid warming device is designed to relieve the symptoms of dysfunction of the glands in
      the eyelids

      Phase I, prospective, comparative study, investigator masked , monocentric

      Objectives are To assess and compare the warming and moisture of Blephasteam速 device versus
      the warming and moisture of warm and moist compresses.

      To assess and compare safety on the ocular surface after 10 minutes of Blephasteam速
      application versus after 10 minutes of warm and moist compresses application
