          <description>Total number of patients randomised and treated in the study. This was a randomised, placebo controlled, 5-period crossover trial, participants were randomised to one of ten possible treatment sequences. The treatments administered were
25mg empa administered orally on day 1 of the treatment period
200mg empa administered orally on day 1 of the treatment period
400mg moxifloxacin administered orally on day 1 of the treatment period
Placebo 1 administered orally on day 1 of the treatment period
Placebo 2 administered orally on day 1 of the treatment period
The trial was double-blind for the placebo and Empagliflozin (Empa) treatments, but open-label for the moxifloxacin treatment. A washout period of at least 1 week was respected between drug administrations.</description>
