        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject has completed study participation in Study M11-846

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 2.

          3. Subject must have adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function per institutional
             normal range as follows: • Bone Marrow: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC ≥ 1,500/mm3
             (1.5 × 109/L); Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 (100 × 109/L); Hemoglobin ≥ 9.5 g/dL (1.4
             mmol/L); • Renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) range
             OR creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels above
             institutional normal; • Hepatic function: AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 × the ULN range. For
             subjects with liver metastases, AST and ALT &lt; 5 × the ULN range; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the
             ULN range. • Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) must be ≤ 1.5 × the ULN range and INR &lt;
             1.5. Subjects on anticoagulant therapy (such as Coumadin) will have an appropriate PTT
             and INR as determined by the Investigator.

          4. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (one of the
             following listed below) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation
             and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Women of childbearing potential must
             have a negative serum pregnancy test within 28 days prior to initiation of treatment
             and a negative urine pregnancy test on Cycle 1 Day 1 and/or post menopausal women must
             be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.
             • Total abstinence from sexual intercourse (minimum one complete menstrual cycle); •
             Vasectomized partner; • Hormonal contraceptives (oral, parenteral or transdermal) for
             at least 3 months prior to study drug administration; • Double-barrier method
             (condoms, contraceptive sponge, diaphragm or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or
             cream); • IUD (Intrauterine Device).

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subject has received anticancer agent(s) or an investigational agent (except for
             veliparib) within 28 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects who have not
             recovered to within one grade level (not to exceed grade 2) of their baseline
             following a significant adverse event or toxicity attributed to previous anticancer
             treatment are excluded.

          2. Subject has undergone major surgery within the previous 28 days prior to study drug
             administration.

          3. Subject has received radiotherapy within 28 days prior to study drug administration.

          4. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical condition(s) including but not
             limited to: • Active uncontrolled infection; • Symptomatic congestive heart failure;•
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia; • Psychiatric illness/social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; • Any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the Study Investigator, places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities.

          5. Subject is pregnant or lactating.
