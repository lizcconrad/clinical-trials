  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop non-invasive MRI, and MRS approaches that will quantify
      the plaque composition and lipid content of plaques and will have the potential for repeated
      in vivo measurements. Simultaneously this study aims to develop US plaque imaging as a
      screening tool to select plaque phenotypes of interest for clinical trials (a large LRNC).
      For plaque composition imaging by MRI the researchers aim to increase scan resolution and
      decrease scan time. For quantifying plaque lipid content the researchers aim to develop an
      MRS protocol. Subsequently, the researchers intend to study the reproducibility of plaque
      composition and lipid content measurements by MRI, MRS and Ultrasound in subjects that have
      carotid artery plaques.

        The population will consist of patients with carotid artery plaques that cause 30% to 70%
        lumen stenosis. The degree of stenosis will be assessed by the peak systolic velocity end
        end diastolic velocity near the stenosis measured by ultrasound duplex.

        The researchers choose to investigate patients with 30% to 70% carotid artery stenosis for
        the following reasons: 1. Treatment of patients with carotid artery plaques is based on the
        amount of lumen stenosis. A stenosis of more than 70% is generally treated surgically by
        endarterectomy. Doing repeated measurements is only possible in patients not treated
        surgically. 2. Patients with 30% to 70% carotid artery stenosis are, despite their drug
        treatment, still at high risk for cardiovascular events.
