  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue is a central organ in mediating metabolic health. There is some evidence that
      women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a degree of adipose tissue dysfunction which
      may negatively affect their metabolic health. The aim of this study was to assess
      transcriptomic profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue of women with PCOS in comparison with
      a control population matched on the basis of age and body mass index (BMI). A secondary aim
      was to then relate these gene expression profiles to the biochemical environment.

    <time_frame>Recruitment ran from Dec 2007-July 2008. Subjects attended the study location fasting on one occasion</time_frame>
    <description>Gene expression profiles from women with PCOS and controls matched for age and BMI were determined by microarray analysis of whole subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. Single gene changes as well as pathway analyses will be used to determine differently expressed genes and pathways between the PCOS cohort and controls.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of biomarkers of metabolic health (lipid, inflammatory markers) in plasma of PCOS cases and controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Recruitment ran from Dec 2007-July 2008. Subjects attended the study location fasting on one occasion</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarkers of metabolic health were assessed in plasma of women with PCOS and age and BMI matched controls. Lipid profile, hormonal profile, various key inflammatory markers and adipokines will be measured. Glucose and insulin concentrations will be assessed also. All parameters will be assessed following a 12 hour over night fast at the study location.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Had a positive diagnosis of PCOS as defined according to the NIH criteria as chronic
             oligomenorrhoea (&lt; 9 menstrual cycles per year) and clinical and/or biochemical
             evidence of hyperandrogenism, in the absence of other disorders causing the same
             phenotype. Clinical criteria included hirsutism with a Ferriman-Galwey score greater
             than 9, acne or male pattern alopecia; biochemical criteria included
             total-testosterone, androstenedione or dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) greater
             than the laboratory reference range.

          -  Were between the ages of 18 and 40

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Were under 18 years or greater than 40 years old,
