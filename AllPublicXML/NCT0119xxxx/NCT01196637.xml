  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic outlet syndrome is caused by compression of the brachial plexus, in most cases under
      the pectoralis minor muscle in the infraclavicular region of the shoulder. The hypothesis is
      that ultrasound imaging can be used to visualize brachial plexus compression and distortion
      of the pectoralis muscle during arm activity, such as abduction, and that normal subjects
      will not demonstrate any plexus compression or muscle distortion.

      Four patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) underwent clinical exam and nerve testing
      to prove that they had TOS and no other nerve abnormality. They subsequently had ultrasound
      imaging of the shoulder (infraclavicular region) at rest and during arm abduction stress
      testing. Two control subjects had similar clinical exams and nerve testing to prove they did
      not have TOS, and then underwent similar ultrasound stress testing. The TOS patients
      demonstrated brachial plexus compression and pectoralis minor muscle distortion during the
      stress tests, and the normal subjects showed no plexus compression or muscle distortion.
