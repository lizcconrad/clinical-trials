  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the efficacy of virtual realty exposure therapy (VRET)by comparing
      it to prolonged exposure therapy (PE) and a waitlist (WL) group for the treatment of post
      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in active duty (AD) Soldiers with combat-related trauma. The
      investigators will test the general hypotheses that 10 sessions of VRET or PE will
      successfully treat PTSD, therapeutically affect levels of physiological arousal, and
      significantly reduce perceptions of stigma toward seeking behavioral health services.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is based on growing evidence demonstrating that VRET is an
      efficacious treatment for PTSD and holds the potential to improve access to care for Soldiers
      who would otherwise avoid treatment. Although PE is considered one of the most effective
      cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) for treatments for PTSD, there are reasons why it may
      not be the most viable option for many Soldiers. First, Prolonged exposure requires a level
      of emotional engagement during exposure to the trauma that many patients are unable to
      obtain. Second, stigma and concerns about how Soldiers will be perceived by peers and
      leadership has a dramatic impact on whether a Soldier will seek care. VRET may address these
      concerns and may also improve treatment outcomes and access to care by augmenting the
      patient's re-living of the trauma with a sensory-rich environment and moderating stigma
      perceptions by offering non-traditional treatment that is a preferable option for many
      Soldiers who are reluctant to seek out traditional talk therapies. Despite its promise as a
      viable treatment option, few studies have examined VRET for combat-related PTSD and there are
      no published studies that have compared VRET to PE in the treatment of combat-related PTSD.
      Positive results may provide new treatment options for all Soldiers, but should prove to be
      an especially attractive option for Soldiers who either do not respond to, or are reluctant
      to engage in other established therapies such as PE.

    <description>The PE protocol is based on manualized procedures, which are derived from the theory that effective treatment for PTSD requires that the underlying pathological fear structure be activated and paired with new information that is incompatible with the fear structure. PE involves imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure as the two primary strategies to elicit repeated confrontation of feared but objectively safe thoughts, feelings, situations and events.</description>

    <description>The VRET protocol follows the same procedures as the PE protocol with the primary exception being that all instances of imaginal exposure will be augmented by immersion into Virtual Iraq environments, thus creating a situation known as immersive exposure.</description>
