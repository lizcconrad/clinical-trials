  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of children 0 to 5 years of age are seen in paediatric Accident &amp;
      Emergency departments (A&amp;E) with feverish illness. Most of these patients could safely be
      managed in a primary care setting, particularly with guidelines in place on how to optimally
      assess these children. Some patients, however, will require admission, either because of a
      potentially serious underlying disease or because of other factors, for example parental
      concern or difficulties in communication because of language barriers. An increase in the
      number of children attending A&amp;E departments with feverish illness as well as a rise in the
      volume of admissions has been noted over time. To enable an appropriate adaptation of acute
      medical services for children an in depth understanding of the assessment and admission
      processes is crucial.

      This study primarily aims to describe factors associated with hospitalisation of children
      aged 3 months to 5 years presenting with fever to an urban paediatric A&amp;E departments by
      describing and analysing characteristics both of those patients admitted to hospital and
      those managed in the community. To complement this, information on the short-term healthcare
      utilization by families attending the emergency department because of feverish illness will
      be collected. The study will be carried out in one participating centre in Switzerland and
      the United Kingdom, respectively, to enable a head to head comparison of the assessment and
      admission practices in two European countries. The resulting data will be used as the basis
      for further research in this area and will provide information on how to optimally structure
      service provision in acute febrile childhood illness.
