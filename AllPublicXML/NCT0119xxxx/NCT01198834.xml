        Inclusion Criteria

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study if all of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Subject has signed an informed consent form.

          2. Subject is 14 years of age or older (with assent according to state law).

          3. Females of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and be using an
             adequate method of birth control. Adequate is defined as either hormonal or partner
             vasectomy for at least three months, or , condoms, IUD, abstinence or other prescribed
             birth control. Females may be considered non-childbearing if post-menopausal at least
             1 year or surgically sterile.

          4. Subject has a diagnosis of uncomplicated acute soft tissue inversion injury of the
             ankle, Grade II classification (as defined by the American Academy of Orthopaedic
             Surgeons (AAOS), &quot;partial tearing of the ligament&quot;) that has occurred ≥ 6 hours to ≤
             48 hours before study entry.

          5. Subject has a Current Pain Intensity during point and flex with the ankle unwrapped
             rated prior to study entry as ≥ 5 but ≤ 8 on an NPRS (11 point; range 0 to 10; anchors
             to be &quot;none&quot; and &quot;severe&quot;).

          6. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Females of child bearing potential that are not using an adequate method of birth
             control or are breastfeeding (adequate defined as either hormonal or partner vasectomy
             for at least three months, or other prescribed birth control, condoms, IUD, abstinence
             or other prescribed birth control).

          2. Subject has a Grade I (&quot;slight stretching and some damage to the fibers (fibrils) of
             the ligament&quot;) or Grade III (&quot;complete tear of the ligament&quot;) sprain or strain,
             bilateral sprain or strain, or concomitant fracture or open wound at the site of the
             sprain or strain, or has a serious injury, as determined by the investigator (e.g.,
             nerve damage, joint instability, or tendon rupture); or surgical treatment is
             required. Diagnosis of Grade III is indicated by a positive anterior drawer test or
             positive talar tilt test is exclusionary (inability to perform test(s) is exclusionary
             when in the opinion of the investigator a Grade III sprain is suspected).

          3. Subject has a history of a previous injury to the same area within two months prior to
             current injury or previous surgery in the same area.

          4. Subject has used non-pharmacologic treatments for the injury within 2 hours prior to
             the baseline visit (e.g. ice or acupuncture) that may interfere with pain assessments.
             Subjects on any therapeutic exercise regimen should continue based on the
             investigator's discretion. Use of iontophoresis is prohibited.

          5. Subject has used oral pharmacologic treatments (NSAIDs or analgesic medications) for
             the injury less than three half-lives before the baseline assessments; ibuprofen is
             permitted prior to baseline as long as it is not within six hours of the baseline
             assessment aspirin (81-325 mg daily) taken prophylactically for cardiovascular reasons
             is permitted.

          6. Subject has used any form of opioid within 24 hours of study entry or used opioids for
             five or more consecutive days within the 30 days preceding the screening visit.

          7. Subject has received systemic corticosteroids in the 30 days preceding the screening
             visit (e.g., intra-articular, peritendinous, oral, or parenteral administration);
             topical corticosteroid use is acceptable unless applied to the target joint; and
             inhaled steroids are acceptable (e.g. Flonase®).

          8. Subject recently initiated sleep medications, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants or
             antidepressants (within the past 30 days); if using any of these, subject must be on a
             stable dose and regimen for 30 days prior to study enrollment.

          9. Subject has used TNF alpha blockers or Class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs within the 60
             days preceding the screening visit.

         10. Subject has a history or physical assessment finding of clinically significant GI
             ulcers or abnormal bleeding, anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, poorly controlled
             lung, stomach, heart, or other vital organ disease as determined by the study
             investigator/physician.

         11. Subject has a history or physical assessment finding that is not compatible with safe
             participation in the study as determined by the study investigator.

         12. Subject has any form of inflammatory arthritis, spondyloarthropathies (sPA),
             fibromyalgia, or is currently undergoing treatment for chronic pain; or has a history
             of, or evidence for, underlying disease in the injured area, such as osteoarthritis or
             gout.

         13. Subject has any pain or medical problem that, in the investigator's opinion, may
             interfere with pain measurement of the target joint.

         14. Subject has active skin lesions or disease at the intended site of application of the
             study medication. Skin lesions include open wounds, rash, papules and vesicles;
             abrasions, lacerations or any break in skin at the intended site of patch application.

         15. Subject has a history of allergy to etodolac, other NSAIDs, lidocaine, or adhesives
             (e.g. adhesive tape).

         16. Subject has a history of prior failed treatment with topical NSAIDs (Flector® Patch or
             Voltaren® Gel) defined as repeated attempts within the three months preceding the
             screening visit.

         17. Subject has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past two years preceding the
             screening visit.

         18. Subject has received an investigational drug or product or participated in an

         19. Subject has scheduled elective surgery or other invasive procedures during the period
             of study participation.

         20. Subject is on workman's compensation or has pending legal hearings associated with any
             injury.

         21. Subject refuses to provide informed consent or is unwilling or unable to follow study
             procedures.
