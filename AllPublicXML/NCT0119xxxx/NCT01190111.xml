    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 20µg/kg/week of Interleukin-7
      (CYT107), the biological activity and safety of repeated cycles of CYT107, for a maximum of 4
      cycles within 21 months and a maximum of 3 cycles within 12 months.

      This was a phase IIa study assessing weekly doses of CYT107 in addition to antiviral
      treatment (HAART) in adult patients with HIV.

      CYT107 were administered at the dose of 20 µg/kg based on the patient's weight, in 3 weekly
      administrations. CYT107 Subcutaneous injection administered at the clinic or day hospital

      Patients were followed every 3 months for primary and secondary biological activity criteria
      as well as safety up to 24 months long term follow-up with quarterly visits.

      A cycle = 3 weekly administrations; D/d0; D/d7; D/d14 For all patients there will be a
      maximum of 3 cycles over 12 months and a maximum of 4 cycles over 21 months, for a total
      duration on study of 24 months.

      All patients were receiving and continued to receive combination antiretroviral therapy while
      on-study.

      Pre-medication was not be used systematically but might be administered if needed according
      to standard clinical practice.

      During the study visits the following may be done:

        -  Medical history, physical examination, blood tests every visit.

        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG)

        -  Chest x-ray study

        -  Liver/spleen imaging

        -  Blood sample collections at frequent intervals for laboratory tests (Virology: HIV RNA
           &amp;HIV DNA;Pharmacodynamics/Immunology;Bacterial translocation )

        -  Urine tests several times during the study.

      PBMCs collections for immunological testing

      An optional substudy on gut biopsy performed prior and at month 3 after the first CYT107
      cycle to evaluate T cell homing

To further characterize, the safety profile established with CYT107 at 20 µg/kg including monitoring of HIV RNA and immunogenicity.
To further examine CYT107 effect on HIV specific T-cells.
To document other properties of IL-7, (ie: T-cell homing within the GI tract).
To assess the sustained CD4 increase until the end of the two years
the safety of CYT107 treatment over the same period

    <time_frame>every 3 months up to the end of study period 2years</time_frame>
    <description>Immune Monitoring will consist on T-cell subsets identification and quantification (such as RTE, naïve/effector and memory CD4 and CD8 T-cells, B cells, CD4 CD25 Fox P3 regulatory T-cells), quantification of the expression of CD127 and the evaluation of T-cell cycling and survival.
T-cell Repertoire Diversity:
Thymopoiesis Evaluation: Quantification of sjTRECs and βTRECs will be done by Real Time Quantitative PCR, and Ratio values will be analyzed.
GUT Biopsy - T-cell Homing :Essential receptors expression for intestinal homing, namely the integrin α4β7 and CCR9, the receptor for the gut-associated chemokine TECK/CCL25 could be assessed as well as molecules for T-cell trafficking (CCR7, CXCR4, CXCL12...) in the gut biopsies.
Immunogenicity: antidrug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing ADA will be tested. In case of a positive sample, the test will be repeated every 3 months until negative.</description>
