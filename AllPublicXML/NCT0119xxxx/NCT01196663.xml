    <textblock>
      This Clinical study is preformed in order to estimate the performance of the TMS thermometer
      and to make a final tuning of the thermometer mathematical algorithm.

      Body temperature of men, women and children will be measured using the TMS thermometer.

      Each Patient will be measured both with the TMS thermometer and with an esophageal or urinal
      thermometer as a reference.

    <textblock>
      Temperature measurement is vital during surgery. Accurate temperature reading can indicate
      patient's condition and alarm if something is wrong.

      Nowadays, during surgeries temperature is measured mostly using an esophageal or a urinal
      thermometer, both of which are invasive, therefore they complicate the procedure and require
      time and activity of the medical stuff.

      The TMS thermometer combines a noninvasive, biocompatible patch, which is attached to the
      body, and a receiving unit, which is placed near the body or the vital signs monitors and
      receives data from the patch. There is no connection between the body and the receiving unit.
      The measurement is based on a conductive sensor that measures the skin temperature and
      applies special algorithm in order to calculate the core body temperature.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the performance of the TMS thermometer and
      improve its algorithm by comparing its measurement to the esophageal or urinal temperature
      measurement
