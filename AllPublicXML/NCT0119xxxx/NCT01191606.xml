    <textblock>
      One-lung ventilation (OLV) during thoracic surgery, in particular, video-assisted thoracic
      surgery is a standard practice to facilitate surgical exposure, but arterial hypoxemia has
      been a serious complication during one lung ventilation. Furthermore, recent studies have
      shown that one lung ventilation with a conventional tidal volume can involve lung injury
      associated with alveolar overdistension and high airway pressure. Therefore, lung protective
      ventilation with a low tidal volume during one lung ventilation has been suggested, and a
      recent study showed that protective ventilation during lung cancer surgery was associated
      with improved postoperative respiratory outcomes such as reduced incidence of acute lung
      injury and atelectasis.

      During protective one lung ventilation limiting airway pressure and using low tidal volume,
      it is important to provide uniform alveolar expansion and maintain adequate oxygenation. A
      previous study suggested that the decelerating inspiratory flow delivery used in pressure
      controlled ventilation improved ventilation/perfusion distribution and arterial oxygenation
      during one lung ventilation5. Moreover, according to a recent study during laparoscopic
      obesity surgery, pressure-controlled ventilation improved oxygenation compared with volume
      controlled ventilation, which was associated with higher instantaneous flow peaks and a
      better alveolar recruitment6. On the other hand, other studies showed that ventilatory mode
      during one lung ventilation did not affect arterial oxygenation. However, these studies were
      performed during mechanical ventilation using conventional tidal volume, and the effect of
      ventilatory mode during protective one lung ventilation on oxygenation has not been clearly
      determined yet.The aim of this study is to determine the effects of pressure controlled
      ventilation during protective one lung ventilation on blood gases, airway pressures and
      hemodynamic variables compared with volume controlled ventilation.

After 30 min, the ventilator was switched to pressure controlled ventilation and the inspiratory pressure was adjusted to obtain the tidal volume 6 mL/kg. No external positive end-expiratory pressure was applied throughout the entire study. Arterial PaO2, PaCO2, peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak), mean inspiratory pressure (Pmean), plateau inspiratory pressure (Pplateau) were recorded at the end of each ventilaroty mode.</description>
