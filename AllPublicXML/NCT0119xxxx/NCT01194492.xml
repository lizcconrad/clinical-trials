      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the kinetics of endogenous albumin is
      altered by the generalized inflammation caused by major abdominal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Albumin infusions have been used for expansion of the plasma volume for more than 60 years,
      not only in the operating room, but also in trauma and sepsis. However, there is an ongoing
      debate whether albumin is good or bad for the patient compared to other intravenous fluids,
      in different situations. Our research program aims at exploring this issue, starting by
      describing how the body handles the endogenous albumin in connection with severe
      inflammation. The final goal is to improve fluid treatment for these patients.

      Plasma albumin is often decreased in inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms are not
      well described. Two aspects of albumin kinetics will be covered in this study by measurements
      immediately before and two days after major abdominal surgery, that will serve as a model for
      generalized inflammation. Albumin fractional synthesis rate will be determined by the
      incorporation of deuterium labelled phenylalanine into plasma albumin. Albumin distribution
      will be measured as transcapillary escape rate of radioiodinated albumin. By assessment of
      P-albumin and plasma volume it will be possible to calculate albumin absolute rate of
      synthesis and albumin absolute flux from the central compartment, respectively.
