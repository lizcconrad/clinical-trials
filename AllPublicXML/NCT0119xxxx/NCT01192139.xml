    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate bioequivalence (BE) of a 5 mg saxagliptin/500 mg
      metformin extended release (XR) fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet (manufactured in Mt
      Vernon, Indiana [IN]) to coadministered 5 mg saxagliptin and 500 mg metformin XR tablet
      (manufactured in Evansville, IN) in fed healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate if the FDC tablet of 5 mg saxagliptin/500 mg metformin
      extended release (manufactured in Mt Vernon, Indiana) is bioequivalent to the coadministered
      5 mg saxagliptin and 500 mg metformin XR tablet (manufactured in Evansville, Indiana)
