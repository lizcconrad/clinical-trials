    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether left ventricular endocardial pacing
      exhibits a greater acute hemodynamic response during biventricular pacing in patients who do
      not show this response to standard cardiac resynchronization therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacemakers and implantable cardiac
      defibrillators (ICD) has proven to be a valuable therapy in selected patients with systolic
      heart failure, ameliorating both morbidity and mortality. However, with current selection
      criteria and implant technique, about 20 to 30 % of patients remain non-responders.
      Non-responders might be due to failing selection criteria or methodology in casu
      echocardiography. However, an important number of non-responders may result of sub-optimal
      positioning of the left ventricular lead, remote from the site of delayed activation.
      Endocardial left ventricular stimulation may ameliorate the shortcomings of epicardial
      stimulation. The advantage of an endocardial approach is the absence of phrenic nerve
      stimulation which regularly complicates epicardial pacing, a more predictable pacing
      threshold and much less restriction to position the lead in the area of interest. Transseptal
      left ventricular endocardial pacing has already been used in patients in whom standard
      epicardial pacing was not applicable.

    <description>a temporary pacemaker lead will be introduced through the aortic valve to evaluate the effect of left ventricular endocardial pacing. Four different pacing sites (basal and apical septal, basal and apical lateral) will be investigated with measurement of LV dP/dtmax. Afterwards, the endocardial pacing lead will be removed.</description>
