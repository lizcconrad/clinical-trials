  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to translate basic behavioral and social science discoveries into
      effective behavioral interventions that reduce obesity and obesity related morbidity in Black
      and Latino communities. This intervention will focus on promoting small changes in eating
      behavior and increasing physical activity among Black and Latino participants in Harlem and
      the South Bronx. The desired result from these activities is individual weight loss that will
      be sustained years after participation in the study.

      SCALE is a five year study (October 1, 2009 through June 30, 2014) funded by NHLBI. The study
      will examine the possibility and acceptance of a mindful eating intervention in African
      American and Latino participants. We will test whether positive thinking can protect
      participants against the negative impact that stress and depression can have on making
      positive behavior changes such as mindful eating and physical activity.

      Currently, the SCALE study is in the trial phase. Among overweight or obese Black or Latino
      adults who live in Harlem or the South Bronx, the primary goal of this project is to achieve
      weight loss of 7% or more over 12 months by making small sustained changes in eating behavior
      coupled with sustained increases in physical activity. Participants are enrolled for 12
      months and are randomized to one of two study groups.

      Group 1: Will choose one of ten small change eating strategies, a physical activity goal and
      will receive the positive affect/self affirmation component.

      Group 2: Will choose one of ten small change eating strategies and a physical activity goal
