  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temple University is conducting a National Institute of Health funded research study designed
      to develop and refine a family-based treatment manual for young adults with Anorexia Nervosa
      as well as assess the feasibility of this out-patient psychotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric illness that occurs in an estimated 0.5 to
      3.7% of women. The illness severely affects physical, emotional, and social functioning. The
      mortality rates associated with this severely disabling condition are higher than those for
      any other psychiatric disorder and substantially higher than those expected in the general
      population. Lower weight at presentation, longer illness duration, and alcohol abuse are
      associated with a higher risk of mortality.

      Treatment-outcome for adult AN is poor with a quarter of adults with AN having poor outcome.
      In AN, promising outcomes are seen in family-based treatment (FBT) for adolescent patients
      who present between the ages of 12 to 18 with a short duration of illness. A manualized
      version of FBT has now been tested in several studies and case series, showing that well over
      80% of participants had good or intermediate outcome at post-treatment. Despite its efficacy
      with adolescents, FBT has not been utilized with young adults.

      The purpose of this study is to develop and refine FBT to promote weight gain in young adults
      with Anorexia Nervosa.
