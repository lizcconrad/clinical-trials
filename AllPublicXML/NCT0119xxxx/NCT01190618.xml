    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate outcomes in patients having vaginal prolapse repair
      with the Elevate prolapse repair kit and compare these outcomes to patients who had a repair
      with Prolift. .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the less invasive Elevate mesh results in a shorter
      operative time, lower blood loss, complications, postoperative pain and earlier discharge
      from the hospital.
