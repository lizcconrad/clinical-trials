    <textblock>
      Results of liver transplantation, the best theoretical treatment for HCC, are limited by
      tumor recurrence. In order to limit this risk Milan criteria was proposed in 1996. However,
      these criteria are to restrictive and approximately 40% of patients denied by Milan criteria
      may be cured by liver transplantation.

      The purpose of this study was thus to prospectively evaluate factors predicting tumor
      recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC and then to reassess criteria for liver
      transplantation.

      In this study, the investigators studied the predictive value of imaging techniques such as
      CT, MRI, PET scan, of serological markers and molecular markers assessed before liver
      transplantation at listing.

      The investigators also evaluated the predictive value of tumor growing during the waiting
      time (imaging and serological).

      Finally, the investigators compared pre-LT data and explanted liver analysis to evaluate
      accuracy of liver biopsy and of imaging.
