    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of consistent
      dosages of the study drug (hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 and sodium chloride injection,
      Vuloven) administrated intravenously for 7 days.

      This study will recruit 120 male and female patients between 18 and 75 years of age who are
      diagnosed with brain hypoperfusion within the unilateral arteries branching from the internal
      carotid artery with or without cerebral infarction. All subjects are taking up to routine
      treatment medications.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of
      consistent dosages of the study drug (hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 and sodium chloride
      injection, Vuloven) administrated intravenously for 7 days.

      Each patient who qualifies and chooses to participate in the study will be randomly assigned
      into treatment groups (consistent dose of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 and sodium chloride
      injection of 500 ml/day, 1000 ml/day or 1500 ml/day) or control group (placebo control).

      The parameters of clinic visits will include a medical history, physical exam, clinical
      laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using T1-weighted scan, T2-weighted scan
      and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and computed
      tomography (CT) perfusion.
