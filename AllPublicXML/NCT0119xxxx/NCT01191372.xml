        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adult male patients ≥18 to ≤75 years of age.

          -  Hemophilia of any type or severity.

          -  Patients who are negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) I and II antibody tests at screening.

          -  Male patients who, with their partners, are willing to use 2 effective, methods of
             contraception (i.e., for both self and partner) throughout the study and for at least
             3 months after discontinuation of study drug treatment.

          -  All patients must be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and must
             have signed the informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients;

          -  If on a prophylactic coagulation factor concentrate regimen, inability or
             unwillingness to discontinue prophylaxis during participation in this study.

          -  Existence of other co-existing bleeding disorder (e.g., von Willebrand Disease).

          -  Medical history of venous or arterial thromboembolism.

          -  Scheduled for elective surgical procedure during the conduct of this study.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days of study entry.

          -  Transaminase values &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) at time of screening.

          -  Haemoglobin &lt;12.0 g/dL.

          -  Participants who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have a significant infection or
             known inflammatory process on screening.

          -  Participants who have a clinically relevant history or presence of respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, lymphatic, neurological, cardiovascular,
             psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, dermatological, connective
             tissue diseases or disorders.

          -  Any medical condition the investigator believes would place the patient at increased
             risk as a result of participation in the study e.g. history of thromboembolic disease
             or stroke.

          -  Any medication the investigator considers may increase the risk of adverse effects
             during the study.
