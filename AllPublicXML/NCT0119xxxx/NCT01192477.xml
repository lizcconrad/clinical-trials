  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increases in air pollution are associated with increases in deaths from cardiovascular
      disease, but the investigators know little about how ozone air pollution affects the
      cardiovascular system. The investigators proposed study will determine the effects of ozone
      on blood vessel and heart function that could worsen illness in people with underlying heart
      disease. This will be accomplished by studying healthy volunteers who inhale ozone in a
      controlled clinical study, and also by studying their exposure to ozone and other pollutants
      during their normal daily activities. The investigators will study volunteers who may be at
      increased risk for the effects of ozone because of genetic susceptibility. Understanding the
      effects of ozone on the heart and circulation can help establish appropriate air pollution
      standards, and provide strategies to protect the most susceptible people.

    <description>We hypothesize that systemic vascular effects of exposure to ozone will be reflected in reductions in arterial blood nitrite or its A/V gradient. This will require simultaneous collection of venous and arterial blood.</description>

    <description>We hypothesize that systemic vascular effects of exposure to ozone will alter markers of vascular function and inflammation. Flow cytometry will be used to detect activated platelets and pro-coagulant circulating microparticles.</description>
