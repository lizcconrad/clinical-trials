        Patients enrolled in the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Diabetes
        Mellitus study, which is a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 4 study of cardiovascular
        outcomes). 12,000 patients with type 2 diabetes and either a history of a cardiovascular
        event or multiple risk factors for vascular disease. Patients will be distributed as
        follows: at least 30% in North America, approximately 30% in Europe, and the remainder in
        South America, Asia, Australia, and South Africa.
