  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lifestyle consulting program through one year follow-up could effective increase the
      scores of health responsibility and nutrition according to the past three-year study.
      Behavior change is a dynamic and complex process. Using a long-term follow up approach will
      be able to understand the trajectory of behavior change. The purpose of this study is to
      explore life experience and lifestyle intervention program for patients with chronic kidney
      disease using mixed methods with a longitudinal approach. The first year of this study will
      include a qualitative study with in depth interview of the subjects who attend previous study
      in the research team and have the scores of health promoting lifestyle among the highest 27%
      and lowest 27%. The life experience will be explored. The quantitative study will be an
      experimental design. Qualified subjects will be randomly assigned to intervention or control
      group. The intervention protocol is based on trans-theoretical model. Each subject will be
      followed every six months. The second and third year of studies will continue to use the
      qualitative and quantitative approach to understand the life experience and meaning among
      patients with chronic kidney diseases. The trajectory of life experience and life style
      changes will be explored. The method may strengthen the effectiveness of lifestyle program
      and may provide comprehensive understanding of the trajectory of behavior changes among
      patient with chronic kidney disease.
