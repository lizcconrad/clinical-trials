      Wounds to be treated under this protocol should be acute non-infected wounds or post surgical
      infected wounds in hospitalized subjects. One ulcer per subject will be treated for a maximum
      duration of 3 weeks. All subjects will receive continuous negative pressure treatment with
      the new NPWT system with a pressure level of -120 mmHg or according to clinicians'
      instruction based on the indication.

      10-15 subjects at two sites will be enrolled provided that they fulfil all the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and who have signed and dated a written informed
      consent.

      The subjects will be consecutively allocated to a specific subject identification code. The
      primary variable wound healing and granulation tissue formation will be assessed by digital
      planimeter, digital photography and visual estimation.

      Subject pain will be measured by using the Visual Analogue Scale, VAS. Subject and
      investigator convenience will be assessed by convenience surveys. Diagnosis and treatment of
      wound infections according to clinical routine.
