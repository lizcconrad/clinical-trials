    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of one booster vaccination with
      45 μg of a recombinant H5N1 influenza (A/Indonesia/05/2005) HA vaccine in healthy young
      adults, previously primed with a two-vaccination of 3 different doses of a recombinant H5N1
      influenza (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) HA vaccine in a priming study (JPIP501-01a, NCT00980447).
