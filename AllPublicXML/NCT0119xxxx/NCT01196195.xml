    <textblock>
      The trial will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy and acceptability of twice-
      and once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (Kaletra) dosed by weight in HIV-1
      infected children who are currently taking lopinavir/ritonavir as part of their combination
      antiretroviral therapy and who are currently achieving virological suppression (&lt;50
      copies/ml). Specifically:

        -  To confirm weight-based dosing recommendations by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of
           twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir half strength formulation tablets dosed on body weight
           and comparing to historical adult and paediatric data of pharmacokinetics of
           lopinavir/ritonavir soft gel capsules and oral solution respectively (1, 2).

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetics of twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir tablets with
           once-daily dosing in the same children.

        -  To evaluate whether once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir is comparable to
           twice-daily dosing in terms of virological suppression at 48 weeks. Adherence and
           acceptability will also be compared.

             containing regimen (where virological failure is defined as two successive HIV-1 RNA
             results&gt;1000 copies/ml (confirmed) more than 24 weeks after starting highly active
             antiretroviral therapy (HAART), i.e changes for toxicity are not counted as failure)

          -  acute illness

          -  abnormal renal or liver function (grade 3 or above)

          -  receiving concomitant therapy except for prophylaxis; Some treatments may be allowed,
