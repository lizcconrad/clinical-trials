  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic periodontitis is a common infectious disease characterized by progressive attachment
      loss and alveolar bone resorption eventually resulting in tooth loss. The ultimate goal of
      periodontal therapy is to prevent this endpoint. At least when a strict supportive care
      program is implemented following active therapy, subsequent tooth loss is limited to a mean
      of about 0.1 per patient per year. In contrast, three to six times as many teeth may be lost
      if the disease is left untreated.

      The objective of supportive care is to prevent disease recurrence, which is accomplished by
      strict home care and professional plaque control at regular intervals depending on the
      patient's needs. Evidently, not all patients are optimally compliant in terms of plaque
      control. Therefore, chemical aids could be administered to supplement mechanical plaque
      removal.

      Essential oils solutions containing menthol, thymol, methyl salicylate and eucalyptol as
      active agents may be more appropriate to supplement daily home care. Clinical studies have
      shown an additional anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis effect over mechanical plaque control
      without relevant side effects in healthy subjects and gingivitis patients.

      Recently, significant reductions of periodontopathogens in the subgingival biofilm have been
      shown in periodontitis patients following subgingival irrigation using an essential oils
      solution. In addition, mouthrinsing on a daily basis seemed to substantially alter the
      subgingival microflora towards a less pathogenic one in gingivitis and periodontitis
      patients. Even though these are interesting findings, they should be considered exploratory
      since they relate to a small number of patients observed for only two weeks.

      The goal of the present study was to thoroughly document the clinical and microbiological
      effects of an essential oils solution used on a daily basis for 3 months as an adjunct to
      mechanical plaque control measures in a large number of chronic periodontitis patients in
      supportive care.
