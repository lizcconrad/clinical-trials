  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of left or right high-frequency DTMS on ADHD
      symptoms, cognitive performance and decision-making ability of ADHD adults, and to compare
      this to the effect of sham DTMS on ADHD adults

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit disorder in adults may be due to hypoactivity of prefrontal areas of the
      brain. Increasing the activity of these areas may help improve symptoms in many of these
      patients. In addition there is evidence as to dysfunction in both hemispheres of the brain,
      but it is difficult to determine the contribution of each hemisphere's pattern of activity to
      behavioral impairment. The purpose of this study is to use high-frequency DTMS to stimulate
      activity either on the left side of the prefrontal cortex (one arm), or on the right side (a
      second arm), to see if such stimulation improves attention, comparing to sham DTMS simulation
      (a third arm).

    <description>DTMS treatment will be given for 3 weeks, 5 days a week. Before each DTMS treatment, neural network excitation practice will be done using AttenGo software (AttenGo, Herzlia, Israel).
Each treatment day: Follow-up to evaluate clinical side effects of treatment. Two additional meetings with DTMS treatment and follow-up will be held to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and side effects. The first will be four weeks after the end of the daily treatment phase; the second eight weeks after the end of the daily treatment phase.</description>

          -  Appropriate diagnosis of ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria:

             o DSM-IV criteria require not only that the ADHD symptoms be present now

          -  Subjects taking medications for attention deficit disorder will give their consent to
             stop the drugs from a week before the start of participation in the study, and during
             the daily treatment phase (four weeks total); subjects also will be asked not to take
             these medications 24 hours before participation in the review meetings (4 and 8 weeks
             after the end of the daily treatment phase).

          -  Subjects have given their written and oral consent to participate in research.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorder.

          -  Use of antipsychotic stabilizers; other than benzodiazepines if necessary to a daily
             dosage equivalent to 2 mg Lorazepam.

          -  History of lack of tolerance to TMS.

          -  Diagnosis of severe DSM-IV personality disorder.

          -  Current suicidal tendency.

          -  Uncontrolled high blood pressure

          -  History of epilepsy, seizures or fever convulsions.

          -  History of plastic or metal implants, including metallic particles in the eye,
             pacemaker, implanted hearing aid devices, use of neurostimulators, or any medical
             pump.

          -  A history of drug or alcohol misuse.

          -  People who lack judgment or are unable to communicate with the experimenters.

          -  Participation in any other medical research during the three months prior to the time
