      The aim of the study is to identify patients with gallstone disease that should be operated
      and those that may potentially be observed. This selection was based on symptoms and clinical
      presentation. The consequences that may arise for the patient if observation is chosen
      compared with outcome after cholecystectomy has been markers of outcome.

      1. Randomized clinical trial (RCT) of observation versus surgery for uncomplicated
           gallstone disease

        2. RCT of observation versus operation for acute cholecystitis

        3. Study of outcome after cholecystectomy in patients from 1. and 2.

        4. Study of symptoms in gallstone disease and symptom relief after cholecystectomy

        5. Long-term morbidity and mortality, including cancer, after cholecystectomy

        6. Long-term follow-up of patients with silent gallstones
