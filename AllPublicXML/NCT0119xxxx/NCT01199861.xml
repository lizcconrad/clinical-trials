    <time_frame>Week 6 (pre-vaccination) and 3 weeks after vaccination (Study week 9)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who responded to treatment with the seasonal influenza vaccine 3 weeks after vaccination. Response was defined as patients fulfilling one of the following criteria for at least one of the three strains contained in the seasonal influenza vaccine:
Seroconversion: The pre-vaccination antibody titer measurement was &lt;1:10 and the post-vaccination measurement is ≥1:40.
Significant increase in antibody titer: The pre-vaccination antibody titer measurement was ≥1:10 and the increase in antibody titer from this to the post-vaccination measurement is ≥ 4-fold.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with an immune response to a single dose of tetanus toxoid three weeks after vaccination. A patient was considered a responder to tetanus toxoid booster vaccination if one of the following criteria was met:
Seroconversion: The pre-vaccination antibody titer measurement was &lt;0.1 IU/ml and the post-vaccination measurement was ≥0.4 IU/ml.
Significant increase: The pre-vaccination antibody titer measurement was ≥0.1 IU/ml and the increase in antibody titer from this to the post-vaccination measurement was ≥4- fold.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Antibody-titer 3 Weeks After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-vaccination (Week 6) and 3 weeks after vaccination (Study Week 9).</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline was expressed by the ratio of post-vaccination to pre-vaccination antibody titer for each of the three strains included in the seasonal influenza vaccine. Inhibition of an immune response to each strain included in the seasonal influenza vaccine was assessed by the relative difference of the geometric mean antibody titer ratio on fingolimod as compared to placebo three weeks after a single dose of seasonal influenza vaccine.</description>

    <description>Relationship to study drug was determined by the investigator (suspected/not suspected).
A serious AE is defined as an event which fulfills one of the following criteria:
is fatal or life-threatening;
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
is medically significant, i.e., jeopardizes the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
