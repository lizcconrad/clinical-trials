  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will design a curriculum for visual screening for melanoma and skin biopsy
      procedure, based on the mastery learning model, using simulators and web-based didactic
      instruction for medical students and internal medicine residents. This requires having a skin
      simulation model that presents a range of lesions from benign nevus to atypical nevus to
      melanoma in a distribution and density that mimics the clinical findings of those with 2 skin
      tones: fair-skin non- Hispanic white and Hispanic.
