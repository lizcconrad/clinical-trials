  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether disease-related expressive writing is effective
      in the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Expressive writing involves writing about traumatic, stressful or emotional events.
      Expressive writing, for as little as 3-5 sessions of 20 minutes, has been found to improve
      both physical and psychological health based on health outcome measures such as number of
      doctor's visits and hospital days, blood pressure control, lung and immune function, and
      pain. Given its simplicity, and obvious advantages in terms of cost efficiency, expressive
      writing appears to have great potential as a therapeutic tool or as a means of self-help,
      either alone or as an adjunct to traditional therapies. This modality has not been studied in
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common gastrointestinal condition, which is lacking
      well-defined etiology or treatments and is best understood in a biopsychosocial context.
