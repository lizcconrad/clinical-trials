      This is a phase I neoadjuvant gene therapy followed by prostatectomy, open-label,
      dose-escalation trial for prostate cancer patients with high risk of local recurrence after
      radical prostatectomy. Patients entered into this trial will have Prostate Cancer of Clinical
      stage T1c, T2 or T3 with a Gleason Score of between 7 (4+3) and 10 at the time of enrollment.
      Patients will receive three 1 mL injections (3 mL total volume) of Ad-REIC/Dkk-3 into the
      prostate prior to undergoing a radical prostatectomy. Three patients will be treated at each
      dose level unless a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed or MFD (defined as 1 x 10e12
      vp/treatment) is achieved with expansion for up to 6 more patients at the MTD or MFD.

      This is a phase I neoadjuvant gene therapy followed by prostatectomy, open-label,
      dose-escalation trial for prostate cancer patients with high risk of local recurrence after
      radical prostatectomy. Patients entered into this trial will have Prostate Cancer of Clinical
      stage T1c, T2 or T3 with a Gleason Score of between 7 (4+3) and 10 at the time of enrollment.

      Patients will receive three 1 mL injections (3 mL total volume) of Ad-REIC/Dkk-3 into the
      prostate under transrectal ultrasound-guidance (TRUS) and, patients will undergo a radical
      prostatectomy four weeks after the injection.

      Patients will receive treatment at one of three dose levels in a sequential dose-escalating
      design.

      Three patients will be treated at each dose level unless a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is
      observed or MFD (defined as 1 x 10e12 vp/treatment) is achieved. Enrollment will proceed to
      the next dose level if 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT; if one of the first 3 patients
      experiences a DLT, three additional patients will be enrolled until a second patient
      experiences a DLT (which defines the toxic dose) or until six total patients have been
      treated at that dose level, whichever comes first. If a second DLT is not experienced within
      that cohort, dose escalation may continue.

      Additional patients will be enrolled a minimum of 14 days after treatment of the first
      patient in the cohort (sentinel patient).

      If 2 DLTs are observed within a cohort, enrollment into the cohort will cease and the dose
      level immediately preceding that dose will be determined to be the MTD. If 2 non-lethal DLTs
      are observed in Cohort 1, a lower dose cohort (Cohort -1) may be initiated.

      Once the MTD is defined, an additional 3-6 patients may be enrolled at that dose level to
      further evaluate safety of the MTD.

      Patients will undergo a scheduled radical prostatectomy approximately 4 weeks after the
      Ad-REIC/Dkk-3 injection. The prostate tissue removed will be retained and for those patients
      treated at the MTD, assessed for REIC expression and evidence of apoptosis by TUNEL staining.

    <description>REIC (Reduced Expression in Immortalized Cells) protein is down regulated in a variety of cancer cell lines including prostate tumors. The REIC gene is identical to the Dickkopf-3 (Dkk-3) gene that is a member of the Dickkopf gene family. Ad-REIC/Dkk-3 is designed as a viral vector that delivers a DNA plasmid capable of producing intracellular REIC protein. The expression plasmid includes the full-length human cDNA sequence for REIC. The adenovirus vector is a transport mechanism to infuse the REIC/Dkk-3 plasmid into the cell providing a temporary transfusion of REIC protein.</description>

          5. In good general health, free from clinically significant illness or disease (as
             determined by medical/surgical history, physical examination, weight, 12-lead ECG, and
             clinical laboratory tests)

          6. Appropriate surgical candidate for radical prostatectomy and a performance status of ≤
             2 (Zubrod scale)

          7. Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral
             granulocyte count ≥ 1,500 and platelet count of ≥ 100,000, adequate hepatic function
             with a total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl and ALT &lt; 4x the upper limits of normal, adequate
             renal function defined as serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl

         10. Patient is willing to refrain from sexual activity or agrees to use a barrier
             contraceptive device (e.g. condom) after treatment with Ad-REIC/Dkk-3 and until the

         11. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of the study, in keeping with the policies of the institution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous or current hormonal treatment, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy
             or other investigational status drug within the past 4 weeks.

          2. Unable to tolerate transrectal ultrasound.

          3. Patients who are not appropriate surgical candidates for radical prostatectomy based
             on the evaluation of co-existent medical diseases and competing causes of death.

          4. Patients with uncontrolled cardiac, hepatic, renal or neurologic/psychiatric disorders
             are not eligible.

          5. Patients who are HIV positive or have chronic hepatitis B or C infections are not
             eligible (because of possible immune effects of these conditions).

          6. Patients with a clinical history of primary or secondary immunodeficiency, autoimmune
             disease or patients taking immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids
             continuously for &gt; 4 months [&gt; 5 mg hydrocortisone/day] are ineligible. (The
             experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune
             system. Patients who have a decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the
             experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

          7. As a result of medical review, physical examination, the Principal Investigator (or
             medically qualified nominee) considers the subject unfit for the study.
