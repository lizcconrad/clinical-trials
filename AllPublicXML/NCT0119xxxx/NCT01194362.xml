  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For this study, blood and tissue samples will be collected in order to perform genetic
      testing to help researchers gather information about this disease and how and why it affects
      some patients more than others.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cause of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and its associated co morbidities is unknown. There
      is, however, evidence supporting a genetic cause for the BAV, Pedigree analysis of familial
      clustering initially directed investigators to a genetic cause of BAV. Subsequent studies on
      BAV patients using linkage analysis have demonstrated high heritability.

      Early identification of those patients with BAV disease who are at risk for ascending
      aneurysm formation and its complications may allow early intervention to prevent rupture,
      dissection and emergent cardiac surgery in at risk patients. Conversely, identification of
      those patients with BAVs not at risk for aortic aneurysm formation would delineate which
      patients do not need close follow up of aortic size or prophylactic ascending aortic
      replacement at time of aortic valve replacement.
