  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate whether asenapine, which is approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults, is also
      effective in adolescents with schizophrenia. Participants who qualify for the study will be
      randomly assigned to receive a fixed dose of asenapine (either 2.5 mg or 5 mg twice daily
      [BID]) or placebo for 8 weeks. Throughout the study, observations will be made on each
      participant at various times to assess the efficacy and safety of the study treatment. The
      primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate significant superiority of at least one
      asenapine dose to placebo, as measured by the change from baseline of the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Day 56.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 3 subscales: positive subscale (7 items), negative subscale (7 items), and general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions (e.g., emotional withdrawal). For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 30 PANSS items, and ranged from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Day 56</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 3 subscales: positive subscale (7 items), negative subscale (7 items), and general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions (e.g., emotional withdrawal). For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 30 PANSS items, and ranged from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <description>This measure reports results for the 7 items of the positive subscale of the PANSS, which is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument used to assess the symptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS positive subscale score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 7 subscale items, and ranged from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive and Negative Subscale Scores Combined at Day 56</title>
        <description>This measure reports results for the combined positive subscale (7 items) and negative subscale (7 items) of the PANSS, which is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument used to assess the symptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions (e.g., emotional withdrawal). For each of the total 14 items in the combined positive and negative subscales, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS positive and negative subscale scores combined for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 14 combined subscale items, and ranged from 14 to 98 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Marder Positive Symptoms Factor Score at Day 56</title>
        <description>This measure reports results for the 8 items of the Marder positive symptoms factor of the PANSS, which is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument used to assess the symptoms of schizophrenia. Marder factors are a modified grouping of the 30 PANSS items (Marder et al. J Clin Psychiatry 1997;58(12):538-46). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS Marder positive symptoms factor score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 8 applicable Marder factor items, and ranged from 8 to 56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Marder Positive Symptoms Factor Score at Day 56</title>
          <description>This measure reports results for the 8 items of the Marder positive symptoms factor of the PANSS, which is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument used to assess the symptoms of schizophrenia. Marder factors are a modified grouping of the 30 PANSS items (Marder et al. J Clin Psychiatry 1997;58(12):538-46). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS Marder positive symptoms factor score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 8 applicable Marder factor items, and ranged from 8 to 56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

Marder factors are a modified grouping of the 30 PANSS items. For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS Marder hostility/excitement factor score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 4 applicable Marder factor items, and ranged from 4 to 28 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Cumulative Percentage of Participants With Total PANSS 30% Response at End of Study</title>
        <description>A total PANSS 30% response was defined as a reduction from baseline of at least 30% in the PANSS Total score. The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The Total score is the sum of the ratings for the individual items, and ranged from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The Kaplan-Meier estimate reports the cumulative percentage of participants with total PANSS 30% response from first drug intake up to approximately Day 59.</description>

          <description>CGI-I response was defined as the occurrence of a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). CGI-I is a 7-point scale for assessing the global improvement of the participant’s illness relative to baseline, with ratings from 1=very much improved to 7=very much worse. The Kaplan-Meier estimate reports the cumulative percentage of participants with CGI-I response from first drug intake up to approximately Day 58.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ-LES-Q) Total Score at Day 56</title>
        <description>PQ-LES-Q is a questionnaire to assess quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction in children and adolescents. The participant is asked to rate 15 items reflecting quality of life with respect to the previous week on a scale of 1=very poor to 5=very good. Items 1-14 assess specific areas (e.g., your health, your mood or feelings); Item 15 is a global assessment of overall quality of life. The PQ-LES-Q total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the first 14 items, and ranged from 14 to 70 with a higher score indicating better quality of life. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in quality of life is represented by positive values. This analysis used a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach; if no Day 56 value was available for a participant, the last available assessment prior to the Day 56 assessment was used.</description>

Items 1-14 assess specific areas (e.g., your health, your mood or feelings); Item 15 is a global assessment of overall quality of life. The Item 15 result is defined to be the PQ-LES-Q overall score, and ranged from 1 to 5 with a higher score indicating better quality of life. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 56; improvement in quality of life is represented by positive values. This analysis used an LOCF approach; if no Day 56 value was available for a participant, the last available assessment prior to the Day 56 assessment was used.</description>
