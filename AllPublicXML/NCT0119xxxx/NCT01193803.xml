      Osteoarticular infections are painful and disabling diseases that require antimicrobial
      treatment adapted to the microorganisms implicated. Microbiological cultures are currently
      regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, the sensitivity
      of these cultures is very variable and depends both on the context in which clinical samples
      are taken, and on the pathogen involved. The rate of detection varies according to infection
      type: from 50 to 70% for infectious spondylodiscitis, 65 to 95% for prosthetic joint
      infections, 50% for gonococcal arthritis and 90% for non-gonococcal arthritis. The aim of the
      study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of microbiological cultures and molecular
      methods in case of osteoarticular infections. The gold standard will be established by an
      expert group of osteoarticular infection (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a
      surgeon, an anatomy-pathologist and a rheumatologist), which established the final diagnosis
      of infected or not infected patients.

      Background: Osteoarticular infections are painful and disabling diseases that require
      antimicrobial treatment adapted to the microorganisms implicated. Microbiological cultures
      are currently regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria and it
      seems that the microbiological cultures are sufficient in most cases to establish the
      diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of these cultures is very variable and depends both on
      the context in which clinical samples are taken, and on the pathogen involved. In addition,
      previous experimental data show that molecular methods could produce a diagnosis missing by
      conventional cultures. Main objective: The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic
      performances of microbiological cultures and molecular method by considering for the
      definition of cases an accumulation of clinical, radiological and biological arguments
      usually used to establish the diagnosis of bone and joint infections. The discordance of the
      two methods will be secondary classified by an expert group of osteoarticular infection
      (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a surgeon, a anatomy-pathologist and a
      rheumatologist).Tested hypothesis:Interest of molecular methods for the diagnosis of
      osteoarticular infections.Secondary objective:Quantification of the delay of the results
      obtained by the two methods Study design: · One centre specialized in osteoarticular
      infections· Observational prospective study· Two methods of diagnosis: cultures and molecular
      methods· An expert group Included patients and number of patients: Total of 284 patients
      composed by 194 cases and 90 controlsIncluded patients (n=194) will all have a suspected
      diagnosis of osteoarticular infections included discitis, septic arthritis and prosthetic
      joint infection defined by inclusions criteria.Results of the included patients will be
      compared to those obtained from the group of control patients (n=90).Protocol of duration:
      Study duration is 6 months for each patientThe protocol duration is planned for 2
      yearsProcedures:All samples will be treated with the same procedure - Samples (synovial
      fluids, biopsies, ..) will be recovered either during surgery, by puncture aspiration at the
      bedside, or by guided ultrasonography, all under sterile conditions (mask, sterile gloves,
      cautious skin preparation and towelling) and transported to the Bacteriology department in
      sterile tubes without additional substrate in less than 12 hours. - Bacteriological
      procedures will be performed according to the guidelines applied for osteoarticular infection
      · Liquid samples: erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, polymorphonuclear percentage · Solid
      specimens: crushed using a mechanic apparatus · Gram and auramine staining· Cultures at 37°C
      on Columbia sheep blood agar (aerobically and anaerobically for 5 days), chocolate agar
      supplemented with IsoVitaleX (with 5% CO2 for 5 days), brain heart infusion broth
      (anaerobically for 15 days with subcultures done after 10 days on the same agar media, even
      if aspect was not cloudy).· Mycobacterial culture : Lowenstein-Jensen and COLETSOS media,
      MGIT incubated for 3 months.- Molecular procedures· DNA manipulations pre- and post-PCR: in
      separate rooms with separate pipetting devices to prevent contamination of samples with
      foreign DNA. · Equipment used in pre-PCR steps: DNA-free and UV-irradiated. · DNA extraction
      based on Boom's method: QIAGEN kit and EZ1 BioRobot · Broad-range 16S rRNA gene amplification
      · Amplicons: sequenced in both directions on an ABIPRISM 3100 analyser (Applied Bio systems,
      COURTABOEUF, France). · Cloning experiments for several sequences in one sample· Analysis of
      sequence: GenBank using the BLASTN program through the website of the National Centre of
      Biotechnology Information.· Internal control PCR: b-actin gene· Real time PCR: for the
      detection of mycobacteria and gonococcal arthritis- Potential implications: We could have
      chosen, like the majority of the studies published to date, to compare our molecular method
      with another method of diagnosis (culture, histology). However, there is not currently gold
      standard and the diagnosis of osteoarticular infections generally rests on an accumulation of
      arguments. The rule of the expert group is to determine, with less possible error, if each
      patient included will be &quot;infected&quot;. This methodology is close to daily clinical reality and
      trusted in physician who was treating the patient. If the study shows an advantage of the
      molecular biology versus classical methods in our groups it would then be justified to
      discuss the diagnosis diagram of osteoarticular infections.
