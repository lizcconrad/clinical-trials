  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators primary objective is to evaluate the effect of a 6 month (3 days/wk)
      supervised, progressive RT program with increased daily milk intake in untrained adolescents
      on measures of body composition and cardiovascular risk factors. The investigators
      hypothesize that milk supplementation will produce significantly greater favorable changes in
      all body composition measures compared with RT + carbohydrate and control.

      We will recruit 150 healthy, adolescent middle school boys and girls (grades 7 through 9),
      BMI &gt; 50th percentile &lt; 98th percentile, who will participate in 6 months of supervised
      resistance training (3 days/wk) and will be randomized to one of 3 groups: RT + milk, RT +
      isocaloric carbohydrate, RT only (control). Both physical activity and diet outside the study
      protocol will be carefully monitored. Measurements will be completed at baseline 3 months and
      upon completion of the training protocol at 6 months.

    <description>On resistance training days, the RT+ milk group will receive milk (280kcals) immediately following exercise and milk at another time during the day. The RT+ juice group will receive fruit juice immediately following resistance exercise and juice again another time during the day. The RT+ water group will receive water following resistance exercise and water at another time during the day.
On non training days, students in the RT+ milk group will receive milk. Students in the RT+ juice group will receive juice. The RT+ water group will receive water during the school day. On non-RT days, the total volume of milk, juice, or water will be split into two administration times during the school day.</description>

          3. No resistance training in the past 6 months.

          4. Endurance training (running, cycling, swimming, walking for exercise etc) not more
             than 3 hr per week, as assessed by screening questionnaire.
