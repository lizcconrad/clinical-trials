      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of post-induction lenalidomide in
      patients with de novo AML with deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality (del (5q)) or monosomy 5
      (-5), who obtained complete remission after conventional induction chemotherapy. So, too, for
      those who no obtained response treatment (total resistance) or partial remission.

      At the same time, the study evaluate the security of lenalidomide.
