      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of manual acupuncture and
      electro-acupuncture on labour pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture is used in obstetric care in spite of insufficient evidence of its potential to
      reduce labour pain. The findings so far are contradictory, which may reflect methodological
      limitations. The present study will take issues into account, such as sufficiently large
      sample to allow detection of possible differences between study groups; optimal timing of the
      intervention; controlling for intensity of the treatment; qualified training of persons
      giving the treatment; biological markers of pain and stress; possible effects on mother and
      infant; women's experiences such as overall birth experience and memory of pain.

    <description>The women will receive treatment on bilateral points, both distal points and local points and the needles will be manually stimulated to reach De Qi every ten minutes during one hour. Eight needles in the painful area (local points) will be connected to an electro-stimulator and stimulated with high frequency (80 Hz) square wave pulses (0.18-ms duration) with alternating polarity. The woman will adjust the intensity of the electrical stimulation to be just under pain threshold.</description>
