    <description>Digital palpation - Evaluates the pelvic floor muscle contraction and assign values according to scales: Oxford (previously validated) and muscular endurance (measured in seconds)
Surface electromyography - evaluates the electrical activity generated by activation of motor units of pelvic floor muscles - during the rest and during the maximum voluntary contraction
2D perineal ultrasound - evaluates the cross sectional area of levator ani muscle.</description>
