  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Governmental agencies in the United Kingdom and Scotland have recently instituted guidelines
      banning physicians' white coats and wearing of long-sleeved garments to decrease hospital
      transmission of bacteria. The purpose of this study is to compare the bacterial contamination
      of physicians' white coats with that of newly laundered, standardized short-sleeved uniforms
      after an eight-hour workday and to determine the rate at which bacterial contamination of the
      uniform ensues. Our hypothesis was that the physician white coat would have more bacterial
      contamination at the end of the work day.

      Governmental agencies in the United Kingdom and Scotland have recently instituted guidelines
      banning physicians' white coats and wearing of long-sleeved garments to decrease nosocomial
      transmission of bacteria. Our goal was to compare the degree of bacterial and
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus contamination of physicians' white coats with
      that of newly laundered, standardized short-sleeved uniforms after an eight-hour workday and
      to determine the rate at which bacterial contamination of the uniform ensues. 100 interns,
      residents, and hospitalists on an internal medicine service were randomized to wear either
      physician white coat or newly laundered, short-sleeved uniform. Bacterial colony counts and
      the frequency with which methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was found was compared
      in the two groups and over time. Our initial hypothesis was that physician white coats would
      have more bacterial contamination at the end of the work day.
