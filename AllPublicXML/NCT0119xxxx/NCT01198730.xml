      central Taiwan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It had been reported that high prevalence of IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) and unknown DM
      (diabetes mellitus) in patients with CAD (coronary artery disease). This study aimed to
      determine the glucose regulation status of patients who were suspected to have CAD in central
      Taiwan. In general, patient who were admitted for CAG (coronary angiography) or MDCT without
      known DM were eligible. After informed consent, OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) was
      performed to determine the glucose regulation status. Study participants will be requested to
      complete questionnaires to assess their risk of diabetes and quality of sleep. Patients who
      were diagnosed as new DM would be asked to follow up after 6-12 months with diet control.
      Treatment with oral anti-diabetic drug may be needed if HbA1c target was not reached.
