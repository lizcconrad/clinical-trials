      The ASK CHILDREN study is intended to aid in future development of various neurologic devices
      (i.e. neuroprostheses). The ASK CHILDREN study seeks to use study information obtained to
      identify more efficient strategies in the evaluation and review of neuroprostheses regulated

      The ASK CHILDREN study is intended to aid in future development of various neurologic devices
      (i.e. neuroprostheses). The ASK CHILDREN study seeks to use study information obtained to
      identify more efficient strategies in the evaluation and review of neuroprostheses regulated
      by the Agency. Specific aims of the clinical study include: (1) Collecting qualitative and
      quantitative self-report clinical data (through interviews) from children undergoing
      treatment related to human factors, safety, usability, and adverse events in patients ages 7
      to 15 years old implanted with a neuroprosthesis targeting the brain or spinal cord (at two 6
      month intervals); and (2) Establish a science-based framework of recommendations based upon
      the data collected in the ASK CHILDREN Study to help develop more efficient strategies in
      evaluating pediatric neuroprostheses regulated by the Agency.
