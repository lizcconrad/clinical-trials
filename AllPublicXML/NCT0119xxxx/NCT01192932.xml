  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed tomography (CT) studies considering bronchial dimensions in chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) have never considered nycthemeral variations. Airway calibre, in
      COPD patients, exhibits a nycthemeral variations with maximal values around noon and minimal
      values in the early morning, that persists under long-acting bronchodilator. Furthermore, no
      study has assessed the possible nycthemeral variations of CT scans parameters reflecting
      airway remodelling and emphysema extent in COPD patients.

      This is a prospective study whose purpose is to assess these variations and their
      relationships with pulmonary function testing (PFT) in COPD patients.

      Patients : COPD patients aged 40 years or more, with a smoking history of &gt; 10 pack-years
      (PY), a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second to vital capacity ratio
      (FEV1/VC) &lt; 0.7 and an optimal treatment according to GOLD guidelines will be included.
      Exclusion criteria are: COPD exacerbation or respiratory infection in the 4 weeks before the
      begin of the study, concomitant pulmonary disease (tuberculosis, significant bronchiectasis,
      lung cancer), pulmonary resection, active malignancy or malignancy of any organ system within
      the past 5 years.

      Procedures: All measurements will be performed on the same day, after obtaining the written
      informed consent of the patient. Medical history, smoking status and patient's treatment will
      be collected.

      At 08:00 AM (T0): PFT will be performed, including vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity
      (FVC), functional residual capacity (FRC), total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV),
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide
      (DLCO), and alveolar volume (VA) measurements (either in absolute values and percentage of
      predicted values). A first CT scan will be performed using the following technique:

        -  Supine CT scan after full inspiration.

        -  Acquisition parameters: (Topogram 35 mA 120 kV 512 mm length) 90 quality ref mAs with
           care-dose ON 120 kV Pitch 1.4 Rotation time 0.33 s Acquired images 64 x 0.6 mm

        -  Reconstructions parameters: B60f 1mm-thick every 0.7 mm, B20f 1mm-thick every 10.0 mm,
           B35f 1mm-thick every 0.7 mm, B60f 5mm-thick every 5.0 mm and B35f 5mm-thick every 5.0 mm

      At 04:00 PM (T0+8h): PFT will be performed, including vital capacity (VC), forced vital
      capacity (FVC), functional residual capacity (FRC), total lung capacity (TLC), residual
      volume (RV), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), diffusion lung capacity for
      carbon monoxide (DLCO), and alveolar volume (VA) measurements (either in absolute values and
      percentage of predicted values). A second CT scan will be performed using the following
      technique:

        -  Supine CT scan after full inspiration.

        -  Acquisition parameters: (Topogram 35 mA 120 kV 512 mm length) 90 quality ref mAs with
           care-dose ON 120 kV Pitch 1.4 Rotation time 0.33 s Acquired images 64 x 0.6 mm

        -  Reconstructions parameters: B60f 1mm-thick every 0.7 mm, B20f 1mm-thick every 10.0 mm,
           B35f 1mm-thick every 0.7 mm, B60f 5mm-thick every 5.0 mm and B35f 5mm-thick every 5.0 mm

      Data analysis:

        -  Emphysema index: from B20f reconstructions, calculation of RA960 using Pulmo CT
           software.

        -  Airway index: from B60f reconstructions (1mm-thick every 0.7 mm), calculations of
           luminal area and wall area for several bronchi.

      Statistical analyses : Comparisons of CT parameters values or derived values (for example :
      wall area to airway area ratio) reflecting emphysema and airways remodelling measured on CT
      scans obtained Ã  T0 and T0+8h. Correlations with PFT values and derived values.
