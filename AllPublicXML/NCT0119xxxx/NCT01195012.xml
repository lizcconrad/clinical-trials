  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to evaluate a 6-month obesity treatment intervention (Helping
      HAND: Health Activity and Nutrition Directions) for pediatric primary care clinics. The
      program targets 5-8 year old children and their parents to change the child's lifestyle
      behaviors and the associated parenting practices to improve the child's weight status. Four
      community clinics participated. Families were recruited from clinics and after informed
      consent and baseline data have been obtained, the families were randomized into one of two
      groups: (1) the treatment group who immediately participated in Helping HAND or (2) the wait
      list control group, who started the program 7 months later. Data were gathered on all the
      participating children and their parents at three time points: baseline, post the
      intervention (month 7) and post the wait list control group completing the intervention
      (month 14).

      This was a pilot study to test the feasibility of an obesity prevention plus program
      delivered in the child's primary care clinic. The primary outcome was family attendance to
      the 3 data-collection meetings with research staff and the 6 prevention plus intervention
      sessions with a trained Health Advisor.
