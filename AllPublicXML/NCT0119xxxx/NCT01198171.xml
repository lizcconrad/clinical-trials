  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying racial and genetic biomarkers of response in tissue samples
      from patients with endometrial cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer
      in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. DNA analysis of tumor tissue may also help doctors predict how
      well patients will respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify racial categorization as the proportion of genetic background of
      African-American or European-American women with endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC).

      II. To evaluate the association of racial genetic admixture with clinicopathologic variables
      and outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the concordance between racial genetic admixture and self-designated race
      categorization.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by race (African-American vs
      European-American) and disease stage (I vs II vs III vs IV).

      DNA from archived frozen normal tissue samples is genotyped for the ancestry informative
      markers. Clinicopathological and demographic characteristics associated with each sample are
      also collected.
