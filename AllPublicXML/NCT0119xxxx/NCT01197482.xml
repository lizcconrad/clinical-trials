      Investigational device: AKITA 2 device versus conventional metered-dose inhaler (MDI)

      Objectives: To explore if inhalative fluticasone application by means of the AKITA technology
      would result in a better symptom control in patients with severe persistent asthma as
      compared to inhalative application of fluticasone by a conventional MDI.

      Study design: open label, cross-over (one AKITA, one MDI arm)

      Patients: 20 Patients with severe persistent asthma
