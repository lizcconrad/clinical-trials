      1. evaluation of blast clearance in b/m after 7 days of prednisolone prephase and the
           efficacy of its substitution by dexamethasone if blast count is 25% and more

        2. feasibility for adults of &quot;no interruptions&quot; protocol with 8 weeks induction and 14
           weeks consolidation followed by 2-years maintenance.

        3. tolerability and efficacy in adults of the prolonged L-asparaginase application (total
           proposed dose 560.000 IU)

        4. feasibility and efficacy of autologous stem cell transplantation for T-cell ALL

      1. The blast count in b/m after 7 days of prednisolone &gt;25% was shown in 64% of patients.
           The substitution of prednisolone by dexamethasone did not influence survival.

        2. &quot;no interruptions&quot; induction was performed in 48% of patients.

        3. In 19% of patients the L-asparaginase therapy was stopped due to toxicity.

        4. Autologous stem cell transplantation was done in 20% of T-cell ALL patients.
