      This study aims to compare the diagnostic efficiency and reliability of Abrams' needle
      pleural biopsy under computerized tomography guidance with that of cutting-needle pleural
      biopsy under ultrasonography guidance in patients with pleural effusion.

      Background. In cases with pleural effusion, tissue samples can be obtained through Abrams'
      needle pleural biopsy, thoracoscopy, or cutting-needle pleural biopsy under the guidance of
      computerized tomography or ultrasonography for histopathological analysis. This study aims to
      compare the diagnostic efficiency and reliability of Abrams' needle pleural biopsy under
      computerized tomography guidance with that of cutting-needle pleural biopsy under
      ultrasonography guidance in patients with pleural effusion.

      Methods. Patients with exudative pleural effusion, who could not be diagnosed by cytological
      analysis, will be included in the study. All patients were randomized following the thoracic
      computerized tomography with contrast enhancement. Patients either underwent Abrams' needle
      pleural biopsy under computerized tomography guidance or the cutting-needle pleural biopsy
      under ultrasonography. The two groups will be compared in terms of diagnostic efficiency and
      in terms of complications associated with the methods used.

    <measure>To compare the sensitivities and specificities of two diagnostic methods for pleural diseases to establish which method is more effective.</measure>
    <time_frame>28-months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will determine which method more efficient for the diagnosis of pleural diseases establishing sensitivity and specificity of the methods. After establishment of sensitivity, specificity and side effects for each diagnostic method the investigators will compare them according to the method and determine which method is more efficient.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability.</measure>
    <time_frame>28-months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients in both arm will be followed for complications of the diagnostic method. Complications experienced by the patients will be determined and recorded in special forms. Each complication will be measured with own characteristic such as pain, local infection, pneumothorax,local inavsion of disease, haemoragy etc.</description>
