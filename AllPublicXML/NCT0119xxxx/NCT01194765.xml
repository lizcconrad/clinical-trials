  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are common pervasive conditions with serious psychosocial implications.
      Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is one individual characteristic that has been implicated in the
      onset and maintenance of anxiety disorders (Schmidt et al., 1999). AS is an enduring fear of
      anxiety-related arousal sensations (i.e., increased heart rate) that arises from the tendency
      to interpret these sensations catastrophically, believing that they will have serious
      physical, psychological, or social consequences (Reiss, 1991).

      Research has shown the efficacy of CBT in decreasing AS among women with high AS (Watt et
      al., 2006). Unfortunately, access to effective psychological treatments is limited by a
      number of barriers such as a lack of treatment availability or qualified clinicians in an
      area. As such, we are conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of
      a distance-based CBT program on decreasing AS among those with high AS. A distance delivery
      approach (e.g., via telephone) is one way to minimize treatment barriers and increase access
      to care while still delivering empirically supported treatment. Recent research suggests
      distance delivery is promising (Lovell et al., 2006).

      The RCT will consist of an eight-week structured CBT program based on Watt and Stewart's
      (2008) brief CBT for AS. The program will include weekly modules on psychoeducation,
      cognitive restructuring, interoceptive exposure, and relapse prevention. Participants with
      high AS will be recruited and randomly assigned to the treatment condition or wait-list
      control (after twelve weeks the wait-list group will receive treatment). In the treatment
      condition, participants will be assigned weekly reading and homework from the treatment
      manual. In addition, a therapist will guide them through the treatment by providing
      individualized support and feedback through weekly half-hour telephone sessions. Treatment
      outcomes will be assessed through changes in AS levels and anxiety symptoms pre- to
      post-treatment. Also, participants' satisfaction with the mode of treatment delivery will be
      assessed. We hypothesize that this treatment program will be effective in reducing high AS
      and anxiety symptom frequency and severity. We also expect this project to yield information
      about the utility of distance treatment delivery for mental health care.
