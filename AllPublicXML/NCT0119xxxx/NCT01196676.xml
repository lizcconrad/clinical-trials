        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide a signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures being performed. including the genetic sampling and analyses. If a
             volunteer declines to participate in the genetic component of the study, there will be
             no penalty or loss of benefit to the volunteer. The volunteer will not be excluded
             from other aspects of the study described in this protocol.

          -  Healthy male and female (of non-childbearing potential) volunteers 18 to 55 years old
             inclusive with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture.

          -  Females must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and on admission to the unit,
             must not be nursing and must be of non-childbearing potential, confirmed at screening
             by fulfilling one of the following criteria:

          -  Post-menopausal defined as amenorrhoea for at least 12 months following cessation of
             all exogenous hormonal treatments and with FSH levels in the laboratory defined
             post-menopausal range

          -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation Male volunteers should
             be willing to use barrier contraception for example, condoms and spermicide, from the

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 kg/m2 (BMI &lt;30.5 =30) and weigh at
             least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive.

             antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  History of any of the following as judged by the Investigator: History of psychiatric
             disorders as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders text

             physician.

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
