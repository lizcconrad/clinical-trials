  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protective airway reflexes may be impaired in the postoperative period, creating the
      potential for aspiration of gastric contents, even after a patient exhibits appropriate
      response to command. Because assessment of airway reflex recovery is not possible in an
      intubated patient, the clinician must make an empiric decision as to when a patient is safe
      to extubate, and choose a combination of techniques least likely to result in pharyngeal
      impairment. Adequacy of reversal of neuromuscular block by cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g.,
      neostigmine) is unpredictable, especially in the presence of profound paralysis, and tactile
      assessment of train-of four and sustained tetanus has shown poor correlation with objective
      assessments. Protective airway reflexes may also be impaired during early recovery by the
      anesthetics themselves, even when muscle relaxant has been avoided. In the absence of muscle
      relaxant the investigators previously demonstrated that patients receiving an anesthetic with
      higher tissue solubility, sevoflurane showed significantly greater impairment of swallowing
      up to 14 minutes after response to command compared to patients receiving an anesthetic with
      lower tissue solubility, desflurane. Therefore, we ask whether the combination of the more
      soluble anesthetic and the presence of neuromuscular block antagonized by neostigmine may
      create a multiplicative effect that might further prolong pharyngeal recovery. We plan to
      randomly assign 100 patients scheduled to undergo surgery with general anesthesia to a
      standardized anesthetic that includes 1) sevoflurane, rocuronium with 70 µg/kg neostigmine +
      14 µg/kg glycopyrrolate antagonism (group S); or 2) desflurane, rocuronium with 70 µg/kg
      neostigmine + 14 µg/kg glycopyrrolate antagonism (group D). Airway reflex recovery will be
      judged as adequate by the patient's ability to swallow 20 mL of water without coughing or
      drooling 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after response to command. Anesthetic (sevoflurane
      or desflurane) will be discontinued after administration of reversal agent and recovery to
      TOF (train-of-four) ratio of 0.7.

    <time_frame>At 2 minutes after response to command (T1).</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is judged by the primary anesthetist to be awake at time T1. At 2 minutes after T1, the patient was asked to swallow 20mL of water from a paper cup, and a blinded observer judged the ability to swallow based on transit of water to the posterior pharynx (absence of pooling or drooling) and absence of cough or gag.</description>

    <description>At the conclusion of surgery, after the patient's potent inhaled anesthetic was discontinued, the commands &quot;open your eyes&quot; and &quot;squeeze my hand&quot; were given at 30-second intervals. The time at which patient first appropriately response to both commands was noted as T1.</description>

    <description>At 2 minutes after first response to command (T1), the patient was asked to swallow 20 mL of water from a paper cup, and an observer blinded to anesthetic assignment assessed the ability to swallow based on transit of water to the posterior pharynx (absence of pooling or drooling) and absence of cough or gag (indicating misdirection of the water bolus into the laryngeal inlet). This test was repeated at 6, 14, 22, 30 and 60 minutes after the time of first response to command.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Participation of the first 26 enrollees was considered a pilot to determine the feasibility of measuring the primary outcome at T1+5 minutes. The majority of participants were alert, and no meaningful analyses could be made. The study was modified to assess the primary outcome at T1 + 2 minutes, and 81 additional participants were recruited.</pre_assignment_details>
