      Research objectives To provide people with sufficient information regarding health care and
      to improve its quality, this research endeavors to discuss the establishment of a health care
      information openness and transparency mechanism within the framework of the National Health
      Insurance system. This research also evaluates whether the transparency of health care
      quality information makes care givers provide better quality. Meanwhile, when appropriate
      information and quality index are presented to patients, patients shall have more knowledge
      about what they are dealing with, hence less misunderstanding between hospitals and patients
      would occur.

      Research Methods

        1. To revise indicators based on international trends, related literature and the need of
           people.

        2. To present 50 sets of quality indicator statistically on the website, and provide
           updated information about the first 10 sets.

        3. To analyze and explain the outcome and purposes of the indicator to the public.

        4. To estimate the possible trend for the coming year, and provide adaptive strategy.

        5. To promote the website, and hold workshops in all six regions of Taiwan.

        6. To make the website linked to the top 5 most populated official and unofficial websites.

        7. To respond to questions on the forum of the website daily, and maintain the system,
           update the website regularly.

        8. To complete the acceptability survey on health care institutions and people.
