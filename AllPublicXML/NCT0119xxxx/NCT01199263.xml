    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving paclitaxel with
      or without viral therapy works in treating patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube,
      or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them spreading. Viral therapy may be
      able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. Giving paclitaxel together with viral
      therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of weekly
      paclitaxel with Reolysin (wild-type reovirus) to weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with
      persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      weekly paclitaxel alone and weekly paclitaxel with REOLYSIN as assessed by Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
      weekly paclitaxel alone and weekly paclitaxel with REOLYSIN.

      II. To estimate (and compare) the proportion of patients who respond to the regimen on each
      arm of the study (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 with
      measurable patients and by cancer antigen [CA]-125 for those patients with detectable disease
      only).

      III. To characterize and compare progression-free survival and overall survival in patients
      with measurable disease (RECIST 1.1 criteria) and patients with detectable (non-measurable)
      disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in arm I and wild-type reovirus IV over 1 hour on days
      1-5.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
