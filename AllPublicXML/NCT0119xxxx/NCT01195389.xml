        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease appropriately documented by the patients
             physician and/or neurologist

          -  Documentation verifying that other generally recognized causes of dementia have been
             ruled out by prior physician evaluations

          -  Mild to Moderate Dementia, as evidenced by a score of not less than 12 nor greater
             than 26 on the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE).

          -  Subject is ambulatory.

          -  A Study Partner who can attend all study visits with the subject. Study Partner being
             defined as an adult who has at least 10 hours/week of contact with the subject, and
             can accompany the subject to all testing and treatment study visits.

          -  Stable &quot;anti-dementia&quot; medication regimen without significant side effects for at
             least 3 months, and on stable medication (unrelated to anti-dementia) without
             significant side effects for at least 1 month; willingness and ability to maintain the
             stable medication regimen throughout the course of the study.

          -  Willingness and ability to present to the testing center for all study evaluations

          -  Willingness and ability to present to the treatment center for all study treatments
             (exposure to the Resonatorâ„¢)

          -  Willingness to maintain stable diet and activity regimen for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Willing and able to abstain from partaking in any non-essential (not physician
             ordered) existing or new treatments to improve cognition and mental functioning

          -  Willing and able to abstain from any medications that could affect cognition and
             mental functioning during the course of the study

          -  Male or female.

          -  Any ethnic background.

          -  Age 55 and older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Change in anti-dementia medical regimen within 3 months prior to initiation of study.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis other non-Alzheimer's type of dementia

          -  Significant neurologic or psychiatric illness other than Alzheimer's disease

          -  Unstable cardiac disease, such as any history of cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial
             fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, or irregular atrial-ventricular conduction
             time), or any incidences of congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction, within
             the last six months.

          -  Previous surgical interventions involving prosthetics or implants comprised of ferrous
             metals, or pacemakers, vagus nerve stimulators, or other functional electrical
             stimulators such as those commonly used for pain.

          -  Reported consumption of more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or other uncontrolled arrhythmias, e.g. tachycardia,
             bradycardia.

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder.

          -  History of seizures or usage of anti-seizure medications that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, participation in this trial would represent a risk to the subject.

          -  Uncontrolled, unstable, or untreated medical conditions which may significantly impact
             the subject's health or ability to complete the entire study, in the opinion of the
             investigator.
