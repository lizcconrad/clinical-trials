  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of raltegravir with optimized
      background therapy (OBT) in multiple-experienced HIV infected patients, measured by the
      proportion of patients with undetectable viral load and the mean increase of CD4 cells count
      at week 24 and 48.

      It is also intended to evaluate:

        -  viral load suppression and the mean increase of CD4 cells count at week 24 and 48 in
           patients who needed to change antiretroviral (ARV) therapy due to inacceptable toxicity,
           as determined by the investigator, including patients who needed to replace T20.

        -  efficacy of raltegravir with OBT in HIV-2 infected patients that were included in this
           cohort, measured by the percentage of patients with undetectable viral load and the mean
           change of CD4 cells count at week 24 and 48.

      Study hypotheses:

        -  Raltegravir with OBT is effective in achieving and maintaining a long term virologic
           suppression along with a significant increase on CD4 cells count in both HIV-1 and HIV-2
           infected patients.

        -  Patients who replaced T20 by raltegravir, due to intolerance, are able to maintain long
           term virologic suppression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considering its novel mechanism of action, potency, safety and tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetic profile, raltegravir has been used in several clinical scenarios. Since its
      initial clinical use in multiresistant patients throughout the Expanded Access and
      Compassionate Use Program (started in March 2007) raltegravir has been used successfully in
      other clinical scenarios, including but not limited to: enfuvirtide-related serious adverse
      events and intolerance, nucleoside analogue inhibitors' toxicity, ritonavir and protease
      inhibitor intolerance and to avoid significant drug-drug interactions. Early access to
      raltegravir was basically focused on patients on therapeutic failure and triple-class
      resistance and due to enfuvirtide intolerance. In order to achieve a better understanding of
      the efficacy and safety profile of raltegravir in the clinical setting, it is intended to
      evaluate retrospectively HIV patients treated in Portugal with raltegravir since the Early
      Access and Compassionate Use Program (EAP) was implemented.

      This is a national, multicenter, observational, clinical cohort study with retrospective
      collection of data. Each site will include patients who had started treatment with
      raltegravir under the EAP.
