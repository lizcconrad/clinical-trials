        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Patients must have a best corrected visual acuity of 0.6 LogMar or better in each eye,
             and must use Restasis BID for at least 6 months.

          -  Lastly, patients must have a sodium fluorescein (NaFl) corneal staining sum score of
             greater than or equal to 3 in the worse eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients cannot wear contact lenses during the study and cannot have a history of
             hypersensitivity to any component of FID 112903.

          -  Patients cannot have ocular or intraocular surgery or serious ocular trauma within the
             past 6 months, and cannot have punctal plugs of any type.

          -  Patients cannot use any prescription topical medication for other ocular conditions
             (such as glaucoma, uveitis, etc).

          -  Patients cannot use systemic medications that may contribute to dry eye if the dosing
             regimen has not been stable for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients cannot have ocular conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             preclude the safe administration of the test article.

          -  Patients cannot have a history and/or current evidence of the following: epithelial
             herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis); vaccinia, active or recent varicella
             viral disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva; active ocular rosacea; acute or
             chronic bacterial disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva and/or eyelids;
             mycobacterial infection of the eye; and/or fungal diseases of the eye.
