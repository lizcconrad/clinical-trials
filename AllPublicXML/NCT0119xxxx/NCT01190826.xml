        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent.

          -  Male or female subjects, ≥ 18 years and ≤ 55 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of moderate asthma and on regular inhaled corticosteroids with or without
             short or long-acting Beta-2-agonists

          -  FEV1 ≥ 55 % predicted in the absence of medications for asthma

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG)) at Screening, and a negative pregnancy test
             immediately before the administration of the study drug for each of Periods 1, 2 and
             3. Sexually active females with non-sterile partner must be willing to use adequate
             contraception.

          -  Male subjects must be willing to use a condom with a spermicide for the duration of
             their participation in the study, plus an additional 30 days following study drug
             administration and ensure that their partner is using a highly effective method of
             birth control such as combined oral contraceptives, implants, injectables or an
             intra-uterine device (IUD). Male subjects must ensure that their female partner is
             willing to use adequate contraception.

          -  Demonstration of an increase in FEV1 by ≥ 10 % predicted between spirometry performed
             before and 10-20 minutes after the administration of 2 puffs of 100 micrograms of
             salbutamol at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant conditions or illnesses other than moderate asthma or systemic
             diseases

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women intending to conceive during the course of the
             study or have a positive serum pregnancy test at Screening or a positive urine
             pregnancy test during the study.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or
             bilateral tubal ligation, or post-menopausal for at least two years) not using a
             highly effective method of birth control.

          -  Non-surgically sterile males and males with partners of childbearing potential not
             willing to use a condom with spermicide for the duration of their participation in the
             study plus an additional 30 days following study drug administration and to ensure
             that their partner is using a highly effective method of birth control such as
             combined oral contraceptives, implants, injectables or an IUD.

          -  Respiratory tract infections or worsening of asthma or changes in asthma medications
             within 6 weeks before Screening/Baseline.

          -  Current cigarette smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of greater than 10
             pack years or who stopped smoking within 12 months preceding enrolment in the study.

          -  Positive urine cotinine test at Screening.

          -  History of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse within 12 months before Screening.

          -  Positive test for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at
             Screening.

          -  Any medication that are known to prolong QT / QTc interval.

          -  Any of the following concomitant medications preceding the administration of
             salbutamol during Screening and preceding the administration of the study drug:

               -  Oral or i.v. corticosteroids within 1 month;

               -  Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids within 48 hours;

               -  Long acting Beta-2-agonists within 24 hours;

               -  Short acting Beta-2-agonists within 8 hours;

               -  Anticholinergic aerosols within 24 hours; and

               -  Theophylline-containing products within 48 hours.

          -  Use of NSAIDs within 7 days preceding the administration of salbutamol during
             Screening and throughout the study.

          -  Use of antihistaminic drugs within 3 days preceding the administration of salbutamol
             during Screening.

          -  Use of an investigational product or participation in a clinical trial using an
             investigational product within 30 days before dosing or within 90 days in the case of

             (ex.: monoclonal antibodies).
