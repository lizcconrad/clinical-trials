  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of exercise in comparison to wellness
      education to determine if they can improve the effects of prolonged exposure therapy (PE) in
      reducing symptoms of anxiety associated with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In
      addition, the two strategies (i.e., exercise and wellness education) will be compared in
      terms of improvements in sleep as well as levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
      BDNF is a protein that helps to support the survival of existing neurons and stimulate the
      growth new neurons and synapses. BDNF is important to learning and memory in general and
      therefore may be associated with the learning and memory as it relates to PE and
      corresponding symptom PTSD improvement.
