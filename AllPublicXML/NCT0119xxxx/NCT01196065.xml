  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, fixed sequence, two-period study will assess the effect of memantine on the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of RO5313534 and the effect
      of RO5313534 on safety and tolerability of steady-state memantine. Healthy volunteers will
      receive a single oral dose of RO5313534 on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 (3 days). After a
      washout period of 5-21 days, oral memantine will be administered on Days 1-21 of Treatment
      Period 2 and a single dose of RO5313534 on Day 19. There will be a follow-up of 3-4 weeks
      after the last dose. Anticipated time on study for each volunteer is up to 14 weeks.
