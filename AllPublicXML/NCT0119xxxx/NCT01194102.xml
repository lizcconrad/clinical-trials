    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether persons with stroke participating in a
      12-week community based wellness program for persons who have had a stroke, experience
      improved mobility (6 Minute Walk Test), balance, (The Short Portable Performance Test and
      Timed Up and Go), strength (JAMAR hand grip dynamometry), level of physical activity (Rapid
      Assessment of Physical Activity), reintegration in community (Reintegration into Normal
      Living Index), self efficacy (Patient Activation Measure) and Quality of Life (Stroke
      Specific Quality of Life Scale) compared to persons who do not participate in the program.

    <textblock>
      The program will be delivered through a partnership between Hamilton Health Sciences, the
      YMCA and McMaster University. Participants will attend the YMCA for exercise sessions several
      times a week and receive education on how to take care of themselves after a stroke. The
      staff who will deliver the program will have specialized training on how to help people with
      stroke to exercise safely and effectively. Control group participants will be provided with
      YMCA memberships but will not have access to stroke specific education and group exercise
      classes.

      Staff assisting the control group will be trained in safety and contraindications after
      stroke, but will not receive the additional specialized training in exercise/education
      programs for persons with stroke.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Six minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is a test of exercise capacity that is measured as the distance walked in 6 minutes. Participants are instructed to cover as much ground as possible in 6 minutes. A greater distance walked indicates a better performance. The unit of measurement is metres.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength (average of 3 trials with either hand) will be measured using a JAMAR hand-held dynamometer. Handgrip has been shown to correlate with elbow flexion strength, knee flexion strength and trunk extension strength. The unit of measurement is kilograms. Higher numbers indicate greater grip strength.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RAPA measures an individuals Level of Physical Activity. The RAPA is a 9 item measure that assesses frequency and intensity of aerobic physical activity and frequency of strengthening and flexibility exercises. The unit of measurement is numbers on a scale. Higher scores indicate greater levels of physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Activation Measure (PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAM is a 13-item measure of the patient's level of knowledge, skill and confidence for self-management of their chronic condition. The unit of measurement is numbers on a scale. Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating a higher level of activation.</description>

    <description>Participants with stroke will attend a 12 week Community Wellness Program. The program consists of a Community Based Exercise Program at the YMCA (2x 1 hour exercise sessions per week with specially trained fitness instructors). They will also attend a 1 hour long &quot;Living with Stroke&quot; education session one time per week and an independent exercise session in the fitness centre one time per week.</description>

YMCA staff working with the control group will not receive specialized training in exercise and education for stroke survivors but will be trained on important safety precautions and contraindications to exercise after stroke.</description>
