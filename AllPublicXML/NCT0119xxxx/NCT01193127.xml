    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of OMS302 (the study drug) in
      individuals undergoing Cataract Extraction with Lens Replacement (CELR) surgery is safe and
      effective at maintaining an adequately dilated pupil during surgery and reducing
      post-operative symptoms of discomfort (such as eye pain and irritation).

    <measure>Pupil Diameter (mm) During Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery (immediately prior to surgical incision to wound closure)</time_frame>
    <description>Pupil diameter from surgical baseline (immediately prior to surgical incision) to the end of the surgical procedure (wound closure) was summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group and time point. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to test for differences in the maintenance of mydriasis. The repeated measures model included change from baseline pupil diameter as the response variable and treatment (OMS302, ketorolac tromethamine, and vehicle), time point (as a categorical variable) and the stratification factor lens opacities classification system II (LOCS II) grade as predictor variables. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach with an AR(1) working-correlation structure was used.</description>

    <measure>Ocular Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score (mm) Within 12 Hours Postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>through 12 hours post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary analysis of this endpoint, only the results on the day of operation at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-12 hours were utilized. The VAS scores (where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain) were summarized by treatment group and time point. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to test for differences in postoperative ocular pain. The repeated measures model included VAS pain score as the response variable and treatment (OMS302, phenylephrine hydrochloride (PE), and vehicle), time point (as a categorical variable) and the stratification factor LOCS II grade as predictor variables. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach with an AR(1) working correlation structure was used.</description>

    <description>Postoperative inflammation as measured using the Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS), summarized by treatment arm and time point. Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject's anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>

        <title>Pupil Diameter (mm) During Surgery</title>
        <description>Pupil diameter from surgical baseline (immediately prior to surgical incision) to the end of the surgical procedure (wound closure) was summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group and time point. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to test for differences in the maintenance of mydriasis. The repeated measures model included change from baseline pupil diameter as the response variable and treatment (OMS302, ketorolac tromethamine, and vehicle), time point (as a categorical variable) and the stratification factor lens opacities classification system II (LOCS II) grade as predictor variables. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach with an AR(1) working-correlation structure was used.</description>

          <title>Pupil Diameter (mm) During Surgery</title>
          <description>Pupil diameter from surgical baseline (immediately prior to surgical incision) to the end of the surgical procedure (wound closure) was summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group and time point. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to test for differences in the maintenance of mydriasis. The repeated measures model included change from baseline pupil diameter as the response variable and treatment (OMS302, ketorolac tromethamine, and vehicle), time point (as a categorical variable) and the stratification factor lens opacities classification system II (LOCS II) grade as predictor variables. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach with an AR(1) working-correlation structure was used.</description>

        <description>For the primary analysis of this endpoint, only the results on the day of operation at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-12 hours were utilized. The VAS scores (where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain) were summarized by treatment group and time point. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to test for differences in postoperative ocular pain. The repeated measures model included VAS pain score as the response variable and treatment (OMS302, phenylephrine hydrochloride (PE), and vehicle), time point (as a categorical variable) and the stratification factor LOCS II grade as predictor variables. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach with an AR(1) working correlation structure was used.</description>

        <description>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was summarized by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity log score. For subjects without a score due to inability to read the ETDRS chart, the log score was imputed as 1.6 for the purpose of treatment comparisons. Subjects without a score because the manifest refraction was not completed were excluded from the analysis. Treatment comparisons for BCVA were performed by pairwise Wilcoxon tests.</description>

          <description>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was summarized by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity log score. For subjects without a score due to inability to read the ETDRS chart, the log score was imputed as 1.6 for the purpose of treatment comparisons. Subjects without a score because the manifest refraction was not completed were excluded from the analysis. Treatment comparisons for BCVA were performed by pairwise Wilcoxon tests.</description>

        <description>Postoperative inflammation as measured using the Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS), summarized by treatment arm and time point. Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject’s anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>

          <description>Postoperative inflammation as measured using the Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS), summarized by treatment arm and time point. Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject’s anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>

          <description>Number of subjects with Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS) = 0, summarized by treatment arm and time point. Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject’s anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>

Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject’s anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>
