      INTRODUCTION: There are several alternatives for one-stage emergency treatment of obstructive
      left-sided colonic cancer (OLCC): subtotal colectomy, intraoperative colon lavage (IOCL) with
      primary anastomosis, and the placement of a stent as a temporary measure prior to scheduled
      surgery. At present, it is not clear whether emergency perioperative lavage or the placement
      of a stent is the better technique. The hypothesis is that IOCL and primary anastomosis is
      equal safe or even safer than placement of a stent as a temporary measure prior to scheduled
      surgery, less length of stay and less cost.

      OBJECTIVE: To establish which of these two techniques is more efficient in OLCC from the
      point of view of morbimortality, economic cost, and long-term survival.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS:

      Prospective, controlled, randomized study of patients diagnosed with OLCC. Patients were
      divided into two groups: group 1: stent and deferred surgery; group 2: emergency IOCL. A
      simple randomization system was used. The estimated sample size required per group was 21
      patients. Demographic variables, risk prediction models, postoperative morbimortality,
      staging, complications due to the placement of stent, surgical time, clinical follow-up,
      health costs and follow-up of survival were recorded.
