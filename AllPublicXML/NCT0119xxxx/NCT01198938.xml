    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to evaluate the effect of postoperative melatonin administration on
      postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular and cardiac surgery. A total of 302
      patients older than 60, undergoing elective vascular surgery will be randomly divided into 2
      groups: treatment and control. During the first 5 postoperative days patients will receive
      sublingually either melatonin 5 mg or placebo at 9:00 pm. The patients will be assessed for
      the signs of delirium, quality of sleep and severity of pain daily for the first
      postoperative week. Screening of delirium will be performed by the specially trained research
      assistant and based on the Confusion Assessment Method and the validated chart review.
      Diagnosis of delirium will be confirmed by the psychiatrist. Incidence of delirium will be
      compared between the groups.
