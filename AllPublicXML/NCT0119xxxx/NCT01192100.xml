  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the daily addition of a protein-rich breakfast
      leads to beneficial changes in appetite control, food intake regulation,and cognitive
      function in overweight &amp; obese 'breakfast skipping' young women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breakfast skipping, which is a common, yet unhealthy dietary habit among young women, has
      been strongly associated with over-eating (especially in the evening), weight gain, and
      obesity. Breakfast skipping has also been shown to reduce cognitive function in this
      population. However, it is unclear as to whether the addition of breakfast, with specific
      emphasis on increased dietary protein, leads to improvements in these outcomes. This study
      will provide mechanistic evidence supporting the addition of a protein-rich breakfast to
      improve and/or re-establish appetite control, energy intake regulation, and cognitive
      function in overweight/obese 'breakfast skipping' young women. 25 overweight and obese
      'breakfast skipping' adolescent girls will participate in the following randomized
      within-subject crossover-design breakfast study. The participants will randomly complete the
      follow breakfast patterns at home for 6 days: 1) Breakfast Skipping; 2) Consumption of Normal
      Protein breakfast meals(i.e., 350 kcal; 15% of the meal as protein, 65% CHO, &amp; 20% fat); and
      3) Consumption of Protein-Rich breakfast meals (i.e., 350 kcal; 40% of the meal as protein,
      40% CHO, &amp; 20% fat). On the 7th day of each pattern, the participants will report to the
      MU-Brain Imaging Center in the morning to complete the respective 10-h testing day. The
      participants will begin the testing day by either skipping breakfast or consuming their
      respective breakfast meal. Blood samples and assessments of perceived appetite,
      pleasure/reward, and cognitive function will be collected/completed at specific times
      throughout the day. A standardized lunch will also be provided. Prior to dinner, a brain scan
      will be completed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain
      activation patterns in response to food pictures. Following the fMRI, the participants will
      be provided with an ad libitum dinner buffet to consume of the facility. They will also be
      given evening snacks to consume ad libitum, at home throughout the remainder of the day.
      There is a 7-day washout period between each breakfast pattern. Primary outcomes include
      morning, mid-day, afternoon, and evening appetite, satiety, pleasure/reward, hormonal
      responses (plasma glucose, insulin, ghrelin, and PYY concentrations), brain activation
      patterns, evening energy intake, and daily energy intake.

    <description>Questionnaires, assessing appetite sensations (i.e., hunger, fullness, prospective food consumption, motivation to eat), hedonic ratings (pleasure), and palatability will be completed throughout each of the testing days (which are separated by 2 weeks). The questionnaires contain validated visual analog scales (VAS) incorporating a 100 mm horizontal line rating scale for each response. The questions are worded in the following manner &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; with anchors of &quot;not all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot;</description>

    <description>25 total blood samples will be drawn throughout each of the testing days (which are separated by 2 weeks). Specifically, there will be 5 ml/sample; 125 ml (4.2 oz)/testing day. The samples will be collected in test tubes containing EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). Protease inhibitors will be added to the sample to reduce protein degradation. Samples will be centrifuged at -4°C for 15 minutes. The plasma will then be separated and stored in microcentrifuge tubes at -80°C for future analysis. Plasma total ghrelin and total PYY will be measure.</description>

    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Brain activation responses will be assessed prior to dinner in each of the 3 testing days (separated by 2 weeks). During the fMRI brain scan procedure, the participants will focus on a set of photographs which will be projected onto a screen and easily viewed through a mirror. The fMRI paradigm incorporates stimuli from three categories of pictures including food, nonfood (animals), and blurred baseline images. Brain activation in the Insula, Amygdala, Hippocampus, and Parahippocampus will be examined when viewing food vs. animal pictures.</description>

    <description>Breakfast skipping serves as the baseline/control arm since the participants habitually skip breakfast (i.e., skip breakfast at least 5 times/week). Thus, during the week prior to and including the testing day, the participants will continue to skip breakfast each morning.</description>

    <description>For 7 days, the participants will consume normal protein breakfast meals each morning. These meals will consist of cereal-based foods and will be 350 kcal, which is approximately 18% of daily energy intake for overweight and obese adolescents ages 9-18 y. The macronutrient composition of these meals will contain 15% protein (13 g of dietary protein), 65% CHO, and 20% fat.</description>
