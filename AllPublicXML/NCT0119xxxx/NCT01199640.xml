    <textblock>
      This was a phase 2a study of MLN1202 to determine safety, tolerability and initial efficacy
      in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It was conducted in 2 dose
      cohorts enrolling a total of 50 patients. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the numbers of
      new gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions during the screening and treatment periods.
