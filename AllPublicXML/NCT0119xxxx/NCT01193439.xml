    <textblock>
      Medical thoracoscopy can be performed for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes.
      Thoracoscopy in the diagnosis of pleural diseases is highly sensitive for detecting pleural
      neoplasia with negative pleural fluid cytology and in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The
      indication of thoracoscopy in patients with pleural effusion has been optimized. In some
      studies medical thoracoscopy has been claimed a useful diagnostic tool with a very low rate
      of complications. However the investigators do not know its safety on high risk patients.
      Because many patients having suspected malignancy have bed conditions due to other health
      problems such as coronary heart diseases, COPD, arrythmia, hypoxemia. In this study the
      investigators aimed to test the safety of medical thoracoscopy in the patients with high risk
      for complications.
