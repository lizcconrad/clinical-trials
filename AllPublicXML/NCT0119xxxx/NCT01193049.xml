  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between upper and lower airway
      allergen-induced cytokine responses in mild asthmatics by attempting to demonstrate the
      following: 1) a positive correlation between allergen-induced Type 2 T-helper cell (Th2)
      cytokines (interleukins 5 and 13) in sputum and nasal exudates; and 2) a positive correlation
      between effects of prednisone versus placebo on Th2 cytokines in sputum and nasal exudates.

    <measure>Geometric Mean Fold Change From Baseline in Interleukin-5 (IL-5) Concentration From Nasal Exudates and Sputum at 7 Hours Post-allergen Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 7 hours post-allergen challenge</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were treated with either prednisone or placebo, followed 1 hour later by nasal allergen challenge and then inhaled allergen challenge. After 7 hours had elapsed, nasal exudates (NE) and sputum (SP) were collected, then the concentrations of IL-5 were determined from NE and SP collected after 7 hours and previously at baseline (BL), to derive the fold change (FC) from BL for each participant. The geometric mean (GM) was determined by averaging FC from BL for all analyzed participants.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Fold Change From Baseline in Interleukin-5 (IL-5) Concentration From Nasal Exudates and Sputum at 7 Hours Post-allergen Challenge</title>
        <description>Participants were treated with either prednisone or placebo, followed 1 hour later by nasal allergen challenge and then inhaled allergen challenge. After 7 hours had elapsed, nasal exudates (NE) and sputum (SP) were collected, then the concentrations of IL-5 were determined from NE and SP collected after 7 hours and previously at baseline (BL), to derive the fold change (FC) from BL for each participant. The geometric mean (GM) was determined by averaging FC from BL for all analyzed participants.</description>

        <description>One hour before treatment with prednisone/placebo, participants inhaled for 2 minutes a nebulised solution of metacholine (0.13 ml/min); then one hour after prednisone/placebo treatment were challenged with allergens. From 1 to 7 hours after allergen challenge, ventilatory heterogeneity was assessed by Vibration Response Imaging (VRI) by monitoring the following: inspiration/expiration (I/E) amplitude ratio, I/E duration ratio, synchrony duration, and quantitative lung data.</description>

          <title>Geometric Mean Fold Change From Baseline in Interleukin-17 (IL-17) From Nasal Exudates and Sputum at 7 Hours Post-allergen Challenge</title>
          <description>Participants were treated with either prednisone or placebo, followed 1 hour later by nasal allergen challenge and then inhaled allergen challenge. After 7 hours had elapsed, NE and SP were collected, then the concentrations of IL-17 were determined from NE and SP collected after 7 hours and previously at BL, to derive the FC from BL for each participant. The GM was determined by averaging FC from BL for all analyzed participants.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Fold Change From Baseline in Interleukin-23 (IL-23) From Nasal Exudates and Sputum at 7 Hours Post-allergen Challenge</title>
        <description>Participants were treated with either prednisone or placebo, followed 1 hour later by nasal allergen challenge and then inhaled allergen challenge. After 7 hours had elapsed, NE and SP were collected, then the concentrations of IL-23 were determined from NE and SP collected after 7 hours and previously at BL, to derive the FC from BL for each participant. The GM was plan to be determined by averaging FC from BL for all analyzed participants.</description>
