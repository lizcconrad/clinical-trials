    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an evaluation of an end of life patient decision aid (EOL-PtDA)
      developed by the Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making using the RE-AIM (Reach
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. To evaluate the Reach
      and Effectiveness, the investigators propose a pilot randomized clinical trial of the
      EOL-PtDA among patients on the inpatient palliative care service at University Hospital in
      Colorado. To evaluate barriers and facilitators of Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance
      of the EOL-PtDA, we propose focus groups of non-palliative care physicians as we perceive
      these physicians to be the largest barrier to ultimate adoption of the EOL-PtDA. Additionally
      we propose a focus group of the palliative care physicians who participated in the
      implementation of this decision guide study to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a
      randomized control trial within a pall. care service and to evaluate the acceptability of
      this decision aid as it was implemented. The investigators also propose to conduct focus
      groups of normal, healthy clinic patients to determine the acceptability among that
      population. The End-of-Life decision aid is different from other decision aids. From the
      vantage point of decision quality, a major difference is that its primary focus is on helping
      patients clarify their values rather than gain knowledge. The results from this study will
      provide critical preliminary data to inform a randomized clinical trial and/or widespread
      implementation of the EOL-PtDA.

      Specific Aims/Research question(s):Aim 1: To determine the Reach and Effectiveness of an
      end-of-life patient decision aid by conducting a pilot randomized clinical trial in an
      inpatient palliative care service. Aim 2: To determine physicians' attitudes towards the
      end-of-life patient decision aid and to gain insights into potential barriers and
      facilitators to Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance by conducting a qualitative study
      of non-palliative care, and separately, palliative care physicians. Aim 3: To determine
      healthy clinic patients' attitudes towards the end-of-life patient decision aid and to gain
      insight into its Reach and Effectiveness.

      The aims 2-3 of this study include focus groups for physicians (both palliative care and
      non-palliative care physicians, aim 2) as well as healthy clinic patients (aim 3). Since
      these two arms are not randomized, they are not reported here. For additional information on
      the protocol and findings, please contact the PI, Daniel.Matlock@ucdenver.edu or the study
      coordinator, Tarah.Keech@ucdenver.edu.

    <description>In addition to usual care, patients assigned to the intervention group will also be asked to view and/or read the EOL-PtDA during their hospitalization. The EOL-PtDA can be utilized anytime in the course of their hospitalization (all hospital rooms at UCH have a DVD player). This could be before, during, or after the palliative care team consultation.</description>

This consultation typically includes a discussion of advanced directives using the five wishes document.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Aim 1: To determine the Reach and Effectiveness of an end-of-life patient decision
             aid by conducting a pilot randomized clinical trial in an inpatient palliative care
             service.

        Participants/Setting: Inpatient Palliative Care Service - University of Colorado Hospital:
        Patients may be included in this study if they are hospitalized at University of Colorado
        Hospital (UCH) and the UCH inpatient palliative care service has been consulted. This
        service, which consists of 6 physicians and two advanced practice nurses, sees
        approximately 40 new consults per month. More than 30% of consults originate from the
        hematology and oncology services, with the bulk of the remaining consults originating from
        the critical care services, cardiology, internal medicine, pulmonology and oncologic
        surgery. More than half of consults are for &quot;goal clarification,&quot; others are for assistance
        with symptom control or disposition issues. We have chosen this population for the pilot
        because they are a high risk population with significant advanced care planning needs and
        they are captive and easily accessible to both PIs of this study. We will include adult
        patients and/or decision makers (ages 18 or greater) with end-of-life decisional needs as
        judged by the practitioners on the palliative care service. In cases where the patient is
        unable to participate due to an altered mental status, the person identified as the
        decision maker will be invited to participate in the study. Patients will be considered
        eligible if the UCH palliative care service has been consulted for &quot;goal clarification&quot;
        and/or assistance with end-of-life discussions rather than symptom control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For Aim 1: We will exclude patients who cannot speak English or who are visually
             impaired as the decision aid is visual and only available in English. We will also
             exclude patients and decision makers with cognitive impairment as determined by
             ability to consent to the study. Ability to consent will be determined by the
             potential subject's ability, after being informed, to comprehend and explain the
             purposes, risks and benefits, and components of the study. If through the consent
             process, we determine that the person designated as the decision maker is unable to
             consent to the study, we will notify the primary team taking care of this patient.
             Additionally, we will exclude patients for whom the primary decision maker is unclear.
