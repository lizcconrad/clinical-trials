  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system (CNS) and is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young
      adults. Rebif is licensed in the United Kingdom for the treatment of relapsing MS and is
      given 3 times per week by subcutaneous injection. The Rebiject II device is an autoinjector
      which allows patients easier administration of their Rebif injections.

      Prior to treatment, patients receive training on the use of the device and its maintenance.
      Currently, all treatments for MS are injectable and require long term patient commitment.
      Rebiject has been developed to improve patient convenience and comfort but does require
      multiple steps to be carried out in order for the injection to be delivered correctly.
      Reports from our local call centre and nurse advisors suggest that inaccuracies of use with
      the Rebiject device are common. By raising awareness of the level of inaccuracy and
      determining which steps patients are most likely not to complete correctly, modified training
      programs or modifications to current subject training may be put into place to address these
      issues. It is also important to demonstrate the link between poor use of the medication
      device and increased relapse rates or increased injection site reactions.
