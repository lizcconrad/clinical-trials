  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current observational evaluation is designed to evaluate the performance of the Axium™
      MicroFx™ Detachable Coil System for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms in the real life
      practice.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 25 patients from from US centers are anticipated to be enrolled for this evaluation.
      Published literature on coils with electrolytic, thermal or hydraulic detachment will serve
      as the basis for control comparisons to the Axium™ MicroFx™ Detachable Coil System for
      patients undergoing embolization of intracranial aneurysm. Comparison will be based on
      criteria evaluating the safety of the procedure, the reliability of detachment, the occlusion
      stability and the packing density impact.

        All patients presenting with an intracranial aneurysm will be evaluated by the neuro
        interventional team, in accordance with institutional practice, to establish an appropriate
        treatment plan based on the patient's medical condition and available diagnostic screening
        prior to recruitment.

             unruptured.

          -  Information on data collection provided to the patient or legally authorized
             representative and signed informed consent.

          -  Age range of 18 - 90.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Aneurysm previously treated.

          -  Aneurysm AVM related or dissecting.

          -  Participation in a clinical investigation of other aneurysm treating or related
             devices.

          -  Any condition that would preclude the conduct of protocol follow-up.

          -  Aneurysm anatomy that is determined inappropriate for Axium coil placement, prior to
             opening of an Axium coil.
