  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human cancers express tumor antigens that can be targeted by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL).
      These antigens consist of a small peptide, derived from endogenous proteins, that is
      presented at the cancer cell's surface by an HLA class I molecule. Such antigenic peptides,
      including MAGE-3.A1 and NA17.A2, have been tested in experimental therapeutic vaccines to
      elicit CTL responses in cancer patients, mainly with metastatic melanoma. Up to now, only
      rare tumor responses have been observed.

      Tumor resistance to CTL killing is the most likely explanation for the poor effectiveness of
      cancer vaccines. This resistance is probably acquired by the tumor during its development and
      selected by its repetitive challenge with spontaneous anti-tumoral immune responses. The
      precise molecular mechanisms of tumor resistance remain unknown. The observation that
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) purified from melanoma metastases can recognize and kill
      autologous tumor cells in vitro, whilst they seem unable to control tumor growth in vivo,
      suggests that this resistance is hosted by the tumor environment, rather than being the
      result of a generalized immune suppression.

      The investigators have developed a murine model of cutaneous graft rejection that mimics the
      situation in melanoma. Female CBA mice do not reject syngeneic male skin grafts, even though
      they mount a spontaneous CTL response against H-Y, a male specific minor histocompatibility
      antigen, following grafting. The investigators have tested various experimental procedures
      aimed at inducing effective graft rejection in these mice. This was obtained with a
      combination of IFN-α, IL-2, GM-CSF, each administered separately under the skin graft,
      associated with topical applications of imiquimod. All these agents are available as
      registered drugs. Based on this murine model of cutaneous allograft rejection, the
      investigators postulate that local immunomodulation with this combination can trigger an
      effective tumor rejection process, and induce a more efficient and long-lasting anti-tumoral
      immune response following peptide vaccination.

      Patients will receive the following treatments:

        1. Vaccinations:

           The vaccine will be the MAGE-3.A1 and/or the NA17.A2 peptide, matching the patient's HLA
           type and the gene expression of his tumor. If both antigens are expressed, then the
           patient will receive both peptides.

        2. Local treatment with a combination of immunomodulatory drugs:

      This treatment will combine peritumoral injection of IL-2, IFN-α and GM-CSF (6000 IU, 100.000
      IU and 300 ng per tumor injected, respectively), as well as topical application of imiquimod
      (applied during 24h). The peritumoral injections of cytokines will be given on days
      +2,+3,+4,+7,+8 and +9, and the Aldara® cream will be applied on days +2 and +7 following
      vaccines 3 and 4. One or 2 cutaneous lesions will be treated, if there are 2 or more such
      lesions present at day 29 of the treatment, respectively.
