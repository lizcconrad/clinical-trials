  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to compare the cost of anesthetic techniques with sevoflurane
      (low fresh gas flow balanced anesthesia) versus propofol (target controlled infusion [TCI])
      versus propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance anesthesia in subjects undergoing
      elective laparoscopic surgery with predicted anesthesic use between 1 and 3 hour duration.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three hundred thirty-six subjects were enrolled in this study. Two subjects, one treated with
      propofol for induction and maintenance and one treated with propofol for induction and
      sevoflurane for maintenance are not included in the study participation since no information
      was available for these two subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost of Volatile Induction and Maintenance Anesthesia (VIMA) With Sevoflurane, Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) With Propofol, or Intravenous Induction With Propofol and Inhalational Maintenance With Sevoflurane</measure>
    <time_frame>Anesthetic Duration between 1 to 3 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>[Cost of VIMA = unit price of sevoflurane X used volume of sevoflurane];
[Cost of TIVA = unit price of propofol X total volume of propofol in the syringe];
[Cost of Propofol Induction and Sevoflurane Maintenance = unit price of propofol X total volume of propofol in the syringe + unit price of sevoflurane X volume of sevoflurane in the syringe].
The total volume of propofol in the syringe was calculated, even if all the anesthetic was not used, because it could not be reused.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Loss of Consciousness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Loss of consciousness was measured from the time the anesthetic was administered until loss of consciousness (no response to command) occurred. Inhalational induction was induced with sevoflurane via vital capacity induction at 8%. Intravenous induction was induced with propofol at 4 µg/mL via target controlled infusion (TCI). In subjects who received both anesthetic agents, a bolus dose of propofol 1.5 mg/kg was used for induction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Eye Opening</measure>
    <time_frame>Every minute after anesthesia was stopped until the subjects' eyes opened</time_frame>
    <description>Measured from the time sevoflurane or propofol administration was stopped until the subject's eyes were opened. The investigator tapped the subject on the forehead or shoulder after anesthesia was stopped and asked them to open their eyes. This process was repeated approximately every minute until eye opening occurred.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Extubation</measure>
    <time_frame>Every minute after anesthesia was stopped until extubation occurred</time_frame>
    <description>Time to extubation was measured from the time sevoflurane or propofol administration was stopped until tracheal extubation occurred. Criteria to determine extubation included a train of four stimulus &gt; 0.9 (a method to measure the magnitude and type of neuromuscular block, a ratio of the fourth response to the first one), a tidal volume &gt; 5 mL/kg, minute ventilation &gt; 3 L, a respiratory rate of &gt; 10 breaths/minute, an end tidal carbon dioxide &lt; 45 mmHg, and eye opening has occurred.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Orientation</measure>
    <time_frame>Every minute after anesthesia was stopped until orientation occurred</time_frame>
    <description>Time to orientation was measured from the time sevoflurane or propofol administration was stopped until orientation (able to state their name and date of birth).</description>

      <recruitment_details>Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 were recruited from 4 hospitals in 4 cities in China. They were required to have elective laparoscopic, in-patient surgery with a predicted anesthetic duration between 1 to 3 hours. Subjects with ASA physical status I or II were enrolled and were to have had the ability to provide informed consent.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study was a prospective, randomized (1:1:1), open-label, multi-center study comparing the cost of inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane to intravenous (IV) anesthesia with propofol, or propofol for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. The full analysis set was used for determination of all primary and secondary endpoints.</pre_assignment_details>
