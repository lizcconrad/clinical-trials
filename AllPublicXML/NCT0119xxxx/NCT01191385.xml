      This study is an international prospective, open-label, multi-center, non-interventional
      study. The protocol will allow enrollment of all patients with diagnosis of HCC in whom a
      decision to treat with sorafenib has not been made at time of study enrollment. All patients
      will be followed-up until withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, or the end of the
      study. Detailed information concerning the past medical/surgical history, performance status,
      methods of diagnosis and staging, etc. of patients with HCC will be collected, and practice
      patterns of the physicians involved in the care of patients with HCC under real-life
      conditions will be evaluated.
