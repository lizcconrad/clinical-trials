  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IUD is an extremely effective method of contraception yet few women use it worldwide.
      Considered safe to use in HIV+ women, few studies have evaluated its use among those using
      antiretroviral therapy. The only prior randomized trial looking at the IUD compared to
      hormonal contraception noted a high rate of IUD discontinuations. Understanding IUD
      acceptability and continuation is critical to improve utilization.

        -  Objective 1: Determine WHO medical eligibility and the willingness for IUD placement

        -  Objective 2: Compare method-related side effects and adverse events

        -  Objective 3: Assess the 1-year acceptability and continuation rates

      Methods: To address our objectives the investigators have designed a two Phase Study:

        -  A cross-sectional screening to evaluate contraceptive medical eligibility and
           desirability

        -  A randomized controlled trial that will compare acceptability and adherence to DMPA
           compared to the Copper IUD: enrolling 200 women stable on antiretroviral therapy to
           follow for 1 year
