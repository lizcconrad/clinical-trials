  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most malaria deaths occur within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, and in rural areas with poor
      access to health facilities, home management of malaria (HMM) can improve the timeliness of
      treatment and reduce malaria mortality by up to 50%. In order to maximize both coverage and
      impact, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) should be deployed in HMM programmes, as
      well as in formal health facilities. Up to 80% of malaria cases are treated outside the
      formal health sector and shops are frequently visited as the first (and in some cases only)
      source of treatment. Strategies to deploy ACTs in Africa thus also need to examine the role
      of shops in home management and to ensure that drugs sold are appropriate. The current
      practice of presumptive treatment of any febrile illness as malaria (both at health
      facilities and in the context of HMM) based solely on clinical symptoms without routine
      laboratory confirmation, results in significant over-use of antimalarial drugs. With ACT
      being a more costly regimen, it is important to be more restrictive in its administration and
      rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide a simple means of confirming malaria diagnosis in
      remote locations lacking electricity and qualified health staff.

      This study therefore proposes to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
      cost-effectiveness of using RDTs to improve malaria diagnosis and treatment by ocal drug
      shops in an area with high malaria transmission.
