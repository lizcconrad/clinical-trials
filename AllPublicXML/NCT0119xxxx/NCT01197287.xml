  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are three elements to this study:

        -  Part A: Single dose escalation in healthy subjects. 6 dose levels of QAK423 are planned
           in healthy volunteers.

        -  Part B: Single dose escalation in patients with mild/moderate COPD. 3 dose levels of
           QAK423 are planned in COPD patients.

        -  Part C: Titrated repeat dosing for a maximum of 14 days in mild/moderate COPD patients.

      Repeat dosing is planned in COPD patients.
