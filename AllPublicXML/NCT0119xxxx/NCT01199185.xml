  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity represents a chronic disease associated with significant cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      morbidity and mortality. Weight gain in young adults adversely impacts the development of CVD
      risk factors. Further, there is a clear relationship between weight loss in obese persons and
      reduction in these CVD risk factors. Unfortunately, young adults are at high risk for weight
      gain. Although the scientific literature contains a number of reports regarding successful
      weight loss efficacy studies, young adults are typically underrepresented.

      Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, but quitting
      smoking frequently results in significant weight gain. Proactive tobacco quit lines using
      behavioral smoking cessation interventions combined with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
      have been shown to help persons quit smoking. However, concerns about post-cessation weight
      gain have been reported as a significant barrier to quitting for many smokers particularly
      young adults.

      If an efficacious behavioral weight loss program could be combined with an efficacious
      behavioral smoking cessation program that prevented or significantly attenuated
      post-cessation weight gain, then a large public health benefit may result. Such a combined
      weight loss/ weight gain prevention / smoking cessation program that used targeted
      intervention strategies to young adults, removed barriers to participation, and utilize
      interactive technology should be appealing to this age group. To date such a combined program
      has not been tested in young adult cigarette smokers. Therefore, the objective of this
      clinical trial is to develop and test a behavioral weight loss / weight gain prevention
      intervention delivered through interactive technology that can be used in conjunction with an
      efficacious tobacco quit line. A total of 330 participants will be necessary to adequately
      address the following specific aims.

    <description>All participants will receive a smoking cessation intervention via the Proactive TARGIT Quit Line. Participants will receive access to the TARGIT Smoking Cessation Handbook which will be a useful tool to guide them through the quitting process and highlight the major points reviewed in all counseling sessions. As part of TARGIT all participants will receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Participants in the Intervention Group will also receive a Behavioral Weight Loss/ Weight Gain Prevention Intervention delivered via interactive technology. The Intervention group will receive 16 weekly webinar sessions beginning 7 weeks after randomization via Cisco WebEx. The webinar sessions will present the behavioral weight loss/ weight gain prevention program. After the 16 weekly sessions, the webinar sessions will then be scheduled monthly for the next 6 months then quarterly thereafter for 12 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The selection criteria for the clinical trial are designed to include a wide range of
        participants such that the study sample will be representative of the broader U.S.
        population of the Memphis metropolitan area. Those who might be at risk of adverse outcomes
        from the study interventions will be excluded (see exclusion criteria). All participants
        will give voluntary consent at the screening visit by signing an informed consent statement
        which has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). We will encourage the
        participation of women and minorities. The study will be open to all persons of any race or
