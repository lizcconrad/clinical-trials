      This study is sponsored by Sierra Oncology, Inc. formerly ProNAi Therapeutics, Inc. The
      purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety of the investigational drug PNT2258
      in patients with advance tumors and see how it acts in the body.

      This study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PNT2258 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors for which no standard therapy exists. Patients will receive
      PNT2258 as an intravenous infusion once daily for 5 consecutive days (Days 1-5) of every
      21-day cycle (3 weeks). At first, patients will be treated in single patient cohorts
      following an accelerated titration design and evaluated for toxicities. After the accelerated
      portion ends, patients will be treated in cohorts of at least 3 patients at each dose level
      and evaluated for treatment-related toxicities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed, malignant solid tumor (measurable or non-measurable disease)
             and cannot be a candidate for known regimens or protocol treatments of higher efficacy
             or priority.

          -  Recovered to Grade 1 from all acute toxicities of prior therapies, except for residual
             toxicities, such as alopecia, which do not pose an ongoing medical risk.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count 1,500/µL

               -  Platelets 100,000/µL

               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) or 5.0 x ULN
                  in patients with liver metastases

               -  Serum creatinine 1.5 x ULN or measured creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at the time of enrollment for women of child-bearing
             potential. For men and women of child-producing potential, use of effective
             contraceptive methods is required during the study.

          -  Ability to understand the requirements of the study. Must provide written informed
             consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information. Must
             agree to abide by the study restrictions and to return for the required assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received previous anticancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or any other
             investigational therapy in the 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior
             to study entry.

          -  Receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Known brain metastases with the exception of patients with a history of treated brain
             metastases who are stable for at least 3 months off glucocorticoids and seizure
             medications.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or serious
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             serious cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.
