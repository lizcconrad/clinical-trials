  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on both pre-clinical and clinical data, it may be advantageous to administer a cancer
      vaccine before chemotherapy to enhance immune responses, thus leading to a more effective
      therapeutic approach for subjects with metastatic HRPC. This clinical study will evaluate the
      role of combination therapy of TroVax® plus Docetaxel vs. Docetaxel alone on the progression
      free survival (PFS) of subjects with HRPC.

          3. Must meet one of following 3 criteria for progressive disease following androgen
             deprivation:

        A. Subjects w/nodal or visceral metastases:

        PSA only disease must have an elevated PSA as defined by Consensus Criteria Prostate Cancer
        Clinical Trials Working Group II (Scher et al. 2008). PSA must indicate progressive disease
        defined as rising PSA values, at least 7 days apart, &gt;2 ng/mL in the 28 days prior to
        randomization.

        C. Subjects w/bone involvement:

        New disease on bone scan as defined by Consensus Criteria Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials
        Working Group II (Scher et al. 2008). 4. Subjects on stable dose of bisphosphonates showing
        subsequent tumor progression may continue on this medication; however, subjects are not
        allowed to initiate bisphosphonate therapy w/in 28 days prior to starting study treatment
        at Week 1 or at any time after that during the study, 5. Must be clinically
        immunocompetent. Clinical immunocompetence assumed unless subject has been diagnosed as
        immunosuppressed, is receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy for oncology disorders, or is
