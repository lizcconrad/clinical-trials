      The purpose of this study is to determine whether taking grape seed extract prior to eating a
      high fat meal will reduce the inflammatory response in people with the metabolic syndrome. If
      this extract is shown to mitigate the inflammatory response induced by a high fat meal, it
      could potentially aid in postponing of the diagnosis of diabetes or other chronic diseases
      associated with high levels of inflammation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The metabolic syndrome will be diagnosed on the basis of having a combination of any 3 of
        the following factors:

          1. Waist circumference of ≥ 40 inches (men) or ≥ 35 inches (women)

          2. Elevated triglycerides ≥150mg/dl

          3. HDL cholesterol of &lt; 40mg/dl (men) or &lt; 50mg/dl (women)

          4. Elevated blood pressure of ≥ 130/85mmHg

          5. Fasting glucose of &gt; 100mg/dL

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Smokers

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects taking any medications that would interfere with outcomes of the study i.e.
             lipid lowering medications, anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. ibuprofen), dietary
             supplements

          -  Subjects with any known allergy or intolerance to foods involved in the study
             (cantaloupe, egg, dairy, wheat, grape seed extract)

          -  Subjects who are actively trying to lose weight

          -  Subjects with unusual dietary habits (i.e. pica, anorexia nervosa, extreme food
             restriction, binging and/or purging disorders)

          -  Subjects who are addicted to drugs or alcohol or who are &lt;1 year recovery program

          -  Subjects who present with significant psychiatric or neurological disturbances as
             determined by the primary investigator (i.e. uncontrolled bipolar disorder)

          -  Subjects with documented atherosclerotic disease, inflammatory disease, diabetes
             mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 140/90mmHg), liver and kidney disease as
             identified by routine blood tests (chemistry panels). These subjects will be referred
             to their primary care doctor for further care.
