      The purposes of this study are to evaluate if switching an antiretroviral medication from
      efavirenz (EFV) to atazanavir/ ritonavir (ARV/r) will, in a 96-week period, change:

        1. the amount of fat in HIV patients with lipoatrophy,

        2. metabolic lab values such as your lipid (fat) profile, glucose (blood sugar), and
           insulin (a hormone that regulates glucose) in HIV patients with lipoatrophy.

      Our study will evaluate the effects on peripheral fat of switching from EFV to ATV/r over 96
      weeks in HIV+ patients with clinical lipoatrophy. From a virologic standpoint, EFV and ATV/r
      are medications which are recommended equally as preferred components of antiretroviral
      regimens in the December 2009 version of the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents
      in HIV-1 Infected Adults and Adolescents.[20] The study subjects should be receiving a stable
      EFV-containing antiretroviral (ART) regimen for at least 48 weeks prior to study entry. Blood
      will be saved for further investigations if needed. Safety parameters will be regularly
      assessed throughout the study. In addition, a subcutaneous fat biopsy will be obtained to
      measure fat mtDNA, mtRNA, and fat apoptosis. These measurements would provide significant
      insight into the clinical changes which have been recently described.
