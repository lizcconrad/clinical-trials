    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety of multiple doses of AAB-003 (PF-05236812) in patients
      with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Patients will receive either AAB-003 (PF-05236812)
      or placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 41 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 26 and 39</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-cog 70 Point is a structured scale (approximately 40 min to complete) that evaluates memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language and constructional praxis. This study used the 11-item cognitive subscale of the ADAS-Cog with scores ranging from 0 to 70 points; higher scores indicated greater cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD) Score at Weeks 13, 26 and 39</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 26 and 39</time_frame>
    <description>The DAD is a functional assessment based on an interview with the caregiver that takes approximately 20 min to administer and it is comprised of 40 items, 17 related to self-care and 23 items involving instrumental activities of daily living. The DAD is scored from 0 to 100 (higher scores indicate better functioning).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 26 and 39</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is an instrument used to assess changes of behavior that have appeared in a defined period of time in participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. Twelve (12) behavioral areas are assessed in the NPI - delusions, apathy, hallucinations, disinhibition, agitation, irritability, depression, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, nighttime behaviors, euphoria, appetite, and eating changes. The NPI score is based on frequency and severity of specific behaviors within these categories as reported by the caregiver. A separate caregiver distress score may also be included. The NPI ranges from 0 to 144 (higher scores indicate greater psychopathology).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Global CDR Rating at Weeks 26 and 39</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 26 and 39</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging instrument that tracks the progression of cognitive impairment in the following 6 categories - memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, involvement in community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care based on the CDR interview. The CDR is based on discussions between the clinician with the participant and caregiver using a structured format. A global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules with values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5 (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). A more quantitative version of the CDR scale is obtained by summing up the ratings in each of the 6 categories to provide the (CDR-SB). The CDR-SB scale ranges from 0 to 18 where higher score indicates severe dementia.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 26 and 39</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used to assess cognition. It is commonly used to screen for dementia. In the time span of about 10 min, it samples various functions, including arithmetic, memory and orientation. Scores range from 0 to 30 (higher scores indicate less impairment) and participants with scores of 16 to 26 were eligible.</description>

        <description>The NPI is an instrument used to assess changes of behavior that have appeared in a defined period of time in participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. Twelve (12) behavioral areas are assessed in the NPI – delusions, apathy, hallucinations, disinhibition, agitation, irritability, depression, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, nighttime behaviors, euphoria, appetite, and eating changes. The NPI score is based on frequency and severity of specific behaviors within these categories as reported by the caregiver. A separate caregiver distress score may also be included. The NPI ranges from 0 to 144 (higher scores indicate greater psychopathology).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Global CDR Rating at Weeks 26 and 39</title>
        <description>The CDR scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging instrument that tracks the progression of cognitive impairment in the following 6 categories – memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, involvement in community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care based on the CDR interview. The CDR is based on discussions between the clinician with the participant and caregiver using a structured format. A global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules with values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5 (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). A more quantitative version of the CDR scale is obtained by summing up the ratings in each of the 6 categories to provide the (CDR-SB). The CDR-SB scale ranges from 0 to 18 where higher score indicates severe dementia.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Global CDR Rating at Weeks 26 and 39</title>
          <description>The CDR scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging instrument that tracks the progression of cognitive impairment in the following 6 categories – memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, involvement in community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care based on the CDR interview. The CDR is based on discussions between the clinician with the participant and caregiver using a structured format. A global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules with values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5 (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). A more quantitative version of the CDR scale is obtained by summing up the ratings in each of the 6 categories to provide the (CDR-SB). The CDR-SB scale ranges from 0 to 18 where higher score indicates severe dementia.</description>
