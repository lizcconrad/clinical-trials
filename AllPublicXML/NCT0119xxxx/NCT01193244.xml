    <measure>Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until radiographic disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (approximately up to 4.7 years)</time_frame>
    <description>rPFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease progression assessed by independent central radiology review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radionuclide bone scans at regularly scheduled visits. Radiographic disease progression in bone required a confirmatory scan. Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue did not require a confirmatory scan for purposes of analysis. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by independent central radiology review using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for soft tissue disease and Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines for bone disease. Participants who did not reach the endpoint were censored at their last assessment.</description>

        <title>Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS)</title>
        <description>rPFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease progression assessed by independent central radiology review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radionuclide bone scans at regularly scheduled visits. Radiographic disease progression in bone required a confirmatory scan. Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue did not require a confirmatory scan for purposes of analysis. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by independent central radiology review using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for soft tissue disease and Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines for bone disease. Participants who did not reach the endpoint were censored at their last assessment.</description>

Pain progression was defined as the occurrence of 1 of the following and confirmed by an additional assessment, at least 3 weeks but not more than 5 weeks later: The brief pain inventory-short form (BPI-SF) worst pain score was &gt;=4 with a &gt;=2 point increase over baseline in BPI-SF worst pain score with stable or increased analgesic use; The BPI-SF worst pain score was &gt;=4 but not less than baseline with new or increased (relative to baseline) Step II or Step III analgesic use; The BPI-SF worst pain score was &lt;=3 but not less than baseline with new or increased (relative to baseline) Step III analgesic use. BPI-SF was an 11-item questionnaire, designed to assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Total score ranged from 0 to 100 with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>

          <title>Time to Pain Progression</title>
          <description>Time to pain progression was defined as the time from participant randomization to the first assessment date of pain progression. Pain progression was defined as the occurrence of 1 of the following and confirmed by an additional assessment, at least 3 weeks but not more than 5 weeks later: The brief pain inventory-short form (BPI-SF) worst pain score was &gt;=4 with a &gt;=2 point increase over baseline in BPI-SF worst pain score with stable or increased analgesic use; The BPI-SF worst pain score was &gt;=4 but not less than baseline with new or increased (relative to baseline) Step II or Step III analgesic use; The BPI-SF worst pain score was &lt;=3 but not less than baseline with new or increased (relative to baseline) Step III analgesic use. BPI-SF was an 11-item questionnaire, designed to assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Total score ranged from 0 to 100 with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>

A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions determined by computerized tomography (CT) or MRI. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimetre (mm). A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters of non-lymph node lesions and of the short diameter or short axis of lymph nodes.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions determined by computerized tomography (CT) or MRI. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimetre (mm). A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters of non-lymph node lesions and of the short diameter or short axis of lymph nodes.</description>

        <title>Time to Deterioration in Global Health Status</title>
        <description>Global health status deterioration is defined as a drop greater than 16 points from the baseline assessment, confirmed at least 3 weeks later, on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Module 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) index after the score has been linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions, where question 1 to 28 can be answered with 1: Not at all, 2: A little, 3: Quite a bit, 4: Very much and question 29 to 30 with 1: Very poor to 7: Excellent. For subscales a high score from 0-100 indicates: high global quality of life, high level of functioning (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social) or a high level of symptoms (fatigue, nausea, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, financial difficulties).</description>
