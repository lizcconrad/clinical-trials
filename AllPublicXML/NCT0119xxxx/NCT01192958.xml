      At present influenza immunity can only be reliably confirmed by a blood test. This test is
      invasive for the patient. This study is intended to validate an oral fluid/saliva antibody
      test for the variant Swine Influenza H1N1. If such a test were available, this painless and
      non invasive test will improve direct clinical care to an individual as well as significantly
      help guide future public health management of the pandemic.
