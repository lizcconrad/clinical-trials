    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS, and to
      assess cortical metabolism before and after rTMS sessions in patients with major depression.
      We also aimed to investigate differences between the responders and nonresponders to rTMS and
      what would predict clinical response to rTMS.

      The specific aims of this study is to: (1) evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS on
      major depression; (2) evaluate the effects of rTMS on cognitive function in depressive
      patients; (3) assess the effects of rTMS on cerebral glucose metabolism in depressive
      patients as measured by 18FDG PET; (4) investigate the differences of the regional cerebral
      glucose uptake changes during rTMS between responders and nonresponders to rTMS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Twenty patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of major depression according to
             DSM IV will be enrolled in the study.

          -  Antidepressant medication will be maintained throughout the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria are current neurological or other psychiatric disorders, as well as
             a history of epileptic seizures, substantial brain damage or neurosurgical operation,
             according to established safety criteria.

          -  To exclude the effect of drug changes on post-rTMS cerebral glucose metabolism, the
             combinations and dosage of pre-rTMS antidepressant drugs will remain unchanged until
             the post-rTMS 18FDG PET is done.
