    <textblock>
      GERD is a common condition in the western world. In most cases, the diagnostic is established
      by good response to empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. When the patient symptoms
      are refractory to therapy, multiple invasive tests are available. The results of those tests
      (EGD, manometry, Ph monitoring and impedance) are clues that the physician use together to
      establish the diagnostic. No test however can be use alone because of their poor specificity
      and sensitivity. Recently, microscopy has been used to detect dilated intercellular space in
      between distal esophageal cells tissue; unfortunately this marker again failed to diagnose
      GERD.

      In search of more sensitive and specific markers of GERD, we propose to assess if acid
      exposure affects: 1) gene and proteins expression in the esophageal/post-cricoid area tissue;
      and 2) local impedance of the mucosa. The secondary aim of this proposal is to determine if
      correlation exists between the two approaches.
