    <textblock>
      Adherence (or compliance with) a medication regimen is generally defined as the extent to
      which patients take medication as prescribed by their health care providers. The adherence to
      medications has close relation to effectiveness of the therapy. The primary objective of this
      study is to observe the adherence to treatment with oral clodronate (PDC, proportion of days
      covered, number of days in which clodronate is taken according to treating physician
      recommendation) in patients with malignancy. The secondary &quot;hypothesis generating&quot; objective
      is to describe the relation between adherence to treatment with oral clodronate and efficacy
      of the therapy (skeletal events, pain).
