  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are more often overweight or obese and are more
      insulin resistant than women without the condition and may be at greater risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease. It is not know whether it is the overweight and insulin resistant
      component of PCOS, or PCOS per se which leads to the greater cardiovascular disease risk. The
      aim of this study was to examine cardiovascular risk markers in women with PCOS versus a
      control population matched for body mass index (BMI), and or, insulin resistance
