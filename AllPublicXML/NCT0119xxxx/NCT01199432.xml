  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled study.
      Eligible patients are randomly assigned into three groups. The investigators propose to
      evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of different neoadjuvant chemotherapies in women
      with primary breast cancer.

    <description>pathological evaluation by Miller &amp; Payne Grading System. Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as no histological evidence of invasive tumor cells in the breast. The presence of DCIS alone was considered as pCR (G5). Residual cancer consisting of scattered tumor cells, not directly measurable, was reported as near pCR (G4)</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Ⅲ° and Ⅳ° Adverse Events According to NCI-CTC</measure>
    <time_frame>at the last day of every chemotherapy cycle</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events that occur after the initiation of the treatment will be handled with utmost attention, and carefully documented. Investigator will identify the adverse events according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 3.0, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.Development of a severe side effect will be an indication for drop-outs.</description>
