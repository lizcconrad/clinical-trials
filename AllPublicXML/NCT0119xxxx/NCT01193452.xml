    <textblock>
      This phase II trial on the assumption that S-1 combined with Leucovorin may have better
      efficacy and safety than simplified 5-FU/LV infusion therapy in elderly patients with
      advanced colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase Ⅱ study, in which S-1 is used in combination with leucovorin in
      elderly patients with advanced colorectal cancer as first-line treatment,comparing with
      sLV5FU2 therapy. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of S-1/LV in
      elderly patients in the first-line setting. The other secondary endpoints are progression
      free survival,overall survival, and quality of life are also evaluated.
