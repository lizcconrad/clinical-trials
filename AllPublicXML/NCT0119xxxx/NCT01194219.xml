  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effects of an called apremilast. Apremilast works by lowering some
      of the chemicals that affect psoriasis and therefore improves the symptoms of psoriasis. The
      purpose of this study was to test apremilast and compare its effects to placebo (an inactive
      substance which contains no medicine but is in the same form as the drug). This study was
      able to test for efficacy (improvement of signs and symptoms) and safety of apremilast in
      patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Improvement (Response) in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI-75) at Week 16 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With At Least 2 Points Reduction From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA was a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall severity, the Investigator factored in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and did not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign was averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions. In the event of different severities across disease signs, the sign that is the predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Percent of Affected Body Surface Area (BSA) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>BSA was a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis was estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area. BSA percent change from baseline (Visit 2 Week 0) was determined at each visit of the study, which is calculated as 100*(visit BSA - baseline BSA) / baseline BSA (%).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score. The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing. PASI score percent change from baseline was calculated as 100* (visit score - baseline score)/baseline score (%).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 50% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score (PASI-50) at Week 16 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was classified as having at least a 50% improvement in PASI score from baseline, which was equivalent to a percent change from baseline ranging from −100% to −50%. PASI score is based on an assessment of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling), and the percent area affected as observed on the day of examination.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus Visual Analog Scores (VAS) were used to measure the amount of itching and discomfort a participant experiences. Participant's Assessment of Pruritus (Itch) asked: On average, how much itch have you had because of your condition in the past week? All VAS values range from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to more severe symptom or disease. Change from baseline was calculated for the VAS scale, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the participant is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mental Component Summary (MSC) Score of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-item (SF-36) Health Survey Version 2.0 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations-physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Both a 75% Improvement (Response) in the PASI and sPGA Score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) With at Least 2 Points Reduction at Week 16 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-75 response was the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. See Outcome Measure #1 for further description. sPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. See OCM #2 for further description.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan Meier Estimate of Time to Loss of PASI-75 Response (Loss of Effect) at Week 32 During the Re-Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 32 to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Time to loss was the time between the re-randomization date and the date of the first assessment where loss of PASI-75 was observed (event); or the time between the re-randomization date and the date of the last PASI assessment in the Weeks 32-52 interval prior to addition of protocol-prohibited medication/therapy, or resumption of APR 30 BID, or discontinuation, or Week 52 if no loss (censored).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) During the Placebo-Controlled Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16; mean duration of exposure was 14.8 weeks and 15.0 weeks for subjects randomized to placebo and apremilast respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With TEAEs During the Apremilast-Exposure Period Through Week 260</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 260; mean exposure to apremilast 30 mg BID during the Apremilast-exposure Period up to Week 260 was 97.83 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Apremilast-exposure Period started on the date of the first dose of apremilast (Week 0 for participants originally randomized to apremilast or Week 16 for participants originally randomized to placebo) to the last dose of apremilast. Adverse events that started after 28 days of initiating placebo and before resuming apremilast treatment in the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Weeks 32 to 52) were excluded in the Apremilast-exposure Period. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

          <description>Participants who were initially randomized to APR 30 mg BID during the 16-week Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0-16) continued dosing with APR 30 mg BID through the Maintenance Phase (Weeks 16-32). At Week 32, those participants who were considered responders [ie, having a ≥ Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score of 75 (PASI-75) response] were re-randomized to PBO during the Randomized Withdrawal Phase (Weeks 32-52). Those participants who retained their ≥PASI-75 response through the Randomized Withdrawal Phase remained on PBO until week 52. Those participants who lost their PASI-75 improvement achieved at week 32, were switched back to APR 30 mg BID at the time loss of effect was observed. All participants who completed the Randomized Withdrawal Phase at week 52 were eligible to participate in the Long-term Extension Phase from weeks 52-260, and received APR 30 mg BID for the remainder of their participation.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Improvement (Response) in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI-75) at Week 16 From Baseline</title>
        <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

        <description>The sPGA was a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall severity, the Investigator factored in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and did not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign was averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions. In the event of different severities across disease signs, the sign that is the predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score. The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing. PASI score percent change from baseline was calculated as 100* (visit score – baseline score)/baseline score (%).</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</title>
          <description>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score. The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing. PASI score percent change from baseline was calculated as 100* (visit score – baseline score)/baseline score (%).</description>

        <description>The Pruritus Visual Analog Scores (VAS) were used to measure the amount of itching and discomfort a participant experiences. Participant's Assessment of Pruritus (Itch) asked: On average, how much itch have you had because of your condition in the past week? All VAS values range from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to more severe symptom or disease. Change from baseline was calculated for the VAS scale, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant’s skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from “Very Much” (score 3) to “Not at All” or “Not relevant” (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant’s skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if “No,” then the participant is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being “A lot,” “A little,” or “Not at all” (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations–physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations–emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) During the Placebo-Controlled Phase</title>
        <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

Adverse events that started after 28 days of initiating placebo and before resuming apremilast treatment in the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Weeks 32 to 52) were excluded in the Apremilast-exposure Period. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>
