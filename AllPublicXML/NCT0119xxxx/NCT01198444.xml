  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to the dosing scheme is the principal element of Combined Oral Contraceptives
      efficiency. On the other hand noncompliance seemed to be an inseparable element of any oral
      treatment. The aim of the study is to evaluate in everyday practice the relation between
      dosage errors and indicated factors, potentially influencing the compliance with the dosing
      scheme.
