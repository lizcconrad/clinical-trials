      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the short and long-term effectiveness of
      two common interventions, manual physical therapy versus corticosteroid injection, for the
      treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunction in the shoulder has been reported to affect up to 33% of the general population
      and generate up to 5% of all consultations from general practitioners. Shoulder problems have
      been reported as the second highest musculoskeletal complaint for those seeking care from a
      physical therapist in a deployed environment. Impingement syndromes occur in nearly anyone
      who repeatedly or forcefully uses their upper extremity in an elevated position, which is
      very common in the active duty population, and is often characterized by pain during this
      motion. Managed improperly, this can lead to disruption in work performance and prolonged
      disability.

      Corticosteroid and analgesic injections are some of the most common procedures for
      orthopedists, rheumatologists, and general practitioners to use in the management of shoulder
      pain. Conflicting reports from systematic reviews questions the efficacy of corticosteroid
      injections over other interventions, including oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs). Additionally they are not without potential risk such as infection or deleterious
      effects of prolonged corticosteroid use to include tissue degeneration reported in animal
      studies as well as other regions of the human body. Manual physical therapy offers a
      non-invasive approach with negligible risk in as few as three to six sessions and has been
      shown to improve strength and function in this patient population.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of two interventions
      that are commonly used in the management of shoulder impingement syndrome.

        1. Evaluate the effect that a subacromial corticosteroid injection has on a subject's
           function and pain as measured by the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI).

        2. Evaluate the effect that manual physical therapy has on a subject's function and pain as
           measured by the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI).

        3. Compare the effect sizes of the two different interventions in a patient population with
           shoulder impingement syndrome.

    <description>The SPADI is a 100-point, 13 item self-administered questionnaire divided into two subscales (pain and disability), with higher scores indicating greater pain and disability. It is responsive to change and accurately discriminates between patients who are improving or worsening. It has high test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The minimal detectable change (MDC) is 18 and the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) is between 8-13 points. The validity and responsiveness to change of SPADI have been described in physical therapy, as well as primary and secondary care settings.</description>

    <description>The GROC questionnaire is an instrument that measures overall changes in the quality of life of the subject. The use of a GROC is a common, feasible, and useful method for assessing outcome, and has been shown to be a valid measurement of change in patient status in other pain populations. A change in score of three rating points has been established as a clinically significant in the patients perception of quality of life. The GROC has 15 possible choices, with 0 being equal to no change and -1 to -7 indicating a negative change and +1 to +7 indicating a positive change.</description>

    <description>The orthopaedic manual physical therapy (OMPT) intervention approach used in this study will be based on an impairment model. The physical therapist providing the intervention will address the impairments found in the shoulder joints to include the acromioclavicular joint, glenohumeral joint, and scapular-thoracic joints, and cervical/thoracic spine. Patients will receive procedures tailored to their specific impairments. Procedures will include mobilizations and manipulations of the joint and soft-tissues.</description>

        <title>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</title>
        <description>The SPADI is a 100-point, 13 item self-administered questionnaire divided into two subscales (pain and disability), with higher scores indicating greater pain and disability. It is responsive to change and accurately discriminates between patients who are improving or worsening. It has high test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The minimal detectable change (MDC) is 18 and the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) is between 8-13 points. The validity and responsiveness to change of SPADI have been described in physical therapy, as well as primary and secondary care settings.</description>

            <description>The orthopaedic manual physical therapy (OMPT) intervention approach used in this study was based on an impairment model. The physical therapist providing the intervention addressed impairments found in the shoulder joints to include the acromioclavicular joint, glenohumeral joint, and scapular-thoracic joints, and cervical/thoracic spine. Patients received procedures tailored to their specific impairments. Procedures included mobilizations and manipulations of the joint and soft-tissues.

        <title>Global Rating of Change</title>
        <description>The GROC questionnaire is an instrument that measures overall changes in the quality of life of the subject. The use of a GROC is a common, feasible, and useful method for assessing outcome, and has been shown to be a valid measurement of change in patient status in other pain populations. A change in score of three rating points has been established as a clinically significant in the patients perception of quality of life. The GROC has 15 possible choices, with 0 being equal to no change and -1 to -7 indicating a negative change and +1 to +7 indicating a positive change.</description>
