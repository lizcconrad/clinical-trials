  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the investigators have reached the Healthy People 2010 goal of 80% coverage among
      U.S. children 19-35 months of age for the primary immunization series, 20% of children still
      remain underimmunized. In addition, pockets of low immunization coverage and outbreaks of
      vaccine preventable disease persist. Immunization reminder-recalls have been shown to be
      successful, but have been limited by the ability to identify and reach large target
      populations in a real-time, automated fashion. Reminder-recalls via text message may offer an
      innovative opportunity to improve vaccination coverage. Currently, 91% of Americans own a
      cell phone. Prior research by our team suggests that text messages reminder recalls may be an
      effective tool to remind parents about their children's vaccines. In this study, the
      investigators will demonstrate the effectiveness of tailored text message appointment and
      immunization reminders linked to a well-established and functional immunization registry to
      increase coverage rates and timeliness of the sentinel vaccines of MMR and HepA. The
      investigators will target parents of young children from an underserved population that is
      primarily Latino, with low socioeconomic status.
