  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presently, the literature addressing the relationship between epidural analgesia and
      likelihood of breast-feeding is inconclusive. Numerous studies have found that epidurals,
      administered prior to vaginal delivery of a full-term, healthy neonate, significantly
      decrease lactation success at follow-up times ranging from 24 hours to 6 months postpartum.
      One proposed mechanism is that analgesics, by decreasing maternal pain during labor, decrease
      maternal endorphin production and result in the transmission of lower endorphin levels to the
      neonate during breast-feeding. Lower endorphin levels, in turn, may render the neonate less
      likely to suckle optimally. Other studies have found that epidural analgesia does not
      significantly decrease lactation success when used during the vaginal delivery of a
      full-term, healthy neonate.

      Although most studies to date have compared the breast-feeding success of epidural recipients
      and non-recipients at various points postpartum, they do not specifically note whether
      deficient feeding behaviors on the part of the infant contribute to failed breast-feeding.
      The present study uses the LATCH assessment tool to score the infant's ability to latch onto
      the breast and the presence of audible swallowing, as well as the mother's level of physical
      comfort with breast feeding, whether she can successfully position the infant for feeding on
      her own, and whether her nipples are inverted, everted, or flat. Thus, the LATCH assessment
      enables the separation of multiple factors that may contribute to breast-feeding failure. A
      multivariate regression analysis will determine how strongly the probability of
      breast-feeding at hospital discharge correlates with epidural duration, LATCH scores, and
      beta-endorphin concentrations in colostrum.

        This study is open to all women, aged 18 and over, who are inpatients on the postpartum
        floor of MetroHealth Medical Center following the vaginal delivery of a single, healthy
        neonate. A neonate is &quot;healthy&quot; if neither of the following two conditions exists: 1)
        admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) following delivery and 2) pathologies,
        in either mother or baby, that would be reasonably expected to impede normal breast-feeding
        activity.
