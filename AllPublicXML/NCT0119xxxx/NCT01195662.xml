    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if BMS-512148 (Dapagliflozin), after 12 weeks, can
      improve (decrease) blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes with uncontrolled
      hypertension who are on an Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an Angiotensin
      Receptor Blocker (ARB).The safety of this treatment will also be studied

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Seated Systolic Blood Pressure for 12 Week Double-Blind Treatment Period - Randomized Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) on Day -1, Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 of the Double Blind Period. Blood pressure (BP) values were obtained after the participant was seated for quietly for 10 minutes; a mean of 3 replicate measurements was taken at least 1 minute apart. However, if the 3 consecutive seated BP readings were not within 8 mm Hg of each other, an additional 2 BP readings were obtained (total = 5) and incorporated into the calculated mean. BP was measured in both arms. If the BP was higher in one arm than the other, then this arm was used; if no difference, the participant's dominant arm was used for all future BP measurements. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Participants refrained from ingestion of caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine at least 10 hours prior to their visit and having their BP measured.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for 12 Week Double-Blind Treatment Period - Randomized Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Adjusted mean change in glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) from baseline at Week 12 was calculated. HbA1c was measured as percent of hemoglobin by a central laboratory. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. HbA1c values were obtained at enrollment and lead-in (Day -28) periods, and at Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, and 12, in the double-blind period.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in 24-hour Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure at Week 12 Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulatory 24 hour (hr) blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed at baseline, which was during the lead-in period (between Day -7 and Day -1 prior to randomization) and 1 week prior to the Week 12 visit/end of treatment visit. If no Week 12 measurement was available, the last available earlier post-baseline measurement was used (LOCF) for analysis. Initiation of the 24-hr ABPM began between 6am and 11am to ensure trough BP measurements were obtained.The ABPM units were calibrated, and used per the manufacturer's and central ABPM vendor instructions. BP was measured in mmHg. Participants had to have a mean 24-hour ABPM ≥ 130/80 mmHg prior to randomization. All medication was withheld on the morning of the study visit and brought to the visit site by the participant. Once the ABPM cuff was in place, all morning medication was taken while at the site.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Seated Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) for 12 Week Double-Blind Treatment Period - Randomized Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic BP was measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) on Day -1, Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 of the Double Blind Period. Diastolic BP values were obtained after the participant was seated for quietly for 10 minutes; a mean of 3 replicate measurements was taken at least 1 minute apart. However, if the 3 consecutive seated BP readings were not within 8 mm Hg of each other, an additional 2 BP readings were obtained (total = 5) and incorporated into the calculated mean. BP was measured in both arms. If the pressure was higher in one arm than the other, then this arm was used; if no difference, the participant's dominant arm was used for all future BP measurements. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Participants refrained from ingestion of caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine at least 10 hours prior to their visit and having their BP measured.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Serum Uric Acid at Week 12 in Double-Blind Treatment Period - Randomized Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Adjusted mean change in serum uric acid from baseline at Week 12 was calculated. Serum uric acid was measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) by a central laboratory. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Serum uric acid measurements were obtained at qualification and lead-in (Day -28) periods, and at Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, and 12, in the double-blind period but only the change from baseline at Week 12 was considered a secondary endpoint and is presented.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Seated Systolic Blood Pressure for 12 Week Double-Blind Treatment Period - Randomized Participants</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) on Day -1, Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 of the Double Blind Period. Blood pressure (BP) values were obtained after the participant was seated for quietly for 10 minutes; a mean of 3 replicate measurements was taken at least 1 minute apart. However, if the 3 consecutive seated BP readings were not within 8 mm Hg of each other, an additional 2 BP readings were obtained (total = 5) and incorporated into the calculated mean. BP was measured in both arms. If the BP was higher in one arm than the other, then this arm was used; if no difference, the participant’s dominant arm was used for all future BP measurements. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Participants refrained from ingestion of caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine at least 10 hours prior to their visit and having their BP measured.</description>

        <description>Ambulatory 24 hour (hr) blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed at baseline, which was during the lead-in period (between Day -7 and Day -1 prior to randomization) and 1 week prior to the Week 12 visit/end of treatment visit. If no Week 12 measurement was available, the last available earlier post-baseline measurement was used (LOCF) for analysis. Initiation of the 24-hr ABPM began between 6am and 11am to ensure trough BP measurements were obtained.The ABPM units were calibrated, and used per the manufacturer’s and central ABPM vendor instructions. BP was measured in mmHg. Participants had to have a mean 24-hour ABPM ≥ 130/80 mmHg prior to randomization. All medication was withheld on the morning of the study visit and brought to the visit site by the participant. Once the ABPM cuff was in place, all morning medication was taken while at the site.</description>

BP was measured in mmHg. Participants had to have a mean 24-hour ABPM ≥ 130/80 mmHg prior to randomization. All medication was withheld on the morning of the study visit and brought to the visit site by the participant. Once the ABPM cuff was in place, all morning medication was taken while at the site.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Seated Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) for 12 Week Double-Blind Treatment Period - Randomized Participants</title>
        <description>Diastolic BP was measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) on Day -1, Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 of the Double Blind Period. Diastolic BP values were obtained after the participant was seated for quietly for 10 minutes; a mean of 3 replicate measurements was taken at least 1 minute apart. However, if the 3 consecutive seated BP readings were not within 8 mm Hg of each other, an additional 2 BP readings were obtained (total = 5) and incorporated into the calculated mean. BP was measured in both arms. If the pressure was higher in one arm than the other, then this arm was used; if no difference, the participant’s dominant arm was used for all future BP measurements. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Participants refrained from ingestion of caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine at least 10 hours prior to their visit and having their BP measured.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With Orthostatic Hypotension at Baseline and Week 12, Including Data After Rescue</title>
        <description>Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease from supine to standing of &gt; 20 mmHg in systolic BP or &gt;10 mmHg in diastolic BP. Proportion was calculated from number of participants with orthostatic hypotension (n) divided by the number of treated participants (N). n/N presented as a percent (%). Baseline was Day 1 of the double blind Period. Measurements for orthostatic hypotension were taken on Day 1 and at Week 12 visit and does not reflect AEs reported by the investigator.</description>
