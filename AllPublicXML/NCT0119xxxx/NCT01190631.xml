  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate total residual spherical aberration (TSA) post-IOL
      implantation, and to determine if an association exists between TSA, postoperative high order
      aberrations (HOA), and functional vision following IOL implantation in patients grouped by
      pre-operative corneal spherical aberration (CSA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be grouped by pre-operative corneal spherical aberration (CSA) measures, i.e.,
      ≤0.230 micron and ≥0.270 micron.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contrast Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast sensitivity is the measurement of one's ability to detect slight changes in luminance before it becomes indistinguishable. It is measured in logarithmic units by means of an illuminated box, the CSV 1000 by Vector Vision. A higher value for the logarithmic units translates to better contrast sensitivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Higher Order Aberrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A higher order aberration is a distortion acquired by a wavefront light when it passes through an eye with irregularities of its refractive components (tear film, cornea, aqueous humor, crystalline lens and vitreous humor). It is measured via wavefront measurements according to manufacturer's instructions with a LADARWave (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Ft. Worth TX).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Spherical Aberration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal spherical aberration is the blurring of an image that occurs when light from the margin of a lens or mirror with a spherical surface comes to a shorter focus than light from the central portion. The changing focal length is caused by deviations in the lens or mirror surface from a true sphere and is measured by corneal topography with a commercially available topographer in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uncorrected Visual Acuity (UCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Uncorrected visual acuity, i.e., visual acuity without any type of corrective lenses, is measured in logMAR. LogMAR is the &quot;logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution,&quot; and a lower logMAR value indicates better visual acuity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Best corrected visual acuity, i.e., visual correction utilizing a phoropter or trial frames, is measured in logMAR. LogMAR is the &quot;logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution,&quot; and a lower logMAR value indicates better visual acuity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Low Contrast (10%) Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity is tested using 10% contrast ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts under photopic conditions. Testing is performed using the correction from the manifest refraction at a distance calibrated for the chart. Visual acuity (VA) is measured in logMAR. LogMAR is the &quot;logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution,&quot; and a lower logMAR value indicates better visual acuity.</description>
