  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter clinical trial, phase III, controlled by active medicine, double-blind,
      randomized, enroll 208 subjects, above 12 years old, that suffer acute inflammation upper
      airway characterized by non-productive cough, daytime/nighttime, with duration for at least 3
      and no more than 5 consecutive days (without systemic/topic use of medication during this
      period) followed by nasal congestion, with or without associate other nasal symptoms
      (sneezing, runny nose, nasal itching and/or mouth breathing). The subjects will be allocated
      in 2 parallel groups, and will receive the medicines of study, according of the
      randomization.
