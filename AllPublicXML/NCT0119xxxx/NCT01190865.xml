    <textblock>
      The goal for this study is to examine the persistence of growth
      arrested,allogeneic,male-donor keratinocytes and fibroblasts when applied as product
      HP802-247 to the surface of acute excisional wounds in health female volunteers, as measured
      using Y-STR for detection of Y-chromosome.

    <measure>Identification of the Full Set of Y-chromosome Short Tandem Repeats in Each Bioopsy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Cohorts of 3 subjects were biopsied at weekly intervals for 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy variable was detection of the full set of 17 Y STR loci. If all loci amplified such that a clear identification of a donor was possible, the test result was categorized as positive. If fewer loci amplified such that identification of the donor was not possible in a forensic setting, the result was categorized as negative. Descriptive statistics are presented for this variable.</description>

    <measure>Time in Days to 50% Correct Identification (ID50) of the Implanted Male DNA 17 Loci in Female Volunteers, With Regard to Three DNA Profile Types, Including Partial DNA Profile, &gt; 50% DNA Profile, and Full (or Complete) DNA Profile.</measure>
    <time_frame>Cohorts of 3 subjects were biopsied at weekly intervals for 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The biopsy area was examined for the presence of the Y chromosome, based on the presence of a full set of Y-STR loci as well as partial sets, assayed by a commercial kit (AmpFISTRTM).
Probit analysis was utilized to determine the time in days to 50% correct identification (ID50) of the implanted male DNA 17 loci in female volunteers, with regard to three DNA profile types, including partial DNA profile, &gt; 50% DNA profile, and full (or complete) DNA profile. The analysis was performed using SAS® PROC PROBIT</description>

          -  Provide written informed consent.

          -  Female, 18 years of age or older.

          -  Any race or skin type, provided that there are no tattoos within 5 cm of the wound
             target, and the gentian violet surgical marker produces a clearly visible mark on the
             skin.

          -  Willing to make all required study visits and, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             able to follow instructions.

          -  Willing to undergo the repeated biopsy procedures.

          -  Willing to undergo verification of sex chromosome status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Males, or phenotypic females bearing Y-chromosome genetic material [e.g., 46,X,(r)Y;
             46,X,der(X)t(X;Y); sex reassignment surgery].

          -  Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the study medications or their
             components (e.g., history of anaphylaxis, serum sickness, or erythema multiforme
             reaction to aprotinin, bovine serum albumin or bovine serum proteins, penicillin,
             streptomycin, or amphotericin B).

          -  History of keloid formation or hypertrophic scarring.

          -  Participation in any interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to screening.

          -  History of prolonged bleeding, bleeding into joints, easy bruising following minor
             trauma, clotting factor deficiency, or current use of anticoagulants or platelet
             inhibitors.

          -  Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the Co-Investigator, may interfere with
             normal wound repair.

          -  Current therapy with drugs or biologics intended to function as immuno-suppressants,
             chronic (&gt; 10 days) oral corticosteroids, or any concomitant medication which, in the
             opinion of the Co-Investigator, may interfere with normal wound repair.

          <title>Identification of the Full Set of Y-chromosome Short Tandem Repeats in Each Bioopsy.</title>
          <description>The primary efficacy variable was detection of the full set of 17 Y STR loci. If all loci amplified such that a clear identification of a donor was possible, the test result was categorized as positive. If fewer loci amplified such that identification of the donor was not possible in a forensic setting, the result was categorized as negative. Descriptive statistics are presented for this variable.</description>
          <population>3 subjects were withdrawn; 2 for non-compliance and one at the subject's request. One subject, who was available to replace a subject assigned to a weekly cohort if the subject was unavailable, was assayed on Day 57 with the subjects assigned to the Week 8 cohort.</population>
