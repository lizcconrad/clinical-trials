    <textblock>
      What hematopoietic precursor compartments as well as hemoglobin subtypes are affected by
      dosing with Sotatercept (ACE-011)? Based upon a similar prior study with Procrit, Celgene has
      determined that all of these goals could be obtained by an intense 10 patient, Sotatercept
      (ACE-011) pharmacodynamic study, completed by two well known experts in the red cell
      production field.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy documented by cytology
             or biopsy.

          3. Presence of metastatic disease.

          4. Hemoglobin value between ≥ 8.0 to &lt; 11.0 g/dL (≥ 80 to &lt; 110 g/L).

          5. ≥ 28 days must have elapsed (prior to pre-dose RBC mass / PV test) since previous
             treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (including concurrent treatment with
             IV iron).

          6. ≥ 28 days must have elapsed (prior to Day 1) since the last RBC blood transfusion and
             receipt of ≤ 2 units of blood in the past 56 days (prior to Day 1).

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 - 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        At the time of screening, subjects who have any grade ≥ 3 toxicity (according to the
        currently active minor version of NCI CTCAE v4.0, except for the following disease related
        toxicities:

          -  Hematological events - anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia
