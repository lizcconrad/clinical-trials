    <textblock>
      The investigators want to research whether genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes
      can be used to predict chemotherapeutic outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      1. Patients evaluation On all patients a complete clinical history and physical examination
           is performed, including routine hematology and biochemistry analyses. Hematology and
           biochemistry analyses are repeated at the end of each cycle. Toxicity is classified
           according to WHO criteria at each cycle for each patient. Response is assessed after two
           cycles of chemotherapy and every two cycles thereafter, using Response Evaluation
           Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines.

        2. Sample collection and SNP genotyping Venous blood (4 ml) is collected from each subject
           and placed into tubes containing EDTA. Genomic DNA is isolated with a DNA Blood
           isolation kit.Genotypes are performed by PCR-RFLP, PCR-DHPLC and PCR-direct sequencing,
           etc.

        3. Statistical Analysis x2 test is used to summarize the association of response and
           adverse events to chemotherapy with genetic polymorphisms.
