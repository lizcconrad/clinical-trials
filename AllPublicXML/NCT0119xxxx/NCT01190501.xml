  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main objective is to assess whether aortic stiffness is a predictor of blood pressure
      response after surgery in patients with an aldosterone producing adenoma or a unilateral
      adrenal hyperplasia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary objectives are to investigate whether aortic stiffness predicts cardiovascular ,
      operative and postoperative morbid-mortality at 1 year, to evaluate the benefit of
      adrenalectomy in patients with primary aldosteronism due to unilateral adrenal hyperplasia
      and in patients with aldosterone producing adenoma associated with controlateral adrenal
      morphological abnormalities, and to participate to a national DNA repository of patients with
      primary aldosteronism.

    <description>The procedure of use of complier has to follow the recommendations for standardization of subject conditions.
Assessment of arterial distensibility: pulse wave velocity (PWV), aortic stiffness is assessed by PWV which is a classic index of arterial stiffness. A semi-automatic device is used to measure carotid-femoral PWV. The distance covered by the pulse wave is measured on the surface of the body and represented the distance between the 2 recording sites.</description>
