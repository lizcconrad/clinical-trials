  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous publications have indicated that Allergic Rhinitis (AR) patients suffering from both
      ocular and nasal symptoms have a greater burden of illness and lower quality of life than
      patients suffering from nasal symptoms alone. Fluticasone furoate (FF) acts against both
      nasal and ocular symptoms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in
      symptom control (both perceptually and objectively) and resource use for patients with
      current seasonal AR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common inflammatory condition of the upper respiratory
           tract, nasal cavity and eyes affecting up to 20% of the population in the United States
           and Europe. The bothersome nature of AR symptoms can severely affect daily activities
           including ability to work and examination performance and impact on quality of life
           (QoL) and psychosocial well being.

        -  This study assesses the impact of Fluticasone furoate (FF) on the QoL of seasonal
           allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients, including the number of symptom-free days (SFD) and
           quality of life over the last 4 weeks, and compares this with other inhaled nasal
           steroids (INS): mometasone furate (MF) and fluticasone proprionate (FP).

        -  Selected physicians provide information including a range of demographic, symptom and
           treatment details for a number of their SAR patients. The patient themselves are then
           invited to provide details about their SAR including symptoms, the impact of AR upon
           their lifestyles, attitudes to treatment and completion of Health Related Quality of
           Life (HRQoL) instruments.
