      The purpose of this study is to determine mean or median of fractional exhaled nitric oxide
      (FeNO) in Thai atopic asthmatic patients that divided into subgroups due to level of asthma
      control according to the global initiative for asthma guideline.

      From many previous studies, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has many benefits such as
      non-invasive, easily to perform, less time consume, has direct association with severity of
      inflammation of bronchial trees and sputum eosinophils, has benefit for diagnosis and
      monitoring the treatment in asthmatic patients.

      In Thailand, this field of study is less extend, especially in children population. We
      hypothesized that in uncontrolled or partly controlled group may have high level of
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) than controlled group.

      It is therefore desirable to examine the association between fractional exhaled nitric oxide
      (FeNO) and level of asthma control among atopic asthmatic Thai children and will be the main
      objective of this research.
