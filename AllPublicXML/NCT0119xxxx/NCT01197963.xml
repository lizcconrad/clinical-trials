    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if by performing surgery we can cure Type II
      Diabetes.

      The surgical procedures:

        1. a sleeve gastrectomy, cutting out a portion of the stomach, which provides restriction
           of caloric intake and rapid gastric emptying.

        2. ileal transposition which involves repositioning a 150cm segment of the ileum into the
           jejunum causing improved glucose homeostasis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serial Postoperative HgA1c levels</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month intervals for 3 months then every 3 months there after</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness of the transposition to alleviate hyperglycemia will be measured by following serial post operative HbA1c levels. The change from baseline mearusements will be used to determine the outcome. Type 2 diabetes is considered resolved if there is normalization of fasting glucose(&lt;110 mg/dl) normal HbA1c (&lt;6%) and no need for diabetic medications.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serial Postoperative Lipid Profiles levels</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month for the first 3 months then every 3 months there after</time_frame>
    <description>Lipid profiles will be examined at follow up witha goal of total cholesterol &lt;200 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels &lt;100 mg/dl, triglyceride levels &lt;150 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels &gt;40 mg/dl. Patients will be fasting for 8 hours and the serum glucose and GLP-1 level will be checked.</description>
