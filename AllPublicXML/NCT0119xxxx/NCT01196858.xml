  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the 1990s, evidence began to emerge of the long duration of untreated illness prior to
      receiving treatment for patients with psychotic disorders. Studies across the world on first
      episode psychosis have consistently found an average of 1 - 2 years between the onset of
      psychotic symptoms and the start of treatment. Lengthy treatment delay has immediate
      implications such as unnecessary distress for patients and families, and may also compromise
      potential recovery when treatment is initiated.By understanding how and why substantial
      delays occur the investigators may be able to better design interventions to facilitate
      better earlier treatment. The components of DUP can be conceptualised as comprising 3
      distinct intervals: help-seeking delay, referral delay and delay in mental health services.
      In this study the primary aim is to establish the level of DUP in nordland, and explore the
      components of this variable. Help-seeking delay will be investigated by interviewing patients
      presenting at the central mental health hospital in Nordland about their psychosis onset and
      pathways to care. Referral delay will be investigated by a questionnaire about the referral
      pratices among GPs in Nordland. Delays in mental health services will be investigated by
      focus group interviews with leaders and professionals at the 7 community mental health
      centers in Nordland. This knowledge is believed to be crucial for developing services that
      can reduce DUP and give this patient population earlier access to adequate treatment.

        This study is a naturalistic cohort study. All patients registrered in a 3 year period with
        the acute and/or rehabilitation units will be invited to participate.

        The eight units (acute and rehabilitation) will be able to provide a potential sample size
        of 150 participants over the 3-year period of the study. We are confident of minimal
        attrition and assume that we will achieve at least 85% follow up. This means that we can
        expect to have collected data on approximately 120 people.
