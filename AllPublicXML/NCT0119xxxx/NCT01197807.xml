  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, bulb or catheter oronasopharyngeal suctioning (ONPS) of all the infants,
      including vigorous infants in the delivery room, has been featured as a standard of newborn
      care. The 5th edition of the Newborn Resuscitation Program (NRP) has minimized the
      recommendation for routine suctioning of infants following delivery, provided they are not
      depressed or in need of immediate resuscitation. However, this new alternative recommendation
      was based on a small randomized trial and other lower level evidence rather than evidence
      from larger trials. The NRP Textbook cautions against vigorous suctioning because of the
      resultant apnea or bradycardia. Furthermore, suctioning may delay other more important steps
      of resuscitation. Thus, it is necessary to compare the alternative recommended practice, i.e.
      simple wiping of the mouth, to determine if it has equivalent efficacy and a favorable side
      effect profile compared to suctioning.
