          1. Subjects must be male at the age of 20-40 years old in good health on the basis of
             medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and routine
             laboratory evaluations.

          2. Vital signs (after 3 minutes resting in a upright position) which are within the

             Diastolic blood pressure, 50-90 mm Hg. Pulse rate, 50-90 bpm. Fasting blood glucose, &lt;
             100 mg/dL.

          3. Body weight must be greater than 50 kg and within -20 to +20% of ideal body weight.

          4. Able to sign informed consent prior to study.

          5. Able to communicate well with the investigator and comply with the requirements of the
             study.

          9. Presence of liver disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C or liver injury as indicated by an
             abnormal liver function profile such as GOT, GPT,gama-GT, alkaline phosphatase, serum
             bilirubin, HBsAg, or Anti-HCV.

         10. Presence of impaired renal function as indicated by abnormal creatinine or BUN values
             or abnormal urinary constituents (e.g., albuminuria).

         11. Presence of neurological disease.

         12. Presence of psychiatrical disease.

         13. Subject is known for HIV infected.

         14. A known hypersensitivity to gliclazide or its analogs.

         15. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to dosing.

         16. Permanent confinement to an institution.

         17. Individuals are judged by the investigator or pharmacokineticist to be undesirable as
