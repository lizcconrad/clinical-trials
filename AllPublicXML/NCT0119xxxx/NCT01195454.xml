      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the total metabolic effect ratios of a new insulin glargine formulation versus
      Lantus®

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the exposure ratios of a new insulin glargine formulation versus Lantus®

        -  To compare the duration of action of a new insulin glargine formulation versus Lantus®

        -  To explore the dose response and dose exposure relationship of a new insulin glargine
           formulation

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a new insulin glargine formulation

      The study period for one patient is one month in average and it can last up to 11 weeks
      broken down as follows:

        -  Screening: 3 to 28 days

        -  Treatment period: 1 to 4 days: 2 days (1 overnight stay)

        -  Washout period: 5 to 18 days (preferentially 7 days between consecutive dosings)

        -  End of study: 1 day after the last dosing
