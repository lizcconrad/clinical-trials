  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than two million American women are breast cancer survivors. Approximately one-third of
      these women are premenopausal at diagnosis and face issues related to reproduction as they
      undergo cancer treatment. Ovarian function after breast cancer diagnosis has implications on
      breast cancer prognosis, choice of adjuvant therapy and reproductive issues such as desire
      for fertility or concerns about menopause. Therefore, tools to accurately predict ovarian
      function in breast cancer survivors could significantly impact physicians and patients in
      counseling, medical and surgical treatment choices, and consideration of fertility
      preservation options.

      The goal of this proposal is to identify pre-chemotherapy hormonal, genetic and ovarian
      imaging markers that can predict ovarian failure and characterize the course of ovarian
      function after chemotherapy. The investigators plan to follow a group of young women from
      breast cancer diagnosis to five years after chemotherapy. The investigators will study the
      following risk factors: blood hormone levels that reflect ovarian function, genetic mutations
      that affect how individuals metabolize chemotherapy, and ovarian size and egg count by MRI
      and ultrasound. The investigators hypothesize that these biomarkers are related to risk of
      ovarian insufficiency singly. After examining these individual risk factors for ovarian
      failure, the investigators will put them together into an Ovarian Failure Clinical Predictive
      Index. This index will be a tool similar to the Gail Model that can be used to determine
      individual risk for ovarian failure. This tool would assist young breast cancer patients and
      their physicians in making treatment decisions that would impact cancer survival and
      reproduction.
