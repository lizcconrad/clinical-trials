  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several groups, especially the PETHEMA group (in their LPA96 and 99 trials), obtained low
      relapse rates in newly diagnosed Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) patients by combining
      ll-transretinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracyclines without Ara-C, suggesting that avoiding Ara-C
      in the chemotherapy of APL reduced treatment toxicity without increasing relapses. While the
      relapse rate for the children with white blood cell(WBC) counts greater than 10×109/L at
      presentation were higher than those WBC counts less than 10×109/L (31% and 3.5%,respectively)
      in the LPA96 and 99 trials. A recent adult randomized trial show that avoiding Ara-C leads to
      an increased risk of relapse in the APL patients with WBC counts less than 10×109/L. The role
      of the Ara-C remains controversial. And there are very limited data reported on children with
      APL so far.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some studies suggest patients with high-risk disease should be treated with intensified doses
      of anthracycline, or intermediate/ high-dose Ara-C or As2O3 as an early consolidation, so as
      to decrease the risk of relapse.However, a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline may lead
      to cardiac toxicity, especially for children. In addition, containing Ara-C will led to more
      therapy-related toxicity. The benefit to add Ara-C to the schedules is questionable and
      remains a matter of investigation in children.
