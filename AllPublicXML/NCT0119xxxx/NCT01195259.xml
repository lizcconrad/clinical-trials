  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational analyses of data from population registeries have suggested that metformin may
      be associated with a decreased prevalence of malignancy. The ADOPT and RECORD studies both
      contain groups of subjects randomly allocated to metformin and rosiglitazone. This
      meta-analysis combines malignancy serious adverse events from ADOPT and RECORD in order to
      compare their incidence on metformin with that on rosiglitazone.

      The objective of this meta-analysis is to compare the incidence of malignancy (excluding
      non-melanomatous skin cancers) reported as serious adverse events in the ADOPT and RECORD
      studies between subjects randomly allocated to treatment with metformin with those allocated
      to rosiglitazone.

        Subjects from ADOPT that are included in this meta-analysis (those in the metformin or
        rosiglitazone groups) had the dose of their study medication increased to a maximum of 2g
        (metformin) or 8mg (rosiglitazone) if their fasting plasma glucose was greater than
        140mg/dl.

        Subjects from RECORD that are included in this meta-analsyis entered the RECORD study
        taking one of three sulfonylureas (glibenclamide, gliclazide or glimepiride). They were
        randomly allocated to metformin or rosiglitazone in a 1:1 ration to use as add-on treatment
        to the background of sulfonylurea. These subjects had the dose of their study medication
        increased to a maximum of 2.55g (metformin) or 8mg (rosiglitazone) if their HbA1c was
        greater than 7.0%.
