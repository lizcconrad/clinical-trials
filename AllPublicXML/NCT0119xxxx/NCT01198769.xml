  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess immunogenicity and safety of Rotarix TM when
      administered in healthy Taiwanese infants (aged 6 to 12 weeks at the time of first
      vaccination) who received Hepatitis B immunoglobulin after birth.

    <measure>Number of Seroconverted Subjects for Serum Anti-rotavirus Immunoglobulin A (IgA) Antibody.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months post-Dose 2 (at study Month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion is defined as the appearance of IgA antibody concentration equal to or above (≥) 20 Units per millilitre (U/mL) in the serum of subjects who were seronegative before vaccination. A seronegative subject is a subject with anti-rotavirus IgA antibody concentration below (&lt;) 20 U/mL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Anti-rotavirus IgA Antibody Concentrations.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months post-Dose 2 (at study Month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean antibody concentration in units per millilitre (U/mL), calculated on all subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Solicited General Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 8-day (Days 0-7) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were cough, diarrhoea, irritability, loss of appetite, temperature (any temperature was defined as a tympanic on rectal setting temperature ≥ 38.0 degrees Celsius) and vomiting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Rotavirus (RV) Present in the Gastroenteritis (GE) Stool Sample.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 0 (first vaccine dose) to study Month 4 (2 months post-Dose 2)</time_frame>
    <description>RV was not identified in the one GE stool sample collected in the study. Two subjects reported GE episode between vaccination Dose 1 and before vaccination Dose 2. For one of them, GE stool sample was not collected and for the other subject no RV was identified in the GE stool sample.
GE symptoms were defined as diarrhoea with or without vomiting. A GE stool sample was collected as soon as possible after the illness began by the parent/guardian of the subject. Presence of RV antigen was detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited adverse event is any adverse event (i.e. any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (from Dose 1 at Day 0 up to Month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that results in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subjects.</description>
