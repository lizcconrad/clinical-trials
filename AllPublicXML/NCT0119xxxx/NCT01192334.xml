  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was well known that total knee arthroplasty could improve the previously impaired
      proprioception in degenerative osteoarthritis. Most current researches have been focused on
      the change of the proprioception. However, the evaluation of the proprioception is based on
      the surrogated end.

      Double or single limb standing balance is considered functional scale. It is very important
      view for the prevention of slipping down injury in evidence-based approaches for knee
      osteoarthritis.

      Unfortunately, few study have been performed for figuring proprioceptive change after surgery
      out.

      Considering the similarity between the proprioception and the standing balance and reported
      positive result in proprioception after total knee arthroplasty, the investigators supposed
      that total knee arthroplasty might give an influence on the recovery of single limb standing
      balance.
