    <textblock>
      Adequate nutrition is one of the critical biological processes to learning and cognitive
      development of children. And is understandable that malnourishment affect these processes.
      Moreover, in recent decades it has been investigated the beneficial effects of Omega-3 in
      cognitive development and academic performance. However, studies have been limited. Therefore
      is of interest to know the effects that has supplement with Omega-3 for children 8-12 years
      with malnutrition in a randomized, blind, placebo-controlled.

      Adequate nutrition is one of the most critical biological processes to learning and cognitive
      development of children, and malnourishment is understandable these processes are affected.
      Moreover, in recent decades is has been investigated the beneficial effects of Omega-3 in
      cognitive development and academic performance. However, studies have been limited. The
      present study will investigate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids supplement on cognition
      and academic performance in children attending elementary school.

      The study will follow a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in which children
      aged 6-12 years will followed for a period of three months to assess cognitive development,
      academic performance and nutritional status . Intervention will take place in elementary
      schools, where children will receive two intervention products daily and one more in their
      houses. The products will contain omega-3 fatty acids, placebo, or only neuropsychological
      evaluation (control group with normal nutrition children). At baseline, and 3months cognitive
      tests will be administered and assess nutritional status. Compliance will be measured weekly.

      We hypothesize that after 12 months of intervention, children consuming omega-3 fatty acids
      will have statistically significant higher improvement in scores on cognitive tests, than
      placebo and normal nutrition children.
