      Background:

      - Seasonal influenza is a major health problem whose impact is typically reduced by
      vaccination. The H1N1 (swine flu) influenza virus is an emerging pathogen that has the
      potential to cause devastating illness and even death in the coming months. Currently, there
      are limited data on the cellular and molecular immune responses in adult recipients of either
      the seasonal or the H1N1 influenza vaccines.

      Objectives:

      - To obtain blood and nasal wash samples and perform laboratory studies to characterize the
      immune response in healthy adult volunteers at baseline and after immunization with the
      seasonal or H1N1 influenza vaccines.

      Eligibility:

      - Adult employees at least 18 years of age of the NIH Clinical Center who are deemed healthy
      by a brief medical history and physical examination and routine blood testing.

      Design:

        -  Before the start of the influenza season, volunteers will receive either the seasonal
           influenza vaccine or the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available. If the H1N1 vaccine is
           available at the start of the season, volunteers will receive both the seasonal vaccine
           and the H1N1 vaccine.

        -  Blood will be drawn over an 8-week period. Volunteers must not eat anything for 8 hours
           prior to the blood draw. The sequence of the blood draws is as follows: 2 weeks before
           vaccination; right before vaccination; and 1, 7, 14, 28, and 60 days after vaccination.

        -  Two to four nasal washings will be collected by a nurse before volunteers receive the
           vaccination(s) and 28 days after the vaccination.

        -  Prevaccine and postvaccine blood and nasal wash samples will be compared to determine
           volunteers immune responses.

        -  Research samples will be stored indefinitely and will be used strictly for laboratory
           experiments.

      Seasonal influenza is a major health problem whose impact is typically reduced by
      vaccination. The H1N1 (swine flu) influenza virus is an emerging pathogen which has the
      potential to cause devastating morbidity and mortality in the coming months. In June 2009,
      the World Health Organization declared the H1N1 outbreak to be a global pandemic. At present
      there are limited data on the cellular and molecular immune responses in adult recipients of
      either the seasonal or the H1N1 influenza vaccines.

      Therefore, the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases proposes
      this protocol designed to obtain blood from healthy adult subjects (NIH employees) prior to
      vaccination and then at various time points after receiving the FDA-licensed seasonal and
      H1N1 influenza vaccine. These samples will be used to perform a comprehensive and detailed
      analysis of the immune system at baseline and in response to vaccination. To our knowledge,
      this protocol will be the first study to characterize the human cellular and molecular immune
      system parameters, or immunome, in a large number of healthy adults (NIH employees). This
      information may be useful in designing newer, more effective vaccines to prevent the spread
      of H1N1 influenza.

      The primary objective is to perform laboratory studies to characterize the immune response in
      healthy adult volunteers at baseline and after immunization with the seasonal or H1N1
      influenza vaccines. Primary endpoint is the results of the research laboratory assessments.
      As samples will be stored indefinitely, the time frame for primary endpoint is indefinite.
