  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to train OIF/OIF Veterans with multiple injuries to be Peer
      Visitors, i.e., Volunteers who visit more recently OIF/OEF Veterans and provide support. We
      evaluated the effectiveness of the training, and any benefits that Volunteer Peer Visitors
      and the Recipients of Peer Visitors experienced as a result of participating in Peer
      Visitation.

    <textblock>
      Peer visitation (PV) provides individuals newly dealing with a particular injury/ illness
      with an opportunity to interact with a peer who has successfully managed a similar condition.
      Interaction with a successful role model can provide credible social support and information,
      increase self-efficacy and teach coping strategies, which in turn can engender hope and
      motivation to engage in treatment and use active coping strategies. In spite of the
      widespread clinical availability of PV programs, the amount and type of training and
      clinical/organizational varies widely, and empirical support for their efficacy is limited.
      The main objective of this project is to test the feasibility of implementing a PV program
      for OEF/OIF veterans with war-related polytrauma.

      The proposed study represented a unique opportunity to evaluate three important aspects of
      peer visitation among OEF/OIF Veterans. Our three hypotheses were: H 1: Veteran Peer Visitors
      (VPVs) who complete the training will demonstrate successful acquisition of efficacy,
      knowledge and skills as measured by: (1) pre- and post-tests administered before and after
      the training; (2) trainer evaluations upon completion of the training, (3) self-evaluation of
      at least two actual peer visits, and (4) evaluation by two individuals who receive peer
      visits. H2: VPVs who complete the study will demonstrate increased self-care, improved mood,
      and increased post-traumatic growth compared to pre-training baseline measures. H 3: Veterans
      who receive a visit from a VPV will endorse improvement in one or more of the following
      areas: stress, self-efficacy, activation, mood, ability to make meaning of their experiences,
      and knowledge of coping options.

      We used a mixed-methods study to evaluate the feasibility of PV training materials developed
      in a previous grant to certify 12-18 Veteran Peer Visitors (VPVs). In a prior project, the
      proposed research team developed the training materials to be tested in this feasibility
      study, including screening tools to identify appropriate candidates for VPV training, an
      Instructor manual and a Veteran PV workbook.

      Two types of participants: Veteran Peer Visitors and Recipients of VPVs were recruited via
      the Polytrauma Network Site in VISN 20 (Seattle). VPVs were nominated by a clinician to
      participate and, if enrolled, will undergo 2-day training and will be required to pass a test
      upon completion of training. Training included a VA Voluntary Services background check, and
      orientation to the VHA and VA privacy policies. VPVs became official VA volunteers. Each
      certified VPV was required to provide 1-5 visits to at least two Veterans. Both VPVs and
      recipients of VPV completed surveys at baseline and upon study completion.

      <recruitment_details>Both types of study participants were recruited from Veterans who were seen in Polytrauma Clinics at the Polytrauma Network Site. Both types of participants were referred by clinicians based on their clinical knowledge of whether this intervention seemed indicated; Recipients could also self-refer based on printed information.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>400 Veterans were considered by the interdisciplinary polytrauma team as candidates for PV training. Of these, 29 (7%) were nominated. Of these, 14 (48%) were not enrolled: 6 (21%) due to time or travel restrictions, 6 (21%) could not be reached, and 2 (6%) because they had either been injured too recently or not participated in enough therapies.</pre_assignment_details>
