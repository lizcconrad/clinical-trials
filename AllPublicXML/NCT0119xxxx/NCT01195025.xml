  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volume kinetics is a method mostly used, so far, to study the distribution and elimination of
      crystalloid solutions. Voluven (in Sweden the most commonly used colloid for replacement of
      bleeding during surgery) is poorly studied, though. Also, a recent study showed unexpected
      volume kinetics for a crystalloid solution when it was given after a colloid solution. The
      investigators aim to study the volume kinetics of crystalloids and colloids and also the
      combination of the two in more detail. The investigators will also compare the invasive
      hemoglobin measurements with measurements from a new non-invasive tool (Radical 7, from
      Masimo Inc.) which could help to make volume kinetics more practical for everyday use.
      Finally the investigators will also study the concentrations of a few coagulation factors to
      see if they can explain the variations in coagulability that has been described in earlier
      studies of infusion solutions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will study ten volunteers, each one on three occasions. Each volunteer will receive only
      crystalloid one time, only colloid another time, and on the third occasion first a colloid
      and then a crystalloid one hour later. The different protocols will be in random order in the
      different volunteers. During all these tests we will sample the hemoglobin (both invasive and
      non-invasive) every fifth minute in the beginning (every tenth minute later) after the
      infusion. On six to nine occasions during each test we will analyse Albumin, Cystatin-C,
      Ig-G, Ig-M as markers of hemodilution and D-Dimer, Fibrinogen, Factor VII, PK-INR
      (prothrombin complex international normalized ratio), and aPTT (activated partial
      thromboplastin time) as markers of coagulation. The volunteers are also monitored regarding
      non-invasive blood pressure and pulse rate.
