      This study will assess the effects of an intervention targeting family caregivers who
      recently placed a relative in a long-term care facility because of cognitive and/or physical
      disability. In a two group randomized clinical trial we predict that caregivers assigned to
      active treatment will have lower levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and greater
      satisfaction with the long-term care facility when compared to individuals assigned to the
      control condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to address three interrelated needs of caregivers who recently placed
      a relative in a long-term care facility: (a) psychiatric problems, particularly depression
      and anxiety which are common among caregivers who recently placed their relative; (b)
      knowledge about the nature of long-care procedures and resident trajectories; and (c)
      end-of-life planning for the institutionalized relative. These needs will be addressed with
      an intervention that has three components: (a) a treatment protocol for depressive symptoms,
      major depression, and anxiety; (b) education about the organization and operating procedures
      of long-term care facilities, the clinical aspects of frailty, and a negotiated plan for
      caregiver participation in the care of their relative; and (c) education about resident
      trajectories in long-term care and assistance with end-of life planning. Expected outcomes
      include reduced depression and anxiety, greater satisfaction with the long-term care
      facility, and reduced service use because of an articulated end-of-life plan. Because this
      intervention is designed to reduce distress prior to the death of the placed relative, a risk
      factor for negative bereavement outcomes, we also expect lower levels of depression and
      complicated grief post-death among persons in the active treatment condition whose relative
      dies. In as much as the demand and utilization of long-term care is virtually certain to
      increase in the decades ahead, this study has the potential of providing valuable guidance in
      navigating this transition and in improving health outcomes for caregivers in the short- and
      long-term. The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Assess the effects of an intervention targeting caregivers who recently placed a
           relative in a long-term care facility because of cognitive and/or physical disability.
           In a two group randomized clinical trial we predict that caregivers assigned to active
           treatment will have lower levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and greater
           satisfaction with the long-term care facility when compared to individuals assigned to
           the control condition.

        2. Assess the impact of the intervention on psychiatric outcomes and on complicated grief
           for those caregivers whose relative dies during follow up. We predict that long-term
           symptoms of depression and symptoms of complicated grief will be lower after death among
           caregivers assigned to active treatment when compared to those in the control condition.

        3. Carry out exploratory analysis to assess the effects of the intervention on
           resident-related outcomes, including number of emergency room visits and
           hospitalizations, rate of functional decline, perceived quality of life, and formal
           complaints filed on behalf of the resident. Because the intervention engages the
           caregiver in monitoring resident health status and in end-of-life planning, we predict
           that resident-related outcomes will be better in the active treatment group. Overall,
           this should be reflected in greater perceived quality of life of residents in active
           treatment when compared to residents of participants in the control condition.

    <description>The intervention is comprised of three modules (see Table 6), each of which has multiple components. Module One provides basic education about the clinical aspects of frailty as well as the organization and operating procedures of long-term care facilities. Module Two focuses on advanced care planning, and Module Three is designed to improve the emotional well-being of family caregivers. The intervention will be delivered via 11 sessions lasting approximately 90 minutes each distributed over a six-month period. All family caregivers will begin with the Basic Knowledge Module. Modules Two and Three will be delivered in alternating sessions, based on caregiver need and preference, a strategy successfully used in the REACH intervention trial.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will receive a portion of the standardized packet of written information that is also provided to the treatment group. This packet will contain several fact sheets from a nationally-recognized expert source in caregiving (the Family Caregiver Alliance's National Center on Caregiving) and a national information and advocacy group (the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform). The fact sheets are relevant to the placement of a family member into a nursing home and are linked to the content areas covered in the intervention. Documents in this packet include &quot;Caregiving and Depression,&quot; &quot;End of Life Decision Making,&quot; and &quot;Taking Care of You: Self-Care for Family Caregivers&quot; from the Family Caregiver Alliance; and &quot;Family Involvement in Nursing Home Care,&quot; &quot;Problem Solving,&quot; and &quot;Residents' Rights&quot; from the National Citizen's Coalition.</description>
