      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      certolizumab pegol (CZP) treatment in children and adolescents with moderately to severely
      active Crohn's disease. Secondarily, to assess the long-term efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      and immunogenicity of CZP treatment in children and adolescents with moderately to severely
      active Crohn's disease.
