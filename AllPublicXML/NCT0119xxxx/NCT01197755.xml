  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two dosing regimens of
      fostamatinib compared to placebo, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are taking
      methotrexate and have had an inadequate response to a single TNF-alpha antagonist. The study
      will last for approximately six months.

      Date: 18 June 2010

      Version: 1

      Objectives: To collect and store, with appropriate consent ,DNA samples for future
      exploratory research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (ie,
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, safety, tolerability and efficacy) to
      fostamatinib disodium and/or methotrexate; and/or susceptibility to, progression of and
      prognosis of RA

    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ACRn: American College of Rheumatology index of RA improvement, based on smallest percentage improvement in the count of swollen joints (out of 28 joints), count of tender joints (out of 28 joints), or in blood test measures of inflammation (such as C-Reactive Protein) or the physician or patient's own assessments of disease activity, pain and physical function. Scores are reported as a percentage improvement on a scale of -100 to +100, with larger values representing a better clinical outcome. Mean refers to change at Week 24. BID = twice daily, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, PO = orally, QD = once a day.</description>

    <description>DAS28-CRP: Disease Activity Score based on a count of swollen and tender joints (out of 28 joints), blood test measures of inflammation (CRP) and the patients' own assessment. Scores can take any positive value with a lower value indicating a better clinical condition. A DAS28-CRP score of &lt;2.6 is indicative of remission of RA symptoms.

Scores can take any positive value with a lower value indicating a better clinical condition. A DAS28-CRP score of &lt;=3.2 indicates low disease activity. BID = twice daily, CRP = C-reactive protein, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, OR = odds ratio, PO = orally, QD = once daily.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Patients With a HAQ-DI Response at Week 24 - Comparison Between Fostamatinib and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI: Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index, a measure of physical function. The HAQ-DI score is calculated by summing the category scores from 8 sub-categories (ie, scores for patient ability in dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygeine, reach, grip and common daily activities) and dividing by the number of categories completed. The HAQ-DI score takes values between 0 and 3, with a higher score indicating greater disability. A HAQ-DI response is a reduction from baseline in HAQ-DI greater than or equal to the minimally important difference (0.22). BID = twice daily, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, OR = odds ratio, PO = orally, QD = once a day.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in mTSS Score, Comparison Between Fostamatinib and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>mTSS: modified total sharp score, a measure of structural progression based upon X-rays. Hand and foot joints are scored for eroisions and joint space narrowing and the results summed to give a value between 0 and 488. A higher value represents more serious progression of the disease. After disregarding ineligible records, patients with 2 or more non-missing values had missing data imputed via linear extrapolation/interpolation methods. Patients with only 1 result were excluded from the analysis. ANCOVA = Analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, IP = investigational product, PO = orally, QD = once a day.</description>

    <measure>SF-36 - Comparison of the Change in PCS From Baseline Between Fostamatinib and Placebo at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36: 36 item short form health survey, as a measure of health-related quality of life. Scores for 8 sub-domains (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, Role-Emotional and Mental Health) are derived and normalised to a scale of 0 to 100. The physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS) are derived by multiplying each of these 8 scores by a constant, summing them and standardising against a population with a mean of 50, standard deviation of 10. A higher score represents a better quality of life. Mean changes from baseline score are presented as increases from baseline (defined as post-baseline minus baseline); larger changes indicate a better clinical condition. Mean refers to change in scores at Week 24. ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, DMARD = disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, PO = orally, QD = once daily</description>

        <title>Proportion of Patients With a HAQ-DI Response at Week 24 - Comparison Between Fostamatinib and Placebo</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI: Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index, a measure of physical function. The HAQ-DI score is calculated by summing the category scores from 8 sub-categories (ie, scores for patient ability in dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygeine, reach, grip and common daily activities) and dividing by the number of categories completed. The HAQ-DI score takes values between 0 and 3, with a higher score indicating greater disability. A HAQ-DI response is a reduction from baseline in HAQ-DI greater than or equal to the minimally important difference (0.22). BID = twice daily, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, OR = odds ratio, PO = orally, QD = once a day.</description>

        <description>mTSS: modified total sharp score, a measure of structural progression based upon X-rays. Hand and foot joints are scored for eroisions and joint space narrowing and the results summed to give a value between 0 and 488. A higher value represents more serious progression of the disease. After disregarding ineligible records, patients with 2 or more non-missing values had missing data imputed via linear extrapolation/interpolation methods. Patients with only 1 result were excluded from the analysis. ANCOVA = Analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, IP = investigational product, PO = orally, QD = once a day.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set includes patients who received at least 1 dose of IP. Patients were analysed by randomised treatment in accordance with the intention to treat principle. Measurements at 2 timepoints are required for a patient to be included in the analysis; therefore patients with only 1 result have been excluded from the analysis population.</population>

        <description>SF-36: 36 item short form health survey, as a measure of health-related quality of life. Scores for 8 sub-domains (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, Role-Emotional and Mental Health) are derived and normalised to a scale of 0 to 100. The physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS) are derived by multiplying each of these 8 scores by a constant, summing them and standardising against a population with a mean of 50, standard deviation of 10. A higher score represents a better quality of life. Mean changes from baseline score are presented as increases from baseline (defined as post-baseline minus baseline); larger changes indicate a better clinical condition. Mean refers to change in scores at Week 24. ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, DMARD = disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, PO = orally, QD = once daily</description>
