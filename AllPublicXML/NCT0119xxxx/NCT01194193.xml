  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD8055 intermittent dosing schedules when
      given orally to patients with advanced solid malignancies and lymphomas. Two intermittent
      dosing schedules will be explored with increasing doses until a maximum tolerated dose is
      determined for each schedule.
