    <textblock>
      The proposed series addresses the prevention and treatment of voice problems in teachers.
      Data in the literature clearly identify voice disorders as teachers' primary occupational
      risk not only in the U.S. but also internationally. Moreover, voice problems constitute a
      global women's health concern. Until recently, few reports have been available around the
      treatment of these problems in teachers, and even fewer have addressed the equally important
      question of prevention. The present studies are conducted within the context of a long-range
      goal to identify effective intervention methodologies for both the prevention and treatment
      of voice problems in teachers taking into consideration multicultural and linguistic factors.
      The present studies will report pragmatic data around the effectiveness of two
      theoretically-driven approaches to the prevention and treatment of voice problems in
      teachers, (a) voice hygiene education (VH) and (b) voice hygiene education + voice production
      training in &quot;resonant voice&quot; (VH+VP, essentially the Lessac-Madsen Resonant Voice Therapy
      program). Participants will be student teachers in Pittsburgh and Hong Kong, who will be
      followed from student teaching across their second full year of employment as a professional
      teacher. The central aims are: [1] to evaluate the effectiveness of VH and VH+VP for the
      prevention of future voice problems in student teachers who are vocally healthy at the outset
      of the protocol, versus the treatment of voice problems in student teachers who already have
      them at some level; [2] to evaluate the generality of the findings across teachers in the
      U.S. and China, using appropriate linguistic and cultural adaptations of the interventions;
      and [3] to evaluate the feasibility of an internet-based voice exercise and reporting program
      as a supplement to face-to-face interventions. Ergonomic and personal factors will also be
      evaluated for their differential ability to predict the risk for future voice problems in
      teachers. The results should be useful at a practical level, and should also lay the
      groundwork for future studies assessing similar issues around the prevention of voice
      problems in teachers, in particular as influenced by multicultural factors within the U.S.
      The results should also be useful for future studies investigating causal pathways in
      interventions around these problems.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        By self-report in person or over the phone: (a) 21-40 yr; (b) no current self-perceived
        voice problem;(c) student teacher in the final year of formal education prior to the
        initiation of employment as a teacher and imminent start of the first formal teaching
        practicum; (d) availability and willingness to attend up to an 8-hr group intervention on 1
        of 2 days when it will be offered the week before the start of student teaching,
        willingness to be randomized to one of three groups, and stated willingness to persist with
        the entire 2.5-yr protocol, which will involve baseline, 1-mo, 3-mo, 1-yr,and 2-yr
        follow-up measures, and two separate interventions followed by a 4-wk hygiene reporting and
        potentially voice exercise period for intervention groups; (e) intention to obtain
        employment as a teacher in the school year following graduation; (f) no degenerative or
        other medical conditions or medications that would affect voice, with the exception of
        seasonal allergies (and their treatment) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR; and its
        treatment).

        · By clinical evaluation, for students satisfying the self-report criteria: (g) nasal
        patency sufficient at least unilaterally for the passage of a flexible scope; (h) no
        history or suspected allergy to any local anesthetic or evidence that a laryngeal exam can
        be conducted without it; (i) acceptably controllable gag reflex; (j) overall voice quality
        score &lt; 15 on a 100-mm visual analogue scale, following standardized procedures (see
        D.2.4.1), together with a total VHI score &lt; 17 and normal larynx (D.2.4.1; &quot;low-starter
        group&quot;—assuming the subject has indicated normal voice by self report, or overall voice
        quality score &lt; 20, together with a total VHI score &gt; 25 and either normal larynx or mildly
        impaired larynx not held to require clinical attention outside the auspices of the
        protocol(D.2.4.1; &quot;high-starter group&quot;)—if the subject has indicated normal voice or at
        most mild, intermittent voice problems by self report; and (k) normal hearing bilaterally
        (30 dB at 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz in the better ear).
