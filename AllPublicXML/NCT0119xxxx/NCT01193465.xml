      The effects of preserving humidity and temperature by low flow anesthesia are different in
      each other anesthesia workstation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fresh gas flow(FGF) is dry and cold in old fashioned anesthesia machine, especially at
      high folw (above 1 L/min). To the contrary, it has been assumed that the heat and humidity of
      FGF may be preserved using low FGF (below 1 L/min) during anesthesia or new anesthesia work
      station. However, it has not been proved yet. We hypothesized that the heat and moisture of
      FGF may be different in various FGF rate during anesthesia. In addition, it may be different
      in accordance to anesthesia work station. Therefore, we planed prospective observational
      study that will demonstrate that the difference of heat and moisture of FGF in different
      anesthesia work station (Excel; 1st generation anesthesia machine of Datex-Ohmeda Corp.,
      Avance; 2nd generation anesthesia work station of Datex-Ohmeda Corp., Cato; 2nd generation
      generation anesthesia work station of Drager, Primus; 3rd generation generation anesthesia
      work station of Drager) and different FGF (0.5, 1, 4 L/min)
