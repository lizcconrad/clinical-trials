  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new drug, RO4929097, can work with cetuximab,
      a drug already approved for colorectal cancer, to help fight the patient's cancer. Cancers
      arise as a result of abnormal control of gene expression. One of the pathways that gets
      abnormally regulated in some cancers is the Notch pathway. RO4929097 is an investigational
      drug that blocks the activation of the Notch pathway. It is hoped that by blocking this
      abnormal activation, this drug may be helpful in patients with cancer but the investigators
      do not yet know if that is true. Cetuximab is an antibody against epidermal growth factor
      receptor and is known to have activity in metastatic colorectal cancer. Recent studies have
      shown that people with colorectal cancers that contain a mutation in a gene called K-ras do
      not benefit from receiving cetuximab. It is unknown if adding RO4929097 to cetuximab would
      benefit patients who have tumors with this mutation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of cetuximab and
      RO4929097.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability of the combination of cetuximab and RO4929097. II. Exploratory
      analyses of anti-tumor effect with the combination. III. Laboratory correlatives exploring
      response rate with notch receptors and ligand expression, correlation of response and
      toxicity profiles to expression of EGFR pathway components, and evaluation of serum and
      tissue markers of gamma-secretase inhibitor activity.

      IV. Pharmacokinetic studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097.

      Phase I dose escalation: In this part of the study, the investigators are trying to find out
      what is the highest tolerated dose of RO4929097 that can be safely combined with cetuximab.
      The investigators will be testing two different cetuximab doses. One is the standard dose
      (Arm A) and one is a little less than the standard dose (Arm B). Everyone will get treated
      with cetuximab and R04929097 in this part of the study.

      Phase I dose expansion: In this part of the study, the investigators will take the highest
      tolerated dose found in the phase I part of the study and test a small number of people with
      colorectal cancer to see if there is any activity with the combination of drugs. Everyone
      will get treated with cetuximab and RO4929097 in this part of the study. This part of the
      study will be restricted to patients whose tumors do not have a mutation in the K-ras gene.
      RO4929097 is an investigational anti-cancer agent that has not yet been approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in colorectal cancer. Cetuximab is FDA approved for
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

          -  Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for metastatic disease; prior
             therapy with anti-EGFR antibody is allowed only as long as patient did not require
             dose reductions of the anti-EGFR antibody because of poor tolerability

          -  For the phase I dose expansion, tumor must be KRAS wildtype

          -  There must be available a tumor block or 20 unstained slides for correlative studies

          -  The effects of RO4929097on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because Notch signal pathway inhibitors as well
             as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of
             childbearing potential and men must use two forms of contraception (i.e., barrier
             contraception and one other method of contraception) at least 4 weeks prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 12 months
             post-treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
             her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months after study
             participation, the patient should inform the treating physician immediately

               -  Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum pregnancy
                  test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 10-14 days and within 24
                  hours prior to the first dose of RO4929097 (serum or urine); a pregnancy test
                  (serum or urine) will be administered every 4 weeks if their menstrual cycles are
                  regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular while on study within the
                  24-hour period prior to the administration of RO4929097; a positive urine test
                  must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test; prior to dispensing RO4929097, the
                  investigator must confirm and document the patient's use of two contraceptive
                  methods, dates of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's
                  understanding of the teratogenic potential of RO4929097

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential are defined as follows:

                    -  Patients with regular menses

                    -  Patients, after menarche with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a
                       contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding

                    -  Women who have had tubal ligation

               -  Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the
                  following reasons:

                    -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
                       salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy

                    -  The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period)
                       for 24 consecutive months

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Ability to swallow pills

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered to a grade 1 or less from adverse events due to agents administered more
             than 4 weeks earlier with the exception of alopecia and neuropathy

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to RO4929097 or other agents (EGFR antibodies) used in the study

          -  Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by
             cytochrome P450 (CYP450), including warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) are ineligible

          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity. Caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently
             with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are
             taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of
             CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk;
             if such patients cannot be switched to alternative medications, they will be
             ineligible to participate in this study

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with
             intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the
             institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, a history
             of torsades de pointes, significant cardiac arrhythmia other than chronic, stable
             atrial fibrillation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RO4929097 is a Notch pathway
             inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with RO4929097, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with RO4929097; these potential risks may also apply to other agents
             used in this study

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RO4929097; in addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy

          -  Cardiovascular: baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt; 470 msec (female)

          -  Patients whose tumor contains a mutation in KRAS are not eligible for the phase I dose
             expansion portion of the study

          -  Patients with prior exposure to γ-secretase inhibitors

          -  Patients with another active malignancy

          -  Patients on antiarrhythmics or other medications known to prolong QTc
