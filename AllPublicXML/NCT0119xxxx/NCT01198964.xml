  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will observe epileptic patients who already have electrodes implanted on the brain and are
      receiving high-level brain stimulation for clinical purposes while testing their motor and
      language function. We propose to do a limited, low-level brain stimulation to show that the
      signatures of local activity in the target area change as an effect of brain stimulation. The
      goal of this study is to understand the feasibility of a novel recurrent brain-computer
      interface that could eventually promote targeted functional recovery in subjects who have had
      a brain injury.

      The subject will have already been scheduled for placement of the ECoG electrodes on the
      surface of the brain and who will, for all clinical purposes, subsequently receive
      stimulation for mapping of function of the ECoG sites. The decision to place the electrodes
      on the brain, the location of the electrodes and the length of time the electrodes are in are
      all part of clinical care.

      There will be two types of testing, motor and language. Motor will involve inducing
      stimulation to the thumb cortex and the wrist cortex. There will be a conditioning of this
      over 4-12 hours. Language will involve showing pictures on a computer screen and the subject
      will be observed whether speech is disrupted with stimulation or not.
