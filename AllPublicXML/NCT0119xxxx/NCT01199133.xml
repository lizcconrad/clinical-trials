  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of one dose of sublingual immunotherapy
      (SLIT) administered to children and adolescents as allergen-based tablets once daily over a
      period of 24 months over 3 years compared to placebo, for reduction of allergic rhinitis
      symptoms and rescue medication use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the screening period, the patients will be administered 300 IR house dust mite allergen
      based tablets or placebo, once a day, for a period of 36 months with two windows of 8 months
      and 6 months without treatment. The carry over effect will be evaluated after a treatment
      free follow up period of 24 months.

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee will be constituted to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety data at the end of Year 1 and Year 3, and the post-treatment long-term efficacy data
      at the end of year 4.

    Following the DSMB recommendation. Study population being insufficiently symptomatic to enable
    differentiation between treatment and placebo. No safety concerns
