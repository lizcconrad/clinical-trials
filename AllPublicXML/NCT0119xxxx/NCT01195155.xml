  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue is a central organ involved in mediating metabolic health, and so the
      investigation of treatments which improve adipose tissue function is warranted. LC n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) have been shown to exert positive effects on adipose tissue
      gene expression in previous studies. However this has not been investigated in women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a population shown to display a degree of adipose tissue
      dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation
      on gene expression profiles of women with PCOS.

    <description>Gene expression profiles were assessed by mircoarray analysis from samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from subjects following LC n-3 PUFA and placebo supplementation. Single gene changes and pathway analyses will be conducted to assess potential differences between PCOS and control samples.</description>
