  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequent airway disease characterized by
      both bronchial inflammation and remodelling.

      Bronchial mucosa is infiltrated by macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes. In addition, the
      number of eosinophils can be also increased during exacerbation.

      Airway remodelling is an abnormal tissue repair following bronchial inflammation, which
      contributes to none reversible pathological features, such as bronchial and peri-bronchial
      fibrosis. It also influences the prognosis of COPD and its mechanisms remain largely unknown.
      The role of fibrocytes has been demonstrated in the pathophysiology of asthma, lung fibrosis
      or pulmonary hypertension. However, the recruitment of blood fibrocytes and their involvement
      in COPD airway remodelling remain unknown.
