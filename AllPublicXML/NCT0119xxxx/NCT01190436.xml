    <textblock>
      The aim of this 12-week, multicenter, interventional, prospective, open-label and single-arm
      study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5 milligram per day (mg/day) and 10 mg/day
      bisoprolol in Filipino hypertensive subjects with diabetes as monotherapy or as an add-on
      therapy.
