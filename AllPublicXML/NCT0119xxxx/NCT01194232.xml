    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common inherited disease in Caucasians, is characterized by
      chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive loss of gas exchange units that eventually
      results in respiratory failure. There is strong evidence that, in CF, abnormally low
      perfusion carries a high risk of death independent from the presence of pulmonary
      hypertension. However, the evolution of pulmonary vascular disease in CF and how it might
      contribute to the rate of decline in lung function is not known. Our knowledge remains
      limited to the results of old observational studies which concluded that the major causes of
      pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypertension in CF are hypoxic respiratory failure and
      destruction of lung tissue. Our recent data obtained by state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) of the pulmonary circulation, challenges the existing paradigm. We demonstrate
      that in the absence of hypoxia, significant changes in pulmonary perfusion and in surrogate
      measures of vascular resistance as well as in collateral blood flow begin early in the course
      of CF. Newly developed therapeutics have altered dramatically the course of patients
      suffering from pulmonary vascular disease. Through this 8 week trial, we will examine by
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging the effect of Sildenafil on pulmonary perfusion and systemic
      vascularization of the lungs in subjects with mild to moderate disease.

          -  Must have mild to moderate lung disease (Mild lung disease will be defined as an
             FEV1%p of 80-99% predicted. Moderate lung disease will be defined as an FEV1%p of
             60-79% predicted.)
