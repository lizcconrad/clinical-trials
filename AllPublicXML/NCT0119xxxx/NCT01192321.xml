      The objectives of this study are to assess and compare bilateral uncorrected distance visual
      acuity and distance spectacle independence post bilateral implantation of AcrySof Toric
      Intraocular Lenses (IOLs) and monofocal IOLs. Secondary outcomes will include cost of
      eyeglass purchased and patient vision-related quality of life.

    <description>Visual Acuity (VA) is measured in logMAR. LogMAR is the &quot;logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution&quot;. A lower logMAR value indicates better visual acuity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  are willing and able to understand and sign an informed consent;

          -  are willing and able to attend postoperative examinations per protocol schedule;

          -  are ≥ 21 years of age, of either gender and any race;

          -  have bilateral, age related, cataracts;

          -  have planned cataract removal via phacoemulsification with implantation of an
             intraocular lens (IOL);

          -  are available to undergo second eye surgery within 6 weeks of the first eye surgery;

          -  are in good ocular health, with the exception of cataracts;

          -  are free of disease(s)/condition(s) listed in the &quot;Precautions&quot; section of the AcrySof
             Toric and monofocal package inserts: choroidal hemorrhage, chronic severe uveitis,
             concomitant severe eye disease, extremely shallow anterior chamber, medically
             uncontrolled glaucoma, microphthalmos, non-age-related cataract, proliferative
             diabetic retinopathy (severe), severe corneal dystrophy, severe optic nerve atrophy,
             irregular corneal astigmatism and color vision deficiencies.

          -  have regular corneal astigmatism;

          -  qualify for bilateral AcrySof Toric IOLs on the AcrySof Toric Calculator
             (www.acrysoftoriccalculator.com)

          -  are able to obtain pupil dilation ≥ 5.0 mm

          -  are able to read and understand one of the following languages: Dutch, French, German

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  previous corneal surgery and/or reshaping

          -  abnormality, disease and/or conditions of the cornea (i.e. keratoconus, corneal
             dystrophy, keratitis, corneal scar, etc.), which would clinically contra-indicate the
             implantation of a toric intraocular lens

          -  planned multiple procedures during cataract/IOL implantation surgery

          -  planned limbal relaxing incision (LRI), Excimer laser treatment or similar procedure
             prior to or during the course of the study

          -  an ocular disease and/or condition that may compromise visual acuity levels (i.e.
             glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, amblyopia, etc.)

          -  pregnant, lactating or planning pregnancy during course of study. Subjects who become
             pregnant during the study will not be discontinued; however, data may be excluded from
             the effectiveness analyses because pregnancy can alter refraction and visual acuity
             results. Data will be collected on the CRF as observations.
