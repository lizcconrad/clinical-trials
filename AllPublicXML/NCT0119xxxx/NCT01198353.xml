  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed with the aim to evaluate the clinical effect of the overlapped
      switching to ziprasidone as well as the efficacy and safe metabolic profile of ziprasidone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited in this 12-week,
      multicenter, non-comparative, open-label trial. Prior antipsychotics were allowed to be
      maintained for up to 4 weeks during the titration of ziprasidone. Efficacy was primarily
      measured using the 18-item Brief Psychotic Rating Scale (BPRS) at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks,
      and 12 weeks. Efficacy was secondarily measured by the Clinical Global Impression - Severity
      (CGI-S) scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale at each visit. Regarding
      the metabolic effects of switching to ziprasidone, weight, body mass index (BMI),
      waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and lipid profile—including triglyceride (TG), high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol levels—were measured
      at each follow-up visit.

    <description>During the 12-week study period, patients were prescribed ziprasidone at 20 to 160 mg/day flexibly based on their effectiveness and tolerability. Fifty to one hundred percent of the past antipsychotic dose was maintained in the first week; during next 3 weeks, flexible dosing of 0-100% was used; then, ziprasidone was discontinued. This study included four visits: baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. Concomitant benzodiazepines (oral formula or injection) were allowed up to a dose of 4 mg of lorazepam-equivalents per day for anxiety and agitation.</description>

          -  Those who have history of clozapine use within 1 month.

             entry.
