    <textblock>
      In this study, BEZ235 will be administered to adult patients with advanced solid tumors whose
      disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. The
      trial will confirmed the safety and tolerability and determine the MTD of BEZ235 in Japanese
      patients.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically-confirmed, advanced unresectable solid tumors who have
             progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard therapy or for whom no standard
             anticancer therapy exists.

          2. At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST criteria for solid tumors.

          3. Age ≥ 20

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG P.S.) of ≤ 2

          5. Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks

          6. Patients must have the laboratory values Patients in the expansion part of this study
             have to meet the following criteria in addition to the criteria described above.

          7. Availability of a representative tumor tissue specimen (either archival tumor or fresh
             tumor biopsy) for pre-screening.

          8. Patients whose molecular status proved to meet the criteria (PIK3CA
             mutation/amplification and/or PTEN mutation and/or low/null PTEN expression) during
             pre-screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have brain metastases or who have signs/symptoms attributable and have
             not been assessed with radiologic imaging to rule out the presence of brain metastases

          2. Patients with any peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2

          3. Patients with unresolved diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2

          4. Patients with a history of photosensitivity reactions to other drugs

          5. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding or adults of
             reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control. Barrier
             contraceptives must be used throughout the trial in both sexes. Women of child-bearing
             potential, defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or
             who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least consecutive 1 years (i.e., who
             has had menses any time in the preceding consecutive 2 years), must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test ≤ 7 days prior to starting BEZ235.
