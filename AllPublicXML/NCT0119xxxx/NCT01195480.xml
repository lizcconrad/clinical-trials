      The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and biological effect
      of adoptive transfer of CD19ζ chimaeric receptor transduced donor-derived EBV-specific
      cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (EBV-CTL) in patients with high-risk or relapsed B cell precursor ALL
      after allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT).

    <description>Patients who have relapsed in the bone marrow after previous myeloablative HSCT and achieve remission after chemotherapy will be treated prophylactically with CD19-specific gene-engineered T cells after a second HSCT with reduced intensity conditioning.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this arm, patients identified at high (&gt; 50%) risk of relapse will be eligible for generation of donor-derived EBV CTL immediately prior to HSCT. These patients will be monitored for evidence of MRD in regular bone marrow aspirates for the first year post-HSCT. MRD positivity post-HSCT is highly predictive of subsequent relapse. In those patients who become MRD+ in the marrow at a level of minimum 5 x 10-4, cryopreserved CTL that have been transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the CD19-zeta transgene will be thawed and administered to the patient pre-emptively.</description>

    <description>The initial cohort of 5 patients (regardless of arm of study) will be treated as described. If transduced CTL infusion is safe in this initial cohort and real-time DNA PCR studies demonstrate that transduced CTL are undetectable in &gt; 50% of patients by 2 months post-infusion, the remaining 25 patients (in either arm of the study) will be treated as above but with an additional vaccination of CD19-zeta-transduced EBV-LCL infusion.
Vaccination will consist of 3 doses of 5 x 10^6 irradiated (70Gy) donor-derived EBV-lymphoblastoid cell line used to generate CTL and will be administered subcutaneously into the thigh (volume 0.3 ml) at day -2, week 4 and 8 post-transduced CTL infusion.</description>
