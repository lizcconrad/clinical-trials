  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional dietary, lifestyle, behavioral and pharmacologic treatment strategies have proven
      relatively ineffective for treating obesity, and once metabolic abnormalities such as Type 2
      Diabetes (T2D) develop, definitive strategies to prevent major cardiovascular events remain
      elusive. More positively, the identification of a scientific resolution for obesity and T2D
      in the short-term is not outside the bounds of reality. Because the complexity of metabolic
      regulation is likely to include already characterized biomarkers, as well as other
      unidentified factors, it is logical to sample subjects of various ages, gender, ethnicity,
      body mass distribution, dietary habits, exercise habits, medication requirements, and disease
      states to discover associations and pathways related to the restoration of normal metabolism.

      As an observational study design, study investigators will prospectively identify potential
      subjects from various primary care and/or specialty care clinics in Western New York. Prior
      to the commencement of any study procedures, subjects will document informed consent and
      acknowledgement of HIPPA rights. Following approval from their practitioner, subjects may be
      asked on multiple occasions to complete or undergo any or all of the following types of study
      procedures:

        -  Medical record review and follow-up

        -  Fasting blood sample (volume limitations stipulated within)

        -  Pre-meal, during meal, and post-meal blood sample (volume limits within)

        -  Short-term and/or long-term dietary intervention (MD approved)

        -  Short-term and/or long-term exercise intervention (MD approved)

        -  Blood glucose log

        -  Food and exercise diaries

        -  Pre- and post-medication blood sampling (neutraceutical or Rx products)

        -  24-hour urine sampling

        -  Spot urine sampling

        -  Stool microbiologic sampling

        -  Intestinal microbiologic sampling (gastric bypass subjects only)
