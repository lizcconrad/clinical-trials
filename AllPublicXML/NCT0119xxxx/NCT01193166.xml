  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the use of paliperidone palmitate compared with oral antipsychotic
      treatment in delaying time to a protocol-defined treatment failure over 12 months, in
      patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who were recently released from an inpatient
      psychiatric hospital.

      The primary objective of this study will be to compare paliperidone palmitate treatment with
      the randomly assigned oral antipsychotic treatment in delaying time to treatment failure over
      12 months in subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia who were recently discharged from an
      inpatient psychiatric hospital. Patients will receive either paliperidone palmitate 78, 117,
      156, or 234 mg monthly by injection for twelve months OR oral aripiprazole, haloperidol,
      olanzapine, paliperidone, perphenazine, quetiapine, and risperidone at doses selected by the
      study doctor.
