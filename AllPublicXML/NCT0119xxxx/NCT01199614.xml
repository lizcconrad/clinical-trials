      This is an open-label study of PTH(1-84) treatment that seeks:

        1. To determine the actions of PTH(1-84) to provide long term control of serum calcium and
           urinary calcium excretion with use of standard amounts of calcium and vitamin D
           supplementation.

        2. To determine the extent to which PTH(1-84) improves quality-of-life on long-term basis.

        3. To establish the safety of PTH(1-84) when administered for up to 12 years.

        4. To attempt to quantify improvements in the typical signs/symptoms of hypoparathyroidism
           post PTH administration.

      There will be one visit conducted every six months in the study offices of the principal
      investigator, Dr. John Bilezikian. In addition to these visits, there will be, for new
      patients who have not used PTH (1-84) before, a Screening Visit four weeks prior to the
      baseline visit for the purpose of performing screening labs as well as a Pre-Baseline Local
      Quest Lab performed to ensure stability prior to Baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder in which parathyroid hormone (PTH) is markedly
      decreased or absent from the circulation. It is the only remaining hormone deficiency state
      for which replacement with the missing hormone has been heretofore unavailable. The
      hypoparathyroid state is due either to autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid glands or to
      loss of parathyroid function after neck surgery. Without PTH, calcium homeostasis is markedly
      abnormal, the most salient clinical feature of which is a reduced serum calcium
      concentration. The hypocalcemia is associated with other important abnormalities such as
      markedly reduced parameters of bone turnover. PTH(1-84) is the ideal therapeutic approach to
      hypoparathyroidism. The current mainstay of therapy, calcium and vitamin D, has important
      clinical limitations. Large doses of calcium and vitamin D are required and often associated
      with hypercalciuria and vitamin D toxicity. Moreover, this approach does not correct the
      skeletal deficiencies resident in the bones themselves due to lack of PTH. In contrast,
      PTH(1-84) replaces precisely what is missing in this disorder. The research question is: What
      are the long-term safety and efficacy parameters of PTH(1-84) therapy in hypoparathyroidism?

      Preliminary data suggest that treatment with PTH(1-84) for up to 4 years improves control of
      the serum and urine calcium concentration safely. Since hypoparathyroidism is a chronic
      disorder, it is important to know whether these salutary effects continue to be seen beyond 4
      years. There is a need to determine the safety and efficacy treatment of PTH(1-84) in
      hypoparathyroidism beyond 4 years.
