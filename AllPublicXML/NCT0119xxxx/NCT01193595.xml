      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the maximum administered dose (MAD) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      ombrabulin in combination with best tolerated dose of bevacizumab based on the incidence of
      related Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the overall safety profile of the combination

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of both ombrabulin and bevacizumab when
           given in combination

        -  To evaluate preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic effect using (Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Ultra-Sound)
           DCE-US, measuring biomarkers

      The duration of the study for each patient will include an up to 28-day screening phase,
      21-day study treatment cycles, an end of treatment visit with a follow-up period. Each
      patient will participate in only one dose group and will receive AVE8062 with bevacizumab
      every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities, withdrawal of consent or
      Investigator's decision.

    <description>The combination of ombrabulin and bevacizumab will be administered every 3 weeks according to the following schedule: One day 1, ombrabulin will be administered as a 30 minutes intravenous (i.v) infusion. Bevacizumab will be administered as a 30-90 minutes i.v. infusion 24 hours after the end of ombrabulin infusion on day 2.</description>
