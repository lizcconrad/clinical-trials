      The primary objective is to assess the effect of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) on the
      relative bioavailability (AUC0-∞) of fluticasone propionate (FLU) when administered as fixed
      AZE-FLU combination product (TEST) compared to a similar formulation without containing AZE
      (i.e. FLU alone in the MP29-02 vehicle; REF).

      The secondary objectives are to compare the relative bioavailability (AUC0-∞) of FLU when
      administered either as fixed AZE-FLU combination product (TEST) or as marketed FLU product,
      Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, Roxane Laboratories (COMP); To compare the effects of AZE
      on other pharmacokinetic parameters of FLU (AUC0 tlast, CL/f, Cmax, tmax, t½); To assess
      adverse events.

      This study will enrol healthy subjects. It is considered that study results are more
      discriminative in healthy subjects than in rhinitis patients as there are no interferences by
      varying rhinitis symptoms and respective differences in the status of the nasal mucosa
      regarding the 3 study periods.

      The time schedule for serum sampling (pre-dose and 8, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 1¼, 1½, 2, 2½, 3, 4,
      6, 8, 12, and 24 h p.a., time refer to the end of the second spray into the second nostril of
      each administration) is derived from previous bioavailability studies assuming a mean tmax of
      1 h p.a. [P5] and a mean t1/2 of 3 h [L9]. Sampling times are expected to cover an AUC0-tlast
      above 80% of the total AUC of fluticasone propionate (bioanalytical detection method with a
      LLOQ of 0.5 pg/mL).

             products).

         23. Subject is vegetarian or reports other strict dietary habits which would preclude the
