      Has stronger effect on immune system, effective good against HBV replication. This is a
      substantial new insight into the pathogenesis of disease, with a clear path toward clinical

      Recent studies have proved Phyllanthus Urinaria - Adenosmatis Glutinosum - Eclipta Prostrata
      - Ascorbic Acid combination plus Tenofovir in treatment of acute and chronic hepatitis B.
      Method the combination of drugs derived from natural and artificial medicaments. To made a
      clean jobs for HBV - DNA in the patient's body - hope this is a new step of medicine, will no
      longer exist phrase &quot;chronic HBV infection &quot; Methods of safety, therapeutic effect on
      expected cost savings should easily apply to everyone everywhere in the world. According to
      the investigation and must be called , Chronic HBV infection is an important worldwide cause
      of morbidity, mortality and source of potential new infections. There are an estimated 350
      million carriers of HBV in the world. In China, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, as
      many as 10-15% of the population are chronically infected. In North America and Northern
      Europe, infection and carrier rates are much lower, usually below 1%. Intermediate carrier
      rates of 1-5% are found in Southern Europe (e.g., Italy, Greece and Spain), parts of South
      and Central America, the Middle East and Japan. Persistent infection develops in over 90% of
      perinatally infected children and in 3-10% of people who become infected after the age of 6
      years. Worldwide, it has been estimated that more than one million people die annually due to
      HBV-related end stage diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The goal of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B is to reduce a patient's risks for progressive
      liver disease through prolonged suppression and eradication of HBV infection and to arrest or
      ameliorate HBV-related liver damage.
