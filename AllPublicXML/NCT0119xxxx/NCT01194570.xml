  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in participants with primary progressive multiple
      sclerosis. Eligible participants will be randomized 2 : 1 to receive either ocrelizumab or
      placebo. The blinded treatment period will be at least 120 weeks, followed by an Open Label
      Extension (OLE) treatment for participants in both groups who in the opinion of the
      investigator could benefit from further or newly initiated ocrelizumab treatment. Unless
      terminated early, all participants will continue their treatment with open-label ocrelizumab
      until the last participant who entered the OLE phase reaches 4 years of open-label
      ocrelizumab treatment.

    <description>The time to onset of CDP was defined as time from baseline to first disability progression, which is confirmed at next regularly scheduled visit &gt;=12 weeks (&gt;=84 days) after initial disability progression. Baseline for time to onset of CDP is the date of randomization, independent of the first day of dosing. Disability progression is defined as an increase of &gt;= 1.0 point from baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, if baseline EDSS value is &lt;=5.5 points (inclusive), or an increase of &gt;=0.5 points, if baseline EDSS is &gt;5.5 points. The total EDSS score ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis). The randomized participants who did not receive any treatment were censored at days 0 in each Arm.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 120</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 is a 36-item, self- reported, generic measure of quality of life that has been widely used in multiple disease areas. It is composed of 8 health domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. The PCS score was derived based on the SF-36 V2 User's Manual. Scoring for PCS involves (a) recoding item response values, (b) summing recoded response values for all items in a given scale to obtain the scale raw score, (c) transforming scale raw score to a 0−100 score. The PCS score was computed by (a) multiplying each health domain z score by a scale-specific physical factor score coefficient, (b) summing the resulting products, (c) converting the product total to T score. The total score ranges from 0-100, higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

        <description>The time to onset of CDP was defined as time from baseline to first disability progression, which is confirmed at next regularly scheduled visit &gt;=12 weeks (&gt;=84 days) after initial disability progression.

Disability progression is defined as an increase of &gt;= 1.0 point from baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, if baseline EDSS value is &lt;=5.5 points (inclusive), or an increase of &gt;=0.5 points, if baseline EDSS is &gt;5.5 points.

        <title>Change in From Baseline Physical Component Summary Score (PCS) SF- 36 Health Survey (SF-36) at Week 120</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 is a 36-item, self- reported, generic measure of quality of life that has been widely used in multiple disease areas. It is composed of 8 health domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. The PCS score was derived based on the SF-36 V2 User's Manual. Scoring for PCS involves (a) recoding item response values, (b) summing recoded response values for all items in a given scale to obtain the scale raw score, (c) transforming scale raw score to a 0−100 score. The PCS score was computed by (a) multiplying each health domain z score by a scale-specific physical factor score coefficient, (b) summing the resulting products, (c) converting the product total to T score. The total score ranges from 0-100, higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
