      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of KW-0761 intravenously administered
      eight times at one-week intervals in patients with CCR4-positive peripheral T/NK-cell
      lymphoma. The primary objective is to assess the antitumor effect in terms of best overall
      response, while the secondary objectives are to assess the antitumor effect in terms of best
      response by disease lesion, to assess the progression-free survival and to assess the overall
      survival. The safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of KW-0761 will be also evaluated.
