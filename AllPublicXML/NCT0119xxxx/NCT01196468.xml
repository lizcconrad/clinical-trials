  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Europe many patients infected with HIV remain undiagnosed, although this percentage varies
      between 15-80% across the continent. In the UK it is estimated to be 27%. Undiagnosed HIV
      results in increased morbidity and mortality and reduced treatment response, as appropriate
      health interventions are delayed. It also has adverse public health implications, with those
      individuals unaware of their HIV status being more likely to transmit the virus.

      An important public health issue is how to diagnose more individuals with HIV earlier in the
      course of their infection. In the US, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
      introduced testing guidelines whereby all individuals are tested, unless they object, at any
      point of contact with the healthcare system - the &quot;opt-out&quot; testing guidelines.

      At the &quot;HIV in Europe&quot; Conference held in November 2007, the consensus, which included
      patient and public involvement, was that such an approach would not be suitable for Europe.
      The Conference recommended further development of focused HIV testing in patients presenting
      with certain clinical conditions and diseases - the &quot;indicator disease'' testing guidelines.

      Cost effectiveness analyses suggests cost savings if a screened population has an HIV
      prevalence of at least 1%, although this rate may be as low as 0.1%. However, there is very
      little - if any - evidence regarding HIV prevalence for certain conditions and diseases in
      specific and easy to identify sections of society. The focus of attention is on those
      conditions and diseases which occur more frequently in individuals known to be infected with
      HIV.

      The aim of this study is to assess HIV prevalence for several diseases and conditions, within
      a specific segment of the population not yet diagnosed with HIV, who present for care with
      that specific disease or condition. These conditions have been selected as they occur
      frequently in individuals already diagnosed with HIV infection. This is a pilot study to
      inform phase two, which will involve more diseases and conditions with a wider participation
      of centres across Europe.
