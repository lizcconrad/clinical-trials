      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling
      pathway inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) and erlotinib hydrochloride when given together in
      treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that is stage IV or has come back.
      RO4929097 and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of RO4929097 combined with
      erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). (Dose escalation portion) II. To assess whether the probability of detectable tumor
      shrinkage or response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria
      correlates with pre-therapy immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse phase protein array (RPPA)
      expression of Notch 1, 2, 3, and 4. (Dose escalation portion) III. A preliminary, exploratory
      assessment will be performed with respect to percent tumor shrinkage and the probability of
      response over the first 2 cycles of therapy. (Expansion cohort) IV. A preliminary,
      exploratory assessment will be performed with respect to change in tumor immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) scores and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) expression for Notch 1, 2, 3, and 4 over
      the first 2 cycles of erlotinib. (Expansion cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform a preliminary exploratory assessment of whether probability of detectable tumor
      shrinkage/response correlates with pre RO4929097 presence in tumor of an activating epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, the T790M EGFR mutation, met proto-oncogene (c-MET)
      gene amplification or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression or activation
      or various Notch pathway markers. (Dose escalation portion) II. To perform a preliminary
      exploratory assessment of whether addition of RO4929097 to erlotinib leads to tumor
      shrinkage/response in any tumor deposits that had previously exhibited growth on erlotinib
      alone. (Dose escalation portion) III. Conduct a preliminary exploratory assessment on the
      expansion cohort with respect to tumor shrinkage/response of the following over the first 2
      cycles of erlotinib and RO4929097 treatment with and without the presence of mutation,
      amplification, and activation of markers: tumor IHC scores and RPPA expression of the Notch
      ligand jagged 1 (Jag1), and the Notch targets hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1),
      hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 1 (HEY1); tumor IHC scores and RPPA
      expression of putative stem cell markers cluster of differentiation (CD)24 (decreased in stem
      cells), CD44, CD133, dehydrogenase and of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
      markers E-cadherin and vimentin; detectability in tumor of EGFR T790M mutations, MET
      amplification, and IGF-1R expression and activation; and soluble markers of angiogenesis,
      including stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1alpha), basic fibroblastic growth factor
      (bFGF), cryptic epitope of collagen IV, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF). (Expansion cohort) IV. Conduct a preliminary exploratory assessment of whether
      percent tumor shrinkage/response or time to progression correlates with pre-therapy IHC and
      RPPA expression of Notch 1, 2, 3 and 4, the above Notch pathway and stem cell markers, with
      baseline detectability of T790M mutations and MET amplification, and with baseline IGF-1R
      expression and activation, and with change in these markers from the initial biopsy to the
      subsequent biopsy. (Expansion cohort) V. In tumor samples collected both during the dose
      escalation phase and in the expansion cohort, assess if IHC and RPPA expression of Notch,
      Notch ligand and Notch targets correlates with expression of stem cell markers.

      VI. Assess if percent tumor shrinkage/response, time to progression and baseline and change
      in IHC and RPPA expression of Notch, Notch ligand, Notch targets and stem cell markers varies
      with: tumor Notch gene amplification as assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH);
      tumor IHC and RPPA expression of selected members of the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways (since
      these could lead to stem cell properties in cells that do not express Notch); host
      (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) polymorphisms for relevant genes in the Notch pathway;
      tumor micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels.

      VII. Trough levels of erlotinib and RO4929097 will be measured in plasma samples of all
      patients on the dose-escalation portion of the study approximately 24 hours after the cycle
      1, day 1 dose and again approximately 24 hours after the cycle 2, day 1 dose. These
      measurements are being done to permit a preliminary exploratory assessment of whether there
      is induction of metabolism of one or both drugs that will lead to decreased drug plasma
      concentrations.

      VIII. In the Expansion Cohort, plasma levels of erlotinib and RO4929097 will be measured
      approximately 24 hours after the cycle 2, day 21 erlotinib dose (just prior to initiation of
      cycle 3), and plasma levels of both agents will be measured in plasma approximately 24 hours
      after the cycle 3, day 1 doses of both agents. These measurements are done to permit a
      preliminary exploratory assessment of whether: plasma drug levels correlate with % tumor
      shrinkage/response or with change in tumor biomarkers over the first 6 weeks of therapy;
      erlotinib plasma concentrations are affected by RO4929097 administration.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and
      gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on days 1-3, 8-10, and
      15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.

          -  Patients who are known to be serologically positive for hepatitis A, B or C are
             ineligible

          -  Patients with &gt; grade 1 (by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]
             criteria) hyponatremia or hypocalcemia (based on measurement of ionized calcium)
             despite appropriate medical management are excluded from this study, as are patients
             with hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate below the lower limit of normal for the
             institution), hypomagnesemia, (serum magnesium below the lower limit of normal),
             hypokalemia, or hyperkalemia (serum potassium outside normal limits) despite
             appropriate medical management

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection requiring systemic therapy (with antibiotics, antiviral or antifungal
             agents), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, angina at
             rest, a history of torsades de pointes, potentially life-threatening cardiac
             arrhythmias (patients are permitted to have chronic, stable atrial fibrillation,
             premature atrial or ventricular contractions, sinus tachycardia, provided the rate is
             controlled at &lt; 115 per minute, and sinus bradycardia, provided the rate is &gt; 50 per
             minute), myocardial infarction within the previous 3 months, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible

          -  Cardiovascular: baseline corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 450
             msec (male) or QTcF &gt; 470 msec (female)

          -  Patients requiring drugs that are known to cause Torsades de pointes and/or prolonged
             corrected QT (QTc) intervals are excluded; patients requiring drugs with a possible
             but unproven association with Torsades de pointes and/or QTc prolongation may be
             eligible, but will require additional electrocardiogram assessments, as outlined

          -  Patients who have not recovered to &lt; CTCAE grade 2 toxicities related to prior therapy
             are not eligible to participate in this study
