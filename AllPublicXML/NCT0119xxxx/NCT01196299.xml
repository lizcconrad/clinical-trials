  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to study the prognostic ability of various MRI imaging markers in the
      evaluation of TBI patients. Cognitive, social, and occupational recovery will be measured at
      each time point, and compared to MRI findings. Healthy volunteers will serve as a comparison
      to the TBI patients.

      It is hypothesized that novel MRI markers of metabolism, hemodynamics, functional
      connectivity, and tissue microstructure will be related to the clinical status of the
      patient, as well as their social and occupational outcomes.

      The goal of this study is to identify advanced magnetic resonance imaging markers that can
      serve as a prognostic marker in the evaluation and management of traumatic brain injury
      patients.

      Magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing (when possible) will be performed in the
      acute (within 10 days following injury), and recovery stages (about 1 month, about 6
      months,and about 18 months). The relationship between the advanced magnetic resonance imaging
      markers and the clinical condition of the patient will be evaluated at each time point to
      determine which combination of imaging markers best describe the current clinical status of
      the patient and which markers best predict a patient's outcome status.
