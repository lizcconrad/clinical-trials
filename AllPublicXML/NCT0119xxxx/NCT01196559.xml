             peritoneal carcinoma

          -  Patients had to have received a front-line, platinum/taxane based chemotherapy regimen

          -  Patients who progressed or whose best response to their most recent platinum-based
             therapy was less than a partial response will be classified as having
             platinum-refractory/resistant ovarian cancer or progressed within six months of
             completing the most recent platinum-based chemotherapy

          -  Participants must have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for management of
             primary disease but must not have received more than 3 prior systemic cytotoxic
             regimens.

          -  Patients had to have at least one bidimensionally measurable and/or evaluable
             (unidimensionally measurable) target lesion in a non-irradiated area and increased Ca
             125

          -  A &gt;= 4 weeks interval between their last chemotherapy regimen and the start of study
             treatment

          -  Age 20-75 years old

          -  Adequate liver (bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal and SGOT/SGPT &lt; 2 times
             upper limit of normal) and renal function (creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  prior therapy with vinorelbine or gemcitabine

          -  treatment with &gt; 2 cytotoxic regimens (including primary platinum and taxane
             chemotherapy)

          -  Serious comorbidities (as determined by the investigator) such as, but not limited to,
             active congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or active infection.
