  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the highest dose of KW-2450 in combination with lapatinib and
      letrozole that can be administered safely to subjects with advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer and to evaluate its effectiveness.

      This study was terminated in Phase 1 and never proceeded to the Phase 2 portion of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, sequential, ascending, multi-dose, Phase 1/2 study will enroll up to 198
      post-menopausal subjects with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress
      HER2. Subjects at each dose level will receive KW-2450 orally, on a continuous daily schedule
      in combination with lapatinib and letrozole.

      In the Phase 1 portion of the study, dose escalation may proceed once ≥ 3 subjects have
      completed Day 30. The safety of each dose level will be established prior to enrollment of
      subjects in the next dose level. Dose escalation will proceed sequentially. Up to 6 subjects
      may be enrolled at each dose level. Enrollment will proceed until the MTD has been
      established or the highest dose level has been reached.

      The Phase 2 portion of the trial will enroll 168 additional subjects. The dose level will be
      based on overall safety and tolerability assessments from the Phase 1 portion of the study.
      The subjects will be randomized into two treatment arms (1) Arm A, KW-2450 plus lapatinib
      plus letrozole: (2) Arm B, lapatinib plus letrozole.

      This study was terminated in Phase 1 and never proceeded to the Phase 2 portion of the study.

    <description>Three subjects will be assigned to each of 4 sequential cohorts. Dose escalation may proceed once at least 3 subjects have completed 30 days of study treatment. Subjects who withdraw prior to completing Day 30 for reasons other than DLT will be replaced. If a DLT is observed, additional subjects may be enrolled so that up to 6 subjects are enrolled at that dose level.</description>
