    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:flight simulator have become an important component in pilot training. However,
      they are known to be associated with motion sickness like symptoms defined as Simulator
      Sickness (SS). Prevention countermeasures against motion sickness have been studied
      extensively focusing on cholinergic blockers and antihistamines. Most comparataive studies
      emphasized the effectiveness of scopolamine over outher agents. Evidence, though, on
      prophylaxis against SS is sparse.

      OBJECTIVE: to assess the effectiveness of oral scopolamine versus oral cinnarizine or placebo
      for SS prevention in helicopter pilots.

      DESIGN: a prospective, placebo controlled double-blind.

      SETTING: Israel Air Forse (IAF) Helicopter Aircaft vWeapon System Trainer.

      PARTICIPANTS: IAF experienced helicopter pilots.

      INTERVENTION: 0.6 mg oral scopolamine or 50 mg oral cinnarizine or placebo 1 hour before
      beginning of a 3 sortie simulator training

    <description>To record a significant difference in motion sickness symptoms reduction during and after simulator training, after taking cinnarizine, scopolamine or placebo. We predict that scopolamine will prove to be more effective than cinnarizine with fewer side effects that can compromise pilot's performance during training.</description>
