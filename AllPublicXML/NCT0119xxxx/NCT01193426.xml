    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), an infection of ascitic fluid in the absence of
      localized intra-abdominal infection, is one of the main potentially fatal complications of
      cirrhosis. In the case of SBP, early diagnosis and rapid therapeutic care can improve patient
      survival (Garcia-Tsao, 2001).

      The diagnosis of SBP is based on the detection of a polymorphonuclear neutrophils count equal
      to or greater than 250 /mm3 in the ascitic fluid (method of reference). However, obtaining an
      ascitic cell count is sometimes difficult because it can not always be performed in emergency
      especially outside the opening hours of the laboratory of Bacteriology. This raises the
      necessity of developing quick and easy alternative approaches of diagnosis.

      Few groups have proposed the use of urinary reagent strip for rapid diagnosis of SBP.
      Nevertheless, the investigators clinical teams have shown that the sensitivity of this test
      was low in a large national multicenter prospective study involving more than a thousand
      patients (Nousbaum et al., 2007). The use of Multistix strips test is thus not recommended
      for the routine application of diagnosis of SBP due to its lack of sensitivity.

      Although performed on small groups of patients, several studies have reported that IL-8 or
      IL-6 might be used as markers of ascitic fluid infections. Based on these data and confirmed
      by the investigators preliminary results the investigators propose to study on a broad
      recruitment of patients estimated to about 500 inclusions (about 45 infected patients) the
      interest of using IL-8 and IL-6 as predictive markers of SBP. The investigators propose to
      use an ELISA method, standardized, rapid and automated, applicable in the context of
      emergency (7 days a week and 24 hours a day) as previously described in the work conducted to
      exclude the urinary tract infection (Oregioni et al., 2005).

      During the preliminary experiments conducted for this project, the investigators also found
      systematic variation of another marker, leptin. This is a protein hormone involved in the
      inflammatory and immune responses (Otero et al., 2005). It appears necessary to include the
      study of this marker in the analysis of differential protein response between patients
      suffering or not suffering from SBP.

      The investigators therefore propose a diagnostic study, non-interventional, prospective,
      multicenter trial conducted over 2 years.

        -  The main objective is to establish the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity,
           positive predictive value and negative) of IL-8 and IL-6, assayed in the ascites fluid
           by an automated ELISA in the early diagnosis of SBP.

        -  The secondary objectives are to confirm the interest of the measurement of leptin in the
           SBP and to establish the diagnostic performance of IL-8 and IL-6 or leptin according to
           different clinical features in patients (score Child-Pugh classification and history of
           SBP, ascitic fluid infection with positive bacterial culture).
