  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A trial in which patients having open abdominal surgery are randomized to receive either
      crystalloids or colloids intraoperatively, guided by esophageal Doppler. The investigators
      test the primary hypothesis that goal-directed colloid administration during elective
      abdominal surgery decreases a composite of postoperative complications within 30 days of
      surgery.

      Patients will be given 5-7 ml/kg of crystalloid (lactated Ringer's) in the immediate
      preoperative period, which will be followed by 4 ml/kg/h crystalloid for maintenance
      normalized to ideal body weight [Men: Ideal Body Weight (in kilograms) = 52 kg + 1.9 kg for
      every 2.5 cm over 150 cm; Women: Ideal Body Weight (in kilograms) = 49 kg + 1.7 kg for every
      2.5 cm over 150 cm].

      They will then be randomly assigned to additional volume replacement, guided by esophageal
      Doppler, to either lactated Ringer's solution of Voluven starch.
