  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Despite their good
      appetite, many females with RTT meet the criteria for moderate to severe malnutrition. The
      pathological mechanism is barely understood. Although feeding difficulties may play a role in
      this, other constitutional factors as altered metabolic processes are suspected. Preliminary
      research showed elevated plasma creatine concentrations and increased urinary
      creatine/creatinine ratios in half of the RTT girls.

      The aim of this study is to confirm previous findings and examine the functionality of the
      creatine transporter in RTT girls.

      The investigators assume that previous findings will be confirmed, and are due to an altered
      functionality of the creatine transporter.

    <description>Blood as well as urine samples will be collected to confirm previous findings concerning plasma and urine creatine concentrations. Furthermore, blood samples will be used to perform mutation analysis of the SCL6A8 gene. Secondary, a skin biopsy will be collected for functional studies regarding the creatine transporter in RTT girls. By comparing intracellular and extracellular creatine concentrations, one can assess the functionality of the creatine transporter.</description>
