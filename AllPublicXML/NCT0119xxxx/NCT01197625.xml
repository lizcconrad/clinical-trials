  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will include patients with high risk of PSA relapse scheduled
      to receive curative surgical treatment. This include patients with high Gleason score (9-10)
      or micrometastatic disease (tumor cells detected in specimens obtained from bone marrow).
      They are scheduled for regular follow-ups with PSA measurements. We have previously published
      that some patients with metastatic prostate cancer may respond to DC-vaccination with tumor
      mRNA, with a decrease in PSA. PSA response is related to immunological response. Patients
      receiving DC-vaccination may have a reduced risk of PSA relapse or increased time to PSA
      relapse. Previous experience with different DC-vaccine protocols in our hospital has resulted
      in only minor side-effects (grade 1-2 fever, rubor, fatigue, local swelling or pain).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Radical prostatectomy. Preferably accessible tumor tissue with enough volume and
             quality for vaccine production (extraction of tumor mRNA).

          -  Pathological stage pT2 - pT3b and Gleason score 7B-10, pN0, pN+ or pNx.

          -  Must be ambulatory with an ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Tumor cells detected in bone-marrow samples (micrometastatic disease). Patients with
             Gleason score 9-10 or pT3b Gleason score 8 may also be included with negative
             bone-marrow aspiration. Bone-marrow aspirates and plasma for microRNA will be obtained
             before start of surgery.

          -  Must be at least 18 years of age and less than 75 years.

          -  PSA &lt; 0.2 µg/L within 6 weeks after surgery.

          -  Must have lab values as the following:

        ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L; Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L; Hb ≥ 9 g/dL (≥ 5.6 mmol/L); Creatinine ≤ 140
        μmol/L (1.6 mg/dL)- if borderline, the creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min; Bilirubin within
        the upper limit of normal; ASAT and ALAT ≤ 2.5 the upper limit of normal; Albumin levels
        above lower normal value

          -  No metastasis on bone scans or MRI, last 3 months before inclusion.

          -  Signed informed consent and expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and
             follow up must be obtained and documented according to ICH/GCP, and national/local
             regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with LHRH (Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone) agonist.

          -  Previous anti-androgen treatment (Casodex).

          -  History of prior malignancy within the last 5 years, with the exception of curatively
             treated basal cell carcinoma.

          -  Active infection requiring antibiotic therapy.

          -  Significant cardiac or other medical illness that would limit activity or survival,
             such as severe congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or serious cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          -  Adverse reactions to vaccines such as asthma, anaphylaxis or other serious reactions.

          -  History of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, juvenile
             onset insulin dependent diabetes, or a vasculitic syndrome.

          -  Positive testing for syphilis (treponema pallidum), HIV, Hepatitis B and C

          -  Use of systemic glucocorticoids.

          -  Any reason why, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient should not
             participate.
