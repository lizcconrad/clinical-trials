  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high rate of partial response to standard thymoleptic medication. In this study
      the investigators want to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donepezil as adjunctive
      treatment to mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder with acute mania. The investigators
      hypotheses were that there would be greater mean reduction in manic symptoms with donepezil
      augmentation of lithium compared with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness that affects 1-2% of the general population.
      Lithium and valproate are effective for treatment of acute mania for many patients. However
      up to half of patients do not respond adequately to currently approved treatments in the
      acute phase of mania. More effective treatment for mania are need. Imbalance in cholinergic
      and adrenergic tone has long been postulated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. In
      the pathophysiology of mania,relative cholinergic hypoactivity was being implicated.
      Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It is approved for
      the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In an open case series with standardized ratings,
      addition of donepezil 5-10 mg/day to ongoing mood-stabilizer treatment was associated with
      marked improvement in treatment-resistant mania. We want to conduct a 4-week randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil as augmentation of lithium in patients
      with acute manic episode to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donepezil as adjunctive
      treatment to mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder with acute mania.
