      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of multiple oral doses of canagliflozin on a
      single oral dose of warfarin.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned)
      single-center study of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) and warfarin in healthy adult volunteers.
      Canagliflozin is a drug currently under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus and warfarin is an approved anticoagulant (ie, a drug that
      stops blood from clotting). After an overnight fast (without eating food) of at least 10
      hours, volunteers will receive Sequence 1 (canagliflozin 300 mg, orally, once daily on Days
      1-12 with a single, oral 30 mg dose of warfarin on Day 6 [Treatment A] followed 14 days later
      by a single, oral 30 mg dose of warfarin on Day 1 [Treatment B]) OR Sequence 2 (Treatment B
      followed 14 days later by Treatment A).
