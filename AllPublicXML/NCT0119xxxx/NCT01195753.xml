      Treatment with liver cell infusion for children with urea cycle disorders (UCD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urea cycle disorders are rare inherited diseases that generally have a poor outcome,
      especially with onset of the disease in the neonatal period. UCDs are caused by a deficiency
      of one of six enzymes responsible for removing ammonia from the bloodstream. Instead of being
      converted into urea which is removed from the body with the urine, ammonia accumulates in UCD
      patients leading to brain damage or death. In the light of a mortality rate of &gt; 50% at the
      age of 10 years the current pharmacological and dietary therapy is of modest success.
      Furthermore, mental retardation, cerebral palsy and other neurological sequelae are common
      among surviving patients.

      In the last years, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become the best therapeutic
      option for UCD with long-term survival rates of about 90%. However, in the first weeks of
      life OLT still is technically demanding and prone to complications. With larger size of the
      recipient, the technical problems with OLT decrease considerably. The increased body weight
      usually achieved at the age of more than 8 weeks is related to a major reduction in
      transplantation related morbidity. Stabilization of metabolism until the patient can undergo
      OLT is essential.

      In this study, young children with UCD will be treated by repetitive application of human
      liver cells. In the last consequence, the aim of this new therapy option is to supply a
      sufficient amount of healthy liver cells to compensate for the metabolic defect and to reduce
      the risk of neurological deterioration while awaiting OLT.
