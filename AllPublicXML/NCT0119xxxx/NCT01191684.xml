      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective
      immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients with colorectal, stomach, or pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:I. To establish whether 2 vaccine dose levels of modified vaccinia virus
      ankara vaccine expressing p53 (MVAp53) vaccines are safe and well tolerated in patients with
      p53 over-expressing solid tumor malignancy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. To provide preliminary evidence of enhanced cellular and humoral
      immunity to p53.

      OUTLINE:This is a phase I, dose-escalation trial of modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine
      expressing p53 (MVAp53).Patients receive MVAp53 subcutaneously (SC) on days 0, 21, and 42 in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years.

    <description>Assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for humoral response, lymphoproliferation for cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ T cell response, and intracytoplasmic cytokine assays, and interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-4 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) for the assessment of cellular immune response. For each assay, the pre-vaccine values will be compared to the highest post-vaccine values. Immunogenicity changes and the maximum change will be quantified by mean, standard deviation, median, and range and tested by paired t-test at the 0.05 significance level.</description>
