      The purpose of this study is the identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      investigational medicinal product. Moreover the safety and tolerability will be assessed and
      an exploratory analysis of efficacy and biomarker modulation will be performed.

    <time_frame>The incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), which define the MTD are assessed continously until achievement of MTD.</time_frame>
    <description>The definition of MTD is based on a 3+3 dose escalation design. MTD is defined as the next lower dose of that dose which was considered to be untolerated (observed DLT frequency at least 2 out of 3 in one cohort or at least 2 out of six patients in 2 cohorts).</description>
