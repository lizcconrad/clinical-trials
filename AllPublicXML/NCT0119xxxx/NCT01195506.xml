  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C is recognized as a tumor lymphangiogenic factor
      based on the effects of activated VEGFR3 on lymphatic endothelial cells. VEGFR3 has been
      proposed as a specific marker for lymphatic endothelial cells. Recent studies indicated that
      VEGFR3 also expressed in a variety of human malignancies, including lung, colon rectal, or
      head and neck cancer. Moreover, VEGF-C/VEGFR3 axis was demonstrated in regulating
      angiogenesis, cell invasion, and metastasis in several solid tumors. The promotion of cell
      mobility in response to VEGF-C was required the involvement of adhesion molecule contactin-1.
      In addition to solid tumors, it has been reported that the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 axis is activated in
      subsets of leukemia patients. Until now, it has been demonstrated that higher endogenous
      VEGFC levels of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells are related to decreased in vitro and
      in vivo responsiveness to chemotherapy; an effect that may result from inhibition of
      apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2/Bax ratios by the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway. Thus, a functional
      VEGF-C/VEGFR3 system may exist in leukemia. However, the detail information concerning the
      role of VEGF-C/VEGFR3 in non-solid tumors is still lacking. Bone marrow neoangiogenesis plays
      a crucial pathogenic and possible prognostic role in AML. The VEGF-C/VEGFR3 axis has been
      proven in the regulation of solid tumors angiogenesis. In the investigators preliminary
      study, the investigators found VEGF-C may play a critical role in angiogenesis regulation of
      leukemic cells by upregulating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, the investigators found
      that the upregulation of COX-2 also correlate with the VEGF-C-induced proliferation in
      leukemic cells and this phenomenon might further regulate the chemoresistance of VEGF-C. In
      this study, the investigators will investigate the extent of angiogenesis and chemoresistance
      induced by VEGF-C in leukemic cells. This study will provide evidences on the subject of the
      novel role of VEGF-C in leukemia. With progress in molecular biology of VEGF-C, its value as
      a therapeutic target is highly promising.
