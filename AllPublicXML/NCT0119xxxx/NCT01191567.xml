  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wounds have long been a source of suffering for unfortunate victims and in recent years new
      complementary methods have been developed in areas where traditional wound treatment has been
      insufficient. Treating wounds with negative pressure, Vacuum assisted closure® [VAC], is a
      relatively new method of treatment and knowledge about its effect on patients is limited.

      Earlier studies haven't been able to answer the question about which groups of patients that
      are in most favour of the treatment and what impact the treatment has on the patient's
      quality of life.

      It is important with further research since an effective and mild wound treatment can
      decrease suffering and increase quality of life for the patient. Wound treatment that does
      not lead to an achieved treatment goal can lead to a risk for the patient and should be
      avoided.

      The project consists of 4 part studies: Study 1 and 2 are chart review studies of a
      consecutive series of patients treated with VAC at Södersjukhuset during a 3 year period. The
      patients are described on the basis of medical, surgical and demographical factors. Outcome
      is treatment results and risk factors for a treatment failure.

      Study 3 and 4 are clinical randomised studies with the aim of studying whether treatment with
      VAC provides a faster and more effective healing of acute and postoperative wounds, and in
      what way the treatment affect the quality of life and pain of the patients, compared to
      conventional treatment.
