  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will assess the effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics
      of a single oral dose of aleglitazar in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment
      (Child-Pugh class A or B) and in matched control subjects with normal hepatic function.
      Subjects will receive a single oral dose of aleglitazar, with assessment of the
      pharmacokinetics of aleglitazar on Days 1-5. Anticipated duration of study for each enrolled
      subject is approximately 6 weeks.

It was calculated as CL/F/kel, where CL/F was calculated as dose/AUCinf, where AUCinf represents the area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma over the time interval from zero extrapolated to infinity and kel as constant elimination rate of aleglitazar.</description>
          <population>The PK analysis population consisted of all participants who received the study drug and adhered to the protocol. Only participants with data available for specific metabolite were analyzed. Only participants with data available for specific study drug/metabolite were analyzed.</population>

ECGs parameters included heart rate (HR), RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTcB, and QTcF intervals. The normal ranges of ECG parameter values were: HR as 40-100 beats per minute, RR as 600-1500 milliseconds (msec), PR as 120-200 msec, QRS as 80-120 msec, QT as 200-500 msec, QTcB as 350-450 msec, and QTcF as 350-450 msec. Data was reported as the number of participants who had low level values (values less than the normal range) and high level values (values more than the normal range).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Low and High Vital Signs Values</title>
        <description>Vital signs were assessed after participants had rested in a supine position for no less than 5 minutes. Vital signs included systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and oral body temperature. The normal ranges of vital signs were: systolic blood pressure as 90-140 millimeter of Hg (mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure as 50-90 mm Hg, pulse rate as 45-100 beats per minute, and oral body temperature as 36.3-37.5 degree Celsius. Data was reported as the number of participants who had low level values (values less than the normal range) and high level values (values more than the normal range).</description>
        <time_frame>Days -28 to -2, Day -1, Days 1 to 5, and Day 10 for blood pressure and pulse rate; and Days -28 to -2, Day -1, and Day 10 for oral body temperature</time_frame>
        <population>The safety analysis consisted of all participants who had received the single dose of the study drug (aleglitazar), whether prematurely withdrawn from the study or not.</population>
