  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if rasagiline improves RLS symptoms. We also want to
      make sure rasagiline is safe to give people with RLS.

      The primary objective is to determine if rasagiline, at a dosage of 1mg/day, is non-futile
      for the treatment of RLS, as measured by the International RLS Study Group Rating Scale
      (IRLS). The primary outcome variable will be the change in IRLS from baseline to Week 12.

      The secondary objectives are to determine if rasagiline, at a dosage of 1mg/day, is safe and
      well-tolerated in participants with RLS. Also, to determine if rasagiline improves measures
      of global clinical change, sleep quality, excessive sleepiness, quality of life, or
      depressive symptoms.
