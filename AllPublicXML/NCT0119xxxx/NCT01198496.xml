      1. Objectives and Hypothesis

             1. Objectives:

                This study evaluates whether strict BP management is useful for the prevention of
                recurrent stroke.

                Hypertensive patients with history of stroke are treated with stepwise multi-drug
                therapy to achieve stricter BP target &lt;120/80 mmHg in the strict BP control group
                and less stricter BP target &lt;140/90 mmHg or &lt;130/80 mmHg for patients with current
                DM/CKD/MI in the standard BP control group. The participants under the BP treatment
                achieving their respective BP target will be followed for recurrence of stroke. The
                study continues until the number of patients with the first recurrent stroke
                reaches a total of 330 between the two groups. The occurrence rates of recurrent
                stroke will be compared between the two groups.

             2. Hypotheses The incidence of recurrent stroke will be lower in a strict BP control
                group having lower BP target: &lt;120/80 mmHg* than in a standard BP control group
                having BP target &lt;140/90 mmHg or &lt;130/80 mmHg for current DM/CKD/MI in patients
                with hypertension.

        2. Study design This will be a multicenter, randomized, open-label study. The study
           consists of a screening period, a titration period and a follow-up period. The screening
           period is a period between the date of consent and the enrollment date. Hypertensive
           patients with history of stroke are randomly assigned to either the strict BP control
           group having the target of &lt;120/80 mmHg or the standard BP control group having the
           target of &lt;140/90 mmHg without current DM, CKD or MI and &lt;130/80 mmHg with current DM,
           CKD or MI. The titration period is the period finding a treatment which achieves target
           BP, and 24 weeks at maximum. Patients will be treated with stepwise multi-drug therapy
           using an angiotensin-receptor antagonist, diuretic, calcium channel blocker and
           aldosterone antagonist. The participants will be observed under the BP management for
           their respective BP target. The study will be continued until the number of patients
           with the first recurrent stroke reaches a total of 330 between two groups. The follow-up
           period will be 3 years.

      The recurrent rates of stroke in both groups will be compared from various aspects, and
      strict BP management will be investigated on the usefulness in prevention of recurrent
      stroke.

      Rationale for Study Duration Predicting that strict BP control reduces the relative risk of
      recurrent stroke by 30% during the planned observation period of 3 years, the number of
      participants necessary to detect the recurrent stroke with rate of 2.5%/year and 7.5%/3 years
      is 2482 patients per group with a detection power of 90% and α-error of 0.05. A drop-out rate
      is estimated as 20%.

      Therefore, the study will be continued for 3 years until a total of 330 patients with
      recurrent stroke in both groups are identified.

      Rationale for Dosing Regimen One of ARB, losartan, is chosen for Step 1 therapy, because
      angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is preferred as the first line of anti-hypertensives.
      Furthermore, a stepwise combination therapy of BP lowering drugs diuretic,
      hydrochlorothiazide, and calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, will be used, because the
      Japanese guidelines recommend the combination for BP control in prevention of recurrent
      stroke. (Step 2 to Step 5). Finally (as Step 6), a selective aldosterone antagonist,
      spironolactone, will be added for the treatment of with refractory hypertensive patients
      whose BP does not reach to the target.

      Treatment Plan The dosages of study drugs will be determined according to the package insert
      for the drug.

      Patients who are not treated with antihypertensive agent or treated with one antihypertensive
      agent at enrollment will start from Step 1. Patients who are treated with two
      antihypertensive agents at enrollment will start from Step 2.

      In principle, treatment duration will be for 4 weeks at each step.

    <description>Hypertensive patients with history of stroke are treated with stepwise multi-drug therapy to achieve BP target less than 120/80 mmHg in the strict BP group and BP target less than 140/90 mmHg or less than 130/80 mmHg for patients with DM/CKD/old MI in the standard BP group. The participants under the BP treatment achieving their respective BP target will be followed for recurrence of stroke.

    <description>Under the strict BP control, not only the recurrence of stroke but also occurrence of cardiovascular events (such as myocardial infarction and heart failure), angioplasty, and death will be reduced.
Separate hypothesis: Additionally, occurrence and exacerbation of dementia is also decreased under the strict BP control in comparison with the standard control.</description>

    <description>The incidence of recurrent stroke will be lower in a strict BP control group having lower BP target: less than 120/80 mmHg* than in a standard BP control group having BP target less than 140/90 mmHg or less than 130/80 mmHg for current DM/CKD/old MI in patients with hypertension.
This study uses BP target: less than 120/80 mmHg that is sat up for this study rather than the BP target recommended in the Guidelines for the management of hypertension, Japanese Society of Hypertension 2009.
BP management is strongly recommended in patients with hypertension, DM, and/or CKD for prevention of recurrent stroke in the Japanese guidelines for the management of stroke 2009.</description>
