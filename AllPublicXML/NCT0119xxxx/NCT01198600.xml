    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the factors affecting comfortable contact lens wear
      and how those factors affect contact lens replacement frequency.

      Eligible participants began Phase 1, following either Cycle A or Cycle B, and crossing over
      to the second cycle after completing the first. After the Phase 1 results were evaluated,
      eligible participants entered Phase 2. After Phase 2 results were evaluated, participants who
      consistently reported the highest and the lowest comfort scores entered Phase 3 and were
      defined as either survivors or strugglers.

I am in pain!”)and 100=VERY COMFORTABLE &amp; FRESH (“Wow! My eyes feel incredible! I love this feeling.”)</description>
