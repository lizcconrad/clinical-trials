  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections (IFI) remain the major cause of death among neutropenic patients
      receiving chemotherapy for leukemia, or submitted to stem cell transplantation. Patients with
      a history of invasive fungal infection (IFI) are at high risk of developing relapse and fatal
      complications.

      Prompt intensive antifungal therapy, have improved responses and survival, allowing an
      increase of antifungal treatments, including secondary antifungal prophylaxis.

      Few studies have addressed the role of previous IFI in the feasibility of stem cell
      transplant, or the secondary prophylaxis with antifungal drugs in preventing recurrence of
      infection after transplantation. However, given the lack of prospective studies, the role of
      secondary antifungal prophylaxis remains unclear.

      Itraconazole is a wide-spectrum triazole antifungal agent active against Candida albicans,
      non-albicans, Aspergillus spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Blastomyces coccidioides,
      Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporothrix schenkii, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma spp.
      and various kinds of yeast fungi and mycetes.

      The role of itraconazole IFI prophylaxis treatment has been proved by many interventional
      studies. In this prospective, multicentric study of secondary prophylaxis, itraconazole will
      be given at standard dose to patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation or
      chemotherapy with prior invasive fungal infection, to assess the efficacy and safety of
      itraconazole secondary prophylaxis.

    <description>The rate of patients who developed persistent fever or pulmonary infiltrates of unknown etiology. For those neutropenic patients with persistent fever, antibiotics should be used according to the International anti-infection guideline in order to exclude the possibility of bacterial infection. If the fever persists after 5-6 days' combination use of itraconazole and antibiotics, this case would be regarded as &quot;secondary prophylaxis failure&quot; and the trial is terminated , while doctors should search for further clinical therapy to save the patient.</description>

    <description>Itraconazole will be administered intravenously 2×200 mg/d(200mg twice a day, with 12 hours interval, and should be completed in no less than 60 minutes each time) in the first two days of treatment as a loading dose, then 200mg/d intravenously (200mg once a day with 24 hours interval and completed in no less than 60 minutes) until the end of the at-risk period.
In transplant patients, the end of &quot;at-risk period&quot; is defined as a stable engraftment of 1*109/L neutrophil cells; in patients who have undergone chemotherapy, it is defined as the resolution of neutropenia (neutrophil cells&gt; 0.5*109/L).
If needed, the patients will take itraconazole solution orally after intravenous administration.</description>
