  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess if low pre-transplantation donor specific T-cell reactive patients
      measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT)assay can be safely managed with
      Calcineurin inhibitor(CNI)-free Sirolimus(SRL)-based immunosuppression.
