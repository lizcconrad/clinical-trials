  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a multi-level
      self-management intervention to improve nutritional intake in a group of homebound older
      adults (HOAs) who are at especially high risk for undernutrition. The study will be guided by
      the theoretical approaches of the Ecological Model and Social Cognitive Theory and will use a
      prospective randomized controlled design to estimate whether individually tailored counseling
      focusing on social and behavioral aspects of eating results in increased caloric intake and
      improved nutrition-related health outcomes in a sample of 104 HOAs. The investigators
      hypothesize that intervention at these levels will improve caloric intake and indirectly
      improve health outcomes.
