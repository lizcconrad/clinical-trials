    <textblock>
      Denture stomatitis is the most common form of chronic oral candidiasis manifested as chronic
      inflammation of the mucous membrane t supporting the movable prosthesis that may have a local
      or systemic nature. This inflammation is presented as mucous erythema and occasionally with
      pain and burning. The standard treatment for denture stomatitis is administration of nystatin
      which is accompanied with complications such as bitter taste as well as the high number of
      drug application that result in reduced tendency of patients in using this medication hence,
      efforts are continuously being made to substitute other types of therapies for this
      condition.
