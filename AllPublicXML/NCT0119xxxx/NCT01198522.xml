  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic treatment for advanced, non-resectable pancreatic cancer still having minimal impact
      on the survival of patients. Even with the application of more potent gemcitabine-based
      regimens, survival of more than 1 year is uncommon for advanced disease. Accordingly, there
      is substantial unmet needs for the improvement of treatment options. The combination and
      simultaneous application of tumor-targeted L19IL2 with gemcitabine could result in improved
      anti-cancer efficacy, based on preliminary clinical and strong preclinical data.

      The primary purpose of this Phase I study is to define a safe and potentially more active
      treatment regimen of L19IL2 (escalating doses) combined with gemcitabine for advanced
      pancreatic cancer patients. Also, early signs of anticancer responses of the
      L19IL2/gemcitabine regimen will be assessed and compared to historical controls (gemcitabine
      monotherapy).

    <description>Part A) Patient cohorts will sequentially be assigned to 800 or 1,000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine. gemcitabine will be given in combination with a fixed dose of L19IL2. Part B) Patient cohorts will sequentially be assigned to 10, 15,22.5,30 or 37,5 MioIU IL2 equivalents of L19IL2. L19IL2 will be given in combination with gemcitabine at the dose recommended from Part A. Should the MTD of L19IL2 not be reached within the planned cohorts listed above, the dose of L19IL2 will be further increased following 7.5 MioIU increasing steps.
Induction treatment: Intravenous (i.v.) infusions of L19IL2 on days 1,3,5,22,24, 26,43,45,47, followed by i.v. infusions of gemcitabine on days 1,8,15,22,29,36,43. Maintenance treatment: Patients with objective tumor responses or stable disease will receive up to 4 cycles of maintenance treatment, starting on day 57: i.v. infusions of L19IL2 on days 1 (day 57), 8,15, followed by an i.v. infusion of gemcitabine. Treatment cycles will be repeated on day 29.</description>

             per day of 5 mg prednisone (or equivalent), when it is meant to address cancer
             symptoms (e.g., pain, dyspnoea, lack of appetite), is allowed. A suspected presence of
             chronic inflammatory disease has to be considered an exclusion criterion.
