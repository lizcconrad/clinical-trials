    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of giving paricalcitol together
      with fluorouracil and radiation therapy in treating patients with rectal cancer that can be
      removed in surgery. Paricalcitol may help rectal cancer cells become more like normal cells,
      and to grow and spread more slowly. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. It not yet
      known if chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective with or without paricalcitol
      in treating rectal cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity and tolerability of oral paricalcitol at 2 Î¼g/day when
      co-administered with oral 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil)-based chemoradiation in patients with
      histologically confirmed, resectable T3-T4 adenocarcinoma of rectal mucosal origin or
      node-positive disease with no known distant metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the biologic effects of oral paricalcitol in addition to oral 5-fluorouracil
      chemoradiation on Vitamin D receptor staining, MIB-1, Caspase 3, P 21, and Bax protein
      expression in these patients.

      II. To identify patterns of gene expression in tumor samples of patients who receive chemo
      radiation with and without Paricalcitol supplementation using gene microarray technology.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paricalcitol orally (PO) daily. Patients also receive standard care
      chemoradiotherapy with fluorouracil PO.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard care chemoradiotherapy as in Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues until surgical resection in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month after surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have histologically confirmed T3-T4 adenocarcinoma of rectal mucosal origin
        or node positive, with no confirmed distant metastases, and that has been shown to be
        resectable Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 Leukocytes &gt;=
        3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin
        within normal institutional limits Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic
        oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate
        transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine within normal
        institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with
        creatinine levels above institutional normal Patients must not have deficient levels of
        Vitamin D, 1, 25 Hydroxy as defined by the institution (this allows patients with normal
        vitamin D or insufficient vitamin D) Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a
        written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

        No prior pelvic radiation therapy or chemo-radiation to the rectum; no chemo-radiation for
        any other reason in the last 8 weeks Patients may not be receiving any other
        investigational agents Patients with a history of or current hypercalcemia may not be
        enrolled in this study History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
        chemical or biologic composition to paricalcitol Uncontrolled intercurrent illness
        including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart
        failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
        situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women and nursing
        mothers are excluded from this study because the adverse effects on the fetus from chemo
        radiation Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination
        antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
        interactions with these agents; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal
        infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be
        undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated
