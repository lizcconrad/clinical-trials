      Avascular necrosis is a disease where there is cellular death (necrosis) of bone components
      due to interruption of the blood supply. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and the bone
      collapses. If avascular necrosis involves the bones of a joint, it often leads to destruction
      of the joint articular surfaces. Avascular necrosis is especially common in the hip joint. A
      variety of methods are now used to treat avascular necrosis the most common being the total
      hip replacement, or THR.A new, more promising treatment is hip resurfacing or metal on metal
      (MOM) resurfacing.Another treatment is utilization of bone marrow derived stem cells.these
      stem cells can provide angiogenic factors and osteogenic cytokine to improve angiogenesis and
      bone formation.

      A vascular necrosis of femoral head is a debilitating disease resulting from interruption of
      blood supply to the bone. This pathologic process results in the death of marrow and
      osteocytes and, in its final stage, femoral head collapse. The most widespread treatment in
      the early stage of this disease is core decompression. This surgical procedure involves
      drilling into the femoral neck through the necrotic area, which reduces pressure within the
      bone and allows more blood vessels to form. This study is designed to evaluate the clinical
      safety and efficacy of CD133+ enriched bone marrow infusion adjacent with core decompression
      in patients with a vascular necrosis of femoral head . Patients will undergo core
      decompression followed by CD133+cell infusion into the cored area. Clinical assessment
      includes a MRI, Harries Hip Score,SF36, Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), and the WOMAC
      osteoarthritis Index.
