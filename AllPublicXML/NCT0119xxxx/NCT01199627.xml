  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bleeding caused by hip replacement surgery (CRT) is an important source of demand for
      blood in the hospital. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a drug that has proved useful in reducing
      bleeding associated with other surgeries and CRT results have been positive, but the variety
      of dosages difficult to evaluate the results To determine the efficacy and safety of TXA in
      reducing bleeding caused by surgery of total hip replacement.

      PATIENTS: Patients ASA(American Society of Anesthesiologists) I-III that they are to perform
      hip replacement surgery and cementless unilateral total that have signed the informed
      consent.

      Group A: 1st dose 15mg/kg of TXA in 100ml saline 0.9% after the completion of regional
      anesthesia, and before the start of surgery.

      2nd dose: intravenous infusion over 10 minutes in 100ml of saline 0.9% at three hours after
      the first administration.

      Group B: 1st dose: 10mg/kg of TXA in 100ml 0.9% saline after the completion of regional
      anesthesia, and before the start of surgery.

      2nd dose: intravenous infusion over 10 minutes of 10mg/kg of TXA in 100ml saline 0.9% at
      three hours after the first administration.

      Group C: 1st dose: intravenous infusion over 10 minutes in 100ml of 0.9% saline after the
      completion of regional anesthesia, and before the start of surgery.

      2nd dose: intravenous infusion over 10 minutes in 100ml of saline 0.9% at three hours after
      the first administration.
