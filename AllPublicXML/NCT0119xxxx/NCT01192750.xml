      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with
      recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck previously treated with
      cisplatin with or without cetuximab.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate the association between ERCC1 expression and clinical outcomes (response
           rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival) in patients with recurrent and/or
           metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who received cisplatin with
           versus without cetuximab on clinical trial ECOG-E5397.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for ERCC1 expression by IHC. ERCC1 levels
      (low or high) are assessed by an H-score and AQUA, a quantitative IHC analysis. Each
      patient's ERCC1 level result is then compared with the patient's clinical outcome.
