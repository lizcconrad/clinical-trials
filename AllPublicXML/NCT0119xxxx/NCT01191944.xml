    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate non-inferiority of pramipexole Extended release to
      Immediate release at 18 weeks on the primary efficacy endpoint (Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale II+III) in Chinese PD patients who can be concomitantly treated with Levodopa .

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 18</time_frame>
    <description>UPDRS total score ranges from 0 (best) to 160 (worst) and was calculated as the sum of Part II (activities of daily living, ranges from 0 to 52) and Part III (motor examination, ranges from 0 to 108). Reduction over time represents an improvement. Means are adjusted for treatment, centre and baseline.</description>

    <description>ESS is a patient-report scale with 8 items rating how likely one is to fall asleep during passive and inconsequential situations such as watching television, more active situations such as sitting and talking to someone, or consequential situations such as sitting in a car, while stopped for a few minutes in traffic.

             breast-feeding.

         11. Sexually active female of childbearing potential (less than 6 months post-menopausal

        <description>Percentage on-time without or with non-troublesome Dyskinesia based on patient diary data, percentage ranging from 0 (best case) to 100 (worst case). On-time describes a period during which a patient was relatively free of Parkinsons symptoms (e.g. mobile or capable of moving with relative ease and independence). Dyskinesia qualified as non-troublesome if it did not interfere with function or did not cause meaningful discomfort. Increase in the percentage represents an improvement. Means are adjusted for treatment, centre and baseline.</description>

          <description>Duration of on-time without Dyskinesia or with non-troublesome Dyskinesia based on patient diary data, percentage ranging from 0 (worst case) to 100 (best case). On-time describes a period during which a patient was relatively free of Parkinsons symptoms (e.g. mobile or capable of moving with relative ease and independence). Dyskinesia qualified as non-troublesome if it did not interfere with function or did not cause meaningful discomfort. Increase in the duration represents an improvement. Means are adjusted for treatment, centre and baseline.</description>

        <description>ESS is a patient-report scale with 8 items rating how likely one is to fall asleep during passive and inconsequential situations such as watching television, more active situations such as sitting and talking to someone, or consequential situations such as sitting in a car, while stopped for a few minutes in traffic. The likelihood of dozing off is rated from 0 points (no chance) to 3 points (high chance). The overall rating scale is scored from 0 (no daytime sleep) to 24 (worst daytime sleep).</description>
