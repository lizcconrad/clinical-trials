  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-period, double-blind study in healthy adult female subjects. Each subject
      will participate in an oral contraceptive Run-in period prior to the treatment periods. The
      length of the Run-in Period will be 28 days or longer, depending on the timing of the
      subject's menstrual cycle and on whether the subject is taking an OC. Each subject will
      participate in this run-in period (if needed), followed by two treatment periods. Treatment
      Periods 1 and 2 must be conducted successively. Subjects will be randomized in a cross-over
      fashion to either YASMIN with GSK2248761 or Placebo for 10 days and switch GSK2248761 or
      placebo for another 10 days. Subjects will return to the study center for final follow up
      evaluations 7 - 14 days after the final dose of study medication.
