      The study is being conducted to collect information about visual outcomes and participant
      satisfaction with the Tecnis One-Piece Multifocal (MF) Intraocular Lenses (IOLs) compared
      with participants previously implanted with Crystalens Aspheric Optic (AO) IOLs. The U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Tecnis One-Piece MF IOL for visual
      correction of aphakia (replacing a removed lens in the eye) in adults.

    <description>Part 1 Only:
The primary outcome measure is incision size at three points:
Immediately after application of the keratome blade Post phacoemulsification Post Tecnis IOL implantation Target refraction vs. achieved
Part 1 and 2:
UCVA data at distance, intermediate, and near Near vision will be measured in mesopic and photopic conditions standardized with light meter BCVA at distance and near Enhancement rates Spectacle independence questionnaire and patient satisfaction Incidence of adverse events</description>
