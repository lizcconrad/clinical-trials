    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the BCG 'challenge' model a four-arm study design
      has been chosen. Twelve subjects will be recruited into each arm of the study. Allocation of
      BCG-naïve volunteers to either group A or B, and BCG-vaccinated volunteers to either group C
      or D, will be performed on a one-to-one alternating basis. Subjects in each group will be
      challenged by BCG administered intradermally. Prior to challenge, pre-existing immunity to TB
      will be induced by vaccination with BCG, MVA85A, and both in combination (when compared to
      BCG- &amp; MVA85A-naïve individuals). BCG quantification will be assessed by analysing the tissue
      obtained in a punch biopsy of volunteers' skin over the site of BCG 'challenge' vaccination.
      Any reduction in BCG quantification between groups will then be correlated to existing (and
      future) laboratory assays of vaccine-induced immune responses in order to identify potential
      immunological correlates of protection.
