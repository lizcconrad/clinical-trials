      Women with HIV infection in Mississippi who are pregnant or who have had their baby in the
      past year can agree to fill out a questionnaire about what helps or hurts return to care for
      HIV infection after having a baby. The combined results should show the most common things
      that keep women from getting care for HIV infection after having a baby. This will help
      design another study in order to help more women get into care for HIV infection after having
      a baby.

      Following recruitment and completion of informed consent, a participant will be given a
      questionnaire to look at factors that help or hinder access to HIV care after delivery. After
      finishing the initial questionnaire the participant will get a Wal-Mart gift card for $15.
      The participant may then be asked to complete a longer interview for which she would receive
      an additional gift card for $25. The combined results will be used to design an
      interventional study to improve entry into HIV care after delivery.
