      This study will examine a new combination of drugs: Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin for the
      treatment of Stage II and III colorectal cancer. Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin are approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in colorectal cancer. The combination of drugs
      is experimental (not approved by the FDA as standard treatment), but is a widely used
      treatment option and preliminary studies have shown that treatment with the combination has a
      positive effect on metastatic colorectal cancer.
