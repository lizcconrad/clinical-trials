      Determine whether eating beans with a high fat meal will reduce the inflammatory response in
      people with the metabolic syndrome and increase feelings of satiety.

      Determine whether eating beans with a high fat meal will reduce the inflammatory response in
      people with the metabolic syndrome; thereby possibly postponing the diagnosis of diabetes or
      other chronic inflammatory diseases. These researchers are also interested in how consuming
      beans can affect the length of time a person stays full after a meal.

    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring inflammatory markers after consumption of a high fat meal in conjunction with one of three soups. The three soups are: a bean soup high in fiber and antioxidants, a couscous soup high in fiber, and a couscous soup high in antioxidants.</description>

    <measure>Satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measure subjects' perception of fullness during the 6 hour post-prandial testing period. Subjects will keep food records on the study day and day following to look for any longer effects on satiety as measured by food intake.</description>
