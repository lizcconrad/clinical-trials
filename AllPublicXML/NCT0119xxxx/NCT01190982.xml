  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LEP-ETU is a novel, proprietary delivery system of paclitaxel developed by NeoPharm, Inc.
      Paclitaxel (currently marketed as Taxol) is an anti-microtubular network agent and is active
      in a broad spectrum of malignancies. Paclitaxel has poor solubility. In order to enhance the
      solubility, this drug is formulated with polyoxyethylated castor oil, which leading to
      infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions. The NeoPharm LEP-ETU is formulated with a
      mixture of well characterized, synthetic phospholipids and cholesterol. This design
      eliminates the need for the oil. The LEP-ETU formulation has improved safety profile that is
      necessary for administering higher doses than would commonly be used with Taxol. The clinical
      evidence obtained from the NeoPharm Phase I study shows LEP-ETU is better tolerated than
      Taxol, as indicated by a higher maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). The current Phase II study is
      designed to accomplish the following objectives:

        1. Assess the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of patients with metastatic breast cancer after
           administered over 90 minutes at the dose of 275 mg/m2 LEP-ETU

        2. To evaluate the Progression-Free Survival (PFS)

        3. To evaluate the safety of LEP-ETU at 275 mg/m2 level, in particular peripheral
           neuropathy

        4. To evaluate the Overall Survival (OS)
