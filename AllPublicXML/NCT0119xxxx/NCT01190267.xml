  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate whether asenapine, which is approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults, is
      generally safe and well tolerated in adolescents with schizophrenia. This is an extension of
      base study P05896 (NCT01190254), which means participants must have completed participation
      in the 8-week base study in order to qualify for this extension study P05897. Participants in
      this extension study will receive open-label asenapine for 26 weeks. Throughout the study,
      observations will be made on each participant at various times to assess the long-term
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of the study treatment.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An AE was defined as a &quot;treatment-emergent&quot; AE if it was not present at the extension study baseline, or if it was present at the extension study baseline but worsened in severity compared to baseline during the extension study treatment period.</description>

          <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An AE was defined as a âtreatment-emergentâ AE if it was not present at the extension study baseline, or if it was present at the extension study baseline but worsened in severity compared to baseline during the extension study treatment period.</description>
