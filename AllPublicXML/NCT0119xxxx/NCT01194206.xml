    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Stereotactic body
      radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to
      normal tissue in patients with liver cancer. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy may
      also increase patient eligibility for liver transplant.PURPOSE: This phase II trial is
      studying how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients with liver
      cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:I. To determine in patients with stage B and C Hepatocellular Carcinoma,
      if Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy can achieve a downstaging rate of &gt;= 30% at 3
      months.SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. To determine in patients with stage B and C Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma, if Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy can achieve a downstaging rate of &gt;= 30% at 3
      and 6 months.II. To determine the rate of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with SBRT
      for liver tumors. III. To determine the rate of local progression after SBRT. (Based onRECIST
      criteria)IV. To determine the number of patients who achieve liver
      transplantation.OUTLINE:Patients undergo 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy
      delivered within 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.

    <description>At least 3 gold standard Cyberknife fiducials will be placed in the liver w/in 6 cm of the tumor for image guidance during radiation therapy. At least 1 wk will elapse between fiducial placement and tx planning simulation to allow for fiducial settling and any migration.The full radiation tx will be given ideally in 3 consecutive days. In any case there must be a minimum of 24 hrs between fractions and all 3 fractions will be delivered w/in 14 days. The dose to at least 95% of the tumor will be 37.5 Gy total in 12.5 Gy fractions.</description>
