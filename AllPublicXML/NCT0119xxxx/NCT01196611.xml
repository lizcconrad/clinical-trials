  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares two different approaches of voice therapy. Vocal Functional Exercises
      (Stemple,1997) and Voice Amplification using a portable amplifier (Tsi Supervoz II -
      Tecnisystem do Brasil TSI 1210).

      Both approaches combined with Vocal Hygiene Program (Behlau, 2007).The target population are
      female teachers because they have the highest risk for developing voice problems. For this
      study the investigators are primarily interested in seeing if Vocal Functional Exercises and
      Voice Amplification are equally effective at improving vocal functioning in teachers with
      voice disorders. The Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation will be done before randomization. All
      the participants will complete before and after a 6-week treatment phase (a) Voice Activity
      and Participation Profile (PPAV), an instrument designed to appraise the self-perceived
      psychosocial consequences of voice disorders to assess the impact of voice disorders on daily
      activities (b) Audio voice recording for later acoustic analysis, through the Kay Elemetrics
      Multi Dimensional Voice Program (c) Audio recording for later perceptual analysis through
      Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE_V). It is believed that the search
      for evidence in clinical studies like this can contribute to awareness programs and vocal
      training for teachers.
