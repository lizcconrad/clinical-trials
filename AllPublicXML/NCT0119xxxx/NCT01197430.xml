      Purpose: Optimal eye-hand coordination is important for volleyball players. Neck disorder may
      affect neck function and subsequently eye-hand coordination. The purpose of this study is to
      explore the vertical stability training effects on coordination of the upper extremities of
      female volleyball players.

      Methods: This study surveyed 25 players of a volleyball team, randomly assigned into the
      group A (training 1st) and group B (training 2nd). The group A includes 13 volleyball players
      and the group B includes 12. Eye-hand coordination was tested by a self-developed
      hand-stroking table device and stay time and motion time of upper extremities were
      determined. There are two testing modes, regular and random. Motion time for the electric
      probe moving between target sensor and stay time for the electric probe staying on a target
      sensors were collected for each mode, before each session of training and after the end of
      the 2nd session. In the 1st session of training, group A started vertical stability training
      and group B did control training for six weeks. In the 2nd session of training, the training
      programs were shifted between group A and B for another six weeks.
