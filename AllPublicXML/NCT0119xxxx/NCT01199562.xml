      RATIONALE: Infection prophylaxis and management may help prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      infection caused by a stem cell transplant.

      PURPOSE:This clinical trial studies infection prophylaxis and management in treating
      cytomegalovirus infection in patients with hematologic malignancies previously treated with
      donor stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a individualized strategy for cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      preemptive management, one that monitors CMV viral load and clinical markers of
      immunosuppression to optimize use of ganciclovir in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT) who experience CMV reactivation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate how donor killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) genes of interest
      (activating KIR2DS2 and 2DS4, inhibitory KIR2DL1, 2DL2/2DL3, 3DL1, 3DL2), together with their
      recipient ligands where known, influence CMV reactivation-free survival after allogeneic HCT,
      independently of clinical risk factors such as onset of acute graft-versus-host disease.

      II. To investigate whether markers of natural killer (NK) cell function correlate with a)
      KIR/ligand compound genotype and baseline or concurrent clinical factors and b) with history
      of CMV reactivation and anti-CMV therapy at the time of NK cell collection.

      III. To investigate associations between NK cell recovery and antigen-specific T cell immune
      reconstruction.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive standard antiviral infection prophylaxis and management comprising
      ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or foscarnet sodium for 2 weeks or until the plasma CMV
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) is negative.
      Patients may receive additional courses based on subsequent CMV reactivations.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 1 year.

    <description>Confirmed by detection of CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy.

    <measure>CMV reactivation-free survival, monitored using a real time PCR assay for CMV DNA in plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 100 post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Modeled using proportional hazards regression. Primary risk factors will be donor KIR of interest (activating KIR2DS2 and 2DS4, inhibitory KIR2DL1, 2DL2/2DL3, 3DL1, 3DL2), together with their recipient ligands where known. Potential confounding factors to be controlled in the model will include established clinical risk factors, including pretransplant CMV serostatus of donor and recipient, unrelated donor, marrow versus peripheral blood stem cells, and onset of acute graft-versus-host disease, handled as a time-dependent variable. The proportionality of hazards over time will be verified.</description>
