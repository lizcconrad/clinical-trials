    <measure>Value of the Peripheral Neuropathy Total Symptom Score (TSS) Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; End of Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The TSS of peripheral neuropathy is used to score the intensity &amp; frequency of four symptoms in participants' feet/legs including: pain, burning sensation, numbness, and hypoesthesia. Frequency is ranked as asymptomatic, occasionally (2-3 times/ week), often (1-2 times/ day), &amp; continuous (nearly all day). Intensity is evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) score: 0 (zero intensity)- 10 (max. intensity). Participants described intensity by marking the number corresponding to severity of symptom they felt in a 10 cm long straight line and investigators distinguished whether it was mild (score: 1-3), moderate (score: 4-6), or severe (score: 7-10). The total score of four symptoms was considered the TSS. Total scores ranged from 0-14.64 points, where 0 was lowest symptom score and 14.64 was most severe level of symptoms. Baseline (before treatment) scores were compared to scores after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Neural Injury Score of the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) was scored based on the following examination items: muscle strength (including hip &amp; knee flexion/ extension &amp; remote foot dorsiflexion/ plantar flexion [scored as normal, 25% weak, 50% weak, 75% weak, and paralysis]), reflex (response at the quadriceps &amp; ankle [normal score=0, decreased score=1, absent score=2], and sensory (tested at the great toe; including touch pressure, pinprick ,vibration, and joint position [normal score=0, decreased score=1, absent score=2]). The Total NIS-LL score ranged from 0-8 points where a higher score means greater neural injury of the lower limbs. Baseline (before treatment) scores were compared to scores after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>
