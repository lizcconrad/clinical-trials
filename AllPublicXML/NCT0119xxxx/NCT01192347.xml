    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who had taken a previous cytoreductive therapy were divided into subgroups based on the treatment regimens used when Anagrelide Hydrochloride treatment was initiated, using the following variables:
•Withdrawal of previous cytoreductive therapy:
Before: if a stop date of previous cytoreductive therapy was prior to the date of Anagrelide Hydrochloride initiation
After: if a stop date of previous cytoreductive therapy was between the first administration and the last administration of Anagrelide Hydrochloride during the follow-up
Not Withdrawn: in all other cases</description>

        <description>Patients who had taken a previous cytoreductive therapy were divided into subgroups based on the treatment regimens used when Anagrelide Hydrochloride treatment was initiated, using the following variables:
•Withdrawal of previous cytoreductive therapy:
Before: if a stop date of previous cytoreductive therapy was prior to the date of Anagrelide Hydrochloride initiation
After: if a stop date of previous cytoreductive therapy was between the first administration and the last administration of Anagrelide Hydrochloride during the follow-up

        <description>Full response is a platelet count of &lt;400x10^9/L. Partial response is a platelet count between 400-600x10^9/L or a platelet count reduction of 200x10^9.
Patients who had taken a previous cytoreductive therapy were divided into subgroups based on the treatment regimens used when XAGRID treatment was initiated, using the following variables:
Initiation of XAGRID dosing consistent with the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC):
Consistent if:
The starting dose was &lt;=1 mg/day, AND
Any increase in dose was no more than 0.5mg/day, AND
Any increase in dose was made at least 7 days after first initiation or at least 7 days after any previous modification (up or down), AND

        <description>Patients who had taken a previous cytoreductive therapy were divided into subgroups based on the treatment regimens used when XAGRID treatment was initiated, using the following variables:
Initiation of XAGRID dosing consistent with the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC):
Consistent if:
The starting dose was &lt;=1 mg/day, AND
Any increase in dose was no more than 0.5mg/day, AND
Any increase in dose was made at least 7 days after first initiation or at least 7 days after any previous modification (up or down), AND
The maximum dose did not exceed 10 mg/day at any stage.
Inconsistent: in all other cases</description>
