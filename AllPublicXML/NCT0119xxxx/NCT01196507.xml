    <textblock>
      Patients of cirrhosis with portal hypertension aged 18 to 75 years who have small esophageal
      varices with or without red color signs and have not bled previously will be enrolled. After
      baseline evaluation, the participants will be randomized to receive either Placebo or
      Carvedilol 12.5 mg BD. After randomization they will be followed up for one year. The primary
      endpoint of the study is the the proportions of patients who develop large varices (Gd 3 or
      Gd 4) at 1 year in each group. The secondary endpoint are survival,reduction in HVPG,change
      in CTP and MELD score&amp; adverse events.

    <description>Carvedilol will be administered orally at a start dose of 3.125 mg twice daily. After 1 week, this will increased if systolic blood pressure does not fall below 90 mm Hg. The patient will receive the maximum tolerated dose of carvedilol or with a maximum of 12.5 BD.</description>
