  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Gambro Prismaflex®
      HF20 Set based on testing the hypothesis that it delivers sufficient renal replacement
      therapy to effectively treat acute kidney injury (AKI) in pediatric patients by reducing
      blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

&quot;Caution: TMP Excessive&quot; At 72 hours from the initiation of HF20 study CRRT, the site may follow applicable institutional practices if additional CRRT is required.
Alarms from Prismaflex ® System 7.10 related to fluid balance will be noted and recorded for the following alarms:
&quot;Caution: Flow Problem&quot;

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a hospital admission body weight ≥8 and &lt;20 kg (ie, ≥17.6 and &lt;44.09
             lbs).

          2. Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) defined as either 1) Acute Kidney Injury by
             the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute Kidney Injury Guideline
             serum creatinine criteria, which is a ≥50% rise in serum creatinine over baseline or a
             0.3 mg/dL SCr rise in 48 hours, OR 2) as Acute Kidney Injury as defined by the
             pediatric modified RIFLE criteria (pRIFLE) which is a 25% reduction in estimated
             creatinine clearance, OR 3) a serum creatinine ≥1.2 mg/dL.

             OR Patients with severe fluid overload, defined as a ≥10% Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
             fluid accumulation (based on ICU admission weight) will be included in the study (%
             fluid accumulation = [(Fluids In (liters) - Fluid Out (liters)/ICU admit weight (kg) *
             100%] and BUN ≥40 mg/dL.

          3. Patients who have received renal replacement therapy previously can be included in the
             study if &gt;72 hours have elapsed since previous RRT provision.

          4. Provide written informed consent from one or both parents as required by the local IRB
             or a legal guardian unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent or not
             reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care
             and custody of the child per 21 CFR Part 50.55(e).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients a) weighing 8.0-20.0 kg with a hemoglobin of &lt;7.0 g/dL, b) weighing 8.0-12.0
             kg with a hemoglobin of &lt;8.0 g/dL (unless blood prime used), and c) weighing 12.1-20.0
             kg with a hemoglobin of &lt;7.5 g/dL (unless blood prime used).

          2. Children who are wards of the state.

          3. Children requiring or anticipated to undergo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
             (ECMO) treatment.
