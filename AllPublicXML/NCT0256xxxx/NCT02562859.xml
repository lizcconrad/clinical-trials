  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the amount of GLPG1837 and metabolite present in the
      blood (relative bioavailability) after a single oral administration of 500 mg GLPG1837 given
      as an oral suspension under fasted conditions as well as a tablet formulation under fasted
      and fed conditions, in male healthy subjects.

      Also, the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of 500 mg GLPG1837 given as an oral
      suspension under fasted conditions as well as a tablet formulation under fasted and fed
      conditions, will be assessed.

      Twelve subjects will receive GLPG1837 on 3 occasions as single dose administrations: as an
      oral suspension fasted, as an oral tablet, fed and fasted. Treatment administrations will be
      separated by a wash-out period of at least 6 days.
