  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-part open-label study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      [18F]MK-6240 as a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agent for quantifying brain
      burden of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology. Brain NFT deposition is a pathology finding
      in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and density of brain NFTs has been shown to correlate with
      severity of cognitive impairment in AD. The objectives of the study include performing the
      following with respect to [18F]MK-6240 administered as a PET imaging agent: assess safety and
      tolerability; determine radiation safety profile; determine optimal imaging protocol
      parameters for quantification of brain NFTs in AD; compare tracer binding in brain PET scans
      from participants with AD of varying severity, participants with amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and healthy elderly participants; and evaluate intra-subject test-retest
      (T-RT) variability of tracer uptake in brain regions of interest. The primary efficacy
      hypothesis is that the intra-subject T-RT variability in brain regions associated with NFT
      deposition in AD is ≤10%.
