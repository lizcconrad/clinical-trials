      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and blinatumomab
      when given together in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a
      period of improvement. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide and blinatumomab, use
      substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when given in combination
      with blinatumomab in the proposed regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity anti-tumor response (complete response [CR] and
      partial response [PR] as per International workshop lymphoma response criteria).

      II. To investigate the immune response to blinatumomab alone and in combination with
      lenalidomide.

      III. To document the infection rate with a 96-hour bag change schedule for blinatumomab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-56 and
      lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 29-49 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving response including stable disease receive blinatumomab IV
      continuously on days 1-7 and lenalidomide PO on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receiving response including stable disease after completion of
      Consolidation receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
