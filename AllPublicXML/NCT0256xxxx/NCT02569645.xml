    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether the addition of Rosuvastatin to standard chemoradiation
      therapy for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer may improve the pathological
      response rate and survival compared to standard chemoradiation therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer involves neoadjuvant chemoradiation
      therapy (CRT) followed by surgery and further adjuvant chemotherapy. The pathologic complete
      responses associated with neoadjuvant CRT are 10-20%. The prognosis of patients undergoing
      neoadjuvant CRT is associated to the extent of post-treatment tumour regression, the final
      primary tumour stage and presence of involved lymph nodes in the surgical specimen. This data
      suggests that treatments that enhance the pathological response may result in improvements in
      survival.

      Overwhelming preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that statins demonstrate anticancer
      properties and sensitize cancer tissues and protects normal tissues to the effects of
      radiation. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of rosuvastatin to standard
      CRT for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer may improve the pathological response
      rate. This protocol describes an open-label single-arm phase 2 study designed to test this
      hypothesis. Moreover, this study will also identify genetic, serological, and pathological
      biomarkers that may be both prognostic and predictive of response and toxicity to treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical stage 2-3 rectal adenocarcinoma, cT3/4N0/M0 or Tx N1-2/M0, within 5 cm of
             anal verge or less than 12cm from anal verge and threatened circumferential resection

             registration if surgery was major.

          5. ECOG 2 or less.

          6. Laboratory Requirements (must be done within 7 days prior to registration):

             a. Hematology: i. Hemoglobin ≥90 g/L ii. Granulocytes (AGC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L iii.

             UNL iii. Proteinuria ≤ grade 1 iv. Thyroid function within normal limits (TSH or free
             T4 within normal limits after correction) v. CPKs ≤ ULN, vi. Urinary myoglobin within
             normal limits Note: If serum creatinine is abnormal, a creatinine clearance should be
             calculated and be ≥ 60 ml/min.

          7. Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile or use two reliable forms of
             contraception if of child-bearing potential. Women of childbearing potential must have
             a urine pregnancy test taken and proven negative within 7 days prior to registration.
             Men must be surgically sterile or use an effective barrier method of contraception if
             sexually active with a woman of child-bearing potential. Acceptable methods of
             contraception are condoms with contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable
             contraceptives, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal
             gel, or a sexual partner who is surgically sterilized or post-menopausal. For both
             male and female patients, effective methods of contraception must be used throughout
             the study and for three months following the last dose.

          8. Patient consent must be obtained according to local Institutional and/or University
             Human Experimentation Committee requirements. It will be the responsibility of the
             local participating investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance. The patient
             must sign the consent form prior to registration. The consent form for this study must
             contain a statement, which gives permission for the sponsor and monitoring agencies to
             review patient records.

          9. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 1⁄2 hours driving distance)
             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of Asian ethnicity (having Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,

          6. Patients with malabsorption syndrome, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease,
             resection of the stomach or small bowel, or other disease significantly affecting
             gastrointestinal (GI) function.

          7. Patients with a known history of documented upper GI bleeding or upper GI ulcerative
             disease.

          8. Patients with hyperlipidemia with clinical indication for statin therapy or other
             prescribed medication (determination of acceptable fasting lipid values should be in
             accordance with current dyslipidemia management guidelines).
