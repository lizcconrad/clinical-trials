  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing major surgery are exposed to extensive damage of tissues, which induces
      widespread activation of the inflammatory system, called 'systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome' (SIRS).This activation of the inflammatory system may induce instability of the
      heart and respiration in the postoperative period. The degree of physiologic response to
      postoperative SIRS as well as the degree of postoperative pain differ between patients.
      Therefore, patients undergoing anesthesia and major surgery are treated in a 'post anesthesia
      care unit' (PACU) after end of surgery.Admittance to a PACU is expensive. The time patients
      need to stay in a PACU after major surgery has not been extensively studied, and more
      appropriate tools for prediction of length of stay are needed.

      The main aim of this study is to assess whether clinical observations, inflammatory
      biomarkers or genetic markers may aid in the prediction of physiological instability and/or
      pain after major surgery. Such predictors would help clinicians planning the length of
      PACU-stays.

    <description>Circulatory stability will be assessed by applying a multi-state statistical model, where any state changes are measured at an hourly basis. The model will include variables reflecting the circulatory state of the patient, including heart rate, systolic blood pressure (or MAP) and lactate, which will be assessed together with the measures needed to maintain them, such as the amount of fluid given (ml per hour) and the extent of vasopressor (i.e. norepinephrine). The main outcome variable will be the time needed to reach the state of 'stable without intervention for more than two hours. To be classified in this state, the systolic blood pressure must be &gt; 100 mmHg, the heart rate between 40 and 110, the patient must be off vasopressor and has a fluid requirement of less than 250 ml/hour.</description>
