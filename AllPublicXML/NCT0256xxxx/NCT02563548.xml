  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b study evaluating a combination of PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab in
      hyaluronan-high (HA-high) subjects with relapsed/refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC) and HA-high subjects with relapsed/refractory gastric adenocarcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study involves dose escalation phase (completed in Nov-2016) to find the RP2D dose and an
      expansion phase to assess the safety and tolerability of the RP2D dose within stage III b/IV
      NSCLC and relapsed/refractory gastric adenocarcinoma subjects.

      Plan is to include approximately 51 HA-high subjects (30 NSCLC and 21 GAC subjects) in the
      dose expansion phase on the obtained RP2D from dose escalation phase of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dose Expansion: Histologically confirmed and documented, previously untreated or
             treated stage IIIB or IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) having failed no more than
             1 previous platinum containing chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic
             disease or relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma
             having failed no more than 2 previous chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or
             metastatic disease. Subjects with NSCLC who are known to be epidermal growth factor
             receptor (EGFR)-mutation positive must have received an EGFR inhibitor and subjects
             known to be anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-mutation positive must have received an
             ALK inhibitor.

        Prior to enrollment, confirmation of the following must be obtained:

        • Dose expansion - For subjects in the dose expansion portion of the study, it is mandatory
        that available archived tumor tissue in FFPE block or minimum 10 unstained consecutive core
        biopsy slides from 1 archival block that meet specific tissue requirements are available.

          -  One or more tumors measurable on CT scan/MRI scan per RECIST v 1.1. - Previously
             irradiated tumors may be eligible if they have clearly progressed in size.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy ≥3 months.

        Subjects must also satisfy the following inclusion criterion:

          -  Subjects (NSCLC and gastric adenocarcinoma) must be determined to have HA-high levels
             from their tumor biopsies.

          -  NSCLC and gastric adenocarcinoma subjects must have tissue available for HA-selection
             and PD-L1 testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or other programmed cell death-1
             antibody (anti- PD-1) or PD-1 ligand-antibody (anti-PD-L1) agents.

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV (Appendix D) cardiac disease or myocardial
             infarction within the past 12 months before screening, or preexisting atrial
             fibrillation.

          -  Patients with known interstitial fibrosis or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Previous history of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary embolism found on screening exam.

          -  History of:

               1. Pneumonitis that requires oral or IV steroids;

               2. Or known cases of hepatobiliary diseases (e.g., primary biliary cholangitis,
                  primary sclerosing cholangitis, history of immune-mediated cholangitis);

                    -  Subjects with cholangitis attributed to infectious etiology (e.g., ascending
                       cholangitis, bacterial cholangitis) are eligible if the infection has been
                       fully resolved prior to the screening visit.

               3. Or known cases of drug-induced hepatobiliary toxicities.

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or
             documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or syndrome that requires
             systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.

          -  History of another primary cancer within the last 3 years that required treatment,
             with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, early-stage prostate cancer, or
