  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the use of reduced intensity chemotherapy and radiation therapy
      before donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with hematologic malignancies. Giving
      low doses of chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, before a donor
      stem cell transplant may help stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's
      immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the
      patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor
      effect). Reducing the intensity of the chemotherapy and radiation may also reduce the side
      effects of the donor stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate efficacy of this approach over the historical 2 step reduced intensity
      conditioning (RIC) approaches in the &quot;vulnerable&quot; population defined as: patients with
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)-co-morbidity index (CI)/age scores &gt;= 2, but no more than
      a score of 5 as based on the Sorror et al. data.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse related mortality (RRM) rates at 1
      year for patients treated on this study to the that of patients undergoing haploidentical RIC
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as reported in the literature and as observed
      in the 2 step RIC trials.

      II. To determine the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients
      undergoing treated on the Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) RIC 2 step approach.

      III. To evaluate engraftment rates and lymphoid reconstitution in patients treated on the TJU
      RIC 2 step approach.

      OUTLINE:

      RIC: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days -10 to
      -8 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients also undergo total body
      irradiation (TBI) followed by a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on day -6.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus orally (PO) beginning day -1 with a taper
      initiated on day 42 and mycophenolate mofetil IV twice daily (BID) on days -1 to 28 in the
      absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

          5. HCT-CI/Age Score ≤ 5 points (Patients with greater than 5 points will be allowed for
             trial with approval of the PI and the Co-PI or his designee. This is an adjustment to
             account for healthy patients who meet the spirit of this protocol but have histories
             that result in higher than HCT-CI 5 points. An example is a patient with a solid tumor
             malignancy in their remote history (adds 3 points to HCT-CI total) where the treatment
             for the malignancy occurred years to decades before and there has been complete

             than age 70 years

          2. HCT-CI/age Score &gt;5 points (Patients with greater than 5 points will be allowed for
             trial with approval of the Principal Investigator and the Co-Principal Investigator or
             his designee. This is an adjustment to account for healthy patients who meet the
             spirit of this protocol but have histories that result in higher than HCT-CI 5 points.
             An example is a patient with a solid tumor malignancy in their remote history (adds 3
             points to HCT-CI total) where the treatment for the malignancy occurred years to
             decades before and there has been complete recovery of toxicities.

          3. A diagnosis of CMML, unless in morphologic CR

          4. HIV positive

          5. Active involvement of the central nervous system with malignancy

          6. Inability to obtain informed consent from patient or surrogate

          7. Pregnancy

             hematologic/oncologic disorder

          9. Patients who have received alemtuzumab or antithymocyte globulin within 8 weeks of the
             transplant admission. The absence of these therapies in the medical record will serve
             as documentation that they were not given.

         10. Patients with evidence of another malignancy, exclusive of a skin cancer that requires
             only local treatment, should not be enrolled on this protocol
