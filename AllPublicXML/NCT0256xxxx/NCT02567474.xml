      This study evaluates the effectiveness of self management programs based on 5A model on the
      lung function status, dyspnea and exercise tolerance in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      patients. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group.
      The control group were receiving standard practice care and the intervention group were
      receiving intervention in addition to standard practice care. The intervention content
      include implementation of a self management plan based on 5A model.

      5 A model implemented during a period of 12 weeks including 5 stags: assessment of behavior,
      beliefs and motivation of the patient (Assess); provide information about personal health
      risks and benefits of change (Advise); mutual contribution of patients and health care
      provider on setting realistic goals based on the patient's interest and confidence in their
      ability to change the behavior (Agree); help anticipate barriers and develop practical
      applications based on the identified patient's strategies, problem-solving techniques and
      social/environmental support (Assist) and specify plan for follow-up (Visits, Phone calls)
      and providing support in the course of follow up (Arrange).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>dyspnea severity measured by dyspnea Borg scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>dyspnea was measured by dyspnea Borg scale. This scale is visual tool ranging from 0(not dyspnea) to 10(maximum dyspnea).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>exercise tolerance rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>exercise tolerance was measured by Six Minutes Walking Test.in this test the distance that each patient was able to walk under standard condition in 6 minutes was measured by researchers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>lung function status measured by spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>lung function was measured by spirometry. Spirometry is a test that measures how an individual inhales or exhales volumes of air as a function of time</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>quality of life was measured by SF-36 Questionnaire. It consisted of 36 questions that examine the eight quality of life dimensions, each question has a continuous quantitative scale from 0 to 100, in which higher scores indicate better situation.</description>
