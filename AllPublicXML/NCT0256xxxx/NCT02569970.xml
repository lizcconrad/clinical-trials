  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a tragic outcome of seizure disorders that
      primarily affect young adults suffering from refractory epilepsy. In this population, SUDEP
      incidence is estimated at 0.5%. While the mechanisms of SUDEP are not completely understood,
      it appears that the majority of such death occurs in the immediate aftermath of a general
      tonic-clonic seizure.

      There is currently no validated preventive treatment for SUDEP. Some evidence suggest that
      modulation of the serotoninergic tone, and more specifically selective serotonin recapture
      inhibitor (SSRI) such as fluoxetine, might prevent SUDEP. Indeed, fluoxetine prevents
      seizure-induced lethal central apneas in DBA/2 and DBA/1 mice, one of the few animal models
      of SUDEP. Furthermore, serotoninergic bulbar nuclei are known to play a major role in the
      control of breathing, especially during sleep and in response to repeated hypoxia.

      In patients with epilepsy undergoing in-hospital video-EEG monitoring, about one third of
      seizures are associated with decrease in SpO2 &lt;90%, an abnormality suspected to represent a
      risk factor of SUDEP. In a retrospective uncontrolled study, patients treated with SSRIs
      displayed less frequent ictal/post-ictal hypoxemia than patients not taking SSRIs.

      The investigators project aimed at testing whether fluoxetine can reduce the risk of
      ictal/post-ictal hypoxemia by performing a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      in patients undergoing video-EEG monitoring as part of the pre-surgical evaluation of their
      focal drug-resistant epilepsy.
