  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to use sensors to monitor physiological signals, sleep patterns, vocal
      characteristics, activity, location and phone usage in study patients with depression who are
      receiving standard treatment (compared with healthy controls).

    <description>We will measure the heart rate at baseline and during the treatment period. We will compare the corresponding patterns in patients with depression, as well as in healthy controls.</description>

    <measure>Phone Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the cell-phone usage (in the form of texts, web browsing, and phone calls) at the beginning of the study and during the treatment period. We will compare the corresponding phone usage patterns in patients with depression, as well as in healthy controls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Voice Characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the voice characteristics (via reading a 30-second script as part of an audio diary) at the beginning of the study and during the treatment period. We will compare the corresponding voice characteristics in patients with depression, as well as in healthy controls.</description>

    <description>Wearable biosensors can play an important role in depression diagnosis. For this study, we will use a cost-effective, unobtrusive, and non-stigmatizing sensor to monitor physiological signals (including heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), physical activity, and temperature).</description>
