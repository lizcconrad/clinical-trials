  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that affects a growing proportion of the population.
      There is currently no treatment to halt this process. The aim of the research is in
      particular to find treatments targeting the molecular origins of osteoarthritis focusing
      especially on the inflammatory component of the disease. That is why research is looking to
      the development of preventive treatments like nutraceuticals. This project aims to determine
      the anti-inflammatory properties of sera of patients who received supplementation of their
      diet with an extract of grape and olive: the Oléogrape®SEED. Sera and synovial fluid will be
      collected during visits for hyaluronic acid injections in OA patients. These sera will be
      tested in vitro in a model of inflamed chondrocytes.
