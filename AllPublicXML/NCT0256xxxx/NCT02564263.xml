  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell
      carcinoma of the esophagus or Siewert type I adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction
      (EGJ) that has progressed after first-line standard therapy will be randomized to receive
      either single agent pembrolizumab or the Investigator's choice of standard therapy with
      paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan. The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with
      pembrolizumab will prolong overall survival (OS) as compared to treatment with standard
      therapy.

      This study will enroll 2 cohorts: the global cohort and the China cohort. The global cohort
      will enroll 600 participants and enrollment for the China cohort will contribute to this
      total. Enrollment will be extended for the China cohort until 120 participants are enrolled
      in this cohort. The China enrollment extension may extend the study approximately 2 years.
