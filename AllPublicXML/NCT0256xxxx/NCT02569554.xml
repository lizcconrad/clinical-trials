  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will be conducted in healthy adult subjects to evaluate the effect of
      proton pump inhibitor and food on pharmacokinetics of PF-06463922, to evaluate the
      bioavailability of the oral solution relative to the tablet formulation of PF-06463922.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PF-06463922 is a selective, ATP competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of
      the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positive (ALK+) or ROS oncogene 1 (ROS1) positive
      (ROS1+) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that also potently inhibits ALK kinase domain
      mutations responsible for resistance to crizotinib. PF-06463922 is being developed as a novel
      anticancer agent for the treatment of patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC or ROS1+ NSCLC.

      The current study is a Phase 1, randomized, open label, 4 period, 4 treatment, 4 sequence,
      crossover study conducted in healthy adult subjects. Each subject will receive four single
      oral doses of 100 mg PF-06463922 as tablets alone, tablets with food, tablets with
      rabeprazole, and oral solution after overnight fasting with at least a 10 day washout period
      between each PF-06463922 dose.

      Twenty four (24) subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 20 evaluable subjects who
      complete all treatments. Subjects who withdraw will not be replaced unless the total number
      of completed subjects falls below 20.
