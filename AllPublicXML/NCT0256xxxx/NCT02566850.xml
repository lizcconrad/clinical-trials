    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to study the safety and health effects of using the Ekso Bionics
      powered exoskeleton device in a home setting over a 12-36 month period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 36 month exploratory Investigational Study compliant with the NSF Human Subjects
      regulations (45 CFR 690) trialing a new device for the SCI populations to aid in ambulatory
      function in a home setting. Ekso Bionics will enable up to twelve (12) subjects with SCI to
      use an Ekso device in their home for a 12-month period. Qualified subjects will help Ekso
      Bionics determine the practical use of the device in the home environment and will enable
      Ekso Bionics to gather data to develop a device for use in a home environment. The study will
      require a trained spotter to be present at all times that the device is being used. The study
      will also evaluate the effectiveness of a non-medically licensed spotter to assist the
      subject.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  be an experienced user of the Ekso device with a minimum of 20 hours and no more than
             50 hours of device use and require no greater than minimal assist (support of up to
             25% body weight) for safe and consistent walking.

          -  no more than 2 episodes of balance loss per 1 hour training session that require no
             more than moderate assistance (support of 26% to 50% of body weight)

          -  participants with more than 50 hours of device experience must agree to a 1 month
             period of non-use prior to acquisition of baseline measures

          -  be between 18-65 years of age.

          -  be able to physically fit into the exoskeleton device.

          -  be able to tolerate upright standing for up to 60 minutes.

          -  have sufficient joint range of motion to fit safely within Ekso: Hip flexion
             contracture ≤ 15o; knee flexion contracture ≤ 10o; ankle dorsiflexion to neutral with
             no more than 10o of knee flexion.

          -  have sufficient upper body strength to balance themselves with two arms

          -  be fluent in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Height below 60 inches or above 76 inches or with physical characteristics
             incompatible with device and testing procedure.

          -  Weight above 220 lbs.

          -  Lower extremity joint contractures that exceed device capacity for safe use.

          -  Any medical issue that precludes full weight bearing and ambulation (e.g. osteoporosis
             that prevents safe standing, orthopedic injuries, pain, severe spasticity)

          -  Skin integrity issues that would prevent wearing the device.

          -  Cognitive and/or communicative disability inappropriate for testing as determined by
             Ekso Bionics clinician. Subjects must be able to follow directions well and
             demonstrate learning capability.

          -  Pregnancy (Self-reported)

          -  Colostomy
