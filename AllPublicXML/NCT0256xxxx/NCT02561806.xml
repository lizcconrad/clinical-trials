    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a ≥90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs). For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0 (0%) to 6 (90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling with a scores range from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored by itself and the scores were then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI calculated as: sum of severity parameters for each region * area score * weighing factor [head (0.1), upper limbs (0.2), trunk (0.3), lower limbs (0.4)]. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) (0,1) With at Least a 2-Point Improvement From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is the physician's determination of the participant's Ps lesions overall at a given time point. Lesions were categorized by descriptions for induration, erythema, and scaling. Participants Ps were assessed as 0 (clear), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe), or 5 (very severe). An sPGA responder was defined as having a post-baseline sPGA score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of fingernail(fn) Ps. This scale is used to evaluate severity of fn bed Ps &amp; fn matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fn unit. fn is divided with imaginary horizontal &amp; longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fn is given a score for fn bed Ps 0(none) to 4(Ps in 4 quadrants of the fn) &amp; fn matrix Ps 0(none) to 4(Ps in 4 quadrants in matrix), depending on presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fn bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant.NAPSI score of a fn is sum of scores in fn bed &amp; fn matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fn is evaluated, then the sum of all fn equals the total NAPSI score with a range from range 0 to 80. Higher scores indicate more severe ps.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized measure of health status used to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L consists of a descriptive system of the respondent's health which comprises the following 5 dimensions: 1) mobility 2) self-care 3) usual activities 4) pain/discomfort 5) anxiety/depression. The Bolt On PSO is an addition to the EQ-5D-5L that consists of 2 dimensions specific to psoriatic disease: 6) skin irritation (itching) and 7) self-confidence. Index scores for the Bolt On PSO range from 0.0042 to 1.0 (worse to better health).

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions, each with 5 levels. The EQ-5D-5L health states were converted into a single summary index by applying a crosswalk using a UK Population value set to each of the levels in each dimension. This produced patient-level index scores between -0.594 and 1.0 (worse to better health).

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a ≥75% Improvement in PASI (PASI 75) From Baseline</title>
          <description>The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs). For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0 (0%) to 6 (90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling with a scores range from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored by itself and the scores then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI calculated as: sum of severity parameters for each region * area score * weighing factor [head (0.1), upper limbs (0.2), trunk (0.3), lower limbs (0.4)]. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had a post-baseline measurement for PASI 75. Participants who did not meet the clinical response criteria or had missing data at Week 12 were considered non-responders for Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Total Score</title>
        <description>NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of fingernail(fn) Ps. This scale is used to evaluate severity of fn bed Ps &amp; fn matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fn unit. fn is divided with imaginary horizontal &amp; longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fn is given a score for fn bed Ps 0(none) to 4(Ps in 4 quadrants of the fn) &amp; fn matrix Ps 0(none) to 4(Ps in 4 quadrants in matrix), depending on presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fn bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant.NAPSI score of a fn is sum of scores in fn bed &amp; fn matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fn is evaluated, then the sum of all fn equals the total NAPSI score with a range from range 0 to 80. Higher scores indicate more severe ps.

        <description>The DLQI is a simple, participant-administered, 10 question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Response categories include &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;a lot,&quot; and &quot;very much,&quot; with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and unanswered (&quot;not relevant&quot;) responses scored as &quot;0.&quot; Totals range from 0 to 30 (less to more impairment). A score of 0 or 1 indicates no impact of disease on a participants quality of life.</description>

        <description>The European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized measure of health status used to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L consists of a descriptive system of the respondent's health which comprises the following 5 dimensions: 1) mobility 2) self-care 3) usual activities 4) pain/discomfort 5) anxiety/depression. The Bolt On PSO is an addition to the EQ-5D-5L that consists of 2 dimensions specific to psoriatic disease: 6) skin irritation (itching) and 7) self-confidence. Index scores for the Bolt On PSO range from 0.0042 to 1.0 (worse to better health).
