      This is a phase II, open-label clinical trial. This clinical trial has as primary objective
      to evaluate changes in EEG of a Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS) treatment protocol for
      elderly patients with moderate / severe depressive episode.

    <description>TNS will be applied by the external simulator (Monarch). The stimulation will be conducted at a frequency of 120 Hz with pulse duration of 250 microseconds. The current intensity will be individually established and should be equivalent to a slight feeling of not painful paresthesia .The stimulus generates a pulse and asymmetric biphasic waveform. Electrodes (25cm2) will be placed on the forehead just above the supraorbital foramen bilaterally. The study protocol will follow the rational of our previous trials with TNS.</description>
