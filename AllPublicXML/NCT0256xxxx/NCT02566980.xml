    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to define and measure biological processes that contribute to the
      underlying pathophysiologic process of peri-partum depression to be used for identifying
      those at risk for developing it. This knowledge may also generate novel drug targets for
      peripartum depression that may be applicable to other types of depression.

      This study analyses the role of inflammation and metabolites of inflammation in perinatal
      depression. Psychiatric assessments of depression and suicidality will be compared to blood
      levels of two metabolites of inflammation, quinolinic acid (QUIN) and picolinic acid (PIC),
      that might regulate nerve cell communication. The levels of these metabolites are regulated
      by kynurenine pathway enzymes.

      Psychiatric symptoms, inflammatory cytokines and levels of the metabolites will be measured
      throughout pregnancy. Additionally, the investigators are gathering placentas at delivery and
      determining the degree of inflammation in the tissue in the investigators' laboratory.
      Inflammatory biomarkers, antibody titers, and key kynurenine pathway enzymes and metabolites
      from pre- and post partum women, placenta, and cord blood will be measured.
