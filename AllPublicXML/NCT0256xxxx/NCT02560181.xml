  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is considered a standard treatment option for the management of localized
      prostate cancer. Among the 20-30% of patients who recur, there is no consensus on the optimal
      salvage therapy. Salvage options available for isolated local recurrence include; temporary
      or permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate, complete removal of the
      prostate gland, use of low temperatures to treat the disease (cryotherapy), and high
      frequency ultrasound to treat the disease. There are risks of complications associated with
      all these treatments, and there is presently no consensus as to which treatment is the best.
      The aim of this pilot study is to look at the feasibility and toxicities of whole gland
      salvage treatment of the prostate using temporary implantation of radioactive seeds into the
      prostate.

      The aim of this pilot study is to look at the feasibility and toxicities of whole gland
      salvage treatment of the prostate using temporary implantation of radioactive seeds into the
      prostate. Reports of the efficacy and toxicities of whole gland salvage HDR brachytherapy for
      local recurrence after external beam radiation therapy are limited to single-institution
      studies with small sample sizes. Given that our institution has the highest volume of
      prostate brachytherapy cases in Ontario and that we receive a significant number of referrals
      from other cancer centres for brachytherapy, this study will aim to add to the literature and
      help guide salvage therapy practice within our institution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy confirmed locally recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma &gt; 30mths after completion
             of XRT by stereotactic transperineal biopsy

          -  Staging T2-weighted, DWI- and DCE- MRI that demonstrates recurrence confined to
             prostate, and correlates with stereotactic transperineal biopsy

          -  Previous external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer with standard/conventional
             fractionation (1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction), or moderate hypofractionation (2.4-3.4 Gy per
             fraction).

          -  Staging CT or MRI (abdomen and pelvis) and bone scan are negative for metastases

          -  IPSS &lt; 15

          -  Baseline (post XRT) serum PSA &lt; 10ng/mL

          -  Prostate volume as measured by TRUS &lt; 50cc

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease adjacent to the urethra as visible on MRI

          -  Any of the following prior therapies; TURP, radionuclide prostate brachytherapy,
             prostatectomy or prostatic cryosurgery, HIFU, bilateral orchiectomy, chemotherapy for
             prostatic carcinoma

          -  Evidence of castrate resistance (defined as PSA &gt; 3ng/mL while testosterone is &lt;
             1.7nmol/L) Patients could have been on combined androgen blockade with initial XRT but
             are excluded if this was started due to PSA progression
