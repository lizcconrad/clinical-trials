  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of oxycodone is well characterized in children older than six months of
      age. However, only one study has been published with children younger than six months,
      concluding that unexplained inter-individual variability is pronounced in the youngest
      children. The aim of the current study was to quantify oxycodone pharmacokinetics in children
      ranging from preterm newborn infants to children up to two years of age.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants scheduled for surgery with planned perioperative or postoperative opioid
             analgesia were screened if the gestational age (GA) was at least 23 weeks and
             postnatal age (PNA) below 2 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  He/she had allergy or hypersensitivity to oxycodone or other ingredients in the
             formulations or had received monoamineoxidase, CYP3A (cytochrome P450 3A enzymes) or
             CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme) inhibitors during the previous month or other
             reason that was considered to contraindicate participation.
