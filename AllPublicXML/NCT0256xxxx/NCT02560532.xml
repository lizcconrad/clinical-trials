  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and potential therapeutic benefit of use
      of clazosentan in reversing cerebral vasospasm (a narrowing of blood vessels in the brain due
      to the presence of blood in the space around the brain) in patients who have suffered a
      condition known as aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by bleeding onto the surface of
      the brain from a ruptured brain aneurysm

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is characterized by bleeding onto the brain surface
      due to a rupture of a pouch or bulge in a brain vessel (called an aneurysm). It is a rare but
      serious condition with a high risk of death. Even patients who have had successful repair of
      the aneurysm remain at risk for developing cerebral vasospasm, which can result in harmful
      conditions related to the lack of oxygen to parts of the brain and death. Cerebral vasospasm
      usually occurs within the first couple of weeks after aSAH, and it is difficult to treat.
      Currently there is no safe, efficacious and widely available treatment. Previous animal
      studies have shown that a new drug under investigation, clazosentan, was able to reverse
      cerebral vasospasm in animal models of SAH. A first trial conducted in a small number of
      patients showed some benefit of clazosentan in reversing established cerebral vasospasm after
      aSAH. Clazosentan has already been evaluated in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm in
      several large clinical trials in aSAH. This current study aims to evaluate if clazosentan is
      effective and safe in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after aSAH.

          -  Signed informed consent from the subject or proxy/legal representative

          -  Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH)confirmed by digital subtraction angiogram
             (DSA) or computed tomography angiogram (CTA), successfully secured by surgical
             clipping or endovascular coiling within 72 hours of rupture

          -  World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade 1-4 at admission, and which
             must not increase to grade 5 at the time of enrollment

          -  Moderate or severe global cerebral vasospasm at the time of enrollment, documented by
             digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed not earlier than 48 hours post
             aneurysm-securing procedure

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
