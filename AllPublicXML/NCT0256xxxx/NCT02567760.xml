  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is set up to determine the cognitive enhancing effect and consumption safety of
      the novel cognitive enhancement product made from the combined extract of Z. mays (purple
      color) and P. amaryllifolius based-drink (MP1) in menopausal volunteer.

      Memory impairment is one of the common health problems in menopausal women. Due to the
      therapeutic efficiency limitation, the searching for the protective intervention for this
      condition is required. Based on the previous findings that the combined extract of Z. mays
      (purple color) and P. amaryllifolius based-drink (MP1) could attenuate memory impairment in
      animal model of menopause, the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of MP1
      functional drink on working memory, psychological fitness, possible underlying mechanism and
      the consumption safety in menopausal volunteers.

    <description>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter for learning and memory.The activity of AChE enzyme in serum is measured by using the biochemical assay method and the result is express as mmol/min.g protein. The lower activity of AChE is the better cognitive enhancing effect of the intervention.</description>
