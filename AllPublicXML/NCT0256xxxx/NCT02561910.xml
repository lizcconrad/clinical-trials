  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair still remains unclear. During a one
      year period a total of 1208 inguinal hernias in 952 patients were consecutively operated
      using the laparoscopic technique by a total of 11 general surgeons in daily clinical routine.

      Laparoscopic hernia repair in the TAPP technique seems to have the potential to become the
      standard procedure in inguinal hernia repair in future.

      Objective:

      Hernia repair is the most frequent operation in general surgery worldwide, but about 25 years
      after the advent of minimal invasive surgical techniques the effectiveness of laparoscopic
      inguinal hernia repair still remains unclear.

      Methods:

      All patients admitted to the hospital for surgery of an inguinal hernia during a one year
      period were prospectively documented and included in a follow-up study. The follow-up was
      performed at least 5 years after surgery and consisted of a clinical examination, ultrasound
      investigation and a questionnaire.
