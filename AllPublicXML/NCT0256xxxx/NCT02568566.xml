    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually-transmitted virus which causes infections
      that usually last only a few months, but sometimes can last a long time and cause cancers of
      the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus or oropharynx over many years among adults. This phase IIA
      trial studies how well does the nonavalent HPV vaccine (which can prevent nine different
      types of HPV) work when given in an alternative dosing schedule to heathy young research
      participants.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the persistence and stability of serologic geometric mean titer (GMT) of HPV
      16/18 between 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the prime dose and prior to the administration
      of the second dose.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the persistence and stability of serologic GMT of HPV types
      6/11/31/33/45/52/58 between 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after prime dose and prior to the
      administration of the second dose.

      II. To assess safety and reactogenicity to each vaccine dose.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly (IM)
      at baseline (priming injection) and at 24 and 30 months (booster injections).

      After completion of study, participants are followed up for 2 weeks.

    <description>A one-sided paired t test will be performed to compare the difference in the mean of the log-transformed antibody levels between 6 and 12 months, between 12 and 18 months, and between 18 and 24 months, respectively, to evaluate whether the GMT at 12/18/24 months, respectively, is not inferior to the GMT at 6/12/18 months. Percentage of participants whose type-specific antibody levels decrease, increase, or remain stable between the 6 and 12 month study visits, between the 12 and 18 month study visits, and between the18 month and 24 month study visits will be reported along with the associated 95% confidence interval.</description>
