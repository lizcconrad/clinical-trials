  <brief_summary>

      Background: Endocrine therapy is the standard treatment for hormone receptor positive breast
      cancer. However, both primary and acquired resistance occurs, and better strategies to
      improve treatment outcome and overcome resistance are urgently needed. There is known cross
      talk between RET and ER, and preclinical studies have suggested that combining a RET
      inhibitor with endocrine therapy may improve cell kill in breast cancer cell lines.

      Aim: To determine the safe dose of lenvatinib that can be co-administered with letrozole in a
      phase Ib study, followed by a phase II study to determine the efficacy of lenvatinib +
      letrozole in post-menopausal patients newly diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast
      cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.

      Methods: Eligible patients will be treated with 2 weeks of single agent lenvatinib, followed
      by 12 weeks of lenvatinib + letrozole. Blood and tumor samples will be obtained from the
      patient serially to study tumor and host factors that may influence drug efficacy and
      toxicity.

      Importance of the proposed research: The combination of lenvatinib + letrozole may improve
      the treatment response in some ER+ breast cancers. The study will seek to identify biomarkers
      (eg tumor RET expression) that may select patients most likely to benefit from the
      combination therapy.

      Potential benefits and risks: The combination may improve treatment response. Adding
      lenvatinib may increase treatment risks, but these will be monitored closely. Pharmacokinetic
      analyses will also be performed to determine the drug levels achieved in the patients, and
      correlate that with treatment toxicity and efficacy.

      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among females in Singapore and worldwide. Approximately
      60-70% of breast cancers are hormone receptor positive and thus potentially sensitive to
      endocrine therapy. However, both primary and acquired resistance to endocrine therapy exists,
      and better combinations are constantly being explored to delay endocrine resistance and
      improve treatment outcome. Several known mechanisms of endocrine resistance have been
      proposed, and include deregulation of various components of the ER pathway itself,
      alterations in cell cycle and cell survival signaling molecules, and the activation of escape
      pathways that can provide tumors with alternative proliferative and survival stimuli.

      Endocrine blockade in breast cancer can be achieved by reducing the levels of estrogens
      through ovarian ablation (medical, surgical, or through radiation) in pre-menopausal women or
      with the administration of aromatase inhibitors in post-menopausal women. Direct inhibition
      of estrogen receptors can be achieved by administering selective estrogen receptor
      modulators, such as tamoxifen, or a pure estrogen receptor antagonist such as fulvestrant. In
      post-menopausal women with advanced breast cancer, current standard first-line endocrine
      therapy comprises of a reversible aromatase inhibitor such as letrozole or anastrozole. Other
      endocrine therapy options in advanced breast cancers include a irreversible aromatase
      inhibitor (exemestane), tamoxifen, megestrol acetate, and more novel combinations of an
      aromatase inhibitor with fulvestrant (combined estrogen blockade), exemestane combined with
      an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus), or letrozole combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib).

      RET is an estrogen response gene, and preclinical studies have demonstrated cross talk
      between RET and ER. Significant interactions between RET and ERa pathways have been
      described, with increased response to estrogen stimulation observed in the presence of
      functional RET. RET is associated with resistance to tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, and
      increased RET expression has been demonstrated in hormone resistant cell lines and primary
      tumors. Combined anti-estrogen and anti-RET therapy in luminal breast cancer had a greater
      effect on cell growth than either therapy alone. The two classes of drugs have different
      mechanisms of action; a RET TKI reduced growth through induction of apoptosis, while anti-ERa
      reduced cell proliferation, forming the biologic basis for dual treatment. Dual therapy with
      tamoxifen and vandetinib, a RET inhibitor, resulted in greater reduction in tumor growth rate
      in MCF7 xenografts in mice. RET has been reported to be over-expressed in up to 75% of ER+
      breast cancers (n=20), compared to only 10% of ER-negative breast cancers (n=10) in a small
      study.

    <description>Single agent lenvatinib daily continuously x 2 weeks, followed by letrozole 2.5mg daily + lenvatinib x 12 weeks. Lumpectomy or mastectomy should be considered after completing 14 weeks of pre-operative lenvatinib + letrozole for curative intent in non-metastatic patients and for local control for patients with metastatic disease. If surgery is planned, it should preferably be performed within 2-12 weeks after completing neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and after toxicities (if any) from the neoadjuvant endocrine therapy have resolved. If the patient is deemed inoperable after 14 weeks of lenvatinib + letrozole, a final biopsy will be obtained, and the patient discontinued from the study and treated as per standard clinical practice by the treating physician.</description>
