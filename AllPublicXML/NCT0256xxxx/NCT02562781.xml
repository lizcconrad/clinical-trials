    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing vascular surgery are at a significantly high risk of perioperative
      cardiovascular, cerebral and renal events compared to those undergoing non-vascular surgery.
      This could be because of co-morbidities that are common in this patient group. Additionally,
      smoking, which is common in this population, may be a contributing factor.

      Oxygen therapy has been used for decades in order to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction
      and stroke in patients undergoing vascular surgery and pre-existing co-morbidities in the
      belief that increased inspired oxygen increases oxygen delivery to tissues, thereby reducing
      the risk for hypoxia and cell death. However, several studies published recently have
      questioned the routine use of high inspired oxygen concentration (hyperoxia) to improve
      oxygen delivery, specifically in the neonatal period but possibly even following myocardial
      infarction. This could be explained by the fact that increasing inspired concentrations of
      oxygen cause vasoconstriction in cerebral and coronary arteries, thereby reducing blood flow.
      Additionally, increased oxygen causes excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
      and repercussion injury from oxidative stress. The latter can lead to apoptosis (cell death)
      in myocardial or cerebral neurons. Despite the high risks of administering oxygen when not
      needed, it is routinely used in hospitals all over the world without a doctors prescription.

      This study aims to assess peri-operative complications up to 1 year following vascular
      surgery in patients randomised to receive high inspired oxygen concentration (endpoint: SpO2
      98 - 100%) or minimal inspired O2 concentration (endpoint: SpO2 &gt; 90%).

      Oxygen is probably one of the commonest &quot;non-prescription&quot; drug used in the hospital and its
      advantage in several situations including carbon monoxide poisoning, central hypoxia and
      prior to planned intubation in an acute situation are today well-established and commonly
      used. Oxygen has been frowned upon in the resuscitation of newborn babies because of the risk
      of retrolental hypoplasia, now well accepted and adopted in clinical practice. Oxygen has
      also been traditionally used to increase oxygen carrying capacity in patients presenting with
      an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), to reduce surgical site infections (SSI), to ensure
      adequate oxygen delivery to tissues in unconscious patients, during cardiac surgery and for
      postoperative management, specifically after major surgery. Thus, deliberate use of high
      inspiratory oxygen concentrations (e.g., 80% or above) is recommended in the treatment of
      specific intoxications, such as with carbon monoxide or cyanide, wherein hyperbaric oxygen
      should also be considered. In addition, a high oxygen fraction has been suggested to prevent
      adverse outcomes after surgery and anesthesia, including a reduction in wound infections and
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). In critically ill patients, oxygen delivery to the
      tissues is often compromised, and supplemental oxygen (e.g., face mask with 10 L oxygen per
      min) is commonly administered to patients with pneumonia, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, or
      stroke - in fact, it is estimated that oxygen is given during transport in approximately
      one-third of all ambulance journeys.

      Several reports published recently have questioned many of the &quot;routine&quot; uses of oxygen and
      some evidence even seems to point towards negative outcomes in some of these conditions.
      Specifically, excessive oxygen is likely to do more harm than good in the neonatal period,
      following cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and likely following acute myocardial infarction.
      Prospective, randomised studies on this important use of oxygen in the preoperative string
      are, however, lacking in the literature and in view of theoretical risks for hyperoxemia to
      several organs, the routine use of high oxygen fractions during the peri-operative phase can
      be questioned.

      This study aims to assess peri-operative complications up to 1 year following vascular
      surgery in patients randomised to receive high inspired oxygen concentration (endpoint: SpO2
      98 - 100%) or minimal inspired O2 concentration (endpoint: SpO2 &gt; 90%).
