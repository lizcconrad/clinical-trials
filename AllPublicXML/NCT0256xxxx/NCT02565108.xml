  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of 2 parts: a double-blinded phase and an open-label extension phase. The
      blinded phase only will be described in this record. Participants will be randomized in a 4:1
      ratio to receive GWP42003-P or matching placebo. The hypothesis is that levels of clobazam
      (CLB) and its major metabolite (N-CLB) may be altered (increased or decreased) as a result of
      using GWP42003-P.

          -  Participant has received an IMP within the 12 weeks prior to the screening visit.

          -  Participant has significantly impaired hepatic function at the screening or
             randomization visit, defined as any of the following:

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 5 × upper
                  limit of normal (ULN).
