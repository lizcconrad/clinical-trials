      The purpose of the study is to provide access to continued treatment for subjects who
      participated in other Astellas sponsored ASP2215 trials that completed the primary analysis
      and for whom the Investigator feels may have potential to continue to derive clinical benefit
      from the treatment with ASP2215, and who did not meet any of the study discontinuation
      criteria in the present study.
