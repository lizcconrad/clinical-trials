    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the independent effects of both a 4-Factor prothrombin
      complex concentrate (PCC) - (Kcentra) and Tranexamic acid (TXA) on the bleeding parameters
      (bleeding duration and blood volume) following a punch biopsy, in addition to assessing their
      effects on the anticoagulant/pharmacodynamic (prothrombin time and endogenous thrombin
      potential) changes induced by rivaroxaban at steady state, to better understand their
      potential role in bleeding reversal.

    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part, single center study to be conducted in healthy men and women. Part 1
      (open-label) consists of Screening Phase (within 28 days before admission into the study
      center on Day -1), followed by a 3 day treatment period and a follow-up visit on Day 8. A
      single oral 20 milligram (mg) dose of rivaroxaban will be administered on Day 1.
      Pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and punch biopsy parameters will be assessed.
      Part 2 (double-blind) consists of Screening Phase (within 28 days before admission into the
      study center on Day -1), followed by a 8 day treatment period (Day -1 to Day 7) and a
      follow-up visit on Day 11. Rivaroxaban (20 mg every 12 hrs) will be administered on Days 1
      through 3 and single 20 mg dose will be given on the morning of Day 4. A single dose of
      either 4-factor PCC, TXA or saline (Placebo) will be administered in a randomized, blinded
      fashion on Day 4. PK, PD, Exploratory Bio-markers and punch biopsy parameters will be
      assessed. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
