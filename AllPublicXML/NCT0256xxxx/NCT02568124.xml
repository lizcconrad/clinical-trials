      BACKGROUND Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most frequent reasons for cranial
      neurosurgical consult. There is no widely accepted medical treatment for CSDH.

      This trial will investigate whether Tranexamic Acid (TXA) can increase the rate of CSDH
      resolution following conservative management, lower the number of required surgical
      procedures and decrease the rate of CSDH recurrence following surgical evacuation. TRACS is a
      double blind, randomized, parallel-design, placebo-controlled, phase IIB study designed to
      provide preliminary efficacy data as well as feasibility, safety and incidence data required
      to plan a larger definitive phase III trial.

      METHODS Consecutive patients presenting at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke
      with a recent (&lt; 14 days) diagnosis of subdural hematoma with a chronic component will be
      screened for eligibility. Exclusion criteria include specific risk factors for thromboembolic
      disease, anticoagulant use or contraindication to TXA. A total of 130 patients will be
      randomized to receive either 750 mg of TXA daily or placebo until complete radiological
      resolution of the CSDH or for a maximum of 20 weeks. CSDH volume will be measured on serial
      CT scanning. Cognitive function tests, quality of life questionnaires as well as functional
      autonomy assessments will be performed at enrollment, 10 weeks follow-up and 3 months
      post-treatment follow-up. During the treatment period, patients will undergo standard CSDH
      management with surgery being performed at the discretion of the treating physician. If
      surgery is performed, the CSDH and its outer membrane will be sampled for in vitro analysis.

      The primary outcome is the rate of CSDH resolution at 20 weeks without intervening unplanned
      surgical procedure. Secondary outcomes include CSDH volume, incidence of surgical evacuation
      procedures, CSDH recurrence, cognitive functions, functional autonomy, quality of life,
      incidence of complications and length of hospital stay. Planned subgroup analyses will be
      performed for conservatively vs surgically-managed subjects and highly vs poorly vascularised
      CSDH.

      DISCUSSION CSDH is a frequent and morbid condition for which an effective medical treatment
      has yet to be discovered. The TRACS trial will be the first prospective study of TXA for
      CSDH.

    <description>The rate of chronic subdural hematoma resolution without intervening unplanned surgical procedure. Specifically, if the initial management strategy chosen by the attending physician within the first 24 hours of presentation consists of expectant management, any surgical procedure leads to a failure of meeting the primary outcome. On the other hand, if the management strategy chosen by the attending physician within the first 24 hours of presentation included a surgical evacuation of the CSDH, the primary outcome is met if the control CT scan at 20 weeks demonstrates a complete radiological resolution of the CSDH. Should a second surgery be required, the subject will fail to meet the primary outcome even if the CSDH has completely resolved by 20 weeks.</description>
