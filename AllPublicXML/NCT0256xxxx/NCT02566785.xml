      Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of a multi-component
      balance &amp; resistance training [RT] intervention on physical function, balance, &amp; falls in
      older [≥ 65 y/o] community dwelling heart failure [HF] patients. The study aims: 1] Pilot
      test multi-component balance activities &amp; RT intervention on primary outcomes. 2] Explore
      perceptions related to outcomes &amp; the intervention through focus groups. 3] Generate pilot
      data on adherence. 4] Generate pilot data on feasibility of conducting the BASIC Training
      intervention.

      Background/Significance: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths in this group.
      Fall risks are even greater for those with HF due to decreased exercise capacity, loss of
      skeletal muscle &amp; medication side effects. Though RT is effective for improving skeletal
      muscle, it has only a modest effect on improving balance, which is comprised of peripheral
      sensory input central integration, &amp; motor output. A multi-component intervention focusing on
      balance retraining &amp; strengthening the muscles supporting static/dynamic balance &amp; functional
      mobility is necessary.

      Methods: Design - Randomized, two-group with wait list control, repeated measures
      experimental design. Sample/ Setting - 40-50 participants recruited from medical center heart
      failure clinic; supervised group sessions conducted in center's health &amp; wellness center.
      Procedures - Participants will be randomized to intervention group or wait list control
      group. Focus groups pre/post intervention. The intervention will be administered in 1x per
      week supervised group sessions &amp; 2x a week home sessions. Instruments - 30 Second Sit-to-St&amp;,
      Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance, Activity Specific Balance
      Confidence Scale, Timed Up &amp; Go, Dynamic Gait Index.

      Analysis Plan: Aim 1- independent t-test to compare change scores from baseline to the end of
      the first 12 week period for the intervention group with the wait list control group. A
      second analysis will combine data from the delayed intervention period for the wait list
      control group with that from the first 12 week period for the intervention group to test
      change. Supplemental analysis, involving only data from intervention group, will test whether
      change is sustained at 24 weeks. Aim 2 - thematic analysis conducted with focus group data.
      Aim 3 - adherence assessed by group session attendance &amp; home activities completed. Aim 4 -
      assess &amp; report logistics of conducting the study.

      Nursing Relevance/Implications: This pilot study will initiate the process of developing a
      targeted intervention to induce changes in elderly HF patients to prevent future falls; thus
      reducing costs, physical &amp; emotional burdens related to falls; &amp; effect a major difference in
      the quality of life for this population.
