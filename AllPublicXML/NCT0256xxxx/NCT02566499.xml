    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to assess the ability of a recently developed Breast
      Microwave Imaging (BMI) system to detect abnormalities in a human breast. These trials will
      be performed by recruiting fourteen volunteers that have been diagnosed with breast
      abnormalities using x-ray mammography. The breast presenting the abnormality will be imaged
      using the BMI system in a controlled and comfortable environment. As this is a feasibility
      study of the technology, and has the main goal to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this
      technology. The data collected from this study will be used to: (1) evaluate the overall
      participant experience during the BMI imaging procedure, (2) optimize the design of the BMI
      imaging system (both hardware and software), (3) open discussions with other medical
      professionals (e.g. radiologists) about the clinical feasibility of this emerging diagnostic
      imaging modality.

      The Breast Microwave Imaging (BMI) system that will be used in this study is designed to
      detect breast abnormalities using low power microwave waveforms. The system is formed by
      three main components:

        1. Patient bed. The volunteer will be positioned in this bed in a prone position where with
           the breast to be imaged in a pendant position.

        2. Instrumentation rack. This component contains all the microwave instrumentation and
           motion mechanisms required to illuminate the breast using an ultrawide band waveform and
           record the responses from the breast structures.

        3. Control computer. This component is used to control the motion of the mechanical
           components of the system and to retrieve the responses from the breast structures from
           the microwave instruments and store them in an electronic format.

      The system takes between 7.5 to 10 minutes to collect a three dimensional dataset from a
      single breast.

      The BMI system used in the study operates in the frequency range of 20 megahertz (MHz) to 9
      gigahertz (GHz). Canadian safety limits for the interaction of these non-ionizing
      electromagnetic waves with humans are outlined in the Health Canada publication &quot;Safety Code
      6: Limits of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Energy in the Frequency Range
      from 3 kilohertz (kHz) to 300 GHz [1]. For unregulated environments, the Specific Absorption
      Rate (SAR) limit set by Health Canada is 1.6 W/Kg. In the system used in this study,
      radio-frequency energy is generated via the Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). If the VNA is set
      at its maximum output power, which is 3.2 milliwatt (mW), the power received at 5 cm from the
      antenna (which is the distance where the breast will be) was measured to be 890 microwatt,
      which would yield a SAR value of 0.0196 W/kg.
