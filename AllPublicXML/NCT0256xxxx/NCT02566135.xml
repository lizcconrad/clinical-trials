  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic Airway devices(SGAs) like I-Gel and C-LMA ( classic laryngeal mask airway ) have
      been used as a conduit for tracheal intubation using ventilating bougie. General Anaesthesia
      with tracheal intubation is one of the technique for giving anaesthesia. Tracheal intubation
      may become difficult sometimes and endangers patients life. Using SGAs as a conduit for
      tracheal intubation helps in securing airway. This will be further facilitated by using
      ventilating bougie, as it maintains oxygenation.

      SGAs have been used as a conduit for tracheal intubation using ventilating bougie. Patients
      were anaesthetised with intravenous induction agent, non-depolarising muscle relaxant and
      then SGAs were inserted. Two groups were compared. In group I : I-gel was inserted, its
      position was confirmed and then ventilating bougie was inserted through it. It's position was
      confirmed, then I-gel was removed , Endotracheal tube was railroaded over ventilating bougie
      and it's position was confirmed. In group C : C-LMA was inserted, its position was confirmed
      and then ventilating bougie was inserted through it. It's position was confirmed, then C-LMA
      was removed , Endotracheal tube was railroaded over ventilating bougie and it's position was
      confirmed.

    <description>Following general anaesthesia I-gel was inserted. After proper placement . ventilating bougie was inserted. Once it's placement is confirmed I-gel was removed keeping the ventilating bougie in situ. Then appropriate sized endotracheal tube was railroaded over ventilating bougie then it (v.bouggie) was removed . Proper placement of endotracheal tube was confirmed by bilateral equal chest excursion and air entry on auscultation, absence of gastric insuffflation sound over epigastrium and 'sine' wave on capnography. Maximum 3 attempts were allowed for I-gel, ventilating bougie and endotracheal tube.</description>

    <description>Following general anaesthesia C-LMA was inserted. Aftre proper placement ventilating bougie was inserted. It's placement was confirmed and C-LMA was removed after deflation of cuff keeping the ventilating bougie in situ. Then appropriate sized endotracheal tube was railroaded over ventilating bougie. It's placement was confirmed by bilateral equal air entry and chest excursion, absence of gastric insufflation sound over epigastrium and 'sine' wave on capnography.
