    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine a group of patients requiring helmet therapy (either
      patients with plagiocephaly or post-surgical patients) to compare outcomes of infants treated
      with the Hanger helmet (Hanger, Inc.) to outcomes of infants treated with the P Pod Helmet
      (Lorica Scientific, LLC). Currently both helmets are prescribed at CCHMC. The investigators'
      goal is to determine which helmet is more effective in skull remodeling and to standardize
      the investigators' care for these patient types.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of helmet therapy to correct abnormal head shape due to either positional
      plagiocephaly secondary to pressure on the posterior skull with infant position and furniture
      use or after minimally invasive surgery for craniosynostosis is currently the treatment of
      choice at Cincinnati Children's Hospital (CCHMC). Helmet treatment in children with
      positional plagiocephaly is initiated for infants between 4 and 9 months of age (at CCHMC).
      Helmet treatment for children undergoing surgery for craniosynostosis is initiated following
      endoscopic cranial vault and stip craniectomy surgery after swelling from the surgery has
      subsided (generally within two weeks of surgery). Treatment with helmet therapy has been
      shown to improve head shape in both patient diagnoses. There are two types of helmets
      available to the investigators' patients (Hanger Helmet and P Pod Helmet) and to date, no
      research has evaluated whether one helmet type is more efficient in reshaping the skull than
      the other type. The current study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by comparing the
      outcomes for infants treated with a Hanger Helmet to the outcomes for infants treated with a
      P Pod Helmet. The investigators will measure skull symmetry with a 3dMD camera and take
      routine cross lateral measurements with a caliper designed for this use. Infants
      participating in the study will be randomized using a computerized program, Minim.

    <description>RMA is measured by first taking a picture of the child's head with the helmet on with a 3dMD camera. RMS is a measurement unique to the 3dMD camera. RMS will be used to quantify symmetry by superimposing left and right quadrants and calculating the mean value of aggregate distances between surfaces.</description>

    <description>Craniosynostosis occurs when one or multiple sutures fuse too early. Several sutures may be fused alone or in combination. An open or endoscopic surgical procedure to open the suture(s) is necessary to allow for normal brain growth and development. After surgery a cranial remolding helmet is used to direct skull growth. Children with craniosynostosis will be treated with either the Hangar Helmet or the P-Pod helmet</description>
