    <textblock>
      This study is constituted of 2 parts:

      Part A: A total of 36 patients will be enrolled in part A. Each eligible subject will
      participate in two 14-day treatment periods with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion
      (CSII) of BioChaperone insulin lispro and insulin lispro (Humalog®, Eli Lilly and Company).
      Each treatment period consists of 10 treatment days under free living conditions (e.g. home /
      workplace) and under standardised conditions at the clinic. Various assessments for
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, pump compatibility, short-term efficacy and safety are
      performed on selected days, including:

        -  Mixed Meal Test (MMT), Day 1, Day 3, Day 12 and Day 14, that will assess the
           post-prandial glucose response for 6 hours after individualized standard meal (fixed
           nutrient ratio) ingestion and bolus administration via CSII.

        -  Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM), (Day 1 - 14) that will be used in blinded mode
           (i.e. neither subjects nor the investigators are aware of the sensor glucose values).

        -  Pump compatibility (Day 1 - 14): Subjects will continue CSII treatment with the
           Investigational Medicinal Products (IMP) during the outpatient periods.

      Part B: A total of 44 patients will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized to a 4-period
      cross-over study aiming at comparing the performance of BC Lispro and Humalog after a
      prandial bolus administration with two different CSII systems (Roche Accu-Chek® Spirit and
      Medtronic Paradigm® Veo™) or with a syringe. Pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, pump
      compatibility and safety will be analyzed.

      Each period will include a mixed meal tolerance test with a CSII device and a mixed meal
      tolerance test with the same dose of insulin administered with a syringe.
