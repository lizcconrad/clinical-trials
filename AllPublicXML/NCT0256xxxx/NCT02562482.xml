      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the
      safety and immunogenicity of a 2 injection vaccine Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and virus like
      particle vaccine (CHIKV VLP) in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 2-injection vaccine regimen with Chikungunya
      virus (CHIKV) and virus like particle vaccine (CHIKV VLP) in healthy adults.

      The hypothesis is that the vaccine regimen is safe and induces a neutralizing antibody
      response to CHIKV. The primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability of a
      2-injection investigational vaccine regimen of VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP at 20 mcg compared to
      placebo (PBS) in healthy adults in CHIKV endemic areas. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate neutralizing antibody response in vaccine recipients. The exploratory objectives
      relate to assessing incidence of CHIKV infection in vaccine and placebo recipients, as well
      as antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses during the study.

      The expected duration of time on the study per subject is approximately 72 weeks with
      vaccinations scheduled at Day 0 and Day 28.
