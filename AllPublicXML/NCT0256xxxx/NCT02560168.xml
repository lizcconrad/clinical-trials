      1. The MyoVista device is capable of detecting surface electrocardiogram signals and
           sensitive in detecting coronary artery disease compared to traditional computed
           tomography angiography (CTA)

        2. Electrophysiological signals at the cellular level of myocardium are related to specific
           patterns on the MyoVista device

        3. Changes in MyoVista device output and can indicative of future CAD outcomes and need for
           revascularization

      Background Myocardial ischemia is caused by myocardial oxygen supply and demand mismatch.
      Despite that coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of myocardial ischemia, the
      symptoms may occur even in the absence of significant CAD. One of the mechanisms suggested
      for myocardial ischemia in these patients is microvascular ischemia (i.e. mismatch in
      microscopic vessels), affecting the myocardium (i.e. heart muscle) at the cellular level.

      A novel electrocardiographic recording method, the iECG is capable of capturing and
      amplifying signals from the cellular level that are much lower biologic signals than those
      processed by a traditional electrocardiogram (ECG). These recordings focus on early detection
      of myocardial abnormalities by non-linear analysis of electrical activity and physiological
      phenomenon. This novel assessment might be capable of detecting subclinical myocardial
      dysfunction in a variety of heart diseases.

      Specific Aims

      Aim#1: Study the feasibility of detection of CAD using iECG compared to computed tomographic
      coronary angiography (CTA).

      Aim#2: Study the association between patterns of iECG and myocardial dysfunction in patients
      without CAD compared to echocardiography.

      Aim#3: Study the effect of changes in iECG output on future outcomes of CAD and need for
      revascularization.

    <measure>Change in coronary plaque burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in coronary plaque burden at 3 months compared to baseline. Coronary plaque burden will be assessed by assigning a score (0 to 5) according to the SCCT guidelines (0, Normal: absence of plaque and no luminal stenosis; 1, Minimal: plaque with &lt;25% stenosis; 2, Mild: 25% to 49% stenosis; 3, Moderate: 50%to 69% stenosis; 4, Severe: 70% to 99% stenosis; 5, Complete occlusion)</description>

    <measure>Myocardial wall motion score index (WMSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Myocardial wall motion score index (WMSI) will be obtained by dividing the left ventricle into 16 segments7. Each of the segments will be assigned a score that is based on myocardial thickening (1 for Normal or hyperkinetic, 2 for hypokinetic, 3 for akinetic, 4 for dyskinesis, 5 for aneurysmal dilatation). WMSI will be calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of segments visualized.</description>
