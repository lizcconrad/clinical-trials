      The investigators hypothesis is that upper airway collapsibility (Pcrit) in patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be measured using equipment found in the clinical sleep
      laboratory and these Pcrit measurements obtained using clinical sleep laboratory equipment is
      comparable to those obtained using research equipment. OSA is a common disease characterized
      by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, leading to hypoxemia and arousals,
      and which has important neurocognitive and cardiovascular consequences. The single most
      important factor in the development of OSA is upper airway collapsibility: those with a more
      collapsible upper airway tend to have OSA while those with a stiffer upper airway do not. The
      gold standard treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which acts by
      stenting open the collapsible airway. Upper airway collapsibility can be measured during
      sleep by changing the CPAP level and assessing the change in inspiratory flow through the
      upper airway. Although technically feasible, these measurements are typically only undertaken
      in research laboratories with specialized equipment. The purpose of this study is to measure
      upper airway collapsibility using clinically available (i.e. equipment found in a clinical
      sleep laboratory) equipment only. If successful, upper airway collapsibility could be
      routinely measured in clinical practice, which could help inform treatment decisions and help
      individualize therapy for OSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSA is defined by total or partial intermittent collapse of the upper airway, resulting in
      nocturnal hypoxemia and arousals from sleep. OSA is incredible common and has important
      cardiovascular (e.g. hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation) and
      neurocognitive consequences (e.g. depression, motor vehicle accidents). Thus, OSA results in
      significant morbidity and mortality and a substantial economic burden. The best studied
      treatment of OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which effectively stents the
      upper airway open, however, many patients are not able to tolerate it. Other treatments are
      available, such as oral appliances or upper airway surgery, however these are much more
      variable in their effectiveness.

      Although other factors are important, the most important factor in OSA pathogenesis is upper
      airway collapsibility. The upper airway collapsibility can be determined during sleep when
      patients with OSA are on CPAP. The CPAP level is decreased until flow limitation and finally
      collapse is achieved. The pressure at which the airway collapses is called the pharyngeal
      critical closing pressure, or Pcrit. When measured in research laboratories, the Pcrit
      correlates with OSA severity. Subjects with a high Pcrit (e.g. 5cm of water pressure)
      typically have severe OSA, while those with a lower Pcrit (e.g. 2cm of water pressure) have
      mild OSA, and those with a negative Pcrit (e.g. -4cm of water, the airway must be sucked
      closed to collapse) typically have no disease. The Pcrit may also have important implications
      for treatment. For example, patients with OSA and a very high Pcrit may require CPAP,
      however, those with a lower or slightly negative Pcrit might be successfully treated by an
      oral appliance. Thus, knowledge of the Pcrit might be useful in clinical practice, but it is
      rarely measured outside of the research lab.

      To measure Pcrit, patients sleep with a mask over their nose or nose and mouth, and CPAP is
      applied using a custom made machine that can rapidly change mask pressures. The idea is that
      rapid changes in airway pressure produce a clear step change in airflow that will be observed
      quickly. In contrast, during clinical titrations, the CPAP machines change pressure much more
      slowly to help promote patient comfort. The goal of this research is to determine whether
      these slower pressure changes could still be used to gather useful information about upper
      airway collapsibility.

    <description>To measure passive Pcrit, patients sleep with a mask over their nose or nose and mouth, and CPAP is applied using a custom made machine that can rapidly change mask pressures in research setting. The idea is that rapid changes in airway pressure produce a clear step change in airflow that will be observed quickly. In contrast, during clinical titrations, the CPAP machines change pressure much more slowly to help promote patient comfort. Passive Pcrit will be measured using both research and clinical equipment in the same patients and the Pcrit result using clinical CPAP titration equipment will be compared to the gold standard: Pcrit measurement done through research equipment that changes CPAP pressure rapidly.</description>
