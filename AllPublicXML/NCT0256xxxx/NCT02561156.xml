  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      TAK-653 when administered as single and multiple oral doses at escalating dose levels in
      healthy participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-653. TAK-653 is being tested to treat
      people who have depression. This study will look at the tolerability and PK of TAK-653 in
      healthy participants.

      The study may enroll up to 112 participants and each cohort will enroll 8 participants. This
      study consists of 2 parts: Part 1- single rising dose (SRD) consisting of at least 6 cohorts
      and Part 2- single rising dose and multiple rising dose (SRD/MRD) consisting of at least 5
      cohorts. Additional cohorts may be added depending on the emerging safety and PK data.
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) within each cohort
      to receive TAK-653 or placebo which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need). Participants enrolled in
      Cohort 1 to 5 of Part 1 will receive TAK-653 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, 3.0 mg, 5.0 mg and 9.0 mg or
      TAK-653 placebo-matching tablet. Subsequent dose escalation in Part-1, from Cohort 6 onward
      will occur after the full availability of safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data from
      preceding cohorts. Participants in Part-2 Cohorts 1 to 3 will receive TAK-653 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg
      and 3.0 mg respectively. Dose for Part 2, from Cohort 4 onward will be based on review of
      safety, tolerability, and available PK and PD data from previous cohorts. All participants
      will be asked to take the drug at the same time each day on Day 1 for Part 1 and Day 1 and
      Days 6 to 18 in Part 2.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 14 days for Part 1 and 31 days for Part 2.
      Participants will be admitted to the clinic for 6 days in Part 1 and 22 days in Part 2.
      Participants will be followed up 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          3. Weighs at least 45 kilogram (kg) and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0
             kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive at Screening.

             psychiatric disease or disorder, or other abnormality, which may affect safety,
             increase risk of seizure or lower the seizure threshold, or potentially confound the
             study results. It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical
             significance; however, consultation with the Takeda Medical Monitor may be warranted.

          6. Is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant before, during, or within 30
             days after 5 half-lives have elapsed since the last dose of study drug (30 days from
             the Follow-up Call/Visit unless available data indicates otherwise); or intending to

          7. If male, intends to donate sperm during the course of this study or within 90 days
             after 5 half-lives have elapsed since the last dose of study drug. This should be
             interpreted as 90 days from the Follow-up Call/Visit unless data indicates otherwise.

          8. Has had previous episodes of seizures or convulsion (lifetime), including absence
             seizure and febrile convulsion.

             brain injury including traumatic injury, perinatal cerebropathy and postnatal brain
             damage, blood-brain barrier abnormality, and angioma cavernous.

         11. Has a history of cerebral arteriosclerosis.

         12. Has a condition that can potentially reduce drug clearance (example, renal or hepatic

         13. Has current or recent (within 6 months) gastrointestinal disease that would be
             expected to influence the absorption of drugs (that is, a history of malabsorption,
             any surgical intervention known to impact absorption [example, bariatric surgery or
             bowel resection], esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, or
             frequent [more than once per week] occurrence of heartburn).

         14. Has a history of cancer, except basal cell carcinoma which has been in remission for
             at least 5 years prior to Check-in (Day 1).

         15. Has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             (HCV) antibody, or a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at
             Screening.

         16. Has poor peripheral venous access.

         17. Has a positive urine/blood result for drugs of abuse (defined as any illicit drug use)
             at Screening or Check-in (Day -1).

         18. Has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol
             abuse within 1 year prior to Screening or is unwilling to agree to abstain from
             alcohol and drugs throughout the study.

         19. Has used nicotine-containing products (including but not limited to cigarettes, pipes,
             cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch, or nicotine gum) within 28 days prior to
             Check-in Day -1. Cotinine test is positive at Screening or Check-in (Day -1).

         20. Has donated or lost 450 milliliter (mL) or more of his or her blood volume (including
             plasmapheresis), or had a transfusion of any blood product within 90 days prior to
             first dose of study drug.

         21. Has a Screening or Check-in (Day -1) abnormal (clinically significant [CS]) ECG. Entry
             of any participant with an abnormal (not clinically significant [NCS]) ECG must be
             approved, and documented by signature of the principal investigator or medically
             qualified subinvestigator. In the case of a QT interval corrected using Fridericia's
             formula (QTcF) interval greater than (&gt;) 450 millisecond (msec) or &gt;480 msec
             (participants with Bundle Branch Block) or PR outside the range of 120 to 220 msec,
             assessment may be repeated once for eligibility determination at the Screening Visit
             and/or Check-in (Day -1) Visit.

         22. Has a supine blood pressure outside the ranges of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 90 to
             less than or equal to (&lt;=)140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) for systolic and &gt;= 50 to
             &lt;= 90 mm Hg for diastolic. If out of range, assessment may be repeated once for
             eligibility determination at the Screening Visit and/or Check-in (Day -1).

         23. Has a resting heart rate outside the range of 50 to 90 bpm (not on ECGs). If out of
             range, the assessment may be repeated once for eligibility determination at the
             Screening Visit and/or Check-in (Day -1).

         24. Has abnormal Screening or Check-in (Day -1) laboratory values that suggest a
             clinically significant underlying disease or participant has the following lab
             abnormalities: Alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;1.5
             upper limit of normal (ULN).

         25. Has a risk of suicide per the C-SSRS (a score of 4 or 5 on ideation or any suicidal
             behavior) or according to the investigator's clinical judgment, has made a suicide
             attempt in the previous 6 months, or has a history of deliberate self-harm in the past
             6 months.

        Additional exclusion criteria for CSF collection in Cohort 3 in Part 2:

          1. Has had CSF collected within 6 months prior to Check-in (Day -1).

          2. Has a known hypersensitivity to the anesthetic or its derivatives used during CSF
             collection or any medication used to prepare the area of lumbar puncture.

          3. Has any skin condition, abnormality of the lumbar spine, medical or surgical condition
             that would preclude lumbar puncture (example, coagulopathy, local or systemic
             infection, left ventricular outflow obstruction, aortic stenosis, raised intracranial
             pressure, previous back surgery).
