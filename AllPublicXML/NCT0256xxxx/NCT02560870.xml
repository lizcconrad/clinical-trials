      Aim: To compare the efficacy of Aloe Vera and non-alcoholic chlorhexidine mouthwash in the
      treatment of Periodontal diseases.

      Methods &amp;Material: 32 patients were selected, the following periodontal parameters were
      recorded at baseline, and after recording all the parameters at the baseline, Scaling, root
      planning, and polishing are done for all the patients participating in the study. Oral
      hygiene instructions were given that included brushing twice a day with a soft brush, After 2
      weeks, patients in the study, were randomly (Balanced Block Randomization) equal divided into
      2 groups;

      Group A: mouthwash aloe Vera (Alodent Co. UK) for each patient, Group B: Non-alcoholic
      Chlorhexidine (Perio-Kin, Livar CO. Spain) 10 ml by patients routinely washed two times in
      one day for about 30 seconds and lasts for 15 days, then every 7 days periodontal parameters,
      and at the end of 2 weeks (days 0, 7, 15) clinical changes are evaluated.

      Eligible participants were 32 adult patients treated for chronic periodontitis and
      participating in a supportive periodontal therapy program at the Department of Periodontology
      of the Dental Clinic of the Islamic Azad University, Dental Branch of Tehran were included in
      the current study; Recruitment of participants started july 2014 and ended may 2015. The
      study met the criteria of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, revised in 2008. The survey plan
      was reviewed and sanctioned, approved by the ethics commission of the Institutional Ethical
      Committee and Review Board of the Deputy of Research, School of Dentistry. All subjects
      received the oral and written explanation of the intent of the survey and signed an informed
      consent after receiving detailed information about the purpose, the benefits, and the
      possible risks associated with the trial. Individuals satisfying the following entry criteria
      were recruited:

        -  Diagnosed suffering from initial (early) to moderate chronic periodontitis;

        -  Adult patients, more than 28 years old with at least 20 remaining teeth and at least
           three teeth in each quadrant;

        -  The presence of at least two residual sites with a probing pocket depth (PPD&gt;4 mm in two
           opposite quadrants, which showed bleeding upon probing, radiographically comparable
           amount of periodontal breakdown and good matching in tooth type, also clinical and
           minimal radiographic signs of initial (early) to moderate (clinical attachment level of
           1 to 3mm.
