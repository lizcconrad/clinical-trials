  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activation of blood platelets is a typical finding in patients with systemic inflammation and
      sepsis.They seem to mediate key pro-inflammatory mediator secretion, immune-cell activation
      while their adhesion to the endothelium enhances the pro-coagulatory activity of endothelial
      cells impairing microcirculation thus, may lead to multiple organ dysfunction. However, the
      exact effects of bacterial products on platelet function have not been found to be consistent
      and may vary according to the species, the timing of the study, and the pathogenesis of
      sepsis. Data vary, including both increased and decreased platelet reactivity and aggregation
      among patients with sepsis compared to healthy controls. Defining platelet's behaviour during
      sepsis is particularly important in view of recent findings revealing potential association
      between antiplatelet therapy and reduction in short term mortality, incidence of acute lung
      injury and intensive care unit admission in critically ill patients.This study aims to
      measure P2Y12 mediated platelet reactivity, -using the point-of-care P2Y12 VerifyNow assay,
      in platelet reactivity units (PRU)- along different stages of sepsis, including
      bacteremia/uncomplicated infection, sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. Subgroup follow
      up of patients going along different stages will also be performed. At the end of this study
      analysis of clinical and laboratory findings in correlation with platelet reactivity will be
      performed to assess platelet aggregation during sepsis.

    <description>Sepsis is defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (i.e. presence of two or more of the following
Temperature of &lt;36 °C (96.8 °F) or &gt;38 °C (100.4 °F)
Heart rate &gt;90bpm
Respiratory rate &gt;20/min or PaCO2&lt;32 mmHg (4.3 kPa)

    <description>Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion [manifesting as hypotension, elevated lactate (serum lactate 2 times the upper limit of normal), or decreased urine output (urine output &lt; 0.5 ml/kg/hr)] Septic shock is defined as severe sepsis plus persistently low blood pressure (&lt; 5th percentile for age or systolic blood pressure &lt; 2 standard deviations below normal for age) following the administration of intravenous fluids.</description>

        infection/bacteraemia , sepsis, severe sepsis/septic shock as this is defined by
        International Sepsis Definitions Conference. Thirty five healthy volunteers will serve as a
