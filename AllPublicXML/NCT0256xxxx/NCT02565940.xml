      This work also highlights the presence of an unknown virus double-stranded DNA. In this
      project we propose 1) incorporating a bank of 150 samples from patients with diabetic foot
      infection in grades 2-4; 2) to study the microbial flora of a selection of 50 diabetic feet
      previously untreated with antibiotics for bacterial metagenomics, viral metagenomics and a
      minimum of 10 per culturomique; 3) to evaluate the use of targeted quantitative PCR on the
      most frequent new species frequency in the disease and incidentally get a sense of their role
      in the evolution and prognosis of the disease, including failures of and targeted antibiotic
      therapy on all 150 samples.

      Patients will be included by the infectious and tropical diseases and diabetes services the
      Nîmes Teaching Hospital which have a large active file and proven expertise internationally
      in this pathology. The usual agents of infection will be searched by standard bacteriological
      techniques as part of the microbiological documentation of such cases and will be performed
      by the microbiology laboratory of CHU Nîmes which will freeze the rest of the sample to -80 °
      C the will send it to the Marseille Microbiology Federation for realization of
      metagenomics-culturomics
