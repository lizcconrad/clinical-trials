      Multicenter trial in Germany:

      Feasibility Study of Adjuvant Treatment with S-1 in Patients after R0-Resection of
      Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach and Esophagogastric Junction with the aim to show the
      feasibility and tolerability of two different adjuvant S-1 treatment regimens in Caucasian
      patients and to determine the recommended dose for both treatment regimens.

      Patients will be enrolled in two cohorts.

      The cohorts 1 an d2 will be conducted consecutively, started with cohort 1. Cohort 1 consists
      of 30 patients who receive S-1 twice daily for 18 cycles (D1-14 q 3 wks). Cohort 2 consists
      of 30 patients who receive S-1 twice daily for 9 cycles (D1-28, q 6 wks). Both cohorts will
      start with 2x 30 mg/m^2 BSA. Two dose reductions will be allowed per protocol.
