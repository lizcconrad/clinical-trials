      This study designed an interventional pre-post compared clinical study. The subjects received
      conventional physical therapy with Walkbot training (3 sessions per week for 7 weeks, 20
      session). Before and after intervention all subjects evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging
      and clinical outcome measurements.

    <measure>Functional ambulation category</measure>

    <description>The functional ambulation category was designed to examine the levels of assistance required during a 15m walk. Six categories are included in the functional ambulation category: 0 (non-ambulatory), 1 (needs continuous support from one person), 2 (needs intermittent support from one person), 3 (needs only verbal supervision), 4 (help is required on stairs and uneven surfaces), and 5 (can walk independently anywhere).</description>

    <measure>Medical research council</measure>
    <time_frame>at the first day of intervention, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after the first day</time_frame>
    <description>The medical research council was designed to examine the muscle strength. Six categories are included in the medical research council: 5 (muscle contracts normally against full resistance), 4 (muscle strength is reduced but muscle contraction can still move joint against resistance), 3 (muscle strength is further reduced such that the joint can be moved only against gravity with the examiner's resistance completely removed. As an example, the elbow can be moved from full extension to full flexion starting with the arm hanging down at the side), 2 (muscle can move only if the resistance of gravity is removed. As an example, the elbow can be fully flexed only if the arm is maintained in a horizontal plane), 1 (only a trace or flicker of movement is seen or felt in the muscle or fasciculations are observed in the muscle) and 0 (no movement is observed)</description>
