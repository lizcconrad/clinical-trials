  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an aging population, most seniors suffer from multiple chronic conditions. When the number
      of medications taken is ≥5 (polypharmacy), the burden of taking so many together can do more
      harm than good. This study will test a program focused on medication reduction involving
      patient, pharmacist and physician using current technology aimed at reducing the harms of
      polypharmacy. Reducing the risk of adverse effects from drugs or the interactions between
      them involves prioritizing the most important ones according to the patient's preference and
      stopping those which may no longer be necessary. Reducing the dose also reduces the risk of
      drug side effects. Patients, aged over 69 years taking ≥5 medications, will randomly receive
      the program immediately or at 6 months. The program involves information gathering from the
      patient, medication review with the pharmacist and then a consultation with the family doctor
      focused on discontinuing/reducing the dose of medications where possible using a 'pause and
      monitor' framework to assess the need for restart. An electronic program that detects drug
      adverse effects and flags potentially inappropriate medications will be integrated into a
      clinical pathway incorporating monitoring and follow up systems. This study will examine
      effects on patient and health relevant outcome measures as well as patients' and clinicians'
      experiences of the program. The results will be used to determine whether this system can be
      implemented as part of routine preventative care in older adults.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive the intervention at study start or delayed
      appointment 6 months later. The intervention includes initial baseline data collection from
      the patient including data on demographics, medications, and illness characteristics. The
      patient will then attend an appointment with a pharmacist to review medications appropriate
      for discontinuation/dose reduction, after which the patient will meet with his/her family
      physician to discuss patient preferences for discontinuation/dose reduction. Follow up
      appointments will take place at one week, 3 months and 6 months (study end). Questionnaires
      and a semi-structured interview will take place at the 6 month appointment. After six months,
      the control group will be offered the intervention.
