      The primary purpose of this trial is to demonstrate that the utilization of CartoFinder™ 4D
      Local Activation Time (LAT) Algorithm may help identify and improve the outcome for the
      treatment of complex arrhythmias.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Signed the Patient Informed Consent Form (ICF)

          3. Scheduled to undergo a clinically-indicated catheter ablation procedure for treatment
             of

               -  Persistent atrial fibrillation (defined as continuous atrial fibrillation that is
                  sustained beyond seven consecutive days).

               -  Drug-resistant Atrial Fibrillation. (failed 1 or more class I or III
                  antiarrhythmic drugs) and demonstrating Persistent AF (requiring drugs or
                  electrical shock to terminate)

               -  Persistent AF despite prior conventional ablation.

          4. Previous procedure permitted but limited to single Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI).

          5. In AF at the time of the Pre-CartoFinder Map (spontaneous or induced)

          6. Able and willing to comply with all pre-, post-, and follow-up testing and
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation

          2. Continuous AF &gt; 12 months (1-Year) (Longstanding Persistent AF)

          3. Cardioversion refractory (The inability to restore sinus rhythm for 30 secs or longer
             following electrical cardioversion. If a patient does not have documented evidence of
             being successfully cardioverted (Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) &gt; 30 secs), the patient
             must be cardioverted prior to the ablation procedure. Failure to cardiovert based on
             the above criteria is considered a screen failure.

          4. A complex arrhythmia secondary to a reversible or non-cardiac cause. For example: a
             complex arrhythmia secondary to electrolyte imbalance or thyroid disease.

          5. Left atrial size &gt;55 mm (echocardiography, parasternal long axis view).

          6. Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude enrollment in this study.

          7. Structural atrial disease such as a prior history of atriotomy from prior atrial
             surgery, presence of an atrial septal defect, and/or presence of an atrial septal
             closure patch.

          8. History of or current blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities, contraindication to
             systemic anticoagulation (i.e., heparin, warfarin, dabigatran, or a direct thrombin
             inhibitor), significant pulmonary disease, cardiac surgeries, unstable angina,
             uncontrolled heart failure, acute illness or systemic infection, or any other disease
             or malfunction that would preclude treatment in the opinion of the investigator.

          9. Enrollment in an experimental study evaluating another device or drug under
             investigation.

         10. Prosthetic valve

         11. Presence of intramural thrombus, tumor or other abnormality / condition that precludes
             vascular access, catheter introduction or manipulation.

         12. Women of child bearing potential whom are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become
             pregnant during the course of the trial.

         13. Presenting contra-indications for the devices used in the study, as indicated in the
             respective Instructions For Use.
