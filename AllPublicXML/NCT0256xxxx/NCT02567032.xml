  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will examine the behavioral effects and neurophysiological
      mechanisms of the pro-social neuropeptide oxytocin in patients with recent-onset
      schizophrenia. Such research is a necessary first step towards identifying whether intranasal
      oxytocin administration can serve as an adjunct treatment for social impairments in
      schizophrenia.

      Aim 1: To quantify the effects of exogenous oxytocin on social cognition and behavior in
      patients with recent-onset schizophrenia.

      Hypothesis A: Patients and healthy comparison subjects will show enhanced social cognition
      (e.g., improved interpretation of paralinguistic and emotional cues, such as those involved
      in emotional or sarcastic communication) after administration of oxytocin versus placebo.

      Hypothesis B: Patients and healthy comparison subjects will show increased attention to
      others' eyes and patients will exhibit increased facial affect expressivity after
      administration of oxytocin versus placebo.

      Aim 2: To examine the effects of exogenous oxytocin on PNS activity in patients with
      recent-onset schizophrenia.

      Hypothesis A: Patients and healthy comparison subjects will demonstrate increased PNS
      activity during social tasks after administration of oxytocin versus placebo.

      Hypothesis B (exploratory): Patients and healthy comparison subjects' improvements in social
      cognition and behavior will be predicted by the degree to which oxytocin increases their PNS
      activity.

    <measure>Change in social cognition task performance</measure>
    <time_frame>2-days at least 1-week apart</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo tasks that measure social cognition, which include the Auction Task, Devil's Task, Ultimatum Task, Verbal Prosody, EEfRT, and Passive Viewing Eyetracking.
This panel of tasks is designed to measure the subject's level of social cognition. Investigators will be measuring the number of tasks that improve on the oxytocin day compared to the placebo day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-morbid IQ Questionnaire (AmNART)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The American National Adult Reading Test (AMNART) is an instrument used to estimate premorbid verbal IQ in adults. Participants are shown 45 words one at a time and are asked to read the word aloud. The scorer then writes 0 if the participant read the word incorrectly or 1 if the pronunciation is correct.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Experiences in Close Relationships-Relationship Structures (ECR-RS) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The ECR is used to evaluate the construct of adult attachment. The scale involves 36 itemized statements split into four parts, each part referring to a different attachment figure. Participants rank each item using a 7-point likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The CTQ is a brief survey of 6 early traumatic experiences, including death, divorce, violence, sexual abuse, illness or other. The scale determines and assesses an individual's understanding of their childhood trauma, if applicable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Quotient Scale (EQS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ is a 60-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to measure empathy in adults. Participants use a 4 item likert scale to record their responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinsey Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Kinsey scale attempts to describe a person's sexual orientation using a scale from 0 (i.e. heterosexual) to 6 (i.e. homosexual).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Working Memory capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>2-days at least 1-week apart</time_frame>
    <description>This task determines a participant's working memory capacity using the University of Maryland Letter Number Span Assessment. This asks 24 questions of increasing working memory difficulty and the total correct is calculated. Investigators will measure the change in the total correct between oxytocin and placebo days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Auditory Perception capabilities</measure>
    <time_frame>2-days at least 1-week apart</time_frame>
    <description>The Sound Sweeps task determines auditory perception ability by measuring changes in pitches to sounds. Investigators will measure the change in the total correct and reaction time between oxytocin and placebo days.</description>
