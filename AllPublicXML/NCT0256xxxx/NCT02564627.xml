    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized study, including moderately obese patients will be included.
      Patients will be randomized in 3 groups:

        -  PENS of dermatome T6 with an ambulatory self-applied patch + 1200Kcal/day diet

        -  PENS of dermatome T6 with conventional procedure + 1200Kcal/day diet

        -  Only 1200Kcal/day diet

      The effect on appetite and weight loss will be investigated.

      A prospective randomized study, including moderately obese (BMI 30-39 Kg/m2) patients will be
      included. Patients will be randomized in 3 groups:

        -  PENS of dermatome T6 with an ambulatory self-applied patch + 1200Kcal/day diet

        -  PENS of dermatome T6 with conventional procedure (weekly stimulation in the Outpatient
           Clinic) + 1200Kcal/day diet

        -  Only 1200Kcal/day diet

      The effect on appetite and weight loss will be investigated.
