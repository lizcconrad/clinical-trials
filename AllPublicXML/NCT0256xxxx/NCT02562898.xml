  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is a standard regimen (NCCN, Category 1) for patients with
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, further improvement in treatment
      is needed. Increasingly, the nature of the immune infiltrate in PDAC appears to be tumor
      promoting. In preclinical studies, ibrutinib treatment, presumably by reprogramming B cells,
      results in increased CD8+ T cells to assist in tumor control. Preclinical studies of
      ibrutinib plus gemcitabine show superior antitumor effects compared to gemcitabine alone in
      both orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer cell line grafts and in genetically engineered mouse
      models. Thus, the investigators propose a clinical trial of ibrutinib plus the standard
      gemcitabine based regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, evaluating safety, then efficacy
      and including correlative studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents the fourth leading cause of cancer-related
      mortality in the United States, with an estimated 39,950 deaths attributable to PDAC in 2014
      (http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html). Over 90% of patients have inoperable
      disease at presentation, at which point systemic therapy becomes the primary form of
      treatment.

      Treating PDAC has been challenging and few approved drugs are available. Recently, however,
      some breakthroughs have occurred, raising hope that this aggressive disease can be better
      controlled. FOLFIRINOX, a combination of 5FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, has been found to
      be substantially superior to treatment of gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic
      disease and good performance status. Similarly, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, a regimen
      with less non-hematologic toxicity, demonstrated improved overall survival and
      progression-free survival compared to gemcitabine alone. Both of these combinations or
      modifications of these combinations are now front line options for patients with good
      performance status. Furthermore, these improvements in survival, however incremental, now
      afford patients with pancreatic cancer time to participate in and possibly benefit from
      clinical trials of novel therapeutics.

    <description>All patients in phase Ib dosing escalation with extended safety and toxicity cohorts will start treatment with daily dosing of ibrutinib concurrently with standard doses of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Ibrutinib (560 mg/day, 840 mg/day, or 420 and 280 mg/day if de-escalation is necessary) will be started on day 1. Approximately patients 15-30 will be enrolled in escalation and extended safety cohort.</description>

    <description>Subjects who are assigned to the Immune Response Cohort will have a biopsy before starting ibrutinib-only therapy. They will then receive ibrutinib for 7 days and have a second biopsy after completing the ibrutinib-only therapy, before starting the combination of chemotherapy with ibrutinib. Approximately 20 patients will be enrolled in this arm.</description>
