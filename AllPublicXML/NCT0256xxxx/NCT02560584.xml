    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if blue light cystoscopy with Cysview improves
      detection of tumors in patients with bladder cancer during surveillance cystoscopy, using the
      KARL STORZ D-Light C PDD Flexible Videoscope System. Another purpose is to investigate if
      Cysview and blue light is safe and effective when used repeatedly.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Patients with bladder cancer in follow-up for tumor recurrence (Note: Patients must be
             included only at the first surveillance cystoscopy after a histologically confirmed
             tumor. The histologically confirmed tumor could either be from a TURB or from a
             surveillance cystoscopy where a biopsy was taken and a tumor was confirmed by
             histology)

          2. History of one or more of the following:

               -  Multiple tumors

               -  Recurrent tumors

               -  High grade tumor(s)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Gross haematuria. (Note: Gross haematuria is defined as a heavy bladder bleed
             resulting in significant amounts of blood in the urine, which may visually limit
             cystoscopy. Where the haematuria is light, the patient should not be excluded, if in
             the investigator's opinion, rinsing and/or electro-cautery during cystoscopy will
             alleviate the haematuria limitations to cystoscopy)

          2. Patients who cannot undergo in-office or operating room cystoscopy (Note: Training
             patients are eligible even if they cannot undergo operating room cystoscopy)

          3. Patients who have received Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) immunotherapy or
             intravesical chemotherapy within the past 6 weeks prior to the procedure

          4. Porphyria

          5. Known allergy to hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride or a similar compound

          6. Pregnancy or breast-feeding (all women of child-bearing potential must document a
             negative urine pregnancy test before study inclusion and use adequate contraception
             during the study

          7. Participation in other clinical studies with investigational drugs either concurrently
             or within the last 30 days

          8. Patient is the investigator or any sub investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of
             the protocol

          9. Patients that the investigator believes are unlikely to comply with the protocol, e.g.
             mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of participating in the clinical study, uncooperative attitude
             or unlikelihood of completing the study
