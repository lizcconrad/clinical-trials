    <measure>Baseline Transitional Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI) Focal Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 12</time_frame>
    <description>A trained assessor interviewed the patient and graded the degree of impairment due to dyspnea (difficulty breathing). BDI/TDI focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort and captures changes from baseline. BDI was measured at day 1 prior to the first dose with domain scores ranging from 0=very severe to 4=no impairment and a total score ranging from 0 to 12(best). TDI captures changes from baseline. Each domain is scored from -3=major deterioration to 3=major improvement to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score.</description>
