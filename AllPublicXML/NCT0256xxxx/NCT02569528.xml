  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn about the patient and provider perceptions, priorities,
      preferences, and willingness to use/prescribe anticoagulation as a stroke prevention therapy
      in patients with atrial fibrillation. Qualitative interviews will be performed with atrial
      fibrillation patients and providers caring for atrial fibrillation patients. The
      investigators want to understand the factors that influence decision-making about
      anticoagulation medications, and to gain insight into patients' and providers' knowledge of
      the risk of stroke and bleeding associated with oral anticoagulation. This feedback will help
      provide better education to providers caring for patients with atrial fibrillation and better
      care to patients with atrial fibrillation by developing tools to optimize the appropriate use
      of oral anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation.
