    <textblock>
      In order to reevaluate safety and efficacy of human urinary kallikrein in treating acute
      cerebral infarction ,a multi-center, open label , single group study was designed. Expect to
      enroll 60 sites and 2186 subjects. Subjects will receive kallikrein treatment according to
      real clinical practice (suggest above 14days treatment) and 90 days follow up
