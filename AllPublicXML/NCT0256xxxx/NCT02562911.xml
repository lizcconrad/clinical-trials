  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the general population, age of puberty, and age of menarche in girls, are closely
      correlated with those of their mother. The severity of chronic disease has an impact on the
      stature, the weight gain and the onset of puberty: age of menarche is even later that chronic
      illness is serious. Cystic fibrosis is one of the major chronic diseases of children.

      Neonatal screening is organized since 2002, most girls with cystic fibrosis therefore
      currently have a very specialized and early care. Older patients were diagnosed during
      childhood. The optimization of the nutritional and respiratory management has allowed over
      the past two decades a significant improvement in the survival of these patients. Most young
      people reach adulthood, puberty and reproductive desire are a crucial issue in the care of
      these young adults.

      In literature, it is often noted an age of menarche delayed an average of 2 years compared to
      the general population, but correlated with the age of menstruation from the mothers.

      The factors involved in the conduct of cycles in the girl followed for cystic fibrosis are
      poorly known and there are few data on the characteristics of cycles. The menstrual
      irregularity and amenorrhoea episodes concern nearly half of women.

      On the pathophysiological level, studies in animals show that there is a direct effect of
      CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator) on the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal and
      reproductive capacity in mice.

      The literature data on the pubertal development, fertility and hormonal profile of these
      girls are for studies with low numbers and are very old. There is to date no French cohort
      study on this topic.

      The study is a multicenter cross-sectional descriptive study for pubertal and gynecological
      characteristics in girls followed annually in the reference centers Cystic Fibrosis two
      inter-region.
