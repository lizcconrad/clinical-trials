      An injury of haematosis in post ischemic chronic heart failure limits the clinic tolerance.

      There is a correlation between injury of pulmonary diffusing, chronic heart failure intensity
      and aerobic physic ability evaluated by an heart-rate maximal exercise tolerance test (VO2
      max). This injury is a new follow-up parameter of cardiac function for the adult.

      The nature of damage (vascular or membrane) can be determined by the measure of double
      pulmonary diffusing capacity to carbon monoxide (CO) associated to nitric oxide (NO).

      Today, in chronic heart failure consecutive to a congenital heart disease, there is no data
      on evolution of membrane and capillar factors.It is impossible to predict if membrane damage
      will be the best factor correlated to the VO2max in patients suffering from complex
      congenital heart disease.

      Assessing these parameters could be an comparative evaluation of heart-rate exercise
      tolerance test with VO2max and an early control of his damage without risks related to
      heart-rate maximal exercise and independently of age, sex, hemoglobin, type of heart
      disease.These results would have an early prognostic value that would permit to refine the
      follow-up and the treatment.

      The main objective of this trial is to assess the statistic correlation between the membrane
      injury of alveolar-capillary diffusing at rest and aerobic physic ability restriction in
      children and adults suffering from complex congenital heart disease.

    <description>Measure of double pulmonary diffusing will be done as the single-breath test: the patient will be seated and connected to device by an oral tip. Measure begins by a maximal inhalation of a gas mixture (0.28% of CO, 14% of He, 21% of O2,450 ppm of NO/N2 and 40ppm of NO).After, the patient will maintain an apnea of 4 secondes and will breathe out in oral tip until his residual capacity.
With the expired air, some parameters will be assessed:
Alveolar volume (VA)
Membrane ductance (Dm) and pulmonar capillary volume (values adjusted by Haemoglobin)
Values of TLCO, TLCO/VA, TLNO, TLNO/VA Vc, Dm, Vc/VA, Dm/VA, TLNO/TLCO et Dm/Vc</description>
