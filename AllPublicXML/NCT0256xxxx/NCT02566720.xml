  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study. The objective is to further understand the mechanism by which
      amantadine improves function in patients with persistent vegetative state and minimally
      conscious state. Specifically, the investigators will measure the size of the nerve fibers
      that mediate arousal (reticular activating system, or RAS) pre and post treatment on MRI
      tractography. MRI findings will be correlated with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) score.
      The information gathered from this study will be used to formulate a larger clinical trial.

      Primary Aim:

      To determine the size of the RAS tracts as measured by MRI tractography. Specifically, the
      investigators will be measuring the fiber tracts that project through the posterior thalamus.
      The RAS is involved in mediating arousal and consciousness. The size of fiber tracts will be
      measured prior to initiating treatment and near the time of discharge from the rehabilitation
      hospital or at approximately ninety-days. It is hypothesized that treatment will result in an
      increase in the size of these fiber tracts.

      As a pilot study, the investigators will be determining the feasibility of recruiting and
      retaining patients in this type of study. This will allow the clarification and understanding
      of the technical standards for MRI tractography related to the assessment of the reticular
      activating system.

      Secondary Aim:

      To determine and monitor changes in function following acquired brain injury as measured by
      the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) score. The DRS score will be obtained prior to initiating
      treatment and at termination of the study. It is hypothesized that treatment with amantadine
      in addition to standard medical treatment, will be associated with an improvement in
      function.

    <description>After informed consent has been obtained, the subjects will be examined by a physician and assigned a Disability Ratings Scale (DRS) score. Subjects will undergo MRI tractography study, which does not require the administration of contrast. All participants will receive oral amantadine at escalating doses to ensure tolerance (50mg twice daily for 7 days, then 100mg twice daily for 1 week, then 150mg twice daily, then 200mg twice daily). The usual length of stay on the inpatient brain injury program is ninety days. The MRI tractography study and DRS score will be repeated near the time of discharge or ninety days from enrollment.</description>

    <description>Participants will initially receive amantadine at the starting dose of 50mg twice daily either by mouth or feeding tube. The dosage will increase every week by 50mg twice daily (100mg total dose increase) up to the target dose of 200mg twice daily. These are the usual doses and rate of increase that are offered to patients with brain injury.</description>
