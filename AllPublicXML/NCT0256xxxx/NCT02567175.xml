      FDA currently allows patients 12 years of age and older with various gastrointestinal (GI)
      conditions to be treated with Domperidone through the Expanded Access to Investigational
      Drugs program. These conditions include gastroesophageal reflux disease with upper GI
      symptoms, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation. Patients must have failed standard
      therapies to be eligible to receive Domperidone. This program facilitates availability of
      investigational drugs, (such as Domperidone) to patients with serious diseases or conditions
      when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or
      treat the patient's disease or condition.

      Expanded Access Program Design:

      The purpose of the Expanded Access Program is to provide oral Domperidone to patients' â‰¥12
      years of age where, according to the investigator's judgment, a prokinetic effect is needed
      for the relief of refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease with upper gastrointestinal (GI)
      symptoms, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation.

      The objective of the Expanded Access Program is to allow the use of Domperidone by patients
      with gastrointestinal disorders who have failed standard therapy. Failed standard therapy can
      be constituted by the following treatments: PPI Therapy, Erythromycin, allergy to
      medications. Subject must be on these therapies for a time period of 1 month before they are
      considered to be ineffective.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female

          2. Age 12 and older

          3. Symptoms or manifestations secondary to GERD (e.g., persistent esophagitis, heartburn,
             upper airway signs or symptoms or respiratory symptoms), gastrointestinal motility
             disorders such as nausea, vomiting, severe dyspepsia or severe chronic constipation
             that are refractory to standard therapy. Failed standard therapy can be constituted by
             the following treatments: PPI Therapy, Erythromycin, allergy to medications. Subject
             must be on these therapies for a time period of 1 month before they are considered to
             be ineffective.

          4. Patients must have a comprehensive evaluation to eliminate other causes of their
             symptoms.

          5. Patient or Parent/Legal Guardian has signed informed consent and child assent (as
             appropriate) for the administration of Domperidone that informs the patient of
             potential adverse events including:

               -  increased prolactin levels

               -  extrapyramidal side effects

               -  breast changes

               -  cardiac arrhythmias including QT prolongation and death

               -  There is a potential for increased risk of adverse events with the drugs listed
                  in the Domperidone protocol addendum (see Appendix).

          6. Patients with a weight &gt; 35kg

          7. Patients are able to swallow the Domperidone pill.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of, or current, arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
             fibrillation and Torsade des Pointes. Patients with minor forms of ectopy (PACs) are
             not necessarily excluded.

          2. Clinically significant bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction, or heart block. Prolonged
             QTc (QTc&gt; 450 milliseconds for males, QTc&gt;470 milliseconds for females).

          3. Hepatic dysfunction

          4. Renal insufficiency

          5. Clinically significant electrolyte disorders.

          6. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or obstruction

          7. Presence of a prolactinoma (prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor).

          8. Pregnant or breast feeding female

          9. Known allergy to Domperidone

         10. The use of medications that interact with Domperidone. a. Subjects may be required to
             stop use (wash-out) of medications that interact with Domperidone. If the subject is
             not willing or able to stop use of the interacting medication, they may be excluded or
             withdrawn from the study at the investigator's discretion. Based on the medication the
             subject may be required to stop-use or wash out from, the PI will determine the
             appropriate washout period using clinical judgment. Some medications may require much
             longer washout periods than others, and this will be explained to each respective
             subject that requires stopping a medication.
