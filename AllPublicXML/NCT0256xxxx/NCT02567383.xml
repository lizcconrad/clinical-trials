  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical experience of with hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy for
      recurrent head and neck cancer is limited. The primary goals of hyperthermia combined with
      CCRT on recurrent head and neck cancer are tumor response rate, while secondary goals are
      rates of acute and late adverse effects, local control rate, distant metastasis rate,
      progression-free rate and overall survival rate.

      Patients will be treated with radiotherapy with 50Gy/22fx/6 weeks, plus hyperthermia for 40
      minutes within 2hr after irradiation, with maximum temperature setted on 42℃ ± 0.5℃ as upper
      limit, once a week since the 1st week of radiation for a total of 6 times. The regimen of
      concurrent chemotherapy will be cisplatin 20mg/m2 and taxotere 10-12mg/m2 per week for 6
      weekly cycles on the day before radiotherapy and hyperthermia treatment. The two chemotherapy
      agents will be given in only one day every week, according to the weekly dose. According to
      Gehan two-stage design, provided the estimated tumor response rate using this regimen is
      about 40% and objective tumor response is observed in ≥1 of the first 6 patients enrolled,
      α&lt;0.05 will be achieved indicating a preliminary efficacy. Then the Gehan second stage will
      be started. With a set of 5% precision and an assumption of 10% dropout rate, 39 additional
      patients will be enrolled in the Gehan second stage depending on the actual number with tumor
      response in the Gehan first stage (totaling 45 patients when counting the first 6 in the
      Gehan first stage). The tumor response, adverse effects and various survival curves will be
      analyzed.
