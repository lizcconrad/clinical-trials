  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survival rate of childhood cancers is now reaching 80%. However, early or late complications
      related to surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy remain high and greatly increase the risk
      of late mortality.

      Health of individuals is closely correlated to the stability of the autonomic nervous system
      (ANS), a key system for maintaining homeostasis in any living species. Efficient computer
      tools allowed the opportunity to assess the intrinsic autonomic regulation of the ANS either
      directly or at a later time by an analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV). These tools
      have become very powerful predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and neurological aging.
      Physical endurance training improves both maximal aerobic capacity and ANS activity.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate improvement of ANS parameters after 6 months
      of adapted physical activity in adults treated for childhood cancer in Rhône-alpes region in
      France who have deregulation ANS or autonomic imbalance.

    <description>The autonomic nervous system activity is classified in sympatho-vagal equilibrium as &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;altered&quot; or &quot;severely abnormal&quot;.
For this classification, we need the values obtained for some temporal indices (Standard Deviation NN intervals (SDNN), Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD)) and frequencies (Ptot, High Frequency (HF), Low Frequency (LF) , Very-Low Frequency (VLF), ratio LF / HF) compared to validated standards for the age (mean +/- standard deviation).</description>
