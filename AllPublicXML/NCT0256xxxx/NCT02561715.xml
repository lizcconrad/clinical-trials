  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anosognosia is a recognised condition for people with Parkinson's, and is the result of
      physiological damage on brain structure.

      Surgical Parkinson Disease Nurse Specialists have noticed that when reviewing the pre-surgery
      videos 12 months post-DBS, patients have forgotten and are shocked at how bad their symptoms
      were prior to surgery (personal communication), which may not be reflected in the change in
      QoL reported.

      This lack of awareness, while possibly helpful in everyday life, may lead to effective
      treatments looking ineffective, or the benefits in QoL of effective treatment appearing
      reduced. This confound may not only reduce the apparent effectiveness but also the related
      cost-effectiveness of treatment. As cost-effectiveness is determined by both size and
      longevity of an effect, current methods of capturing these data may be suboptimal.

      The overarching aim of this project is to identify coping mechanisms and pathological lack of
      self-awareness and the impact they are likely to have on patient reported quality of life
      (QoL) outcome measures for a chronic condition.

      This will be an observational study, a case series of approx. 10 to 20 patients. These
      patients will be recruited over a 6 month period from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital,
      Birmingham and will be informed of the study during their routine pre-surgical visit.

      Patients will be eligible if they are about to undergo DBS at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. If
      the participant has a carer, who is also willing to participate, they may also join the
      study. Patients will be excluded if they are unable to complete questionnaires in English.

      Once recruited and following consent, a patient will complete a brief battery of
      questionnaires both self-reported and clinician rated prior to surgery and at their 6 month
      post op visit.
