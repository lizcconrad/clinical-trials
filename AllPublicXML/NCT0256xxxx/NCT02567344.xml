  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, crossover trial that will recruit a cohort of non-treatment seeking
      Cannabis use disordered participants. Participants will then undergo either active, or sham
      rTMS to the LDLPFC, and cue-induced craving, and risky decision making will be assessed.

      Our primary aims are to determine the effect of a single session of 10 Hz L DLPFC rTMS on
      cannabis cue induced craving (Aim1), and behavioral tasks of impulsive decision making
      (Aim2), in non-treatment seeking individuals with Cannabis Use Disorder. The aims of the
      study will be accomplished by performing a double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial.
      Non-Treatment seeking individuals with CUD will be recruited through media advertisements, as
      well as via a pre-established database of non-treatment seeking individuals who have
      participated in previous Cannabis trials and agreed to be re-contacted. Interested
      individuals will undergo a brief phone screen to determine if they meet general
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and if so will be invited to meet with study personnel in order
      to sign informed consent, and undergo a screening visit. There will then be two experimental
      visits separated by at least one week. During each of these visits participants will undergo
      either a real, or sham rTMS treatment, as well as a cannabis cue Paradigm. Data on craving as
      well as on impulsive decision making will be collected before and after each treatment.
