  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been made in the management of
      myocardial infarction, both in the acute phase and in monitoring beyond the hospital phase.
      However changing practices in the &quot;real world&quot; and their impact on prognosis in the medium
      and long term patients admitted to the intensive care unit for acute myocardial infarction
      are relatively little studied exhaustively.

      The study of clinical, biological and genetic characteristics of patients and their
      conditions of care, help to identify patients at risk for increased morbidity and mortality
      after myocardial infarction and could be the basis for the subsequent realization of specific
      studies on the optimal therapeutic management of the disease according to the different risk
      profiles.

      This is a multicenter observational study, given to 300 prospective medical facilities,
      including a clinic or intensive care unit entitled to receive emergency acute coronary
      syndromes.

      Patients will be recruited consecutively during a period of 2 months.

      Annual follow-ups will be conducted during 10 years of clinical research technicians of the
      French Society of Cardiology, mail and / or telephone contact with the municipalities of
      birth, treating physicians and patients.

      The ambition of the 2015 Observatory of the French Society of Cardiology is through a
      photograph &quot;scale&quot; of the practices in France at present, to ensure consistency in the
      quality of care for hospitalized patients heart attack; the investigation will emphasize the
      strengths but also the weaknesses of our health care system so that should improve. Finally,
      the observation of a large population of the real world will give the opportunity to assess
      the interactions between the different types of treatments used and check their possible
      synergy or incompatibilities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female aged over 18 years

          2. Patients admitted within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in a coronary intensive care
             unit (USIC) for acute myocardial infarction (MI) defined by:

             A rise and fall of typical troponin (or CPKMb) associated with at least one of the
             following:

               -  symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia

               -  development of pathological Q waves

               -  repolarisation disorders related to ischemia (or in addition to ST depression, T
                  wave inversion)

          3. And having agreed to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refusal to consent

          2. MI occurring in the 48 hours after therapeutic intervention (bypass surgery or
             coronary angioplasty or other surgical procedure)

          3. Diagnosis of myocardial reversed in favor of an alternative diagnosis
