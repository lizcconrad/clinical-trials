  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective in this case-control intervention study, therefore, was to explore the effect
      of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on the GCF levels of vaspin and omentin in patients with
      chronic periodontitis in order to determine the usefulness of vaspin and omentin as a
      diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of periodontal disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All individuals underwent a full-mouth periodontal examination, which included probing pocket
      depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI),
      bleeding on probing (BOP). BMI and WHR were used for assessing obesity. In addition, HbA1c
      and fasting plasma glucose levels were used for elimination of diabetes mellitus. Based on
      the periodontal and anthropometric measurements, individuals (n=76) were divided into four
      groups: the periodontal-healthy group (n=19), chronic periodontitis group (n=19),
      periodontal-healthy with obesity group (n=19) and chronic periodontitis with obesity group
      (n=19). Periodontitis patients received nonsurgical periodontal therapy. GCF sampling and
      clinical periodontal parameters were assessed before and 6 weeks after therapy. Vaspin,
      omentin, and TNF-α levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
