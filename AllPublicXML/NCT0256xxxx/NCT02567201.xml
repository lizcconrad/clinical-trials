      Aim : To assess the ability of healthy subjects and patients with a severe motor disability
      to voluntary control their attention

      Material and Methods:

      Population: healthy subjects, patients with brain injury Electroencephalographic study to
      research attentional modulation during different kind of stimulation (visual, auditory,
      tactile)

      Sudy 1: passive recording.

      Study 2: active recording (instruction of attentional control given to the subject).

      Study 3: active recording with a feedback obtained after a processing of the brain activity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Research of statistical differences between sensory evoked potentials in attentional oriented condition and distracted condition</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>stastical analysis allowing to compare evoked responses during different stimulation condition (attentionnaly oriented versus attentionnally distracted versus passive condition = no instruction to the subject). These comparisons are made either for one single subject and at the group level. Analysis mainly concerns the differences in amplitude variation between the differents evoked potentials on several electrods of interest. These can vary between patients because of the different topographies of lesions and because of the different adaptative strategies. The statiscal difference will be assessed by a randomization test (also called &quot;permutation test&quot;) wich allow to assess how high is the risk that the observed difference between the evoked potential (amplitude, variance) is due to chance or not</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Online and offline accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 3 years.</time_frame>
    <description>percentage of correct answers with the brain-computer interface (BCI). A &quot;correct answer&quot; is recorded each time the feedback of the BCI match the command sended by the subject controlling the BCI. This analysis can be done online and offline. Online accuracy is recorded in real-time during the session with the subject. offline accuracy is obtained a posteriori of the experiment, to test the impact on accuracy of the changes in different parameters (stimuli duration, numbers of spatial filtering, change of classifiers, etc.).</description>

    <measure>Clinical scale score (&quot;Evaluation de la Communication des patients en Eveil de Coma&quot; (ECEC) scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 3 years (At the group level)</time_frame>
    <description>this clinical scale allow to obtain an outcome measure of the investissment, the communication themes and the communication modes of the patient. The final global value range between 0 and 44.</description>
