    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study, open-label, uncontrolled proof of concept trial. The
      trial objective is to evaluate the analgesic tolerability, safety and activity of IDN 5243
      (3-glycosyl-3-O-demethylthiocolchicine derivative)administered intramuscularly at 4 mg b.i.d.
      for 5 days in the morning (8.00-10.00 AM) and in the evening (6.00-8.00 PM) in subjects with
      Low Back Pain (LBP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate in a Phase 2 A study, the analgesic tolerability,
      safety and activity of IDN 5243 (3-glycosyl-3-O-demethylthiocolchicine derivative)
      administered intramuscularly at 4mg b.i.d. for 5 days in subjects with Low Back Pain (LBP).

      IDN 5243 (3-glycosyl-3-O-demethylthiocolchicine derivative) is a new muscle relaxant molecule
      prepared by synthesis from D-xylose and 3-O-demethylthiocolchicine.

      The primary outcomes of the study will be to evaluate the systemic safety (vital signs,
      laboratory evaluations and incidence of adverse events) of the study drug assessed by
      Investigator taking into consideration the change from baseline to DAY 5, the local
      tolerability assessed by the patient every day during the treatment period and by
      Investigator.

      The secondary objectives of the study will be to evaluate the analgesic activity of the study
      drug. Analgesic activity will be evaluated with scoring spontaneous pain. In particular, the
      secondary outcome of the trial will be the change of the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS Scale)
      score (100 mm) evaluated at baseline and at DAY 5 (Visit V5). Moreover, the evaluation of
      secondary parameters for the analgesic activity and changes on quality of life will be
      assessed.

      Patients will perform a total of 6 visits: 5 visits during the treatment duration (day 1 -
      day 5) and a Follow-up visit (day 12) will be performed after 7 days from the end of
      treatment (± 2 days in the event that the visit will occur on Sunday).

    <description>The secondary objectives of the study will be to evaluate the analgesic activity of the study drug. Analgesic activity will be evaluated with scoring spontaneous pain. In particular, the secondary outcome of the trial will be the delta of the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS Scale) score (100 mm) evaluated from baseline to day 5 (Visit V5). The 100 mm VAS score will consider a 0 mm value as NO pain, and 100 mm value as the most SEVERE pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>IDN 5243 is a new muscle relaxant molecule. This molecule has showed significant anti-inflammatory activity by intraperitoneal route at 10 mg/kg in both carrageenan induced oedema and granuloma tests. IDN 5243 is a new 3-glycosyl-3-Odemethylthiocolchicine derivative endowed with muscle-relaxant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. The primary packaging of test formulation will be a glass vial containing a solution of IDN 5243, 4 mg/ 1 mL. The secondary package will correspond to the patient's kit and will be a box containing ten (10) vials. The box label will be provided with a tear-off label.</description>
