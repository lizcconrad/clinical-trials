  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to understand, using radiolabelled PF-06463922, how this compound is modified
      by the body once it is absorbed. The study also aims to understand how much of the compound
      is broken down and how much leaves the body unchanged.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects who, at the time of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55
             years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2 and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs)

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week (1 drink = 5 ounces
             [150 mL] of wine or 12 ounces [360 mL] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of hard liquor)
             within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study medication (whichever
             is longer).

          -  Screening supine blood pressure 140 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If blood pressure is 140 mm Hg (systolic)
             or 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the blood pressure should be repeated two more times and the
             average of the three blood pressure values should be used to determine the subject's
             eligibility.

          -  Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF (time from ECG Q wave to the end of
             the T wave corresponding to electrical systole [QT] corrected for the heart rate using
             the Fredericia's formula) &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval (time from ECG Q wave to the end
             of the S wave corresponding to ventricle depolarization) &gt;120 msec. If QTcF exceeds
             450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the
             average of the three QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the subject's
             eligibility.

          -  Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat, if deemed necessary:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transminase (SGOT) or
                  alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transminase (SGPT) 3 x
                  upper limit of normal (ULN);

               -  Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5x ULN; subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may
                  have a direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided
                  the direct bilirubin is ≤ ULN.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. As an
             exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of 1 g/day. Limited use of
             non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor.

        Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued at least 28 days
        prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of
             the study.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Subjects with a history of irregular bowel movements eg, regular episodes of diarrhea
             or constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or lactose intolerance.

          -  Subjects enrolled in a previous radionucleotide study or who have received
             radiotherapy within 12 months prior to screening or such that total radioactivity
             would exceed acceptable dosimetry (ie, occupational exposure of 5 rem per year).

          -  Subjects whose occupation requires exposure to radiation or monitoring of radiation
             exposure.

          -  Subjects who have used tobacco within 90 days prior to dosing.

          -  Male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male subjects able to father children
             who are unwilling or unable to use 2 highly effective methods of contraception as
             outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 90 days after
             the last dose of investigational product or longer based upon the compound's half life
             characteristics.
