    <description>Injectable Artesunate.Each vial contained 60 mg anhydrous artesunic acid, which was dissolved in 1 ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate (provided with the drug) and then mixed with 5 ml saline solution (provided with the drug) before injecting into an indwelling intravenous catheter.
Patients received 2.4 mg/kg bw of parenteral artesunate at H0, H12, H24 and thereafter once daily, for a minimum of 24 hours.
Patients exited from the protocol if they had clinically recovered and parasitaemia was negative.</description>

    <description>Injectable quinine. Each vial contained 250 mg or 500 mg QB.
Patients received a loading dose of 16.6 mg/kg bw of QB by intravenous (IV) infusion over 4 hours followed 8 hours after the start of the loading dose, with a maintenance dose of QB at 8.3 mg/kg bw over 4 hours every 8 hours diluted in 10 ml/kg bw of 10% dextrose solution.
Patients received a minimum of 24 hours of parenteral treatment and exited from the protocol if they had clinically recovered and parasitaemia was negative.</description>

Patients received 12.5 mg/kg bw of QB over 4 hours by IV infusion every 12 hours diluted in 10 ml/kg bw of 10% dextrose solution.
Patients received a minimum of 24 hours of parenteral treatment and exited from the protocol if they had clinically recovered and parasitaemia was negative.</description>
