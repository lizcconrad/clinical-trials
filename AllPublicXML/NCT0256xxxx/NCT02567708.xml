  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled (with rescue
      medication), two period crossover study in subjects with persistent uncontrolled asthma,
      currently not treated with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or long acting beta 2 agonist
      (LABA). This study is the first administration of GSK2269557 to asthmatic subjects, and the
      aims of the study are to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      of four weeks of treatment with orally inhaled GSK2269557 1000 microgram (mcg) in subjects
      with persistent uncontrolled asthma. In a sub-study, biological mediators will be measured
      from induced sputum and blood.

      Approximately 50 subjects will be randomised into the study (including approximately 16
      subjects in the sputum sub-study). Each subject will complete two treatment periods: subjects
      will be randomised to receive GSK2269557 1000 mcg in one treatment period, and matching
      placebo in the other treatment period. Each treatment will be administered once daily for 28
      days (+/- 2 days) via the DISKUS™ dry powder inhaler (DPI).

      The study will consist of a Screening Visit; a Run-in Period (approximately 2 weeks in
      duration); two 28-day Treatment Periods (each with 4 clinic visits); a 4-week Washout Period
      (between the Treatment Periods); and a Follow-up Visit. The total duration of the study for
      each subject will be approximately 16 weeks. DISKUS is a registered trademark of the
      GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

             of systemic corticosteroids (oral, parenteral or depot) within 12 weeks of screening,
             or an inpatient hospitalisation or emergency department visit due to asthma that
             required systemic corticosteroids within 6 months of screening.

          -  Respiratory Infection: culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of
             the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that has not resolved within

             the investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

             laboratory abnormality, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion
             of the investigator (in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor, if required), would
             put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or would confound
