  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot study to explore the potential use of
      routinely collected data in General Practitioner (GP) practices to conduct enhanced safety
      surveillance of seasonal influenza vaccines in the UK, as recommended in the EMA interim
      guidance on enhanced safety surveillance for seasonal influenza vaccines in the EU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data routinely collected as part of clinical consultations in primary care will be extracted
      from nine General Practitioner (GP) practices in order to estimate medically attended Adverse
      Events of Interest (AEIs), for people who have received an influenza vaccine. This study will
      also actively follow patients who were exposed to seasonal influenza vaccination for 7 days
      in three of the nine GP practices using a customised card-based adverse drug reaction
      reporting system, in order to determine whether a more active approach to surveillance can
      capture higher rates of AEIs.
