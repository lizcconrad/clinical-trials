    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of acupuncture on post-stroke overactive bladder symptoms.
      Participants will be put into groups randomly and compared. There are two groups: traditional
      acupuncture and usual care. The ratio of group allocation is 1:1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current practice in management of OAB is quite limited. Acupuncture, which is a major
      treatment modality of traditional Chinese medicine, has also claimed to have favourable
      therapeutic effect on OAB. Previous study found that acupuncture at the BL-33 point was
      effective for controlling the overactive bladder. Although acupuncture has been shown to be
      effective in treating OAB, there has been no randomized controlled trial examining the
      efficacy of acupuncture on patients with post-stroke. Given the high incidence of OAB in
      post-stroke patients, potentially effective alternative treatments should be investigated.

    <description>Acupoints which are empirical for treating OAB in terms of Traditional Chinese medicine theory are used (in the sequence of scalp reproduction area and motor area of the unaffected side, RN3, bilateral BL32, BL33, BL28, BL39). And Ear point urinary bladder, and Ear point uterus will be treated after removal of needles. Needles will be left for 30 minutes and then removed. Subjects will be treated with acupuncture 2 times per week for the first 2 weeks and 1 per week for the 3rd and 4th week.</description>
