  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation represents the standard of care for patients with exacerbation of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, NIV fails in almost 30% of the most severe
      forms of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and patients must undergo endotracheal
      intubation and invasive ventilation to restore adequate gas exchange. Under these
      circumstances, patients may express a clear intention not to be intubated.The aim of this
      study is to retrospectively assess efficacy and safety of noninvasive ventilation-
      plus-extracorporeal Co2 removal in patients who fail NIV and refuse endotracheal intubation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a period of two years (from January 2013 to July 2015) 35 patients with acute
      hypercapnic respiratory failure due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
      refused endotracheal intubation after failing NIV and were treated with extracorporeal Co2
      removal plus NIV as last resort therapy.

      The collected data of these patients will be retrospectively matched with data obtained from
      35 historical controls who received conventional treatment with endotracheal intubation. The
      study will retrospectively compare intubation rate, acid base homeostasis, norepinephrine
      requirements (in the patients who due to clinical conditions were under norepinephrine before
      starting extracorporeal Co2 removal ) and coagulation parameters.
