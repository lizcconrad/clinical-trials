      Acute urticaria is common and affected 12% of population. 400 patients come in department
      emergency of Toulouse each year and there aren't many studies in literature which evaluate
      the glucocorticoids treatment. The standard treatment of urticaria is antihistamines H1, but
      glucocorticoids treatment administered orally for short course would permit to increase
      quickly acute urticaria uncomplicated. Clinical trial, prospective randomized double blinded
      of adults with acute urticaria less 24 hours duration and no take treatment urticaria before.

      Acute urticaria is common and affected 12% of population. 400 patients come in department
      emergency of Toulouse each year and there aren't many studies in literature which evaluate
      the glucocorticoids treatment. Acute urticaria is pruritic and incapacitating for daily life.
      The standard treatment of urticaria is antihistamines H1, but glucocorticoids treatment
      administered orally for short course would permit to increase quickly acute urticaria
      uncomplicated. Clinical trial, prospective randomized double blinded of adults with acute
      urticaria less 24 hours duration and no take treatment urticaria before. One group randomized
      received 40mg of cortancyl and 1 pill of citerizine and another group randomized received 1
      pill citerizine and placebo like cortancyl. Pharmacy hospital takes care of randomization.
      Pruritus evaluated with icth score and rash evaluated with nine rule of Wallace, the patient
      is evaluated in T0, one hour after and contacted by telephone at J2, J5, J15, J 21 itch
      score, Wallace extension, observance, side effects are asked him.
