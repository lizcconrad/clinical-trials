    <textblock>
      This study will follow 40 healthy, vaginally delivered infants that are primarily (&gt;/- 75%)
      breast fed and 40 infants that are exclusively formula fed for at least the first 4 months of
      life from birth until 12 month age. Visits - Subjects will be consented prior to delivery,
      visit 1. Subject will be seen if possible after delivery for instruction on stool collection
      and distribution of supplies, visit 2. Subject will be seen at 6 months of age post
      immunization, visit 3. Subject will be seen prior to 12 month visit. Study staff will contact
      via phone/email to collect information about feeding changes.

      Cord Blood will be collected at birth if possible and peripheral blood will be collected at 6
      month of age (5 to 10 days after receiving their standard 6 month immunizations) and at 12
      months of age prior to their 12 month immunization. Additionally, stool samples will be
      collected within the first week of live and once monthly through 12 months of age.
      Breastfeeding mothers will collect breast milk once monthly at the same time as the stool
      specimen during the period of breastfeeding.
