  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore and assess possible outcome benefits of lactate
      clearance＞30% vs ScvO2 ≥70% in 6 hours as the protocol goal that evaluated adequacy of during
      early resuscitation of septic shock through a single-center randomized controlled study. The
      investigators anticipate to collect 300-400 qualified patients with septic shock who were
      selected from critically ill patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine.
      The participants can be randomized divided into lactate clearance group and SCVO2 group. The
      investigators compared the treatment and the relevant parameters changed after different
      target. 28-day mortality, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, ventilator-free days, and new
      emerged organ failure were collected and compared. 28-day survival curves were drew between
      these two group. And the adverse events of the treatment have also been compared. Through
      this study, the investigators want to answer that whether lactate clearance-oriented therapy
      can reduce the mortality in patients with septic shock, compared with ScvO2-oriented
      protocolised therapy.

    <description>New onset organs dysfunction/failure were defined with reference to internationally accepted criteria as follows. (1) In accordance with the RIFLE criteria, acute kidney injure (AKI) defined as the sudden changes (48 hours) of renal function caused by renal structural or function damaged, showing absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg / dl (≥26.4umol / l), or an increase ≥50% (1.5 times the baseline value), or urine output &lt;0.5 ml/kg/h for over 6 hours. (2) Acute liver injury is defined as ALT increased more than 1 times. (3) Acute myocardial injury is defined as emerging symptoms of myocardial ischemia. ECG changes suggested myocardial ischemia (ST segment elevation or depression, or pathologic Q waves), and biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis was typical increased (troponin and creatine kinase). (4) Based on the Berlin definition, acute lung injury is defined as oxygenation index &lt;300mmHg with PEEP ≥5 cmH2O.</description>

    <description>First, either crystalloid or colloid could be given to achieve a CVP of 8 to 12 mm Hg. Second, if the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was less than 65 mm Hg, norepinephrine was administrated to maintain MAP ≥65 mm Hg. If the mean arterial pressure was higher than 90 mm Hg, vasodilators were given until it was 90 mm Hg or below. Finally, SCVO2 or lactate clearance will be checked to determine red blood cells transfused or not to achieve a haematocrit of at least 30%. If ScvO2 or lactate clearance remains unmet target value, dobutamine could be used in the treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with septic shock were assessed for inclusion, which required that patients
             be older than 18 years with confirmed or presumed infection, met two or more criteria
             for systemic inflammatory response syndrome [16], and evidence of refractory
             hypotension or a serum lactate level above 4 mmol per liter.

          -  Refractory hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg,
             or a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg , after an intravenous fluid
             challenge of 20 ml or more per kilogram of body weight.

          -  Patients had to be enrolled in the study within 2 hours after the earliest detection
             of septic shock and within 12 hours after arrival ICU.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients were excluded if they meet any one of follows: an age of less than 18
