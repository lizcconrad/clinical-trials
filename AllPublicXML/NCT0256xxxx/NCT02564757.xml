      The investigators will examine if pregnancy increases risk of ventral hernia recurrence

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will establish a cohort of female fertile patients who underwent ventral
      hernia repair (Umbilical, Epigastric and Incisional hernia repair) registered in the Danish
      Hernia Database. The investigators will link these data at an individual level with the
      Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR), Danish Medical Birth Registry (DMBR) and the Danish
      Civil Registry (CPR).

      From DMBR, subsequent pregnancies in the study cohort will be noted. From DNPR, ventral
      hernia recurrence, defined as clinical recurrence and/or reoperation for recurrence will be
      noted. Cases registered with both clinical recurrence and reoperation for recurrence, the
      date of the earliest registration will be defined as the date of ventral hernia recurrence.

      From CPR, date of death or emigration will be noted.

      Through an extended Cox regression analysis, handling pregnancy as a time-dependent variable,
      the investigators will examine whether pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of
      ventral hernia recurrence.
