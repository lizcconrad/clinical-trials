  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, multi-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
      of apaziquone in patients with ≤4 non-muscle invasive bladder tumors, ≤3.5 cm in diameter,
      all of which must have been fully resected at TURBT.

      In addition to Screening, patients will undergo an assessment of urothelial carcinoma of the
      bladder via cystoscopy for clinically apparent tumor Ta, G1-G2.

      Following TURBT on Day 1, eligible patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms
      in a 1:1:1 ratio:

      Arm 1 : One dose of Apaziquone

      Arm 2 : Two Doses of Apaziquone

      Arm 3 : Placebo

      Primary endpoint is to evaluate the Time to Recurrence with either a one instillation of 4 mg
      apaziquone or two instillations of 4 mg apaziquone relative to placebo instillation following
      TURBT in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who receive transurethral
      resection bladder tumor (TURBT).

      This is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, multi-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
      of apaziquone in patients with ≤4 non-muscle invasive bladder tumors, ≤3.5 cm in diameter,
      all of which must have been fully resected at TURBT.

      In addition to Screening, patients will undergo an assessment of urothelial carcinoma of the
      bladder via cystoscopy for clinically apparent tumor Ta, G1-G2.

      Following TURBT on Day 1, eligible patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms
      in a 1:1:1 ratio :

      Arm 1 : One Dose of Apaziquone:

        -  Day 1: administration of 4 mg of apaziquone 60±30 minutes post-TURBT

        -  Day 15 (±5 days): administration of placebo

      Arm 2 : Two Doses of Apaziquone :

        -  Day 1 : administration of 4 mg of apaziquone 60±30 minutes post-TURBT

        -  Day 15 (±5 days): administration of 4 mg of apaziquone

      Arm 3: Placebo :

        -  Day 1 : administration of placebo 60±30 minutes post-TURBT

        -  Day 15 (±5 days) : administration of placebo

      Once randomized, Day 1 study drug instillation will occur 60 ±30 minutes post TURBT. Patients
      will return on Day 15 (±5 days) for a second instillation unless their pathology results are
      available and show non Ta, G1-G2 histology; in the absence of local pathology results by the
      Day 15 visit, patients will receive a second instillation of study drug. All histology
      specimens will be reviewed by a local pathology laboratory and all clinical treatment
      decisions and study analyses will be based on the local pathology review. Patients whose
      pathology is other than Ta, G1-G2 will be followed for safety at Day 35 (±5 days) from the
      last dose of study drug and then discontinued from the study.

      Patients with pathology confirmed Ta, G1-G2 disease will be followed according to the
      schedule below :

        -  Cystoscopic examination and urine cytology every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from
           date of TURBT) through 24 months for tumor recurrence and progression.

        -  If at any time during the 24 month follow up period there is a tumor recurrence, the
           patient will continue on study with follow-up cystoscopic examination and urine cytology
           every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from date of TURBT) through the end of 24 months.
           Patients with a recurrence are permitted to have a follow-up TURBT.

        -  If at any time during the 24 month follow up period there is a tumor recurrence and/or
           patient is started on another therapy, the patient will be followed by telephone, for
           safety every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from date of TURBT) through the end of 24
           months.

      Duration of Study: The duration of the study for each patient will be approximately 24 months
      including:

        -  Screening Period : 30-days

        -  Treatment Period : Day 1 and Day 15 (±5 days)

        -  Safety and Follow-up Period: 24-months
