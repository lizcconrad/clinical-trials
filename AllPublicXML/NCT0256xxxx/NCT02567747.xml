      The purpose of this study is to provide data on trends of morbidity due to Acute Otitis Media
      (AOM) (primary analysis) and morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia, and AOM related health
      care resources before and after the introduction of vaccination against pneumococcal disease
      within the Universal Mass Vaccination (UMV) in Colombia.
