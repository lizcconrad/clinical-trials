  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better define the potential molecular and anti-inflammatory
      changes induced by the modified Atkins diet in the brains of patients with treatment
      resistant epilepsy. The investigators plan to enroll 30 subjects overall in this study to
      compare serologic and brain tissue specimens. At NYU, investigators plan to enroll 20
      subjects; an estimated ten (10) subjects will consume a modified Atkins diet for 3-4 weeks
      prior to surgery and an estimated ten (10) subjects will consume a non-modified, higher
      carbohydrate diet. Investigators at Saint Barnabas Medical Center plan to enroll 10 subjects
      in this study to compare serologic and brain tissue specimens. Approximately five (5)
      subjects will consume a modified Atkins diet for 3-4 weeks prior to surgery and five (5)
      subjects will consume a non-modified, higher carbohydrate diet. Blood and brain tissue
      specimens will be obtained at the time of surgery and will be compared. The goal of this
      study is to identify whether or not there are changes in neuroinflammation or
      neuroexcitability in the human brain induced by the modified Atkins diet.

    <description>For those in the MAD intervention group, the dietitian trains the patient and family in the preparation and management of this specialized therapy including sick-day guidelines, meal planning, carbohydrate counting and trouble-shooting. Written and verbal education including, but not limited to: recipes, education materials, sample meal plans and carbohydrate counters are provided to the patient during the initial education session. The caregiver/patient is trained in the outpatient setting and the diet is implemented at home with as much email/phone support from the dietician and ketogenic team as the patient needs to successfully maintain the diet. Medications are all changed over to the lowest carbohydrate forms to eliminate excess carbohydrate intake and all patients are started on vitamin supplements to maintain adequate nutrition.</description>
