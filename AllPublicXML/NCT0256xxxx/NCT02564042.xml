    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of two concentrations (0.5 percent [%] and
      1%) and two application frequencies (once a day and twice a day) of GSK2894512 cream for the
      topical treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Results from this study will be
      considered when selecting the most appropriate concentration of GSK2894512 cream and dosing
      frequency in future clinical safety and efficacy studies. This is a multicenter (United
      States, Canada, and Japan), randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblind), vehicle-controlled,
      6-arm, parallel-group, dose-finding study. Two concentrations of GSK2894512 cream (0.5% and
      1%) and a vehicle control cream will be equally randomized and evaluated following
      application to all psoriasis lesions (except on the scalp) once daily (evening) or twice
      daily (morning and evening) for 12 weeks. This study will consist of 3 periods: up to 4 weeks
      screening, 12 weeks double-blind treatment, and 4 weeks post-treatment follow-up. The total
      duration of subject participation will be approximately 16 to 20 weeks. Approximately 270
      adult males and females subjects with plaque psoriasis will be screened in order to have at
      least 228 randomized subjects (38 subjects for each of the 6 treatment groups) and
      approximately 204 evaluable subjects overall. Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized in
      Japan to achieve at least 24 evaluable Japanese subjects.

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant's psoriasis. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. Each assessment was made as a visual 'average' of the severity of all treated areas at the time of the assessment. The scores ranged from 0 to 4 where 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate and 4=Severe. The percentage of responders that is, participants who achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1 and a minimum 2-grade improvement from Baseline were summarized. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose. The analysis was performed on modified intent-to-treat (mITT) Population which comprised of all randomized participants except those enrolled at center ID 220008.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a standard clinical tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis based on severity of erythema, thickness and scale, as well as the extent of body surface area (BSA) affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs were graded on a 5 point scale (0 to 4) and the % BSA affected was scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6) for each of the 4 specified body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities). The individual scores were multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region. The sum of these scores gave the overall PASI score. Higher scores indicated more severe disease. The percentage of participants with &gt;=75% improvement in PASI from Baseline were summarized. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

    <description>The extent of BSA affected by psoriasis is a general indicator of disease severity and was measured throughout the study. The extent of BSA to which study treatment was applied was also recorded. For the purpose of approximate clinical estimation, the total palmar surface of the palm plus 5 digits was assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1 percent BSA. Assessment of BSA affected with psoriasis was performed separately for four body surface regions: the head, the upper extremities, the trunk and the lower extremities, corresponding to 10, 20, 30 and 40 percent of the total body area, respectively. The mean change in percent BSA affected from Baseline was summarized for each study visit. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 to 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Confirmed clinical diagnosis of chronic stable plaque psoriasis for &gt;=6 months.

          -  Body surface area involvement &gt;=1% and &lt;=15%, excluding scalp, at Screening and
             Baseline.

          -  A PGA of psoriasis score &gt;=2 at Baseline.

          -  One target plaque located on the trunk or proximal parts of extremities (excluding
             knees, elbows, and intertriginous areas) that is at least 3 (centimetre) cm х 3 cm in
             size at Screening and Baseline with a severity representative of the subject's overall
             disease.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a
             negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin test), not lactating, and at least one of
             the following conditions applies: Non-reproductive potential defined as: 1)
             Pre-menopausal females with one of the following procedures documented: tubal
             ligation; hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of
             bilateral tubal occlusion; hysterectomy; bilateral oophorectomy. 2) Post-menopausal
             defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample
             with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels consistent with
             menopause and falling into the central laboratory's postmenopausal reference range is
             confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt are required to use one of the highly effective contraception
             methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrolment; Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in
             the modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of
             reproductive potential from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and
             until (at least five terminal half-lives OR until any continuing pharmacologic effect
             has ended, whichever is longer) after the last dose of study medication and completion
             of the follow-up visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any sign of infection of any of the psoriatic lesions.

          -  A history or ongoing serious illness or medical, physical, or psychiatric condition(s)
             that, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with the subject's completion of
             the study.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study treatment excipients, or a history of drug or
             other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones), presence of
             hepatitis B surface antigen, or positive hepatitis C antibody test result within 3
             months of screening.

          -  Liver function tests: alanine aminotransferase &gt;=2x upper limit of normal (ULN);
             alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable
             if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  QTc &gt;=450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;=480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block.

        NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's
        formula (QTcF), with machine over-read. The QTc should be based on a single ECG obtained
        over a brief recording period. If QTc is outside of the threshold value, triplicate ECGs
        may be performed with the QTc values averaged.

          -  Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy or prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources
             of UV radiation (eg, sunlight or tanning booth) within 4 weeks prior to the baseline
             visit and/or intention to have such exposure during the study, which is thought by the
             investigator to potentially impact the subject's psoriasis.

          -  Used any of the following treatments within the indicated washout period before the
             baseline visit: 1) 12 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) - biologic agents
             (eg, 24 weeks for alefacept, 12 weeks for etanercept, 15 weeks for ustekinumab); 2) 12
             weeks - oral retinoids (eg, acitretin or isotretinoin); 3) 8 weeks - cyclosporin,
             interferon, methotrexate, other systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents,
             or psoralen plus UVA light treatment; 4) 4 weeks - systemic corticosteroids or
             adrenocorticotropic hormone analogs; 5) 2 weeks - immunizations; drugs known to
             possibly worsen psoriasis, such as beta-blockers (eg, propranolol), lithium, iodides,
             angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and indomethacin, unless on a stable dose
             for &gt;12 weeks; 6) 2 weeks - topical treatments: corticosteroids, immunomodulators,
             anthralin (dithranol), Vitamin D derivatives, retinoids, or coal tar (used on the
             body).

          -  Participated in a clinical study and received an investigational product within the
             following time period prior to the baseline visit: 4 weeks, 5 half-lives, or twice the
             duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is
             longer).

          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last 2 years.

          -  Participated in a previous study using GSK2894512 (or WBI-1001).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Have a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 12 and a Minimum 2-grade Improvement in PGA Score From Baseline to Week 12</title>
        <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant’s psoriasis. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. Each assessment was made as a visual ‘average’ of the severity of all treated areas at the time of the assessment. The scores ranged from 0 to 4 where 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate and 4=Severe. The percentage of responders that is, participants who achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1 and a minimum 2-grade improvement from Baseline were summarized. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose. The analysis was performed on modified intent-to-treat (mITT) Population which comprised of all randomized participants except those enrolled at center ID 220008.</description>

        <description>The PASI is a standard clinical tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis based on severity of erythema, thickness and scale, as well as the extent of body surface area (BSA) affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs were graded on a 5 point scale (0 to 4) and the % BSA affected was scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6) for each of the 4 specified body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities). The individual scores were multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region. The sum of these scores gave the overall PASI score. Higher scores indicated more severe disease. The percentage of participants with &gt;=75% improvement in PASI from Baseline were summarized. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Minimum 2 Grade Improvement in PGA Score From Baseline to Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant’s psoriasis. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. Each assessment was made as a visual ‘average’ of the severity of all treated areas at the time of the assessment. The scores ranged from 0 to 4 where 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate and 4=Severe. The percentage of participants who achieved a minimum 2-grade improvement from Baseline for each study visit were summarized. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a PGA Score of 0 or 1 at Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant’s psoriasis. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. Each assessment was made as a visual ‘average’ of the severity of all treated areas at the time of the assessment. The scores ranged from 0 to 4 where 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate and 4=Severe. The percentage of participants who achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1 from Baseline at each study visit was summarized. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Percent of BSA Affected With Psoriasis From Baseline to Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>The extent of BSA affected by psoriasis is a general indicator of disease severity and was measured throughout the study. The extent of BSA to which study treatment was applied was also recorded. For the purpose of approximate clinical estimation, the total palmar surface of the palm plus 5 digits was assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1 percent BSA. Assessment of BSA affected with psoriasis was performed separately for four body surface regions: the head, the upper extremities, the trunk and the lower extremities, corresponding to 10, 20, 30 and 40 percent of the total body area, respectively. The mean change in percent BSA affected from Baseline was summarized for each study visit. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in PASI Score From Baseline to Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>The PASI is a standard clinical tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis based on severity of erythema, thickness and scale, as well as the extent of BSA affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs were graded on a 5 point scale (0=None to 4=Severe) and the percent of BSA affected is scored on a 7-point scale (0=0% involvement to 6=90-100%) for each of 4 specified body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities). The individual scores were multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region. The sum of these scores gave the overall PASI score. PASI score ranged from 0=no psoriasis to 72=worse psoriasis. The mean change in PASI score from Baseline was summarized for each study visit. Baseline was the latest assessment prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>PGA Scores at Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant’s psoriasis. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. Each assessment was made as a visual ‘average’ of the severity of all treated areas at the time of the assessment. The scores ranged from 0 to 4 where 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate and 4=Severe. The mean of PGA scores at each study visit was summarized. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in PGA Score From Baseline to Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant’s psoriasis. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. Each assessment was made as a visual ‘average’ of the severity of all treated areas at the time of the assessment. The scores ranged from 0 to 4 where 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate and 4=Severe. The mean change in PGA scores from Baseline was summarized for each study visit. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Individual Target Lesion Grading Scores From Baseline to Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>A single target lesion of at least 3 centimeter (cm) x 3 cm was selected at Baseline. For the selected lesion, the severity of erythema, scaling and plaque thickness (induration) was assessed by the investigator on a 5-point scale ranging from 0=none to 4=severe. The mean change in individual grading scores from Baseline was summarized for each study visit. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Weekly Average Itch/Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) From Baseline to Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>The participant reported itch severity was obtained from the response of the participants to the itch NRS item in the psoriasis symptom diary (PSD). PSD was developed to assess daily self-reports of psoriasis symptoms and the functional impact related to the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. The participants answered questions related to the severity and impact of the signs and symptoms daily using a 11 point NRS with scores ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). Mean change in itch/pruritis NRS from Baseline to each study visit was presented. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the post dose weekly average value minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PGA Score of 0 or 1 and a Minimum 2 Grade Improvement From Baseline to Each Study Visit</title>
        <description>The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a participant’s psoriasis. It is a static 5-point morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, plaque thickness, and scaling as guidelines. Each assessment was made as a visual ‘average’ of the severity of all treated areas at the time of the assessment. The scores ranged from 0 to 4 where 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate and 4=Severe. The percentage of responders that is, participants who achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1 and a minimum 2-grade improvement from baseline were summarized. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant under clinical investigation, temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, other situations and is associated with liver injury or impaired liver function. A TEAE is defined as an AE which occurred on or after study treatment start date and on or before the last visit. Number of participants with AEs and SAEs were presented. The analysis was performed on safety Population which comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of change in levels of alk phos, ALT, AST and GGT from Baseline throughout the study. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment (including unscheduled visits) prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Direct Bilirubin (Bil), Bilirubin (Bil), Creatinine and Urate.</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of change in levels of direct bil, bil, creatinine and urate from Baseline throughout the study. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment (including unscheduled visits) prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of change in Hgb levels and MCHC from Baseline throughout the study. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment (including unscheduled visits) prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Hematology Data of Clinical Importance</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of hematology parameters including hematocrit, Hgb, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets. The number of participants with clinically significant abnormal values of the mentioned hematology parameters was presented. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment (including unscheduled visits) prior to the first dose. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of change from Baseline in immunophenotype levels including CD19, CD3, CD3TFLC, CD3+CD8+, CD3+CD8+ TFLC, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD4+ TFLC, CD16+CD56+, CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127 flow cytometry (CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127), CD3+CD4+foxP3+CD25+CD127 flow cytometry (CD3+CD4+fP3+CD25+CD127) and T-B cell NKL. Baseline was defined as the latest assessment (including unscheduled visits) prior to the first dose and change from Baseline was defined as the value at post dose visit minus the Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category title).</description>

For multiple ECGs at one visit, or &quot;Any time post-screen&quot;, a participant is categorized as &quot;Abnormal&quot; if &gt;=1 assessment is abnormal.
