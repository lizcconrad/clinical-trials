    <textblock>
      An open-labeled phase II study to investigate preliminary efficacy using p53 gene therapy in
      treatment of diabetes concurrent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It was found in the treatment of HCC using p53 gene therapy that the concurrent diabetes was
      controlled as well. The objectives of this study are to investigate both anti-diabetic and
      anti-tumor role of p53 gene therapy. This is an open-labeled, randomized, active-controlled
      phase 2 study. p53 will be injected via the artery, which supplies blood for the tumor
      nodules. The study endpoints for anti-diabetic role are fasting plasma glucose (FPG),
      postprandial glucose (PPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) at 30 days after the start of
      treatment; and for antitumor effect are progression-free survival and overall survival.
