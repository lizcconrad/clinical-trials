  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will demonstrate proof-of-mechanism of HIF1A inhibition by a decrease
      of HIF1A mRNA after intravenous (IV) infusion of RO7070179 in participants with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have failed at least one line of systemic therapy. This
      will be a single arm study and all participants will receive RO7070179, 13 milligram per
      kilogram per week (mg/kg/week), 2-hour IV infusion on Days 1 and 4 during Week 1 of Cycle 1,
      followed by once weekly in 6 week cycle. Treatment with RO7070179 will be continued until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

If a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in more than 33% of participants at any time, the dose will be reduced to 10 mg/kg/week. The dose will be further reduced to 6 mg/kg/week if more than 33% of treated participants have a DLT.</description>

             criteria).

             to the potential for prolonged half-life of RO7070179 in the liver.

          -  Known, clinically suspected, or history of CNS tumor involvement.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, investigational therapeutic agent, or other therapy
             used to treat HCC within 4 weeks before the first scheduled administration of
             RO7070179.

          -  Participants who have not recovered from any reversible side effects (except alopecia)
             to Grade 0 or 1 toxicity attributed to the administration of an investigational
             therapeutic agent, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or other agents
