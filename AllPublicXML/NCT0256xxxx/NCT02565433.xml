      The aim of the study is to assess prospectively the impact of radiosurgery on the quality of
      life in patients with brain metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who meet the selection criteria and who have accepted to participate at the
      study will answer different questionnaires of the study before radiosurgery and at 3, 6, 9
      and 12 months after the treatment of brain metastases. Baseline examinations will be done
      before receiving the treatment during the hospitalisation for the Gamma Knife treatment, and
      then they will be repeated at the evaluation visits which are classically done every 3
      months. MRI's will also be performed every 3 months. In this way, no additional travel or MRI
      will be carried out as part of the study.

    <description>The type of associated treatments are: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, corticoids, anti-epileptics, psychotropic drugs.
The different scales are QLQ C30, BN20 (quality of life), IADL (autonomy), HADS (anxiety-depression), ESAS (quality of life) and MoCA (cognition)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with newly diagnosed brain metastases

          -  Patient with cancer regardless of the type of primary cancer, with anatomopathological
             proof

          -  At least, one measurable lesion ≥ 10 mm on the MRI T1 gadolinium sequences

          -  Number of brain metastases lower or equal to 5

          -  Indication of radiosurgery treatment

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  ECOG-PS 0-2

          -  Expected survival &gt; 3 months

          -  Ability to complete self-administered questionnaires. If the patient has a motor
             disability (hemibody deficit) that does not allow to complete himself the
             questionnaires, these will be read by a CRA of the Neurosurgery department who will
             outline the questions without making any comment.

          -  A non-opposition form must have been completed by the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous cancer (&lt; 5 years) except of carcinoma of cervix uteri, basal cell or
             squamous cell skin carcinoma adequately treated

          -  Previous brain radiotherapy

          -  Neurological pathology with cognitive disorders existing before the study

          -  Having a contraindication for MRI

          -  Associated leptomeningeal disease

          -  Patients having another severe or uncontrolled pathology which could compromise the
             participation at the study (such as infection, cardiovascular, digestive, renal or
             pulmonary disease)

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding woman. The women must not breastfeed for at least 6 months

          -  Impossibility to submit to the medical examinations of the study due to geographic,
             social or mental reasons
