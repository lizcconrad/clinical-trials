      The purpose of the study is to develop methods to identify predictors of Malignant
      Hyperthermia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will use the combination of electronic medical records and genomic
      information in samples of persons who have exhibited signs of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) or
      have family history or high risk of MH to see if risk factors can be identified. These will
      be compared with control samples of children who have been exposed to the same agents which
      could induce MH, yet showed no signs of the disorder.

        Cases are selected from the medical records at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
        Center who have a current malignant hyperthermia diagnosis. Control cases are selected
        based on previous participation in pharmacogenetic research and had exposure to agents
        known to trigger malignant hyperthermic episodes.
