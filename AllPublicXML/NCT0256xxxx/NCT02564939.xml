      Delirium is a common morbid condition in hospitalized adults. Treatment of delirium has been
      unsatisfactory and prevention is the preferred goal. Based on limited experimental research,
      ramelteon appears to have promise for prevention. This study will evaluate ramelteon in
      prevention of delirium in a hospitalized adult population age 65+ in a double-blinded RCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a very common condition that is associated with significant complications in
      hospitalized adults.

      The manifestations of delirium are the result of a disturbance of brain functioning, the
      causes of which include a very wide array of illnesses, intoxications, and stresses. Delirium
      has been estimated to affect 20-50% of hospitalized patients, and to be associated with
      longer hospital stay (2x), greater likelihood of discharge to nursing home (2x), and higher
      rate of death (2x). 20% have delirium on admission. Patients who experience delirium may have
      persistent confusion (cognitive impairment). In 20%, this confusion appears to be permanent.
      Treatment of delirium has been unsatisfactory. Once it develops, no therapy or intervention
      has demonstrated a meaningful reduction of delirium associated complications. Prevention is
      clearly the preferred goal. Based on limited reports, ramelteon appears to have the most
      promise for prevention. Ramelteon, FDA approved (2005) as a nonscheduled prescription
      hypnotic agent, is generally considered safe and effective with no serious associated side
      effects, and no limitation of duration of use. It is related to melatonin in action and
      shares sleep promoting effects (reduced sleep latency) and improvement in coordination of
      circadian cycles. A recent randomized placebo-controlled single blinded trial of ramelteon
      treated 33 patients with ramelteon 8 mg/d. The researchers reported that ramelteon was
      associated with a dramatically lower risk of delirium (3% vs 32%; P = .003), with a relative
      risk of 0.09. Estimates of time to develop delirium were delayed for ramelteon compared to
      placebo, and the frequency of delirium was significantly lower in ramelteon compared to
      placebo (P = .002). There were significant limitations of this study, however, including a
      very high exclusion rate (1059 of 1126 [94%] patients assessed were excluded), a 24+ hour
      delay in initiation of study agent, a small sample size, and unclear sampling bias. The
      investigators propose a clinical trial of ramelteon to prevent delirium in patients admitted
      to Hartford Hospital. Hartford Hospital is in a unique position to conduct this study having
      established the ADAPT program to systematically apply best practices to the assessment and
      management of delirium. A registry of patients screened contains all of the screening results
      (over 1.5 million CAM screens on nearly 91,000 patients). Our study will permit us to
      evaluate the recent limited research findings regarding ramelteon in a larger general adult
      hospitalized population, and evaluate the potential benefit of treatment started earlier in
      the course of a hospitalization.
