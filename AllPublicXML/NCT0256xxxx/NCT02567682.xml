    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of GBT440 on
      caffeine (a CYP1A2 probe substrate), S warfarin (a CYP2C9 probe substrate), omeprazole (a
      CYP2C19 probe substrate), and midazolam (a CYP3A4 probe substrate) plasma concentrations.
