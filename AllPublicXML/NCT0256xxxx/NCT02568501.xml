  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will compare a novel approach using daily financial
      incentives and a tiered sponsor network to motivate adolescents and young adults with type 1
      diabetes to improve glycemic control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be given daily glucose monitoring goals of ≥4 glucose checks per day with
      ≥1 readings within goal range (70-180 mg/dL) and provided with iHealth wireless glucometers.
      Half of the study participants will be randomized to the 3-month intervention arm on Way to
      Health. The intervention includes daily financial incentives ($60 in an account at beginning
      of each month with $2 daily loss if non-adherent) and a 2-level tiered sponsor network (youth
      select 2 people who will be notified of non-adherence after 2 and 5 consecutive days). The
      primary outcome will be HbA1c at 3 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes will
      include HbA1c at 6 months and the proportion of participants adherent to daily glucose
      monitoring goals. Exit interviews will elicit intervention feasibility and feedback from a
      youth perspective.
