  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot trial investigating cognitive training in
      older Veterans with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to assess training effects,
      acceptability of training to participants, and to explore whether other factors influence
      training effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study of older Veterans (60-85 years old) who have 1) a history of repetitive mild TBI or
      at least one moderate TBI and 2) subjective cognitive complaints. Participants will be
      randomized to one of three conditions for 4 weeks: Project:Evolution (EVO) multitask video
      game, EVO words video game, or an assessment only control condition. Participants will
      complete assessment visits at baseline, post-intervention (1 month after baseline), and 3
      months post-intervention (4 months after baseline).
