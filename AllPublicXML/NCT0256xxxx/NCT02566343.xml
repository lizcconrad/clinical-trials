  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study intends to investigate the incidence of postoperative pulmonary
      complications (PPC) or in-hospital mortality in patients with COPD or at risk for COPD
      undergoing high-risk noncardiac major surgery and to identify relevant risk factors.
      Furthermore, this study aims to quantify and compare the diagnostic performance of
      preoperative functional tests, exercise capacity, clinical assessment tests and predictive
      scoring systems to predict PPC or in-hospital mortality in these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality and PPC frequently occur
      in these patients. However, concepts for preoperative pulmonary risk assessment and the
      predictive value of routine preoperative exercise capacity, clinical assessment and pulmonary
      function tests are still poorly characterized.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the incidence of the composite end point of PPC or all cause in-hospital
           mortality in patients with confirmed COPD (spirometry) and patients with clinical risk
           factors in whom spirometry disproved COPD.

        -  To determine the predictive value of exercise capacity, clinical assessment tests,
           pulmonary function tests and predictive scoring systems to predict the composite end
           point in these patients.

        -  To identify relevant risk factors and predictors associated with the composite end
           point.

      Methodology:

      Prospective observational, case-control study of 320 patients -240 with confirmed and 80 with
      disproved COPD- undergoing high-risk noncardiac major surgery (365 patients enrolled).

      All patients receive a structured preoperative pulmonary risk assessment with:

        1. standardized clinical questionnaire

        2. COPD Assessment Test (CAT™)

        3. exercise capacity (symptom-limited stair climbing)

        4. spirometry

        5. capillary blood gas Analysis

      Postoperative follow-up is planned between the 2nd and 5th day after extubation.

        Patients scheduled for major surgery, who present in the pre-assessment clinic of the
        University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf during the study recruitment period, will be
        screened for eligibility. Patients with typical clinical signs and a positive COPD
        Assessment Test (CAT™) qualify for spirometry. After informed consent 80 patients with
        disproved COPD (FEV1/FVC ratio ≥ 0.70) and 240 patients with confirmed COPD (FEV1/FVC ratio
        &lt; 0.70) will consecutively be analysed.
