    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide oral panobinostat (PAN) treatment to relapsed or
      relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients who are without satisfactory treatment
      alternatives prior to the commercial availability* and reimbursement of panobinostat during
      the regulatory approval process. This protocol will acquire additional safety data on the use
      of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib (BTZ) and dexamethasone (Dex) in patients with
      relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In this protocol, PAN must be
      administered in the defined regimen in combination with both BTZ and DEX.

      *(Note: throughout this protocol &quot;commercially available&quot; means local health authority
      approval and a functional method for reimbursement)

      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center study of oral panobinostat administered in
      combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed, and relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma.

        -  Panobinostat will be administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone over
           2 weeks in each 21 day cycle; the third week will be without administration of any drug.

        -  Treatment phase 1 will consist of 8, 21 day cycles (24 weeks). Patients with clinical
           benefit at the end of cycle 8 as per investigator assessment may continue to receive
           study treatment in phase 2 for a maximum of an additional 24 weeks.

        -  Patients who have not achieved or maintained at least &quot;no change&quot; (EBMT response
           criterion) by 8 cycles must discontinue from study treatment

        -  The protocol will remain open in each participating country until drug is commercially
           available and reimbursable or until July 2017, whichever comes first (except in Norway
           where this protocol will end by March 2016).

      Dosing schedule for treatment is detailed below:

      Treatment Phase 1 (weeks 1-24 starting C1D1)

        -  PAN given three times per week (TIW), weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle (Cycle days
           1,3,5,8,10, and 12)

        -  BTZ given twice a week (BIW) weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle (Cycle days 1,4,8, and 11)

        -  Dex given for 2 days twice a week (BIW), with BTZ on weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle
           (Cycle days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11, and 12)

      Treatment Phase 2 (24 weeks starting C9D1)

        -  PAN given TIW, weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle (Cycle days 1,3,5,8,10, and 12)

        -  BTZ given once a week, weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3 week cycle (Cycle days 1 and 8)

        -  Dex for 2 days once a week with BTZ, weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle (Cycle days 1,2,8,
           and 9)

                  under current therapy or up to 60 days of last dose of this therapy. Patients
                  previously treated with bortezomib are eligible.

             steroids for pain control or management of cord/nerve root compression is eligible.

             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,

                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                  subject.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository In case of use of oral contraception women should have been
                       stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study
                       treatment.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of
        oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
        follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.
