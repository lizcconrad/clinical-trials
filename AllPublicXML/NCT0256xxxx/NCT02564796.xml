  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyanotic congenital cardiac patients require higher hemoglobin concentrations (red blood cell
      levels) for optimal oxygen delivery to the body. Prophylactic erythropoietin (EPO) and iron
      can prevent and/or decrease the amount of blood transfusions needed in this population. We
      seek to investigate if EPO and iron make a clinically significant difference in the number of
      transfusions given to these patients and the morbidity associated with it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease occurs in about 1% of all live births. Cyanotic cardiac lesions in
      particular are at risk for significant mortality and morbidity because of their reduced
      ability to provide adequate oxygenation to the body and the brain. Many experts believe that
      to have adequate oxygen carrying capacity that these infants should ideally have a hemoglobin
      level greater than 13 g/dL. Many of these patients require blood transfusions prior to
      surgery to provide adequate oxygenation. The cause for this is likely multifactorial
      including normal neonatal physiology, frequent lab draws, and co-morbidities. Although rare,
      the morbidity due to transfusions can be devastating to this population including transmitted
      infections, transfusion reactions, extra hospitalizations, and antigen sensitization that
      would complicate heart transplant if needed.

      There are centers in the United States that have developed protocols using erythropoietin to
      minimize blood product transfusions before and after surgery, also referred to as &quot;bloodless
      surgery&quot;. There have been retrospective studies evaluating the success of these protocols,
      but there are no randomized controlled prospective studies that the investigators have
      studying the effects of erythropoietin effects in patients with cyanotic heart disease in
      regards to transfusion prevention.

      Congenital cyanotic cardiac patients require higher hemoglobin concentrations for optimal
      oxygen delivery. Prophylactic erythropoietin can prevent and/or decrease the amount of blood
      transfusions needed prior to surgery. The researchers seek to investigate if erythropoietin
      makes a clinically significant difference in the number of transfusions given to these
      patients and the morbidity associated with it.
