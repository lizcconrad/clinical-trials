  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no clear legal or ethical guidance about how researchers and IRBs ought
      to proceed when the research participant in a biobank is deceased and there is clinically
      relevant information that could be disclosed to family members. This study is designed to
      test a procedure offering genetic information to family members of research participants who
      participated in a pancreatic cancer biobank in a Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act (HIPAA) -compliant design.

  <detailed_description>

      To develop, prototype, and evaluate a novel procedure for offering probands' genetic results
      to family members. The intervention is to offer a deceased research participant's actionable
      germline genetic research finding, and depending upon the choice made by the next of kin, a
      disclosure of the research finding by a genetic counselor in a family conference call. Using
      mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative), the investigators will assess decision making,
      family communication, and actions and responses in individuals from families in which a
      proband is known to have a deleterious germline mutation in one of several known cancer
      susceptibility genes.

    <description>The primary outcome is: relative proportions of individuals who, when offered genetic results of a deceased family member who participated in a biobank study, will decide to learn those results. Uptake will be a binary outcome (Yes/No). We will enumerate the number of invited participants who choose to learn results and who choose not to learn results.</description>
