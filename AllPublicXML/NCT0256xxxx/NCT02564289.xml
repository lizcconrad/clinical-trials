      The current study proposes to investigate the effects of chronic snus use on the blood
      vessels. Several cardiovascular endpoints are measured using various methods in healthy daily
      snus users as well as in healthy matched controls.

    <textblock>
      The Swedish moist oral snuff known as &quot;snus&quot; has previously been found primarily in
      Scandinavia. In Sweden approximately 1 in 5 men are habitual users of snus. It is estimated
      that 3-4% of the female population are regular users. However, the last few years has seen a
      shift in the global tobacco industry towards finding novel ways of entering the smokeless
      tobacco (ST) markets. In the United States both Camel and Marlboro brands, among others, have
      launched an array of ST products similar to Swedish snus. Since its launch in 2007, the US
      snus market has continued to grow at an exponential rate and now sells approximately 50
      million cans a year.

      Smoking has been studied extensively and been undoubtedly linked to a range of detrimental
      health effects, including cardiovascular disease. As snus has until recently been available
      in a limited Scandinavian market, few experimental and epidemiological studies have been
      performed.

      A recent meta-analysis found snus to be associated with heart failure and higher risk of
      fatal myocardial infarctions and stroke. Following myocardial infarction, discontinuation of
      snus use was associated with a 50% decreased risk of mortality.

      With new emerging markets worldwide publicizing the product as a discrete and healthier
      alternative to cigarettes, it has become all the more imperative to study the health effects
      of this smokeless tobacco. Using well validated methods the investigators intend to study the
      possible effects of chronic snus use on vascular endothelial function, thrombosis,
      circulating microparticles in blood and arterial stiffness.

    <description>Venous occlusion plethysmography is a semi-invasive method of estimating vascular function in which brachial forearm blood flow is measured. In combination with intra-arterial infusion of substances with vasodilatory effects (for example bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside and acetylcholine) this method is considered the &quot;golden standard&quot; for assessing endothelial function. Measurements are given in ml/100 ml tissue/min.</description>
