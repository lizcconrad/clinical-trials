      The investigators aimed to evaluate by the Sniffin' Sticks test the effects on olfactory
      functions of nasal steroids and leukotriene antagonists used for allergic rhinitis.Thirty
      patients with seasonal were included in this study. Patients were randomly divided into three
      groups of 10 patients; group 1 received montelukast sodium and mometasone furoate therapy,
      group 2 received only montelukast, and group 3 only mometasone furoate. Patients' olfactory
      functions were determined using the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory test before and after a month
      treatments.

      Threshold, discrimination, identification, and TDI values were not significantly different
      among the groups before treatment. For Group 1 and Group 3 patients, there were statistically
      significant differences in threshold, discrimination, identification, and TDI values before
      and after treatment (p &lt; 0.05) (Wilcoxon signed ranks analysis) For Group 2 patients, the
      before and after treatment values of threshold, discrimination, identification, and TDI
      showed no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05). According to the findings of our study, MF is
      superior to montelukast in improving olfactory function. Although montelukast has been shown
      to be effective against AR symptoms, its effect on olfactory function was not demonstrated in
      this study.
