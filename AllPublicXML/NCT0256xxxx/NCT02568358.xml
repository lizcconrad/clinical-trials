    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Cohen's kappa measures the agreement between methods and the final clinical diagnosis. Both methods (DNA-based testing and standard cultures) will result in isolation of a non-viral pathogen or no isolation of a pathogen. A final clinical diagnosis will classify patients clinically in two categories as non-viral lower respiratory tract infection or no non-viral lower respiratory tract infection usually made 48-72 hours made after sampling. Cohen's kappa will be compared between the two methods.</description>
