    <textblock>
      Temporary stomas has been performed to reduce complications after colorectal cancer surgery,
      especially in high-risk anastomosis. Different closure technics showed different outcome. The
      aim of this study is to compare the VSS score , surgical site infection and pain score of
      pursestring wound closure vs conventional closure.
