      The investigators' hypothesis is that the administration of Fluzone® High-Dose with booster
      to all patients with monoclonal gammopathies (irrespective of age) will lead to
      seroconversion rates exceeding 50% and more importantly, will reduce influenza-related
      morbidity, reduce interruptions in cancer therapy and may reduce disease progression at the
      end of the flu season

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is a major cause of morbidity in the US. Patients with monoclonal gammopathies are
      known to have increased risk of developing influenza. Furthermore, several of the medications
      (such as proteasome inhibitors), commonly used to treat these tumors, are known to further
      increase the risk of these tumors. Seasonal influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce
      influenza related morbidity and is approved for routine prophylaxis in US. In 2009, Fluzone®
      high- dose vaccine was FDA approved in 2009 for adults aged 65 and older based on the data
      regarding higher rates of seroprotection (defined as hemagglutination antibody inhibition
      (HAI) titer of 40 or higher).

      In this study, the investigators will administer Fluzone® High-Dose vaccine with a planned
      booster to patients with monoclonal gammopathies irrespective of age versus a standard of
      care control group. Primary endpoint is composite of documented influenza infection rate and
      disease progression (as defined by International Myeloma Working Group criteria) at the end
      of the flu season. Based on the background data, the investigators expect a higher rate of
      success in the experimental arm. As such, the investigators power for success rates of 90%
      and 70% in the experimental and control arms, respectively.

      The investigators will also analyze several secondary endpoints including rates of influenza
      related morbidity, the analysis of humoral and cellular immune response to these vaccines and
      the rate of disease control (defined as lack of disease progression by standard international
      myeloma working group criteria).
