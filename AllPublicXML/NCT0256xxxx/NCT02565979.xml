    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to investigate if 6 months resveratrol supplementation can
      improve glucose tolerance in overweight/obese individuals. As secondary objectives we want to
      investigate whether resting energy metabolism, intra-hepatic lipid content, physical
      performance, body composition and quality of life change by 6 months resveratrol
      supplementation in these individuals.
