  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is a long term process, starting early in life, and progressively affecting various
      functions and organs. Cardiovascular diseases and cognitive impairment are two conditions
      related to advancing age and sharing common risk factors. The Mona Lisa- PREDOR study is a
      population-based prospective cohort study carried out to develop risk prediction algorithms
      aimed at identifying people who are the most likely to develop impaired psychometric and
      cognitive functioning and impaired cardiovascular risk, in the coming years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at identifying predictors of impaired changes in psychometric and
      cognitive performances and level of cardiovascular risk, over a seven-year period, and to
      develop risk prediction algorithms. Main secondary objectives are to study response to
      psychometric and cognitive tests according to age, and to estimate the prevalence of the
      frailty syndrome according to age.

      The design is a prospective cohort study carried out among 1500 men and women from the
      general population, aged 42-89 years, and living in South-western France. Except for
      participants aged 80-89 years, all participants have been previously assessed in 2005-2007,
      as regard to their psychometric and cognitive performances and level of cardiovascular risk,
      as part of the Mona Lisa study.

      Data collection includes a detailed questionnaire on previous medical history, drug intake,
      education level, and life habits; a standardised clinical examination; psychometric tests
      (word list learning test, digit symbol substitution test, word fluency test and Stroop test),
      and a fasting blood sample. Level of cardiovascular risk and frailty syndrome were assessed.
