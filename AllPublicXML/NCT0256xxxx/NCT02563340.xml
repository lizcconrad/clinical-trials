  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic bone
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on chronic antibody-mediated rejection (cAMR)
      after kidney transplantation. Chronic AMR is diagnosed according to Banff criteria 2013 based
      on renal graft biopsy and donor specific antibodies (DSA) examination. cAMR patients are
      assigned to MSCs group or control group. Patients in control group are prescribed to current
      desensitization therapy including at least one of the following treatments: plasmapheresis
      (PP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab or Bortezomib, depending on individual
      pathological and immunological features (eg. DSA type and titer) of each study subjects.
      Patients in MSCs group receive additional BM-MSCs therapy besides desensitization treatments
      as in control group. Allogeneic BM-MSCs (1*10^6/kg) are intravenously administered every two
      weeks for four consecutive doses. All cAMR patients are followed up for one year. Renal
      function, DSA level, pathological features, patient/graft survival, and severe adverse events
      are monitored during the follow-up period. Immunological features of patients in both groups
      are consecutively examined.
