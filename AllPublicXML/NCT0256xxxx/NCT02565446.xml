  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A variety of liver insults lead to pathological changes in liver architecture that culminate
      in cirrhosis. While invasive liver biopsy was required to detect cirrhosis, the development
      of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has revolutionized our ability to detect liver
      fibrosis through non-invasive means that involve measurement of liver stiffness. However, a
      number of pathological findings occur in liver in response to various insults that precede
      cirrhosis and are clinically important to identify such as steatosis associated with NASH,
      inflammation associated with viral hepatitis, and congestion associated with cardiac
      hepatopathy. Detection of such entities provides essential diagnostic, prognostic, and
      treatment information but yet is not available non-invasively. Recent murine studies from
      this group of investigators has identified that MRE technology can be adapted to
      non-invasively detect these conditions. Implementing this into the practice will transform it
      by obviating the need for invasive liver biopsies in patients suspected of having such forms
      of suspected liver disease. This will differentiate Mayo from other institutions where such
      technology is not available.

      An additional aim of this study is to examine the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on
      the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both common comorbidities of
      obesity. Recent evidence indicates a potential link between OSA and severity of NASH and
      fibrosis, but the mechanisms of OSA- associated hypoxia on liver disease progression in NAFLD
      is unclear. This study offers the unique opportunity to analyze this association, as the
      study population will undergo routine evaluation for OSA, as part as the preoperative work-up
      prior to bariatric surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The role of MRE as a non-invasive tool for estimation of inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD.</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome (correlation of liver histology with MR elastogram) will be assessed once, at the time of bariatric surgery. The enrollment will span over 14 months (10/2015 - 12/2016). No subsequent outcomes will be assessed after bariatric surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>80 participants undergoing bariatric surgery will complete a non-invasive determination of liver inflammation and fibrosis by MRE. All subjects will undergo liver biopsy at the time of bariatric surgery. The liver tissue will be assessed for fat, inflammation, and fibrosis by pathology. We are looking for differentiation of simple steatosis from steatohepatitis and steatohepatitis with fibrosis by non-invasive measures such as MRE.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of liver fibrosis and adipose tissue dysfunction in obese patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea.</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional estimation of liver and adipose tissue histology between subjects with and without sleep apnea will be assessed once, at the time of bariatric surgery.The enrollment will span over 14 months (10/2015 - 12/2016).</time_frame>
    <description>80 participants undergoing bariatric surgery will be assessed on parallel with the obesity epidemic, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects millions of people in the US (approximately 50% of the obese subjects) and may represent an additional risk factor for liver fibrosis progression in patients with NAFLD. We will assess whether subjects with sleep apnea have worse fibrosis in the liver and fat tissue compared to subjects without sleep apnea.</description>

    <description>To evaluate new MRE sequence that is capable of distinguishing liver fibrosis and inflammation. MRE has emerged as the potential alternative to invasive liver biopsy and possibly &quot;the reference standard for non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis&quot;. All 80 participants undergoing bariatric surgery will complete a non-invasive determination of liver inflammation and fibrosis by MRE. The proposed sample size for this experiment will be calculated based on sensitivity and specificity of MRE for differentiating various stages of fibrosis. We are looking for differentiation of simple steatosis from steatohepatitis and steatohepatitis with fibrosis.</description>
