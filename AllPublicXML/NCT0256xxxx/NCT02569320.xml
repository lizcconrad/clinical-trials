  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor AR-42 (AR-42) when given together with pomalidomide in treating patients with
      multiple myeloma that has returned after a period of improvement. HDAC inhibitor AR-42 may
      work to stop cancer growth by blocking an enzyme needed for cell growth. Pomalidomide is a
      drug used in chemotherapy that works to stop the growth of cancer cells by causing them to
      die. Giving HDAC inhibitor AR-42 together with pomalidomide may cause patients to respond
      better to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose, safety and efficacy of AR-42 in combination with
      pomalidomide in relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine time to progression (TTP). II. To determine overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of HDAC inhibitor AR-42 and pomalidomide.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21, dexamethasone PO twice weekly
      (BIW) or thrice weekly (TIW) weeks 1-3, and HDAC inhibitor AR-42 PO BIW or TIW on weeks 1-3.
      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.

    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>In the scenario where the MTD does not follow the assumption of non-decreasing toxicity of dose in both directions of the agent dose combinations, the MTD will be estimated by a bivariate isotonic estimator.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 30 days after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Summary statistics will be computed for baseline biomarkers. The absolute and percent change from baseline will be calculated for each subsequent measurement. Summary statistics will be computed for each collection time point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>From first observation of partial response to the time of disease progression (taking as a reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started), assessed up to 30 days after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier, with a focus on graphical evaluation as well as early timepoint and median estimates of survival distributions.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of toxicity, evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4 standard toxicity grading</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency distributions and other descriptive measures will form the basis of analysis of toxicity number and severity. Adverse events will be summarized by CTCAE v.4 category and perceived causal relationship to the study therapy. Tolerability will also be determined through assessing the number of patients who required dose modifications and/or dose delays in subsequent cycles. In addition, the proportion of patients who go off treatment due to adverse reactions or those who refuse further treatment for lesser toxicities that inhibit their willingness to continue on trial will be captured.</description>

    <measure>Number of patients experiencing objective response, based on criteria adapted from the International Myeloma working Group Uniform Response Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number and percentage of patients experiencing objective response will be descriptively summarized overall and by dose level. The objective response rate will be analyzed by using a 95% confidence interval for the proportion responding at trial closure in the treated population.</description>
