      The goal of this study was to compare early results of Total Hip Replacement (THR) in 2
      groups of patients: with and without closed suction drainage (CSD). Patients were followed
      for 3 months post operatively.

      After approval from the local ethical committee, patients undergoing Total Hip Replacement
      (THR) were included in this study. Patients with previous hip surgeries and coagulation
      disorders were not included. All patients were submitted to a non-cemented Total Hip
      Replacement (THR) through a Hardinge's approach. Before wound closure, a nurse opened an
      envelope containing the patient randomization: group 1 - with closed suction drainage (CSD)
      and group 2 - without closed suction drainage (CSD). In the group 1, a sub-fascial suction
      drain was used, and kept for 24 hours. Data collected included: mid-tigh circumference after
      24 hours, blood transfusion, inflammatory blood markers C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) and leucogram, Harris Hip Score (HHS) after 3 months, and
      complications. Patients were followed for 3 months post operatively.
