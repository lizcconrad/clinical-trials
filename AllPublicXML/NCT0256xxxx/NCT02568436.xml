  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      26 participants from the Orthodontic Department at University of Damascus Dental School will
      be randomly assigned into two groups. In the experimental group, a low level laser with a
      wave length of 830 nm, output of 150 mw, energy of 2 j per point and application time of 15
      seconds per point will be applied on each tooth of the six upper incisors according to this
      protocol: the root will be divided into 2 halves; gingival and cervical. Laser will be
      applied in the center of each half from both the buccal and palatal sides which means 4
      application points and a total energy of 8 j per each tooth. Control group will undergo
      typical orthodontic treatment with the laser device applied the same manner but without being
      turned on (to get the placebo effect for pain reduction effect). This procedure will be
      repeated after 3, 7, 14 days and each 15 days from the beginning of the second month till the
      end of the leveling and alignment stage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long time needed for orthodontic treatment is considered one of the biggest obstacles
      which make patients refuse to undergo treatment. It also has many disadvantages including
      higher caries rates, gingivitis, and root resorption. It also combined commonly with pain,
      which reducing patient acceptance and cooperation with treatment.

      Low level laser therapy in orthodontic has shown pain-reducing effects with an effect in
      biomodulation which lead to increased orthodontic tooth movement rate and reducing risk of
      root resorption.

      A recent systematic review states that low level laser therapy has shown efficiency in
      accelerating orthodontic tooth movement, but there is a need for more studies to determine
      the best protocols regarding energy and frequency. A review of the literature shows that
      there is no randomized controlled trails evaluating its efficiency in accelerating
      orthodontic tooth movement in regard of dental crowding cases, which is the main purpose of
      this study.
