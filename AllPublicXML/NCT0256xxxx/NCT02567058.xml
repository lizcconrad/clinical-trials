      Among Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) the rupture of the Achilles tendon is the most common.
      Up today, the mechanical and elastic properties of the Achilles tendon are still unknown, and
      that both in healthy subjects in pathology. The viscoelastic properties or dynamic mechanical
      properties are directly related to the tendon of the health status and its elongation
      capacity.

      The laboratory UMR Inserm U930 - CNRS ERL 3106 in Tours has developed a non-invasive
      ultrasonic device, named Achillus, which, via an ultrasonic probe, allowing to access the
      viscoelastic properties of the tendon during the contraction of the sural triceps.

      This is what we want to do in this first protocol: in vivo observation of the normal values
      and variations, looking for changes related to hyper solicitation and finally trying to
      highlight a tendon fragility parameter for patients who have experienced of a Achilles tendon
      rupture.

      Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are among the main causes of pain and disability in adults.
      Tendon disorders are an important part of MSD. Among them, the rupture of the Achilles tendon
      is the most common, with a prevalence of about 18 to 100000. The disorder mostly affects men
      between 30 and 50 years. Up today, the mechanical and elastic properties of the Achilles
      tendon are still unknown, and that both in healthy subjects in pathology. The viscoelastic
      properties or dynamic mechanical properties are directly related to the tendon of the health
      status and its elongation capacity. Additional tests that we have to explore the Achilles
      tendon are ultrasound and MRI. They bring mainly morphological information but can not
      demonstrate the mechanical properties of the tendon.

      For this purpose, the laboratory UMR Inserm U930 - CNRS ERL 3106 in Tours has developed a
      non-invasive ultrasonic device, named Achillus, which, via an ultrasonic probe, allowing to
      access the viscoelastic properties of the tendon during the contraction of the sural triceps.
      It is therefore important in the exploratory work we propose to have a proven method of
      calibration of forces applied to the tendon, which is why an ergometer laboratory
      biomechanics and bioengineering at UT Compiègne is associated with our experiments.

      No human study has yet been conducted to evaluate this method in medically relevant
      situations such as hyper solicitation and incorporated rupture.

      This is what we want to do in this first protocol: in vivo observation of the normal values
      and variations, looking for changes related to hyper solicitation and finally trying to
      highlight a tendon fragility parameter for patients who have experienced of a Achilles tendon
      rupture.
