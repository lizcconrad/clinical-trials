      This study the investigators aimed to determine the effect of the herbal porridge containing
      the combined extract of mulberry and Vietnamese coriander (MP) on cognitive function and bone
      formation markers of menopausal women. Forty-five participants were randomly assigned to
      receive a placebo or MP (50, 1500 mg) treatments once daily for 8 weeks.

    <textblock>
      At present, the novel cheap and effective intervention against menopause related symptoms
      such as memory impairment and osteoporosis is still required due to the increased breast
      cancer risk induced by hormone replacement therapy. Based on the role of oxidative stress on
      cognitive deficit in menopause and the synergistic effect of herbs in traditional folklore,
      the cognitive enhancing effects and anti-osteoporosis effects of the functional food
      containing the combined extract of herbs possessing antioxidant effect has gained attention.
      Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of the herbal porridge containing the combined
      extract of mulberry and Vietnamese coriander (MP) on cognitive function and bone formation
      markers of menopausal women. Forty-five participants were randomly assigned to receive a
      placebo or MP (50, 1500 mg) treatments once daily for 8 weeks. The cognitive function and
      working memory were assessed via the auditory oddball paradigm of event-related potentials
      and computerized battery tests respectively prior to the intervention, 1 month, 2 month, and
      at delay 1 month. Bone formation markers including serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and
      osteocalcin were determine prior to the intervention and at the end of study.
