  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric obesity has become a critical health problem worldwide, increasing the premature
      onset of obesity-related morbidities. This phenomenon has induce an increase in the incidence
      of serious health complications starting in childhood and adolescence. Lifestyle
      interventions, including diet and regular physical activity, are the cornerstone of current
      medical management. Unfortunately, these interventions are often ineffective in providing a
      meaningful and long-lasting weight loss necessary to change health outcomes. It has been
      demonstrated that an early intervention in obesity in children and adolescents, inducing
      weight loss by performing bariatric surgery in carefully selected patients, can dramatically
      reduce the risk of adulthood obesity and obesity-related diseases, including non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

      Recent evidence suggest that bariatric surgery can improve metabolic complications and liver
      involvement in patients affected by morbid obesity.

    <description>These patients (no. 20) are assessed by clinical and psychological evaluation (auxological parameters, blood pressure and personal and family history), blood tests (liver function test's (LFT's), uric acid, lipid and gluco-insulinemic profile with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)), abdominal ultrasound at time of enrollment.
They are treated with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy associated to lifestyle intervention. Concomitantly to surgical intervention, liver biopsy is performed.
At 6 and 12 months after LSG the patients are evaluated with laboratory, clinical and echographic assessment. Moreover, one year after LSG liver biopsy is repeated.</description>
