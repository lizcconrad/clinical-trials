  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to develop a clinical data registry that can be used to facilitate
      research with the ultimate goal of reducing the morbidity and/or mortality and improving the
      quality of life of patients diagnosed or living with hairy cell leukemia. With approximately
      600 new cases of this rare disease identified in the US each year, HCL represents 2% of all
      cases of leukemia in adults. Considering the rarity of this chronic leukemia, the Hairy Cell
      Leukemia Foundation (HCLF), in partnership with investigators from its Centers of Excellence,
      seeks to develop a registry to help researchers identify new trends in outcomes, recognize
      the most effective treatments, discover previously unknown complications of the disease, and
      design clinical trials for new therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical registry is being established to collect de-identified information on this rare
      disease. The registry created by assimilation of de- identified coded patient data will
      centralize information that can be used to improve the management of the many complications
      of this disease and its treatment. This study is focused on collection of clinically and
      biologically meaningful endpoints across multiple institutions; as such, it is not focused on
      a specific set of hypotheses but will collect data that will facilitate such analyses. The
      investigators will collect information related to the symptoms and the clinical course of the
      disease, to the complications from the disease and its treatment, presence of minimal
      residual disease, frequency of relapse and subsequent management, data on novel molecular
      markers associated with the prognosis.

      In conjunction with Dr. Philip Payne, Chairman of the Department of Bioinformatics at The
      Ohio State University, the investigators have created a system for safeguarding the
      confidentiality and the identity of all patients who agree to participate in this research
      registry. Each participating institution will be responsible for de-identification of the
      data, using software developed by The Ohio State University, Department of Biomedical
      Informatics, before it is used in the registry. Each institution will confidentially maintain
      a code for linking this information to an individual patient.

      Each participating institution will have direct control over the data contained in the
      registry that is associated with their respective patient population, which will be housed
      locally (at the participating institution) and not replicated in a central location. As a
      result of these measures, should a patient wish to withdraw from the registry, the
      responsible institution will be able to immediately remove all records related to that
      patient from the registry

Identify and characterize patients at each participating institution with autoimmune complications associated with their diagnosis (e.g., polyarticular arthritis; immune cytopenias; vasculitis), and describe the response to immunosuppressive therapy.

        This study will be a multi-institutional, international project that will collate clinical
        information from patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia from participating institutions in the
        Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation.Initially, this study will be launched at three institutions
        (The Ohio State University in Columbus Ohio, M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston Texas, and
        the Royal Marsden Hospital in London in the United Kingdom). Patients with HCL, who live in
        remote areas, without access to a HCLFCenter of Excellence, may voluntarily submit their
        name and contact information, through the Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation website.
