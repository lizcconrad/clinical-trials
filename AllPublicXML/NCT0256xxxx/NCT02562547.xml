      This is a retrospective data-only study following the phased introduction of the HEM-AVERT®
      Perianal Stabilizer into routine clinical practice. The investigators aim to capitalize on
      the introduction of the HEM-AVERT® Perianal Stabilizer into routine clinical practice in
      labor and delivery settings in the hospital of Dignity Health - St. Rose, Siena Campus and to
      determine whether the HEM-AVERT® Perianal Stabilizer reduces the frequency of Cesarean
      Section during labor and delivery.

      The on label device in this study is the HEM-AVERT® Perianal Stabilizer manufactured by
      Stetrix, Inc. This study is being sponsored by Dignity Health and falls within the guidelines
      set forth by the Food and Drug Administration in 21 CFR Section 812.2 as a non-significant
      risk study. The HEM-AVERT® Perianal Stabilizer is a Class II device in accordance with FDA
      regulation 21 CFR 801.109. Retrospective data will be collected in this study on the
      reduction of c-section rates and duration of second stage of labor. These data may be used to
      support an application to the FDA for a new indication of reducing c-sections. It is also
      possible the second stage labor data may also be used in support of expanded labeling.
