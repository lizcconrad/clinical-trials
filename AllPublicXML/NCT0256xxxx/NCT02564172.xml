  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pudendal neuralgia is a frequent diagnosis in pain clinics. This perineal pain has
      devastating effects on patient's quality of life. Today, 30% of patients are refractory to
      pain management and surgical procedure.

      The neuropathic characteristics of the pain in these patients lead us to test the efficiency
      of spinal cord stimulation at conus medullaris level.

      In our published preliminary study involving 27 patients with refractory pudendal neuralgia,
      we demonstrated that 74% of patients implanted with stimulation electrodes at the conus
      medullaris responded to stimulation.

      The primary objective of the present trial is to assess through a randomized, parallel group
      design, the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation at the conus medullaris using pentapolar
      surgical lead ((TM)Penta, St Jude medical ANS) versus medical treatment alone on sitting time
      in refractory pudendal neuralgia.

      In this national multicenter prospective open label trial, patients will be randomized 1:1 to
      experimental group (CMS group : Conus Medullaris Stimulation using pentapolar surgical lead,
      plus optimal medical management) or to control group (OMM group : optimal medical management
      alone) and followed for 12 months, in intention to treat.

      42 patients suffering of refractory pudendal neuralgia will be included. Optimal medical
      management will be prescribed by algologists in both groups according to patient pain relief.

Pentapolar surgical lead implant ((TM)Penta lead from St Judes Medical ANS which is the medical device under study)
Test phase of 10 days according to HAS(&quot;Haute Autorité de Santé&quot;) recommendation
If test phase positive, the lead is kept and subcutaneous rechargeable generator is implanted.
If test phase negative, the lead is removed.
Optimal medical management : Similarly to patients randomized in active comparator group, patients randomized in experimental group will also be prescribed optimized medical management (treatment for pain relief) under algologist control.
(A decrease of the consumption of pain treatment should be observed if conus medullaris stimulation has a positive effect).</description>

    <description>Optimal Medical Management (treatment for pain relief) includes analgesics and/or antidepressant and/or antiepileptics.Usually, drugs for neuropathic pain are prescribed as follows:
at effective dose, and minimal effective dose on the basis of adverse events and contraindications
as alone treatment in first and second line, then combination treatment. All this depends on the patient, on her/his pain, on her/his previous treatment.
Medical treatment prescription will reviewed by algologist at each clinical visit. It is not possible in this indication to establish a standardized treatment.
Non drugs therapies (physiotherapy, psychobehavioral approaches…) will not be forbidden or contra-indicated.</description>
