  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of TANSNIP-PESA is to determine in a population of asymptomatic bank
      employees with high and low imaging defined cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk the
      effectiveness of a comprehensive 3-year worksite-based lifestyle intervention consisting of
      12 personalized lifestyle counseling sessions, a Fitbit physical activity tracker and a
      sit-stand Workstation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will study the effectiveness of a 30-month worksite-based lifestyle program aimed to
      promote cardiovascular health in participants having a high or a low degree of subclinical
      atherosclerotic plaque burden (SAPB), compared to standard care.

      Methods: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) including middle-aged bank
      employees from the ´Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis´ (PESA) cohort,
      stratified by SAPB. Within each stratum, participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive a
      lifestyle program or standard care.

      The primary outcome measure is the adapted FUSTER-BEWAT CVD risk and lifestyle composite
      score and secondary outcome measures include physical activity, sedentary time, standing
      time, diet, smoking, anthropometric measures, blood biomarkers, self-rated health,
      work-related outcomes, healthcare consumption, program process measures and cost measures.

    <description>To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the lifestyle program, sickness absenteeism, presenteeism (i.e., working while feeling ill) and healthcare consumption (e.g. general practitioner, allied health professionals, complementary medicine consumption) will be assessed every 3 months until 36 months after baseline. Sickness absenteeism and presenteeism will be assessed with items from the WHO Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (WHO-HPQ). Presenteeism is conceptualized in the WHO-HPQ as a measure of actual work performance in relation to best performance, irrespective of the presence or absence of health complaints. Sickness absenteeism will be self-reported using the WHO-HPQ in hours per month.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Employees aged 40 to 60 years of the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical
             Atherosclerosis) cohort study (48) from the Banco de Santander Headquarters in Madrid
             (Spain).

          2. Employees to be included need to be 1 year before PESA 2/3 visit (-1/ +2 months

             thickness of the plaques or coronary artery calcium score (CACS) by computed
             tomography ≥ 1 point). Low degree of imaging-defined SAPB will be defined as having a
             CACS Agatston score of zero and no plaque by 2D ultrasound or being in the lowest two
             tertiles of plaque burden. Participants without plaque burden but with a BMI ≥ 25, or;
             reporting at least one unhealthy lifestyle behavior in their last PESA visit (i.e.,
             &lt;150 min/wk of at least moderate intensity physical activity assessed by
             accelerometer, sitting &gt;7 h/d as assessed by accelerometer, not meeting Mediterranean
             diet guidelines as assessed by a computerized dietary history tool previously
             developed and validated in the EPIC-Spain study and improved by ENRICA investigators,
             or smoking) will also be included in the low SAPB group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris,
             stroke, peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, angioplasty, heart surgery,
             atrial fibrillation, or any other heart disease).

          2. Active treatment for cancer, history of transplant with active immunosuppressive or
             immunomodulator treatment.

          3. Morbid obesity (body mass index ≥40 kg/m2).

          4. Presence of any disease that decreases life expectancy to 3 years, or any condition
             that could affect adherence to the study procedures.

          5. Participants are also excluded if they are pregnant or lactating women.

          6. Employees without plaque burden, a healthy BMI and a healthy lifestyle will be
