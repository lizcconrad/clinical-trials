    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, controlled, multi-center study is to assess the clinical and
      radiographic outcomes of using a Straumann® Bone Level Tapered implant for immediate
      implantation following extraction of a tooth in the pre-molar and anterior region of the
      maxilla and mandible (test) compared to the outcomes of placing this implant in healed sites
      (control).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the change in mean peri-implant marginal bone
      level changes (mesial and distal) from loading to 12 months post-loading of the test
      treatment will not be worse than the control treatments.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess differences in clinical and radiographic
      outcomes between the test and control treatments at 12 months post-loading by looking at
      implant success and survival, buccal bone dimensional changes, implant stability, soft tissue
      changes, subject satisfaction, and adverse events.

      An additional objective is to assess long-term differences in clinical and radiographic
      outcomes, as measured in the primary and secondary objectives, over the span of two, three,
      four, and five years.
