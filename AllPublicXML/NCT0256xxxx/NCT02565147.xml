      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of bivalirudin will reduce extent of
      the damage done to the heart muscle in patients who suffered a heart attack, compared to the
      comparator treatment (heparin).

      The study will assess the effect of bivalirudin administration during primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) and for 4 hours (h) afterwards, looking at contrast enhanced
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) assessed infarct size and on circulating markers of
      thrombosis and cell injury in subjects treated with PPCI for a large myocardial infarction
      (MI).

      The objective of this study is to determine whether bivalirudin, compared to unfractionated
      heparin (UFH), for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in large ST segment
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can:

      Primary Objective

        -  Reduce infarct size assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) at 5 (defined
           as 5 days ± 36 h from randomisation) days after PPCI Secondary Objectives

        -  Improve other CMR derived parameters of myocardial recovery 5 days after PPCI (i.e. left
           ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], myocardial salvage index [MSI] and micro-vascular
           obstruction [MVO]).

        -  Improve LVEF by CMR at 90 days

        -  Modulate markers of thrombin activity and cell injury after reperfusion Approximately
           200 subjects will be randomized. Subjects will be stratified prior to randomization
           according to: a) total duration of ischemic pain (&lt; 6 h vs. ≥6 h), and b) by site.

      Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Selection: Adult subjects (≥18 years) with an onset of
      symptoms of &gt;20 minutes (min) and &lt;12 h will be enrolled based on a diagnosis of STEMI with
      ST segment elevation of ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous precordial leads, or presumably new left
      bundle branch block and who have Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 0 or 1 flow in
      the infarct related artery (IRA) and fulfill angiographic criteria/score for a large
      infarction and are candidates for PPCI. All subjects should receive as soon as logistically
      feasible: aspirin (150-325 milligrams [mg] orally, or 250 500 mg intravenously [IV]) and a
      loading dose of any approved P2Y12 inhibitor unless already on maintenance dose.

      Bivalirudin will be administered at the time of PPCI at the approved dose of 0.75 mg/kg bolus
      followed by a 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion that will continue for 4 h after the completion of the
      index procedure.

      Subjects randomized to UFH should be treated according to the institutional protocol
      (including the timing and dosing of the UFH bolus). A target activated clotting time (ACT) of
      ≥250 seconds (s) is recommended.

      Criteria for Evaluation:

      Primary Endpoint:

      • Infarct size assessed by CMR 5 days post-PPCI

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  CMR MVO assessment at 5 days

        -  CMR MSI at 5 days

        -  CMR assessment of LVEF at 5 days

        -  CMR assessment of LVEF at 90 days

        -  TIMI flow and Myocardial Blush Grade (MBG) at end of PPCI

        -  In-hospital net adverse clinical events (NACE) up to 5 days or discharge, whichever
           comes first (death, re-infarction, ischaemia driven revascularisation [IDR], and
           Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] ≥3 bleeding)

        -  Death at 90 days

      Exploratory assessments • Assess patterns between comparator groups at various
      peri-procedural time points with respect to but not limited to: micro-particle release,
      thrombin anti thrombin complexes (TAT), myeloperoxidase (MPO)

      Sub-study:

      • Index microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and collateral flow index (CFI) sub-study
