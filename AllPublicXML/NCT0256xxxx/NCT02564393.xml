    <textblock>
      The study is defined in 3 stages of in vitro assays :

      Phase 1 : Secretion of NETs in response to lung disease and their secretion of factors.

      This is a transversal study in which we compare :

        -  Producing NETs (DNA and proteases ) by neutrophils purified from sputum and blood of
           patients

        -  Producing NETs (DNA and proteases ) by purified neutrophils in the blood of patients and
           blood of control subjects

      Phase 2: Mechanisms of activation of NETs secretory pathways . This phase will identify
      receptors (TLR ) involved in the secretion of NETs and analyze the involvement of dependent
      transduction pathways calcium and PKC . It will be performed on control blood neutrophils.

      Phase 3: Analysis of cell death ( NETose )

      This is a transversal study that will analyze :

      the mode of cell death of neutrophils purified blood and sputum of patients and control blood
      neutrophils by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy .
