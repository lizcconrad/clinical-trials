  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intake of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from fish oil and fish are
      associated with significant health benefits in risk of cardiovascular disease. However, both
      lean and fatty fish have been shown to have beneficial effects suggesting that not all
      effects are mediated by n-3 PUFAs. Krill oil is an n-3 PUFA supplement on the marked. The n-3
      PUFAs from krill oil is in the form of phospholipids, and these fatty acids may be more
      readily and effectively absorbed after ingestion than n-3 PUFAs in the form of
      triacylglycerols from fish oil. Fish also contain many other potential health components than
      n-3 PUFAs such as taurine and vitamin D, iodine, selenium and more unspecified components
      such as bioactive peptides which can mediate the health beneficial effects observed after
      intake of fish.

      The present study aims to elucidate the cardiovascular health beneficial effects after
      consumption of fish (lean and fatty) and krill oil, with regard to effects on plasma lipids
      and other markers of cardiovascular health such as inflammatory, haemostatic and endothelial
      dysfunction markers. The investigators will perform whole genome transcriptome analyses in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in order to further understand the cardiovascular
      health benefits and elucidate the mechanisms of action.
