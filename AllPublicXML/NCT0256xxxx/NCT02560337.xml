  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many ovarian cancer patients have been offered different standard cytostatics and gradually
      develop chemo-resistance. However, a considerable fraction of these patients are still in
      good general health and have a strong wish for further treatment.

      Cabazitaxel (Jevtana®) is a new taxane with effect in breast and prostatic cancer. In both
      tumors it has shown effect in patients refractory to docetaxel. Therefore, it could be
      anticipated that cabazitaxel may also have an effect in chemo-resistant ovarian cancer.

      Tocotrienol is a fraction of the natural E-vitamin with several biological effects, including
      effect on malignant cells and angiogenesis.

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether cabazitaxel and tocotrienol could be
      reasonable treatment options in patients with chemo-resistant and refractory ovarian cancer
      with regard to effect and toxicity.

      In case of progression on cabazitaxel there is an option of crossing over to tocotrienol and
      vice versa.
