  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify whether an exclusive human milk diet (EHMD) would improve
      outcomes in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal disorders (CGD) and by facilitating an
      earlier transition off of parenteral nutrition (PN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants born with congenital gastrointestinal disorders (CGD) can be very challenging to
      treat. The CGD require surgery shortly after birth to correct the problems and recovery can
      take a long time.

      During the period of time the infant's intestines are sick or don't work properly, they rely
      on parenteral nutrition (IV fluids containing carbohydrates, proteins and fats) to meet their
      nutritional needs. Being on PN for a long time requires special intravenous lines, and
      increases the risk of blood stream infections and can make the liver sick.

      Feeding babies who have these CGD is often very difficult, as the intestine needs to adapt.
      It needs to make appropriately formed stool to eliminate wastes, but not lose too much water
      or too many electrolytes. There is often a lot of starting and stopping of feeds. Human milk
      (HM) is considered the ideal source of nutrition for all infants.

      This study aims to identify whether an exclusive human milk diet (EHMD) would improve
      outcomes in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal disorders (CGD) and by facilitating an
      earlier transition off of parenteral nutrition (PN).

    <description>A minimum of 150 patients with CGD admitted to participating NICUs who meet inclusion criteria and provide informed consent will be enrolled in the prospective arm of the study. These patients will be fed an EHMD comprised of mother's own milk (MOM) or pasteurized donor human milk (DM). Fortification will be provided with human milk derived human milk fortifier, either a human milk-based fortifier (Prolact+ H2MFÂ®) for infants born at less than 37 weeks GA or &lt;2,200g birth weight or the term-equivalent version (PBCLN-002) formulated for infants &gt;37 weeks and/or &gt;2,200g at birth. Infants will receive this EHMD until they have achieved full enteral feedings for 7 days with bowel in continuity</description>
