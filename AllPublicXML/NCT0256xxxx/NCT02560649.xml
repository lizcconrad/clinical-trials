      The aim of current study is to investigate whether the HBsAg clearance rate can be improved
      if applying RGT((Response-Guided Therapy) strategy in HBeAg positive CHB(chronic hepatitis B)
      patients treated by nucleoside analogue(NUC) achieved HBVDNA&lt;1000copies/ml，and
      HBsAg&lt;5000IU/ml; &amp;HBeAg&lt;100PEIU/ml (or470s/co), combined with PEG-IFN a-2a for 24 weeks.

      The current study is a prospective, randomized, open, multi-center investigation. The aim of
      current study is to investigate whether the HBsAg clearance rate can be improved if applying
      RGT strategy in HBeAg positive CHB patients treated by NUC achieved HBVDNA&lt;1000copies/ml，and
      HBsAg&lt;5000IU/ml; &amp;HBeAg&lt;100PEIU/ml (or470s/co), combined with PEG-IFN a-2a for 24 weeks. Then
      the subjects will be divided into three groups according to qHBsAg levels of week 24 (RGT).
      For the subjects who qHBsAg&lt;200IU/ml of week 24, they are defined in Group A; the subjects in
      Group A will continue to be treated by NUC combined with PEG-IFN a-2a 180μg for another 24
      weeks(total will be 48 weeks). If the qHBsAg at week 24 did not achieve minor 200IU/ml, the
      subjects will be randomized to 2 groups: Group B: the subjects will continue to be treated by
      NUC combined with PEG-IFN a-2a 180μg for another 24 weeks (total will be 48 weeks); Group C:
      the subjects will be treated by NUC until 48 weeks.

             to 3 months or any history of the following: a suicidal attempt hospitalization for
             psychiatric disease, or a period of disability due to a psychiatric disease

          9. History of immunologically mediated disease, (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease,
             idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia,

         12. History of severe cardiac disease (e.g., NYHA Functional Class III or IV, myocardial
             infarction within 6 months, ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring ongoing treatment,

         14. History of a severe seizure disorder or current anticonvulsant use

         15. Major organ transplantation or other evidence of severe illness, malignancy, or any
             other conditions, which would make the patient, in the opinion of the investigator,
             unsuitable for the study

         16. History of thyroid disease poorly controlled on prescribed medications

         17. Evidence of severe retinopathy or clinically relevant ophthalmologic disorder

         18. History of other severe disease or evidence of other severe disease or any other
             illness or conditions that the investigator believe that patients are not suitable to
             join in the study

         19. Immunomodulatory treatment (including interferon) or LDT(telbivudine) within 1 year
             prior to the first dose of treatment
