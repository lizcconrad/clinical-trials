      The aim of this study is to show presence of cognitive and emotional factors on the beginning
      and persistence of auditory hallucinations in non-psychotic children. Investigators will
      describe a significant link between this factors and hallucinations in a sample of
      non-psychotic children. The results of this sample will be comparing to another group of
      children of the same age, sex and diagnosis, but without hallucination. Finally,
      investigators will control the persistence of hallucination on the first group after a six
      month period.

      Background: Hallucinations are a common symptom in pediatric population without psychotic
      syndrome. Vulnerability, co morbidity and risk factor are already been described.
      Investigators will study the cognitive and emotional factors on the beginning and persistence
      of auditory hallucinations in non-psychotic children. The goal of the study is to find a
      social cognition our emotional impairment to explain auditory hallucinations without
      psychotic symptoms. Methods: Sample of out non-psychotic patients aged six to eighteen years
      old with auditory hallucinations were recruited with a self report scale created for this
      study. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)-kids interview and &quot;psychosis&quot;
      section od Kiddie-SADS (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for school age
      chidlren) were conducted to determine Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
      (DSM) IV diagnoses. All children patient were spend specifics social cognition
      (NeuroPsychologic assessment NEPSY II) and emotional (ifferential Emotions Scale (DES) IV,
      Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire Revised (BAVQ-R)) scales. Each child results will be
      compared to child result of the same age, sex and diagnosis but without hallucination that
      passed the same specifics scales. All of child will be control after a six month period to
      evaluate auditory hallucination persistence and diagnosis evolution. The total period of the
      study will be twelve month.
