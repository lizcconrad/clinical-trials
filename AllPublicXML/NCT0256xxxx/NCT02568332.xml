      This study is aimed at assessing the safety of candidate Hepatitis C (Hep C) vaccines
      AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut when administered to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
      seropositive individuals. This study also aims to assess the cellular immune response
      generated by these vaccines when administered as mentioned above.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C (Hep C) is a common infection. Worldwide, over 180 million people are infected.
      Hep C is a blood borne viral infection spread through direct contact with the blood of an
      infected person. People with Hep C frequently have no symptoms and infection can lead to
      fibrosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure and cancer. Infection with the Hep C virus
      (HCV) progresses more rapidly to liver damage in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected
      individuals.

      Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a novel candidate vaccine against HCV
      ('NSmut'). This vaccine has been inserted into the carrier viruses Chimpanzee Adenovirus 3
      (AdCh3) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both of which have excellent safety records
      and have been previously tested in people.

      However, the objective of this study is to use exploratory immunological assays to assess
      whether vaccines for Hep C can induce immune responses in HIV positive individuals that are
      similar in strength to those in healthy volunteers.
