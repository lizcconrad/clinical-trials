      This pilot clinical trial studies how well carbon C 14 oxaliplatin microdosing assay works in
      predicting exposure and sensitivity to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with
      colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Carbon C 14 is a radioactive form of carbon,
      exists in nature and in the body at a low level. Microdose carbon C 14 oxaliplatin diagnostic
      assay may help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment and develop
      individualize oxaliplatin dosing in patients with colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of [14C] (carbon C 14) oxaliplatin microdose as a clinical
      assay to predict oxaliplatin exposure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the degree to which a [14C]oxaliplatin microdose predicts the observed
      pharmacokinetics of standard dose oxaliplatin.

      II. To validate that intrapatient variation of exposure to a [14C]oxaliplatin microdose is
      less than 5%.

      III. To detect the levels of oxaliplatin-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adducts induced by
      oxaliplatin microdosing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and correlate the
      results with patient response and progression free survival on oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy.

      IV. To develop preliminary safety data of [14C]oxaliplatin microdosing for future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive carbon C 14 oxaliplatin microdose intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes.
      Beginning not more than 4 weeks after the initial carbon C 14 oxaliplatin microdose
      administration, patients receive FOLFOX comprised of leucovorin calcium IV, fluorouracil IV
      over 2 hours (over 46-48 hours via ambulatory infusion pump on days 1 and 2), and oxaliplatin
      (contain carbon C 14 microdose course I only) IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every
      14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
