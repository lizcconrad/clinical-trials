      Daclatasvir is a recently approved anti-HCV agent that is a cytochrome P450 3a (CYP3A)
      substrate but does not affect CYP3A itself. It is also a moderate inhibitor of various
      membrane transporters such as organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) ,
      p-glycoprotein (P-gP), and organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2.

      Metformin is used to treat diabetes mellitus. It is an OCT-2 and OCT-1 substrate and when
      combined with daclatasvir increased levels of metformin may occur, with risk on hypoglycaemic
      episodes. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of daclatasvir currently does not
      mention this potential drug-drug interaction.

      HCV is associated with insulin resistance (IR) which may develop to diabetes mellitus (DM).
      The prevalence of IR in HCV infected patients is estimated varying from 30% to 70%. Several
      studies showed that IR has a negative impact on the achievement of an undetectable HCV viral
      load after completing 12 weeks of treatment (Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)).

      This study aims to provide clinical information on a potential drug-drug interaction between
      daclatasvir and metformin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 and not older than 55 years at screening.

          2. Subject does not smoke more than 10 cigarettes, 2 cigars, or 2 pipes per day for at
             least 3 months prior to Day 1.

          3. Subject has a Quetelet Index (Body Mass Index) of 18 to 35 kg/m2, extremes included.

          4. Subject is able and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form prior to screening
             evaluations.

          5. Subject is in good age-appropriate health condition as established by medical history,
             physical examination, and electrocardiography, results of biochemistry, haematology
             and urinalysis testing within 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Results of biochemistry,
             haematology and urinalysis testing should be within the laboratory's reference ranges
             (see Appendix A). If laboratory results are not within the reference ranges, the
             subject is included on condition that the Investigator judges that the deviations are
             not clinically relevant. This should be clearly recorded.

          6. Subject has a normal blood pressure and pulse rate, according to the Investigator's
             judgement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Creatinine clearance below 60mililiter/minute (ml/min).

          2. Documented history of sensitivity/idiosyncrasy to medicinal products or excipients.

          3. Positive HIV test.

          4. Positive hepatitis B or C test.

             less than 4 weeks before day 1) or breast-feeding female. Female subjects of
             childbearing potential without adequate contraception, e.g. hysterectomy, bilateral
             tubal ligation, (non-hormonal) intrauterine device, total abstinence, double barrier
             methods, or two years post-menopausal. They must agree to take precautions in order to
             prevent a pregnancy throughout the entire conduct of the study.

          6. Therapy with any drug (for two weeks preceding Day 1), except for acetaminophen (max 2
             gram/day).

          7. Relevant history or presence of pulmonary disorders (especially COPD), cardiovascular
             disorders, neurological disorders (especially seizures and migraine), psychiatric
             disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, renal and hepatic disorders (increased alanine
             aminotransferase (ALAT)/ASAT), hormonal disorders (especially diabetes mellitus),
             coagulation disorders.

          8. Relevant history or current condition that might interfere with drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion.

          9. History of or current abuse of drugs, alcohol or solvents.

         10. Inability to understand the nature and extent of the study and the procedures
             required.
