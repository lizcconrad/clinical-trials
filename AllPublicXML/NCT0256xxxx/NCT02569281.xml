  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific evidence of conservative management of subacromial pain syndrome is conflicting.
      There is evidence that eccentric exercise programs are effective at medium term for this pain
      condition. The inclusion of other therapeutic modalities is still controversial. A recent
      study suggests that the inclusion of US-guided percutaneous electrolysis combined with
      eccentric exercises can be effective at short-term for this condition. The objective of this
      randomized clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness at short- and long-term of the
      inclusion of US-guided percutaneous electrolysis (EPE速) into a eccentric exercise protocol
      for the management of patients with subacromial pain syndrome for pain, function, disability
      and pressure pain sensitivity.

    <description>Patients will receive one weekly session for 5 weeks including best-evidence manual therapy and an eccentric loading exercise program for the shoulder musculature, particularly the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The exercise program will be asked to be performed on an individual basis twice every day. The therapeutic protocol will be applied for 5 weeks. In addition, they will receive one session of US-guided percutaneous electrolysis. This intervention consists of the application of a galvanic electrical current with an acupuncture needle in the soft tissue, in this case the supraspinatus tendon.</description>
