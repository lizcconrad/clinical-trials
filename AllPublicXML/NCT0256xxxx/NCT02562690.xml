  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired thrombotic status is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Patients with
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at increased cardiovascular risk. The aim of the study is
      to determine the usefulness of thrombotic status assessment in a large cohort of ACS
      patients, managed with contemporary treatments, to identify patients at risk of thrombosis
      and those at risk of bleeding complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at increased risk of future
      cardiovascular events, despite optimal medical treatment and coronary intervention. Such
      events are usually caused by increased stickiness of the blood causing a blood clot
      (thrombus) to block arterial blood vessels in the heart. Much of the medication to prevent
      recurrent thrombotic events increases the risk of bleeding complications. Identification of
      patients at recurrent thrombotic risk could allow targeted treatment with potent
      antithrombotic medications, with less potent agents in others to reduce bleeding. The
      investigators will assess the stickiness of the blood (i.e. thrombotic status) in patients
      who are admitted to hospital with ACSÍ¾ at baseline, at discharge from hospital and at 30 days
      post hospitalisation. Blood stickiness will be tested using a number of tests of thrombotic
      status including thrombin generation assays, Thromboelastography (TEG) and the near-patient,
      point-of-care Global Thrombosis Test (GTT). The results will be evaluated to assess the
      effect of disease process and clinical state on blood stickiness to gain further
      understanding of the condition and form the basis for future studies aimed at identifying
      patients who are at high risk of future cardiovascular events.

    <description>Patients with acute chest pain and persistent ST-segment elevation or new left bundle branch block on the 12 lead ECG. This is termed ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).
Patients with acute chest pain but without persistent ST-segment elevation. These patients, based on the measurement of cardiac biomarker values (troponin), will be further classified as Non-ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina.
Where possible, all patients will have tests of thrombotic status including thrombin generation assays, TEG and GTT.</description>

        Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Patients. ACS patients will comprise of patients admitted to
        hospital with suspected cardiac chest pain and at least 2 of the following 3 criteria of
        (1) chest pain, (2) ischaemic ECG changes (3) a cardiac troponin measurement exceeding the
        99th percentile of a normal reference population (upper reference limit).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients aged 18 years or over.

          2. Patients diagnosed with ACS and free of exclusion criteria below.

          3. The patient is willing and able to understand the Patient Information Sheet and
             provide written informed consent.

          4. The patient must agree to comply with the drawing of blood samples for the
             assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has, in the opinion of the investigator, significant neurological,
             hepatic, renal, endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, haemorrhagic,
             metabolic or other disease likely to confound the study requirements or analyses.

          2. The patient has a history of substance abuse or demonstrates signs or clinical
             features of active substance abuse or psychiatric disease.

          3. Alcohol consumption above recommended safe levels (i.e. more than 21 units per week
             for males, or more than 14 units per week for females) due to the potential effects of
             high alcohol levels on platelet reactivity.

          4. Any illness deemed significant by the investigator during the four (4) weeks preceding
             the screening period of the study.

          5. Any major bleeding diathesis or blood dyscrasia (platelets &lt; 70 x 109/l, Hb &lt; 8 g/dl,
             INR &gt; 1.4, APTT &gt; x 2 UNL, leucocyte count &lt; 3.5 x 109/l, neutrophil count &lt; 1 x
             109/l).
