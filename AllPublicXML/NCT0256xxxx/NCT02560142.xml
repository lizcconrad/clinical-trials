  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center non-interventional study in healthy participants for behavioral
      assessment and fMRI assessments. The study will consist of 2 parts. Part A will involve 5
      participants and will study the implementation of the behavioral tests and identify potential
      issues. Part B will involve 30 participants and will study the test-retest reliability.
      Duration of participation for each participant will be 30 days for Part A (28 days screening
      period and 2 days of study visit) and 48 days for Part B (28 days screening period and 2
      study visits of 2 days each separated by a period of 14 days).
