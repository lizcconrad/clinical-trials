  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human adipose tissues were obtained from five healthy adult women who underwent abdominal
      liposuction. They were aged 28 to 45 years (mean, 32.15±4.8 years) and had no infectious or
      endocrine diseases. Ten millilitres of discarded adipose tissue from the humans was used to
      gain the adipose-derived stem cells. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the
      potential of a small intestinal submucosa scaffold combined with adipose-derived stem cells
      to form an adipocyte-containing hypodermis.

      Human adipose tissues were obtained from five healthy adult women who underwent abdominal
      liposuction. They were aged 28 to 45 years (mean, 32.15±4.8 years) and had no infectious or
      endocrine diseases. All protocols using human samples were approval by the Institutional
      Review Board of Nanfang Hospital (no.18502), and samples were obtained with written informed
      consent. Ten millilitres of discarded adipose tissue from the humans was washed extensively
      with equal volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); minced into a fine, homogeneous
      preparation; and digested at 37°C for 30 min with 0.125% type I collagenase. Enzyme activity
      was neutralized with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS. Then, the
      sample was filtered through a 200-mm nylon mesh to remove cellular debris and was centrifuged
      at 1500 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 5 min. The precipitate was resuspended in 6~10 ml
      NH4Cl and incubated at room temperature for 10 min to lyse contaminating red blood cells. The
      compound was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for an additional 5 min. The ASCs were collected via
      centrifugation as described above, resuspended in 2 ml of control medium (DMEM containing 10%
      FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution) and incubated at 37°C in a humidified chamber
      containing 5% CO2 for 48 h. Next, the plates were washed extensively with PBS to remove
      residual non-adherent red blood cells and debris. The resulting cell population was termed
      ASCs, and the cultures were expanded with media changes at 3-day intervals. Cells at passage
      1 through 6 were used for all experiments.
