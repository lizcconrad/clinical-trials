      The goals of this Model System Program are to expand upon and advance the findings and
      outcomes of previous and current Model Systems clinical research, to continue to develop and
      study the effectiveness of innovative treatment strategies for persons with spinal cord
      injury (SCI); and to evaluate the benefits of a well-designed, comprehensive, coordinated,
      interdisciplinary continuum of care that lead to improved outcomes for all persons with SCI.
      In order to achieve these goals, the following objectives of the Midwest Regional Spinal Cord
      Injury Care System (MRSCICS) model system grant proposal will be accomplished.

      The investigators will develop and assess the use of spring-loaded devices to assist limb
      swing and forward propulsion during body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) (Aim 1).
      Prototype models of both devices have been developed.

      These devices will be:

        1. simple to use in the clinical setting;

        2. will be easily adjustable to alter the assistance provided; and,

        3. will be able to quantify the amount of assistance necessary to facilitate normal
           stepping patterns.

      The investigators will also evaluate short- and long-term adaptations in locomotor
      performance following BWSTT in individuals with incomplete SCI with the use of these devices.
      This information will identify the effects of variable assistance at the limbs or trunk to
      modulate muscle activity and/or motor performance (kinematics) during stepping to maximize
      walking recovery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  non-progressive lesion between spinal levels C1-T10 of &gt; 3 months duration. Subjects
             with below T10 will be excluded due to potential lower motor neuron (LMN) injury

          -  score &gt; 10 on the Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS) developed previously to measure
             strength in SCI. For the LEMS criteria, preliminary data indicate that subjects with
             LEMS &lt; 10 in the chronic stages do not recover walking

          -  All subjects must require physical assistance to ambulate on the treadmill at a speed
             of 4.0 kmph at 0% body weight support (BWS)

          -  All subjects will have an overground gait speed &lt;.8m/s

          -  range of motion (ankle: -10 to 30 deg, knee: 0 to 90 deg, hip: -10 to 40 deg)
             consistent with gait

          -  medically stable with medical clearance to participate (absence of concurrent illness,
             including unhealed decubiti, infection, cardiopulmonary disease, osteoporosis, active
             heterotrophic ossification or peripheral nerve damage in the lower limbs, history of
             traumatic head injury)

          -  able to tolerate 30 minutes of upright (standing) position without orthostasis
             (decrease in blood pressure by 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg diastolic; minimized with
             ambulatory population)

          -  women of childbearing potential

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  women who are pregnant will be excluded due to potential forces at trunk from BWS or
             pelvic assistance

          -  those in concurrent physical therapy to eliminate effects of additional interventions
