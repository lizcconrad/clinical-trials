    <textblock>
      Naïve CD4+ helper T (Th) cells, upon encountering their cognate antigens presented on
      professional antigen-presenting cells, differentiate into different effector cells:

        -  Th1 cells produce Interferon-γ and regulate antigen presentation and immunity against
           intracellular pathogens;

        -  Th2 cells produce IL-4 (Interleukin-4), IL-5 and IL-13, and mediate humoral responses
           and immunity against parasites;

        -  Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22 and regulate inflammatory responses by tissue
           cells.

      An additional TH subset called follicular helper T (Tfh) cells has recently been identified
      in germinal centers and also in whole blood (circulating Tfh cells). These cells regulate
      B-cell maturation and immunoglobulin production during normal immune responses. They produce
      factors essential for B cell selection and maturation into memory B-cells or long-lived
      antibody-secreting plasma cells. Furthermore, they also seem to favor pathogenic autoantibody
      production in systemic autoimmunity, and therefore could potentially represent a novel
      therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases. Indeed, rheumatoid arthritis synovium is
      characterized by the presence of ectopic lymphoid structures, resembling germinal centers.
      Potentially, Tfh cells from these nonlymphoid tissues could promote B-cell maturation and
      synthesis of pathogenic autoantibody production, thus potentiating tissue injury.
      Interestingly, production of IL-21 by Tfh cells is implicated in B cell activation, and the
      same cytokine have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis.

      IL-6 blocking therapy significantly reduces signs and symptoms as well as radiological
      progression in RA. However, so far, it has not been determined which of the pleiotropic IL-6
      effects impact the observed clinical response. Recently, Samson et al have demonstrated that
      Tocilizumab (TCZ) corrects the imbalance between Th17 cells and Treg cells in patients with
      RA. More interestingly, the group of Hans-Peter Tony has reported the impact of TCZ on B cell
      compartment. They showed a significant reduction in the frequency of peripheral pre-switch
      and post-switch memory B cells but also a reduction of serum immunoglobulin levels, that
      could be the reflect of TCZ on Tfh cells development, circulation and/or function.

      Most of the work studying the role of IL-6 on Tfh cells development has been performed in
      mice. They showed that optimal Tfh cells formation requires IL-21 and IL-6, and that
      cytokines alone are insufficient to drive Tfh cells differentiation.

      To better understand the impact of IL-6 on human Tfh cells, the investigators would like to
      conduct a prospective study in patients with active RA and investigated the effects of
      blocking IL-6 with TCZ on circulating Tfh cells levels and Tfh cells subsets over a 12-week
      study period. Furthermore, the impact of TCZ treatment on Tfh cells generation will be
      explored in vitro.

        This study will be performed as a prospective observational open-labeled study
        (non-interventional) to evaluate the impact of TCZ treatment on the evolution of
        circulating Tfh cells levels. The administration of treatments (TCZ and MTX) will be done
        according to current practice, and will not be motivated by the inclusion in this study.
        TCZ will be administered in association with a conventional DMARD, or in monotherapy,
        according to clinical recommendations. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact
        of new therapy set-up, and patients included in the TCZ group would be under MTX treatment
        for at least 3 months. The immunological analysis will be performed with drop-off of blood
        samples used in the recommended follow-up of patients treated by MTX or TCZ. For the
        healthy controls, the immunological analysis will be performed with drop-off of blood
        samples used in the recommended follow-up of patients treated for osteoporosis or
        osteoarthritis.
