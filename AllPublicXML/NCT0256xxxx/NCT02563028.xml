  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spine surgery in the prone position (which involves lying face down) is associated with
      various visual changes, ranging from temporary changes in acuity (or sharpness) to permanent
      blindness. Known risk factors include low blood count (anemia) and long surgical times in the
      prone position under general anesthesia. While blindness is a rare outcome of this surgery,
      it is devastating and incompletely prevented by controlling known risk factors. Thus,
      improved monitoring and detection of visual injury during surgery is necessary. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether a novel, non-invasive monitoring device can reliably
      record visual responses during spine surgery. The first phase of this study is completed and
      involved patients undergoing microdiscectomy surgery. The second phase of this study involves
      patients undergoing single-level lumbar spine decompression/fusion surgery.
