  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a phase Ib design using the established dose of CAVATAK with
      pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced melanoma for whom pembrolizumab would be considered
      standard of care. Our hypothesis is that oncolysis of melanoma cells by CAVATAK will be
      important in amplifying the T-cell potentiating effects of pembrolizumab.
