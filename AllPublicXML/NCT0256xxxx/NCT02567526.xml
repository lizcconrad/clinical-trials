    <textblock>
      Inadequate food and fluid intake is a common problem among nursing home (NH) residents and
      one that can lead to under-nutrition, dehydration, weight loss, hospitalization, and even
      death. The most common nutrition intervention for at-risk NH residents is oral liquid
      nutrition supplementation, although, there is limited controlled evidence of the efficacy of
      supplements in promoting weight gain in NH residents. Moreover, studies show that supplements
      are not provided consistent with orders and residents receive little to no staff assistance
      to promote consumption in daily NH care practice. The result is that nutritionally at-risk NH
      residents with supplement orders receive few additional daily calories from supplements.
      Recent evidence strongly suggests that offering residents a choice among a variety of foods
      and fluids multiple times per day between meals coupled with assistance is effective in
      increasing daily caloric intake and promoting weight gain. However, the provision of the
      between-meal choice intervention requires significantly more staff time relative to the
      amount of time NH staff currently spend on between-meal nutritional care provision.

      A new federal regulation allows NHs to train non-nursing staff to provide feeding assistance
      care. Preliminary research has demonstrated that non-nursing staff trained as &quot;feeding
      assistants&quot; provide mealtime feeding assistance care that is comparable to or better than
      their indigenous nurse aide counterparts. Moreover, a recent demonstration project showed
      that these staff can be used to effectively augment nurse aide staff for mealtime feeding
      assistance care provision in daily care practice. The proposed translational study will
      utilize the federal regulation to train non-nursing staff for between-meal nutritional care
      delivery. Specifically, the proposed study will use a controlled, intervention design to
      determine the cost-effectiveness of the between-meal choice intervention relative to a usual
      care control group in a group of 200 residents across 4 NH sites. Residents with an order for
      caloric supplementation will be included in this study and randomized into either a usual
      care control group or a choice intervention group (100 residents per group). The usual care
      control group will continue to receive standard NH care for supplement or snack delivery
      between meals, as provided by indigenous nurse aide staff. Non-nursing staff trained as
      &quot;feeding assistants&quot; will offer residents in the intervention group a choice between
      supplements and other snack foods and fluids twice daily, five days per week, for 24 weeks
      while also providing a standardized prompting protocol to enhance intake and independence in
      eating. Research staff will independently document the costs of intervention implementation
      and compare these costs to effectiveness measures which include improvements in caloric
      intake, weight and quality of life. These outcomes will be independently monitored for both
      groups across 24 study weeks by trained research staff using standardized, validated
      protocols. This translational research effort will provide critical information to improve
      care practices in nursing homes for nutritionally at risk residents.
