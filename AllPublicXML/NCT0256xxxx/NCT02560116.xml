  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to correlate noninvasive pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP)
      measurements obtained with and without echocardiographic contrast (Optison) during
      transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with those obtained invasively and simultaneously during
      right heart catheterization, as the gold standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is an increasingly recognized cause of
      morbidity and mortality.

      Echocardiography, due to its widespread use, versatility, portability, noninvasive nature,
      and safety, is routinely used as the primary method for diagnosis and evaluation of these
      patients. However, in this very cohort, its accuracy is frequently compromised by poor
      acoustic windows. The use of echocardiographic contrast (EC) in such patients may increase
      diagnostic accuracy, eliminate the need for performing more invasive, time-consuming, and
      expensive tests, and eliminate potential diagnostic and management errors.

      Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure (PASP) is routinely measured noninvasively with
      transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by obtaining the tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV)
      with continuous wave spectral Doppler and applying the modified Bernoulli equation.

      The investigators aim to use the FDA approved perflutren-based EC agent Optison to augment
      inadequate TR CW spectral Doppler envelopes and determine if the TRV and PASP measurements
      obtained with the use of Optison correlate better with the invasive measurements obtained
      simultaneously during right heart catheterization as opposed to those measurements obtained
      without the use of EC.

        After obtaining informed written consent, investigators will enroll all consecutive
        patients (age ≥ 18 years old) undergoing right heart catheterization in the catheterization
        laboratory for various clinical indications as part of routine medical care.

        This will be a prospective and multicenter study. The participating institutions are: North
        Shore University Hospital (Manhasset, NY), Long Island Jewish Medical Center (New Hyde
        Park, NY), and Mt Sinai Medical Center (NY, NY).
