  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether trough serum infliximab concentrations at
      the time of loss of clinical response will identify pediatric participants with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) who would benefit (regain clinical response) from dose escalation above
      the currently approved dose [5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) every 8 weeks (q8wk)] and the
      safety of that dose escalation.

      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), prospective (study following participants forward in time), open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention) study of infliximab in pediatric participants
      with inflammatory bowel disease. The study consists of 3 Phases: screening Phase (up to 4
      weeks), open-label treatment Phase (56 weeks) and follow up safety Phase (8 weeks). The
      duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately up to 68 weeks
      (including screening period). Participants' efficacy and safety outcomes will be monitored
      throughout the study.

             possibly confounding the evaluation of benefit from infliximab treatment

          -  Must not have presence or history of colonic or small bowel obstruction within 6

             bowel proximal to the stricture on barium radiograph or an inability to traverse the
             stricture at endoscopy)

          -  Must not have local manifestations of CD, such as fistulae, strictures, abscesses, or
             other disease complications for which surgery might be indicated. Enterocutaneuous
             fistulae for which surgery is not indicated, are allowed

          -  Must not have presence of a stoma

          -  Must not have documented short bowel syndrome (more than 100 centimeter in total of
