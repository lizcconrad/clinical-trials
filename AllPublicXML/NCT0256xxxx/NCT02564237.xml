    <textblock>
      This is a single-centered trial of a group A streptococcal (GAS) vaccine, StreptAnova™. The
      study is designed to assess safety and immunogenicity of three doses (0, 1, 6 months) of one
      dosage (600 µg protein) in healthy adults 18 through 50 years of age.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-centered trial of a group A streptococcal (GAS) vaccine, StreptAnova™, to be
      performed in Canada. It will be randomized, observer-blinded, and comparator controlled. The
      study is designed to assess safety and immunogenicity of three doses (0, 1, 6 months) of one
      dosage (600 µg protein) in healthy adults 18 through 50 years of age.

      A comparator vaccine is included at 2:1 ratio (StreptAnova™ to comparator). Assignment to
      StreptAnova™ or comparator vaccine will be both randomized and observer-blinded. Three (3)
      0.6 mL doses (600 µg protein) of StreptAnova™ or 0.5 mL doses of comparator will be
      administered on days 0, 30 and 180 (N= 30 StreptAnova™, 15 comparator); each subject will
      receive three doses of the same treatment.

      Forty-five subjects will be enrolled. At each vaccine dose, detailed safety data will be
      collected from the first 15 randomized subjects until seven days after administration and
      used to determine whether to proceed to immunizing the 30 remaining subjects. Detailed safety
      data will be collected from the remaining 30 randomized subjects until seven days after
      administration and used to determine whether to proceed to immunizing the first 15 randomized
      subjects at the next dose.

      Treatments will be followed by standard clinical parameters for evaluating the safety of a
      biologic/vaccine product including standardized methods for local and systemic vaccine
      reactions, repeated vital signs and physical examinations, 12-month follow-up (6 months
      post-dose 3) for adverse events and concomitant medication changes, and monitoring of
      clinical laboratory values as clinically indicated.
