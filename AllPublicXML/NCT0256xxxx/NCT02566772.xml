      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of TAS3681 and to
      find the maximum tolerated dose of TAS3681.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, multinational, phase 1, open-label study of TAS3681 in patients
      with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)evaluating safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity in patients with mCRPC for which there is
      no standard therapy. Eligible patients will either be enrolled in the dose escalation phase
      to evaluate safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose for TAS3681 or the expansion
      phase in which additional cohorts of patients may be enrolled to further evaluate safety and
      preliminary efficacy of TAS3681 at the MTD or at a lower dose.

      Approximately 50 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase and
      approximately 80 patients will be enrolled in the Expansion Phase.
