  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in fast-track programmes are required to take an active part in their treatment and
      rehabilitation. Spouses of older patients can often provide valued practical and emotional
      support, reducing stress, pain and length of stay - yet they are seldom invited to
      participate in a supporting role. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
      spouses' involvement in older patients fast-track treatment programs using case management as
      intervention. A two-group quasi-experimental design with pre-test and repeated post-test
      measures (protocol approved in November 2012) was used. Patients aged 65 years or older going
      through a fast-track programme for a total hip replacement and their spouses was recruited in
      dyads from one Danish orthopaedic ward for the intervention group (n=15) and for the control
      group (n=14). Data was collected from both groups at baseline, two weeks and three months
      after surgery. Outcome measures for patients include: functional status, nutrition, pain,
      depression and healthcare consumptions; and for spouses: caregiver satisfaction and
      difficulties and anxiety.

    <description>Before admission the spouse-patient dyads will take part in an interview with the case manager assessing the spouses' needs during admission through an individual care plan. During admission the case manager will follow-up and assess the goals and actions of the individual care plan and coordinate with other health professionals. During the discharge meeting the case manager will provide additional information to the spouse according to needs assessed in the care plan. After discharge the case manager will conduct a follow-up telephone call for the spouse 3-4 days and 10 days after the patient's discharge consisting of information similar to that provided at the discharge meeting.</description>
