  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present clinicians have no way to reverse anesthesia. Patients wake when their bodies
      clear the anesthetic. Most people wake quickly, but some do not. All patients have memory and
      other cognitive problems after waking from anesthesia. In studies on animals, the
      investigators observed that caffeine caused rats and mice to wake much more rapidly from
      anesthesia. This was true for all the animals tested. The investigators would like to see if
      this holds true in humans. Will caffeine accelerate waking from anesthesia? Will it reverse
      the cognitive deficits associated with anesthesia, after waking?

      The investigators carried out a modest trial with 8 test subjects. Each volunteer was
      anesthetized twice. Each volunteer was anesthetized one time and received an infusion of
      saline (placebo control), without the aid of any other drugs and the other time the volunteer
      received an infusion of a relatively low dose of caffeine. The order of saline versus
      caffeine was randomized and the study was done in a double blind manner. We observed that
      emergence from anesthesia was significantly accelerated by the caffeine infusion. No adverse
      events were observed.

    <measure>Waking Time - Re-establishment of the gag reflex.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of the study is to determine whether caffeine speeds emergence from anesthesia. The time between terminating delivery of anesthetic and the subject starting to gag was measured. Anesthesia suppresses the gag reflex. Immediately after anesthetizing the test subject, a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) device was inserted into the test subject airway. After anesthesia was terminated and emergence from anesthesia was taking place, the gag reflex was re-established, and the LMA produced a &quot;gag response&quot; in all test subjects. This objective and unequivocal measurement constituted the &quot;emergence&quot; time for each subject. The &quot;emergence&quot; time was defined as the time between terminating the anesthesia and the test subject starting to gag.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Test1 - Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15-120 minutes, starting at 15 minutes and then repeating every 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Fifteen minutes after terminating anesthesia each subject was asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, if they were able. Otherwise the testing started at 30 minutes. The tests were repeated every 15 minutes. The first test, a visual analog scale (VAS) test consisted of two 100-mm lines, each labelled with of &quot;feel good&quot; or &quot;feel bad&quot; displayed on a computer screen. Test subjects were asked to rate how they currently felt by placing a cursor on each of the line (0=not at all, 100=extremely). The test repeated every 15 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Test2 - Sternberg Test of Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>15-120 minutes, starting at 15 minutes and then repeating every 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. The test was first applied at 15 minutes following anesthesia, if the subject was awake and then repeated every 15 minutes. In the Sternberg Test of Memory (STM) participants were asked to memorize a string of numbers. Afterwards, a computer would flash a series of random numbers on the screen and the participant was asked whether the number on the computer screen was part of the earlier string or not. In three rounds, participants were given a string of 2, then 4, then 6 numbers. The latency until the subject answered the question was also monitored.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Test3 - Divided Attention Task</measure>
    <time_frame>15-120 minutes, starting at 15 minutes and then repeating every 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. The test was first applied at 15 minutes following anesthesia, if the subject was awake and then repeated every 15 minutes. In the Divided Attention Task (DAT), participants were asked to fly an airplane over the center of a winding road with a joystick and simultaneously press a button whenever targets randomly flashed on the screen. The computer program tracked the root mean squared (RMS) deviation of the plane from the center of the road and the latency for pressing the trigger when the target appeared.</description>

    <measure>Bispectral Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuous monitoring from start of anesthesia until discharge of test subject.</time_frame>
    <description>A bispectral index (BIS) measurement system was employed to measure depth of anesthesia. In particular, we wished to determine whether BIS exhibited more rapid recovery after caffeine infusion as compared to saline (control).</description>

    <measure>Minute Ventilation</measure>
