  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to assess the time above MIC (4 mg/mL), and the
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of 1 g ceftriaxone administered by
      constant rate subcutaneous infusion over 2 hours compared with 1 g of ceftriaxone
      administered as a constant IV infusion over 0.5 hours. In addition, the study will compare
      the results obtained after 1 g ceftriaxone intravenous or subcutaneous administration with 2
      g ceftriaxone administered subcutaneously
