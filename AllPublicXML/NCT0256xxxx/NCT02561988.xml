    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antineoplastic activity of
      avapritinib (also known as BLU-285), administered orally (PO), in adult patients with
      advanced systemic mastocytosis and other relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies. The
      study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and an expansion part (Part 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Part 1:Patients must have one of the following diagnoses:

          -  Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) as confirmed by World Heath Organization (WHO)
             diagnostic criteria.

          -  Systemic mastocytosis-associated hematologic non-mast cell disease (SM-AHNMD) as
             confirmed by WHO diagnostic criteria, and the patient also has at least 1 C-finding
             attributable to systemic mastocytosis (SM). The AHNMD must be myeloid, with the
             following exceptions that are excluded: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic
             syndrome (MDS) that is very high- or high-risk as defined by the International
             prognostic scoring system for myelodysplastic syndromes (IPSS-R) and Philadelphia
             chromosome positive malignancies.

          -  Mast cell leukemia (MCL) as confirmed per WHO diagnostic criteria.

          -  Histologically- or cytologically- confirmed myeloid malignancy as confirmed by IWG-MRT
             or WHO diagnostic criteria that is relapsed or refractory to standard treatments. AML,
             MDS that is very high- or high-risk as defined by the IPSS-R, and Philadelphia
             chromosome positive malignancies are excluded.

             platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling) may be considered for
             enrollment.

        For Part 2:

          -  Group 1: ASM as confirmed by WHO diagnostic criteria.

             that are excluded: AML, MDS that is very high- or high-risk as defined by the IPSS-R,
             and Philadelphia chromosome positive malignancies.

          -  Group 3: MCL as confirmed per WHO diagnostic criteria.

        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;470 milliseconds

          -  Platelet count &lt;25,000/mL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt;500/mL

             limit of normal (ULN); &gt;5 × ULN if associated with clinically suspected liver
             infiltration by mastocytosis or another disease for which the patient enrolled into
             the study

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN; &gt;3 × ULN if associated with liver infiltration by the
             disease being treated or in the presence of Gilbert's Disease

          -  Estimated (Cockroft-Gault formula) or measured creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/min

          -  Brain malignancy or metastases to the brain

          -  History of a seizure disorder or requirement for anti-seizure medication

          -  Known risk of intracranial bleeding, such as a brain aneurysm or history of subdural
             or subarachnoid bleeding
