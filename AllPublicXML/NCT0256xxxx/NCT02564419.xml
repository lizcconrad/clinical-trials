  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will show proof-of-concept that brain signals can be used in
      real-time, closed-loop mode to trigger stimulation for hand function. Subjects will undergo
      surgery to implant a unilateral subdural strip electrode (Resume II, Model 3587A) over the
      motor cortex. These electrodes implanted in the brain will enable bioelectrical data
      recording (sensing) from the brain to the implanted Activa PC+S. The cortical sensing data
      will be

        1. either processed in the Activa PC+S; or

        2. off-loaded via the Nexus D communication device (Medtronic) to a computer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical device manufacturer Medtronic has developed a fully-implantable, bi-directional
      neuroprosthetic that is built upon existing deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology and has
      the ability to perform electrocorticogram recording and deliver functional electrical
      stimulation. This device is an incremental improvement to an existing Premarket Approved
      (PMA) deep brain stimulation (DBS) device the Activa PC. The incremental improvement enables
      sensing and algorithmic capabilities while maintaining full functionality for therapy
      delivery without appreciable loss of device longevity [9].

      Our investigator initiated feasibility trial seeks to test the Activa PC+S as a therapeutic
      system to restore movement to paralyzed muscles. Our mission is to develop and demonstrate in
      humans innovative direct neural interface technology that restores motor function,
      rehabilitates, and improves the quality of life of individuals with SCI. Investigators seek
      to enable testing that will lead to innovative neuroprosthetic therapies that improve
      recovery by retraining the nervous system, reduce secondary conditions, and create a better
      life for persons with SCI and other conditions that impair physical or cognitive function.
      This project will increase the understanding and tempo of research into the modes of
      functionality of a fully implantable system from the following perspectives: neurosurgery,
      biomedical engineering, rehabilitation, and therapeutics. A major strength of our approach is
      that it incrementally tests sub-components of the system through a systematic buildup of
      functionality towards control of upper extremity function.

    <description>Objective of this pilot phase early feasibility study is to assess the safety and feasibility of Medtronic Activa PC+S implant (device) by;
Evaluating the ability of the Activa PC+S system to sense ECoG signals in subjects living with quadriplegia (C5 or C6 level).
Assessing the feasibility of activating fundamental upper extremity muscles to reproduce hand grasp.
These are important first steps towards creating and designing a device that can enhance or assist in performing activities of daily living (ADL) in the life of these subjects. Attachment 15.3</description>

    <description>Upon consent, the good candidates will undergo surgical screening that includes a full neurological workup and baseline functional assessment. Subjects that demonstrate feasibility for control will undergo surgery for unilateral implantation of the Activa PC+S as well as the implantation of unilateral subdural strip electrodes (Resume II, model 3587A) over the motor cortex. After 24 hour observation in the hospital, subjects will participate in 24 distinct sessions or visits of testing over a 3-6 month period. During these visits, the sensing, decoding of the implanted device (Activa PC+S) as well as the external stimulation components (Bioness H200) and parameters will be tested and benchmarked. Subjects will participate for 24 sessions and continue to participate in the study until the end of life of the device, at which point the subject may elect to undergo an explant at that time.</description>
