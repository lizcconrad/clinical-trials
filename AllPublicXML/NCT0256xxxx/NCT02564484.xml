      This observational study is designed to establish induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from
      childhood cancer survivors who did or did not develop persistent treatment-induced peripheral
      neuropathy, from which to make human neurons for comparing their sensitivity to vincristine
      and other potentially neurotoxic drugs.

      Investigators will assess the effects of inherited genome variations on treatment-induced
      peripheral neuropathy that persists in adults who were cured of childhood cancer. Cells from
      childhood cancer survivors who did or did not develop drug-induced neuropathy will be
      isolated and induced to become neurons. Cell sensitivity to anticancer agents will be tested
      in both groups and compared to determine if the survivors have genetic variants that
      correspond to those identified in companion genomic studies. This will assist in determining
      if gene variants increase the risk of treatment-induced neurotoxicity.

      The investigators are interested in detecting changes of phenotype pre-post treatment in each
      group (cases, controls) respectively, as well in comparing the pre-post treatment phenotypic
      changes between the two groups (cases vs. controls).

      Participants will be recruited from an existing protocol at St. Jude (SJLIFE, NCT00760656).
      Complete neuropathic evaluations are obtained as part of SJLIFE, and the information will be
      shared for use in the SJLPSC study. A one-time blood draw will be obtained, and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) will be isolated for eventual creation of induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that will be differentiated into human neurons. These human
      neurons will allow the investigators to functionally validate and further interrogate CEP72
      genetic variants or variants in other genes that are associated with persistent (or acute)
      vincristine neuropathy using a &quot;state of the art&quot; cellular model of human neurons.
      Furthermore, creating neurons from patients at the extremes (highly sensitive to
      vincristine-induced neuropathy and matched controls) allows the study of differences at
      baseline and after treatment with vincristine.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To establish induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from childhood cancer survivors who
           did or did not develop persistent treatment-induced peripheral neuropathy, from which to
           make human neurons to assess their sensitivity to vincristine and determine whether
           neurons from patients who developed neuropathy are more sensitive to vincristine or
           other neurotoxic chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To evaluate the iPSC neurons made from patients with persistent treatment-related
           neuropathy and iPSC neurons from patients who did not develop neuropathy from the same
           treatment, for phenotypic difference prior to and after exposure to vincristine or other
           potentially neurotoxic medications.

        Cases and controls for this study will be recruited from among the acute lymphocytic
        leukemia (ALL) survivor members of the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study (SJLIFE). Cases will
        be matched for gender, tumor type, estimated cumulative vincristine dose at which toxicity
        occurred, intended vincristine chemotherapy regimen, age (within 5 years) and race with
        existing controls.
