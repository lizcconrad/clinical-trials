  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of inflammation on central nervous
      system (CNS) glutamate, white matter pathology and alterations in behavior and cognition in
      middle-aged patients with major depression. Depression is associated with significant
      alterations in glutamate concentrations and white matter integrity, which has been associated
      with decreased antidepressant response, poor functional outcome, and cognitive impairment.

      This study involves behavioral assessments, neurocognitive testing, blood sampling and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Goals of this study are to determine the impact of
      inflammation on glutamate concentrations in the basal ganglia and on the integrity of white
      matter tracts in the basal ganglia and other subcortical regions of middle-aged depressed
      versus non-depressed individuals and to associated the impact of glutamate and white matter
      changes on behavioral symptoms among the same group of patients.

    <description>Single-voxel MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) scans will be done to determine the glutamate levels in the basal ganglia. MRS uses a magnetic field to look at magnetic nuclei which absorb and re-emit electromagnetic energy in the presence of the magnetic field. By looking at the peaks in the resultant spectra, the structure and concentrations of metabolite can be determined.</description>
