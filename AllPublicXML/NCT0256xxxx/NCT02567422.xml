      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970
      (VX-970) when given together with cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with
      human papillomavirus negative (HPV) (-) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that has spread
      from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 together with cisplatin and radiation therapy may work
      better in treating patients with locally advanced HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of VX-970 when administered along with weekly cisplatin
      and radiation therapy (XRT) in patients with locoregionally advanced HPV (-) head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      II. Establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VX-970. II. Assess for potential
      drug-drug interaction between VX-970 and aprepitant. III. To observe and record anti-tumor
      activity. IV. To assess the rate of complete metabolic response (CMR) at 12 weeks post
      completion of chemoradiation using 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET) scans.

      V. To collect archival tumor material for retrospective analysis of association between
      tissue-based biomarkers and clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970.

      Patients receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day -7 and
      then weekly on day 2 and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes weekly on day 1. Patients also
      undergo radiation therapy once daily, 5 days a week. Treatment continues for up to 7 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 2 weeks for
      3 months, and then every 3 months for 2 years.
