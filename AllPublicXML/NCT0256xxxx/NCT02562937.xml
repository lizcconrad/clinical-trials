    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the current study was to determine whether a text message intervention
      would increase break frequency and length of break from sitting, time spent standing, and
      time spent in light and moderate intensity physical activity in university students

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behaviour (SB) has been linked to many health problems (e.g., type 2 diabetes,
      heart disease). Interventions aimed at office workers, overweight and obese individuals have
      proven successful in reducing SB; however, no studies have examined university students.Text
      message-based interventions have succeeded to aid in smoking cessation and increase both
      physical activity and healthy eating, but have not been shown to reduce SB. Eighty-two
      university students were randomized into intervention (SB related text messages) or control
      (text messages unrelated to SB) groups. Participants received daily text messages and
      reported various SBs (i.e., breaks from sitting, standing, light and moderate intensity
      physical activity) at four time points (baseline, 2, 4 and 6 weeks).
