    <textblock>
      Phase II non-inferiority randomized trial of annual systematic biopsies versus mpMRI and
      targeted biopsies for men with low risk prostate cancer on active surveillance with any
      volume Gleason's Score 6, but no prior MRI imaging of the prostate.

    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded, randomized trial of TRUS biopsy-based active surveillance versus
      mpMRI-based active surveillance. Patients on the TRUS biopsy-based arm will undergo annual
      systematic biopsies without any MRI staging or guidance. Patients on the mpMRI- based arm
      will undergo annual mpMRI surveillance imaging, with image-guided targeted biopsies only as
      indicated by radiographic findings.

    <description>Baseline and annual systematic TRUS-guided biopsy performed as per standard of care by urologists for a total of one baseline diagnostic biopsy and two active surveillance systematic biopsies.
mpMRI at the end of the 2nd year with targeted biopsy of any Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 4 or 5 lesion. Patients needing image- guided targeted biopsies will undergo this procedure by interventional radiology, which is a common standard of care at HHM VAMC.
Optional transperineal template biopsy of the prostate performed at end of 2nd year (month 25-30).
Patients will be followed, as per standard of care, for any potential infections from biopsies.
Annual PSA tests performed as per routine standard of care.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed by biopsy within 12 months prior to study
             registration.

          -  Gleason score ≤ 6

          -  PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL

          -  Completed and documented history and physical addressing all inclusion/exclusion
             criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma on more than one set of prostate biopsies, on
             separate calendar dates.

          -  Previous MRI imaging of the prostate.

          -  Prior history of pelvic radiotherapy.

          -  Prior history of prostatectomy.

          -  Contraindication to prostate mpMRI (renal failure, hip prosthesis, pacemaker, etc).

          -  Contraindication to prostate biopsy via transrectal or transperineal approaches
             (including coagulopathy).

          -  Patients on testosterone replacement therapy who are unwilling to discontinue.

          -  Medical, psychological, or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the patient's risk or limit the patient's adherence with study
             requirements.

          -  Unable to understand, or unwilling to complete the informed consent process.
