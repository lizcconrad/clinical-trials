  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this research project were: 1) to develop a senior-tailored Healthy Beat
      Accupunch (HBA) exercise program for community-dwelling older adults, 2) to test the effects
      of a six-month, instructor-led HBA exercise program, and 3) to evaluate the feasibility,
      compliance, and long-term effects of a six-month, DVD-guide HBA exercise program.

      A three-year, longitudinal, triangulation research method was applied. First Year (Phase I):
      A preliminary HBA exercise program, including hard copy descriptions and DVD demonstrations
      of each exercise, was mailed to the 16 experts in the Delphi advisory panel for their
      critique and evaluation. First Year (Phase II): A quasi-experimental, one-group,
      pretest-posttest design was used to pilot-test the feasibility of the HBA exercise program on
      a group of 31 community-dwelling older adults in a community care station. Second Year: A
      cluster randomized controlled trial was used to test the effects of a six-month,
      instructor-led HBA exercise program on the functional fitness (cardiovascular-respiratory
      function, body flexibility, muscle strength, and muscle endurance) of the community-dwelling
      older adults. Through the use of convenience sampling strategy, eight community care stations
      with 232 older adults in Kaohsiung were recruited and randomly assigned based on their
      community care stations to a HBA experimental group or a wait-list control group.
      Participants in the experimental group received the HBA exercise program led by trained and
      certified instructors, three times per week, 40 minutes per practice for six months;
      participants in the wait-list control group continued with their regular daily activities.
      One pre-test and two post-tests, three months apart, were conducted. Third Year: Using the
      same method as in the second year, participants from the second year continued practicing the
      HBA exercise program, but guided by a DVD, for another six months. The feasibility,
      compliance, and effectiveness of the DVD-led HBA exercise program on the community-dwelling
      older adults were tested, and another two post-tests, three months apart, were conducted on
      the same outcome measurements as in the second year.

    <description>The HBA exercise program includes: 1) warm-up: 5 slow and gentle exercises to regulate qi, loosen up the body, and elevate the energy for a safe transition to the next phase, 2) accupunch: 14 low-to-medium speed exercises to punch the 14 meridians to enhance the cardiovascular-respiratory workout, and 3) relaxation: 5 low-speed, muscle relaxing exercises with deep breaths to sooth the body and mind. It is conducted 3 times per week and 40 minutes per practice.</description>
