    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous Fuzeon in patients with
      advanced HIV-1 infection unable to construct an appropriate treatment regimen from currently
      available antiretroviral agents. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and
      the target sample size is 9 individuals.
