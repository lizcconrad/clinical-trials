  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Close relationship exists between sleep slow wave (SSW) and the generation of
      spike wave in NREM-sleep. SSW are cortically generated oscillations alternating between
      excitatory depolarization (&quot;Up-phase&quot; of the SSW) and inhibitory hyperpolarization
      (&quot;Down-phase&quot; of the SSW). It has been shown experimentally that with increasing synchrony of
      slow neuronal oscillations SSW turn into spike waves. Acoustic pulses applied in
      correspondence to the SSW &quot;Up-phase&quot; enhance the amplitude of the subsequent SSW. Conversely,
      tones delivered at the SSW &quot;Downphase&quot; have a disruptive effect on the following SSW.

      Participants: Patients with epilepsy and spike waves in NREM-sleep.

      Objective: Modification of spike wave frequency, amplitude and spreading during NREM sleep by
      acoustic pulses applied at the &quot;Up-&quot; or &quot;Down-phase&quot; of SSW.
