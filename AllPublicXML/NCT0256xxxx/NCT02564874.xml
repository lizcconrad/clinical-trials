  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect different sources and forms of
      discretionary foods have on dietary compensation and energy intake in healthy adults in a
      free living, real world setting. Specifically, this pilot study will compare the effect of
      the greatest caloric sources of savory and sweetened discretionary foods in the American diet
      (savory snacks v. sugar-sweetened beverages). The rationale for conducting this study is to
      test the mechanism whereby sugar-sweetened beverages are hypothesized to relate to weight
      gain and obesity above and beyond other discretionary foods (lack of energy intake
      compensation due to liquid form of the beverage), since the evidence for this topic is
      limited. The subject population will be 20 men and women between the age of 18 and 59 who are
      overweight by body mass index (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), generally healthy, consume sugar-sweetened
      beverages or , and are willing to incorporate a sweetened beverage or a savory snack into
      their usual diet in the 4 week period.

      The study design will be a randomized parallel study consisting of a 4-week period during
      which each participant will be assigned to one of the two food groups. Participants in each
      group will be provided with a daily provision of a chosen sugar-sweetened beverage or savory
      snack to incorporate into their usual dietary pattern. The main outcome is dietary intake,
      specifically energy intake gathered by 24 hour dietary recalls. Secondary outcomes include
      measured body weight / BMI. The participant will be blinded to the main outcome so as not to
      affect the results. To do this they will be told the rationale for the study is to examine
      the effect of discretionary food sources on perceived health status and provided a standard,
      valid short questionnaire (SF-12) at the beginning, middle and end of each period.
      Investigators will estimate the energy intake necessary for weight maintenance of the subject
      based upon a standard approach and equation that accounts for the participant's age, sex,
      body size, and activity level. The subject will be provided with approximately 15-20% of
      their estimated daily energy needs in the form of a sugar-sweetened beverage or savory snack
      of their choice during one period and will be asked to incorporate this into their usual
      dietary pattern each day for 4 weeks. During the 4 week period the subject will be randomly
      prompted to complete five, 24-hour dietary recalls using an online tool. They will also be
      asked to fill out a short physical activity questionnaire during the intervention periods and
      a short questionnaire on perceived health (SF-12). They will have their weight, height, and
      waist circumference measured at the beginning and end of the period.
