        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (&gt; 18 yo) patients

          -  With symptomatic walled- off pancreatic necrosis in which an endoscopic approach is
             appropriate based on cross-sectional imaging

          -  Must have solid necrotic material present in their pancreatic fluid collection as
             determined by MRI, EUS, or direct transluminal endoscopic imaging of the collection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous intervention for pancreatic necrosis (surgical, percutaneous, or endoscopic)

          -  Indication for emergency laparotomy (compartment syndrome, bowel ischemia, bleeding,
             or perforation of a GI lumen)

          -  Uncorrectable coagulopathy.
