  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit acquired muscle weakness (ICUAW) is a common disease. After 7 days of
      mechanical ventilation, a quarter of patients develop an ICUAW responsible of a 15-20% of
      muscle loss. This is a serious pathology associated with high morbidity and mortality.

      Clinical diagnosis of ICUAW is difficult and need a patient awoken. CT scan and Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) are considered as &quot;gold standards&quot; to quantify and monitor changes in
      muscle mass. But these tools are not adapted to ICU patients.

      Ultrasound (US) is an easy access tool at the bedside to assess muscle mass and does not
      expose the patient to additional radiation.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between US and CT scan to measure
      quadriceps muscle thickness of ICU patients.

      As part of the monitoring of the neurological disease, brain CT scans are frequently
      performed. At the same time, an acquisition sequence centered on the quadriceps will follow
      the brain sequences. Up to three brain CT scans coupled with a quadriceps imaging will be
      performed between the day of admission and on the tenth day of hospitalization. An ultrasound
      of the quadriceps will be performed concomitantly. The thickness of the quadriceps is
      measured by an independent operator on CT and ultrasound images.
