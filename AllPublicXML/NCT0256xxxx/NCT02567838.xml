      The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the use of topical lidocaine gel in reducing
      pain associated with transrectal ultrasonography (TRS) in gynecologic field.

    <textblock>
      TRS is the common procedure to diagnose or exclude gynecologic disease in virgin women. This
      procedure can be associated with significant pain, both on insertion of the ultrasound probe
      as well as on manipulating the probe. The investigators evaluated a new technique for pain
      relief during TRS. In all, 80 consecutive subjects undergoing TRS at obstetric and
      gynecologic department were randomized to receive either lidocaine gel(Instillagel) or
      placebo(Aquagel) rectally prior to probe insertion. The pain encountered before, during, and
      after the procedure was graded by the patient on a 10-point visual analogue score. The
      gel-associated side effect was also evaluated by phone survey after 2 day of procedure. The
      aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the use of topical lidocaine gel in reducing pain
      associated with transrectal gynecologic ultrasonography.
