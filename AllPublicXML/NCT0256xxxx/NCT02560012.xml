  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is for subjects with metastatic Renal Cell Cancer (RCC). There are four Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved drugs for first-line therapy of Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) and two
      for second-line therapy. Each of these drugs targets a specific molecular pathway. At present
      oncologists select therapy based on current guidelines. There is a new method for trying to
      use biomarker information from the subject's tumor to select the best drug to treat the
      subject. This process is investigational, which is why this study is being done.

      Biomarkers are genes, proteins and other molecules that affect how cancer cells grow,
      multiply, die and respond to other compounds in the body. These biomarkers build a tumor
      profile or &quot;fingerprint&quot; of the subject's tumor. A new focus in cancer care is personalized
      treatment, where doctors select a drug based on the subject's tumor's unique &quot;fingerprint&quot;
      which is more likely to be effective in fighting the tumor. Selecting the treatment the
      subject is more likely to respond to requires a thorough understanding of the relationship
      between biomarker and treatment effect. The PI wants to gather data to understand that
      relationship to help treat future cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      efficacy of treatments that are selected based on tumor profiles.

      This will be a prospective, one-arm, proof of concept study designed to evaluate the efficacy
      of algorithm-based allocation (based on genomic/proteomic profile) of first-line therapy in
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      After eligibility review, patients will receive one of the four first-line therapy agents
      based on their tumor's molecular profile as determined using fresh biopsy tissue from an
      accessible metastatic site. Upon disease progression, patients will then receive one of two
      second-line agents based on their tumor's molecular profile.

      Because this is a proof-of-concept study, the sample size is based on feasibility of accrual.
      The clinic should be able to recruit 100 patients within a reasonable timeframe for the
      study. The number of patients receiving each drug will vary based on the frequency of
      molecular alterations in the population. Therefore, groups will not be compared with one
      another - the research goal is to determine whether the progression-free survival (PFS) for
      each drug is improved over the PFS reported in FDA approval trials for each drug when they
      are assigned based on molecular analysis.

    <description>Subjects will receive one of the four first-line therapy agents based on their tumor's profile. The first-line agents are sunitinib, temsirolimus, sorafenib, or pazopanib. These are all routine drugs for RCC treatment and will be given at their approved doses and dosing schedules.
Upon disease progression, subject's tumor(s) will be biopsied again to create another tumor profile. The second-line agents are everolimus or axitinib. Both of these are routine drugs for RCC treatment and will be given at their approved doses and dosing schedules.</description>
