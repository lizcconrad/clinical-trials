  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use CBPR mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative data collection) to
      conduct needs assessments and design and evaluate a core family-based intervention. Project
      activities will emphasize capacity building in two refugee communities resettled in Greater
      Boston—the Somali Bantu and the Bhutanese—actively engaging refugee community members,
      community advisory boards, services providers, and other stakeholders. Specific Aims are to:
      (1) deepen partnerships with the Somali Bantu and Bhutanese communities through
      co-leadership, capacity-building, and knowledge sharing; (2) collect and apply qualitative
      data to (a) prepare a needs assessment of mental health in children and adolescents, barriers
      to care, and services preferences with each target refugee group; (b) develop mental
      health/psychosocial assessments for refugee caregivers and children; (c) adapt the core
      components of a family-based strengthening intervention for use with refugees; and (3)
      conduct an 80-family pilot study to examine acceptability and sustainability of the
      intervention. Key outcomes will be reduced mental health symptoms among children and
      adolescents and improvement in caregiver-child relationships.
