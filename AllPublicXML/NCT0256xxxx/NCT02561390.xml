  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Allergic rhinitis(AR) and asthma was increased world wide. In 1998, ISAAC
      found that prevalence of AR and asthma inThailand was in moderately high group.

      Tests for immediated reaction SPT and spIgE, were used for evaluated sensitization of
      allergen in patient. They guided the investigators for proper management as well as patient
      education. Clinician will use the result for choose allergen in case that might need
      immunotherapy.

      SPT is safe and more economic for patient. Specific IgE has an advantage in patient who
      cannot withhold antihistamine prior SPT. In United state had a trial of result between SPT
      and spIgE for cockroach, cat, house dust mite and mold. It showed the correlation between two
      tests. In Thailand, the investigators haven't had data about it yet.

      SPT and specific IgE for allergens is necessary for allergen avoidance and specific
      immunotherapy. To have local allergen extracts will help the patients to easier get the
      appropriate management
