    <textblock>
      The enrolled subjects will get an intravenous cannulation in both elbows. The subject will
      get before xylocaine spray is placed, the intervention-arm, one intravenous cannulation in
      one of the elbows, the other intravenous cannulation is placed in the other arm before
      placebo spray is placed, the control arm. The pain score during insertion of the cannulation,
      the incidence of adverse events and the success rate and degree of difficulty to place an
      intravenous cannulation. The subjects and the one who place the cannulations will be blinded
      to the treatment.

    <textblock>
      The enrolled subjects will get an intravenous cannulation in both elbows. The influence of
      the left or right-handedness is reduced by randomizing the arms of the subjects in the
      placebo group or xylocaine group. The subject will get before xylocaine spray is placed, the
      intervention-arm, one intravenous cannulation in one of the elbows, the other intravenous
      cannulation is placed in the other arm before placebo spray is placed, the control arm. The
      pain score during insertion of the cannulation, the incidence of adverse events and the
      success rate and degree of difficulty to place an intravenous cannulation. The subjects and
      the one who place the cannulations will be blinded to the treatment.
