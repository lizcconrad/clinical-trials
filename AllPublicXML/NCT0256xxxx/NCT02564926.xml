    <textblock>
      This is a 52 weeks, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-centres phase IV study.

      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg qd or glimepiride 1~2 mgqd
      in an open-label manner for 12 months as add-on to metformin 1000 mg.

      Parallel group study design was chosen. In order maintain the practicality of the phase IV
      study, open label design of study drug delivery was chosen. The reading of the DXA scans will
      be conducted by one expert in blinded manner. Glimepiride is the most frequently used SUs in
      Korea and therefore this was chosen as comparator.Dapagliflozin treatment will be associated
      with reduction of total body FM, BW, abdominal VAT and SAT volume compared with glimepiride.
