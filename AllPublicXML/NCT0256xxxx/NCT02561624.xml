  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) is shown to reduce malaria
      prevalence. The Tanzania Net Voucher Scheme has been an active component of bed net
      distribution to pregnant women in Tanzania since 2004. The transition from paper vouchers to
      electronic vouchers in this program has increased efficiency and the ability to track and
      distribute nets since 2007. Although the program has been successful, to date, electronic
      voucher redemption varies widely across the country and it has not been clearly established
      as to what barriers exist for women who receive electronic vouchers in the program. This
      cluster-randomized trial was designed to examine perceived barriers to electronic voucher
      redemption among pregnant women and to evaluate if educational and personalized text messages
      around electronic voucher redemption and bed net usage will increase electronic voucher
      redemption when directed at pregnant women who receive electronic vouchers in the currently
      existing program.
