    <textblock>
      NC ProCESS is a cohort of patients from diverse backgrounds diagnosed with early prostate
      cancer, who were enrolled from January 2011-June 2013. These patients were recruited
      throughout North Carolina, and also in partnership with institutions across the country.
      Patients enrolled before they start treatment, and are then followed prospectively through
      treatment and then afterwards. This observational study collects information on quality of
      life, cancer control, and health care received inclusive of treatment and management of
      subsequent effects including complications and recurrence. The objective of this study is to
      examine comparative outcomes among different modern prostate cancer treatment options in this
      cohort of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Localized prostate cancer treatment options is consistently a &quot;highest priority&quot; comparative
      effectiveness research (CER) topic according to the Institute of Medicine, Agency for
      Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and other summary reports. Patients urgently need
      information on the comparative outcomes of modern treatment options to guide decision-making
      for this disease that causes significant burden based on its high prevalence, mortality and
      treatment effects on quality of life. The status quo as it pertains to prostate cancer is
      significant overtreatment causing potential patient harm, rapid diffusion of new/expensive
      technologies without proven benefit and patients lacking high quality research evidence to
      balance direct-to-consumer advertising and guide individualized decision-making.

      NC ProCESS is a population-based cohort designed specifically to address well-described
      knowledge gaps. It was designed in close collaboration with the unique AHRQ consortium
      stakeholder group, which included representatives from patients, clinicians and policymakers.
      Stakeholders helped define study design to emphasize &quot;real-world&quot; patients and select
      patient-centered and relevant outcomes, and have been involved throughout assembly of this
      patient cohort. The diverse cohort is well-represented by &quot;hard to reach&quot; patients;
      enrollment before treatment avoids biases with participation and recall. As clinical trials
      are not feasible to address the central questions in prostate cancer CER, this prospective
      study will yield the highest level of evidence to inform patients and other stakeholders.
      With an assembled cohort, this study is necessary to examine comparative outcomes.

    <description>For each treatment group (radiation therapy, prostatectomy, active surveillance), we will describe the cumulative utilization for each category of health care. These categories are physician/specialty visits, hospitalizations, diagnostic tests/procedures, medications, and prostate cancer treatments (for the initial cancer and for recurrence). Measurements will be attained by review of medical records.</description>
