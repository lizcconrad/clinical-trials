      The ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa highlights the need for prevention and
      treatment strategies, as supportive therapy is currently the only treatment for Ebola virus
      disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity
      of two doses of the HPIV3-EbovZ GP vaccine candidate administered intranasally in healthy
      adults.

      This study will enroll healthy adults who have low pre-existing serum antibody titers to
      human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3). Participants will be enrolled sequentially in two
      cohorts. Cohort 1 will receive two doses of 10^6.0 PFU/mL of HPIV3-EbovZ GP, approximately
      4-8 weeks apart. Cohort 2 will receive two doses of 10^7.0 PFU/mL of HPIV3-EbovZ GP,
      approximately 4-8 weeks apart.

      Participants will be admitted to the inpatient unit 1 or 2 days before receiving their first
      dose of the vaccine. While in the inpatient unit, all participants will undergo a medical
      history review, physical examination, nasal wash, blood collection, pregnancy testing (for
      female participants), and pregnancy prevention counseling. Participants will be discharged
      from the inpatient unit on Day 7 or possibly later, depending on the results of participant's
      lab tests. An additional study visit will occur at Day 14.

      On Day 26, participants will be readmitted to the inpatient unit, and they will receive their
      second dose of the vaccine on Day 28. Participants will undergo the same study procedures
      that occurred during the first inpatient stay, and they will be discharged on Day 35.
      Additional study visits will occur on Days 42, 56, 84, 112, 180, 270, and 360.
