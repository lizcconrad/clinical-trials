  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an radioactive airway
      stent loaded with 125I seeds compared to a conventional airway stent in patients with
      malignant airway obstruction caused by both primary and metastatic malignant tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant tumors of the lung, esophagus, thyroid, or other mediastinal structures often
      involve the trachea by direct tumor growth compression and (or) invasion. In addition,
      extrathoracic cancers metastasize to these lymph nodes as well. However, surgical resection
      and airway reconstruction are the gold-standard treatment for MAO, many patients with airway
      involvement are poor surgical candidates based on physiologic or oncologic criteria.There are
      three main types of malignant airway obstruction: endobronchial obstruction, extrinsic
      compression, and a mixed pattern. For endobronchial obstruction, ablative techniques that
      destroy tissue are indicated, including lasers, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation
      (APC), photodynamic therapy, microdebriders, and cryotherapy, but primary tracheal cancers
      are less common than other types of lung cancer. If the obstruction is exclusively or mainly
      due to compression from outside the airway wall, the only option consists of placement of a
      stent or endoprosthesis. However, follow-up data has demonstrated that postoperative
      restenosis of stenting occurs in 5-45% of cases as a result of neoplastic infiltration
      through the mesh into the lumen or tumor overgrowth above and below the mesh stents.
      Encouraged by the success of 125I esophageal and biliary stent in esophageal carcinoma , a
      tracheal stent loaded with 125I radioactive seeds was developed in investigators'institute.
      After successful in vitro and in vivo evaluations of the delivery system, investigator will
      prospectively compare responses to treatment with this irradiation tracheal stent versus the
      conventional self-expandable stent in patients with MAO.
