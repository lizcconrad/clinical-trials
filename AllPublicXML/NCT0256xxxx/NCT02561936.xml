  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of rilpivirine in
      healthy adult participants following: 1) administration of a single dose of two different
      oral dispersible tablet formulation candidates and of an oral granules formulation with that
      following administration of a single dose of the 25-milligram (mg) oral tablet (EDURANT),
      after a standardized breakfast; 2) administration of a single dose of one selected oral
      formulation candidate (a dispersible tablet or granules) in different fed conditions
      (standardized breakfast or yoghurt) and in the fasted state and breakfast and 3)
      administration of a single dose of one selected oral formulation candidate (a dispersible
      tablet or granules) dispersed in water or in orange juice, in fed condition (standardized
      breakfast).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-panel, 4-way crossover study in healthy adult
      participants to assess the relative bioavailability of rilpivirine following single dose
      administration of oral pediatric formulation candidates (two dispersible tablet formulations
      and one granules formulation), compared to the commercially available 25-mg tablet (EDURANT)
      and to assess the effect of food and different food constituents on the oral bioavailability
      of rilpivirine following single dose administration of one selected formulation candidate.
      The study will consist of 2 panels: Panel 1 and Panel 2. In each panel, participants will be
      randomized to receive treatment A, B, C, D and E, F, G, H, respectively. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters will be evaluated primarily. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the
             absence of any clinically significant abnormality and includes a physical examination,
             medical history, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and the results of blood
             biochemistry and hematology tests and a urinalysis performed at screening. If there
             are abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the Investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This

             serum follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level greater than or equal to (&gt;) 40
             international units per liter (IU/L) [to be confirmed at screening for all
             postmenopausal women]), OR permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion
             [which includes tubal ligation procedures as consistent with local regulations], total
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) or otherwise incapable
             of becoming pregnant, and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening

             days after receiving the last dose of study drugs and male participants must agree not
             to donate sperm during the study and for at least 90 days after receiving the last
             dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female participants who are breastfeeding at Screening

          -  Participants with a history of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering
             study drug to the participants or that could prevent, limit or confound the protocol
             specified assessments. This may include, but is not limited to, renal dysfunction,
             significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant
             diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the Investigator's opinion could
             influence drug absorption or bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic,
             rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or metabolic disturbances
