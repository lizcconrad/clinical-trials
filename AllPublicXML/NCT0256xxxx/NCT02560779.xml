      The purpose of the phase 1b portion is to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a
      recommended phase 2 dose for TRC105 when added to standard dose sorafenib in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Up to 18 patients will be treated.

      The purpose of the phase 2 portion is to estimate the ORR of patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma by RECIST 1.1. Up to 21 patients will be treated in phase 2.

      Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting several receptor tyrosine kinases,
      including the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and
      cancer progression. Sorafenib is approved for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). TRC105 is an antibody to endoglin, an important angiogenic target on
      proliferating endothelial cells that is distinct from VEGFR. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis,
      tumor growth and metastases and complements the activity of bevacizumab and multi-kinase
      inhibitors that target the VEGFR in preclinical models. Together, the use of TRC105 with
      sorafenib may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy
      over that seen with sorafenib alone.
