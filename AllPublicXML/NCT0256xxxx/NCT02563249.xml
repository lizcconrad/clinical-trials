      If investigators know that the anticipatory mechanisms involved in precision grip take into
      account the gravity, however it is unclear how they adapt to changes in the gravitational
      level. The objectives of this study are to study and model the movement control and the
      mechanisms underlying learning and adapting to the condition of weightlessness. Specifically,
      i) investigators will determine if a change in the level of gravity is taken into account
      when controlling grip force and ii) investigators will examine the effects of gravity change
      on hand-eye coordination.
