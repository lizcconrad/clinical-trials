      Summary: Emerging data demonstrate long-term morbidity and mortality in those who survive
      critical illness. However, there is no data regarding long-term follow-up for ICU survivors.
      The investigators have begun the implementation of an ICU recovery clinic.

      Rationale:

      ICU survivors are at high risk for functional, cognitive and psychiatric impairments.
      However, methods to mitigate these impairments and improve recovery are lacking. Special
      follow-up clinics for survivors of critical illness have been proposed and implemented to
      some degree, but are uncommon.

      Objectives:

        1. To evaluate physical function, cognitive function, and overall functional status during
           recovery from critical illness.

        2. To evaluate anxiety, depression, and PTSD during recovery from critical illness.

        3. To evaluate resilience during recovery from critical illness.

        4. To evaluate healthcare utilization rates, morbidity, and mortality following critical
           illness.

        5. Added April 2016: To study the voice and swallowing function of patients following
           recovery from critical illness.

        6. Added April 2016: To study the pain of patients following recovery from critical
           illness.

      Intervention:

      A prospective observational study of all patients who attend our ICU recovery clinic.

      Methods:

      Patients will be identified for participation in our ICU Recovery Clinic during their
      admission to the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). They
      will be asked to return to the ICU recovery clinic within 1 month of hospital discharge.
      Structured clinic visits as standard of care will include medication reconciliation and
      evaluation by a pharmacist, along with an evaluation by a clinic physician to address acute
      medical issues and provide counselling. They will also undergo standardized testing to
      evaluate physical function, cognitive function, and psychiatric function. Added April 2016:
      They will also undergo a standardized evaluation of speech, swallow, and pain.
