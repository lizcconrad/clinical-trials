    <textblock>
      This is a bridging trial of the recombinant HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine manufactured by Xiamen
      Innovax Biotech CO., LTD.The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the
      immunogenicity (type specific IgG antibody) and safety of the tested vaccine administered in
      girls aged 9-17 years is non-inferior to young healthy adults of 18-26 years according to the
      standard 3-dose schedule (0,1,6 months). Meanwhile, this study tries to compare the
      difference of safety and immunogenicity among different schedules (0-6m vs 0-1-6m).

      Totally 750 healthy girls of 9-17 years and 225 healthy young women of 18-26 years were
      enrolled. The subjects of 9-14 years will be stratified into 2 subset. Subjects in each
      subsets will be randomly assigned into the standard 0-1-6m schedule group or an alternative
      0-6m group. All subjects of 15-26 years of age will receive the standard 0-1-6m schedule.
      Participants were actively monitored for adverse events for 1 month after each injection.
      Severe adverse events during the trial were followed up. Serum samples from all the subjects
      would be collected on day 0, 6m, 7m to evaluate the immunogenicity.
