  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2881078 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that is being evaluated for
      effects on muscle growth and strength in subjects with muscle wasting to improve their
      physical function. Part A of this study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of GSK2881078 in healthy, older men and post-menopausal women who will take
      daily dosing for 28 days and be followed for a total of 70 days. Part B of this study will
      characterize the effect of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibition on the GSK2881078
      pharmacokinetics. Part B will only be conducted if safe and efficacious dose is identified in
      Part A. Part A will include healthy older males and post-menopausal females; and randomize
      approximately 60 subjects (about 15 per cohort [4 cohorts]) to complete approximately 48
      (about 12 per cohort). Part B will enroll one cohort of approximately 15 healthy male
      subjects to complete approximately 12. The study duration will be approximately 115 days for
      Part A and 122 days for Part B.
