  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 36-week, three-arm randomized, controlled trial using a team-based model to compare
      two weight loss programs to control. Each intervention will use insights from behavioral
      economics to leverage social incentives and gamification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality affecting more than one in three
      adults in the United States. Modifiable health behaviors contribute to this growing epidemic.
      Insights from behavioral economics have shown promise for motivating behavior change through
      the use of financial incentives. However, social incentives or those influences that impact
      individuals to adjust their inherent behaviors based on social ties and connections have not
      been well examined. Social incentives are a more patient-centered approach that leverages and
      enhances the existing connections and influences on the individual. Since one individual's
      behavior change is connected to many others within their network, social incentives have the
      potential to be a scalable intervention that impacts the community. Gamification, or the use
      of game design in non-game situations, is often used in the real world, but its effectiveness
      is unknown. In this study, investigators will conduct a 36-week, three-arm, randomized,
      controlled trial using a team-based model to compare two weight loss programs to control.
      Each intervention will use insights from behavioral economics to leverage social incentives
      and gamification.

    <description>Participants choose a weight loss goal of 6-8% of baseline weight and given access to a wireless weight scale and smartphone application activity tracker to receive feedback on weight and feedback on step counts.
They will be given information on the federal and CDC guidelines for physical activity and will also be told that they should strive to achieve 10,000 steps per day to help promote weight loss.</description>

    <description>Participants choose a weight loss goal of 6-8% of baseline weight and given access to a wireless weight scale and smartphone application activity tracker to receive feedback on weight and feedback on step counts.
All participants play a game with their teammate that includes points, levels and the opportunity to win a trophy, plaque or medal. They will advance or not advance based on their progress with weight loss and physical activity through 24 weeks. During the 12-week follow-up they'll be asked to maintain or make progress toward their weight loss goal.</description>

    <description>Participants choose a weight loss goal of 6-8% of baseline weight and given access to a wireless weight scale and smartphone application activity tracker to receive feedback on weight and feedback on step counts.
Participants will be asked to allow the study team to share their weight and step data with their primary care physician (PCP).
