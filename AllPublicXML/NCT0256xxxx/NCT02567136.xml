      The purpose of the study is to determine if we are able to find one or more biomarkers of
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) using magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans at different levels, 3 tesla (3T) and 7 tesla (7T). A biomarker
      is a measurable characteristic that can be used as an indicator of a particular disease
      state. Identifying biomarkers of a disease can lead to a better understanding of the disease
      as well as improved treatments. This study will enroll patients with ALS, PLS, and healthy
      controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  21 to 75 years of age inclusive.

          -  Willing and able to give signed informed consent that has been approved by the
             Institutional Review Board (IRB).

        ALS patients:

          -  A clinical diagnosis of possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite
             ALS, according to a modified El Escorial criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease,
             etc).

          -  Clinically significant history of unstable medical illness (unstable angina, advanced
             cancer, etc) over the last 30 days.

          -  Inability to undergo MRI scanning, including but not limited to unable to remain still
             in an MRI scanner for more than 30 minutes, claustrophobia, presence of paramagnetic
             substances or pacemakers in body, weight over 300 lbs, or in the opinion of the
             investigator, if there is a strong likelihood that the subject would not be able to
             lie flat comfortably for 75-90 minutes.

          -  The subject requires assistance to ambulate OR climb stairs, unless in the opinion of
             the investigator, and based upon the subject's rate of disease progression, the
             subject is likely to be able to participate in the MRI screening 12 months after
             enrollment.
