  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to transition patients who have been stable on Belatacept for
      one year after kidney transplant from standard 4-week to an investigational 8-week belatacept
      dosing schedule. The investigators hypothesize that renal function and acute rejection rates
      will be non-inferior with 8-week belatacept dosing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current dosing protocol for patients who have undergone a kidney transplant requires that
      Belacept be given as an infusion every 4 weeks. The investigator wants to assess if the
      patients who have been stable for one year after transplant can be safely transitioned to an
      8-week Belatacept infusion schedule. Renal function and any episodes of acute rejection will
      be closely monitored.

    <time_frame>Baseline, at 12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The mean estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) will be calculated according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation using serum creatinine measurements and the patient's age, gender, and race. Change is the difference in the eGFR from baseline to 12 months from baseline. An eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 indicates lower renal function.</description>
