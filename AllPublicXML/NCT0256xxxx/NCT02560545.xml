  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective treatment of acute pain, chronic and persistent is the most important concern in
      the world today. Although a variety of pain medications including anti-inflammatory
      painkillers and opiouids, patients continue to suffer from pain constantly. For over a
      century ,International committees studied the issue of cannabis, and almost uniformly
      recommended the use of cannabis for various medical applications ,especially those that
      include pain treatment.

      Despite the widespread use of THC in clinical practice, there are few studies on the efficacy
      of THC In a double-blind, randomized trial. In addition, few studies examined the effect of
      THC on the experience pain in healthy subjects and most of them did not find an effect on
      pain experimental induced by capsain. so checking other models of pain such as thermal pain
      and mechanical pain in addition to checking the influence on the regulation of pain will
      contribute to understanding the mechanism of action of THC. Understanding the mechanism of
      action of THC in relieving pain will lead to predicting who will benefit from this treatment
      and direct patients for selection of appropriate medication according to the damaged
      mechanism.
