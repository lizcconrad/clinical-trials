  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-part study will evaluate how safe LY3154207 is and the effects it has on the body.

      Part A will include healthy participants. Each participant will receive daily doses of
      LY3154207 or placebo for 14 days. Part A will last approximately 4 weeks including a 17 day
      stay in the clinical research unit (CRU) and follow-up.

      Part B is contingent on the results of Part A. Part B will include participants with
      Parkinson's disease. Each participant will receive daily doses of LY3154207 or placebo for 14
      days. Part B will last approximately 4 weeks including a 17 day stay in the CRU and
      follow-up.

      Both Part A and Part B will require screening within 30 days prior to the start of the study.
