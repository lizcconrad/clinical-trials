         20. Subjects who show any clinical laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that
             in the opinion of the Investigator would endanger the subject or interfere with the
             study conduct. If the results of the clinical laboratory or ECG are outside of normal
             reference range the subject may still be enrolled but only if these findings are
             determined to be not clinically significant by the Investigator. This determination

         29. Subjects who have received treatment with an investigational drug or device within 30
             days of the screening visit or participated in a central nervous system clinical trial

         30. Subjects with any other medical condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator
