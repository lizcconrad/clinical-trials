  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular stimulation (NMES) has been used for several years in the rehabilitation of
      COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients (among others) to improve their
      resistance to efforts in everyday life. In patients in intensive care, it seems to improve
      strength, reduce the loss of muscle mass, prevent the development of CIP / CIM (Critical
      illness polyneuropathy / critical illness myopathy) and perhaps even reduce ventilation days,
      with expected effects on the duration of hospitalization and the long-term functional
      outcome. Although its use could sometimes be limited by the development of peripheral edema
      and use of vasoconstrictors, the main advantage of this technique is the possibility of being
      used very early, even in patients that require deep sedation . This is extremely important
      given that the muscular atrophy process already starts 18h after the onset of invasive
      ventilation and as signs of impaired nerve transmission are developed in one third of
      patients at risk within 72 hours.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the effects, in the short and medium term, of early
      neuromuscular stimulation in patients who are at higher risk of developing a critical illness
      polyneuropathy (CIP) / critical illness myopathy (CIM) spectrum disease.

      This is a randomized controlled single-blind study comparing a group of patients submitted to
      NMES early (up to 5 days after admission) versus a control group unstimulated.

    <description>The duration of ventilatory support is defined as the time in days, during which the patient requires invasive media type (continuous or not, intubation or tracheotomy and need the help of the respirator) or noninvasive (discontinuous or CPAP NIV (continuous positive airway pressure, noninvasive ventilation)- dependence). This will be assessed during the entire length of stay of the patient inside the intensive care unit (ICU).</description>

    <description>This simple functional test was developed to measure the functional abilities of patients severely debilitated that are found in the ICU. It consists in assessing four different levels of physical ability: the bending force of the shoulder and knee extension in sitting position, measured with the Oxford scale; the level of assistance needed to move from a sitting position to a standing position; and the ability to stand and walk on site. Patients will be tested as soon as possible aka when the patient has: -1 ≤ RASS ≤ 1, is sufficiently collaborating and not heavily sedated.</description>

    <description>Patients included in the 'stimulated' group will be stimulated at the level of the quadriceps twice a day, bilaterally and simultaneously, five days per week from Monday to Friday (Stimulator: Gymna Belgium, DUO 400). The stimulation protocol (rectified alternating current; frequency, 75 Hz; intensity, 0-80 mA; pulse duration, 350 microseconds) is the one proposed by the manufacturer for atrophy prevention. The intensity of the electrical current will be gradually increased, without exceeding 80mA or the pain threshold of the patient.</description>
