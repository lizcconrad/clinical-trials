  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the first 28 day cycle, all patients will be treated with single agent pacritinib at 200
      mg twice daily. The investigators chose this starting dose based on the previous three phase
      I studies of pacritinib as a single agent which showed that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      to be 500 mg, and subsequently, the dose of 400 mg daily was recommended for the phase II
      studies.

      Recently, the results of the phase III PERSIST-1 trial comparing pacritinib to best available
      therapy (BAT) in patients with MF was reported at the 2015 American Society of Clinical
      Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. Pacritinib was found to be significantly more effective than
      BAT at reducing spleen volume at 24 weeks of therapy and improving constitutional symptoms.

      Low dose decitabine has demonstrated depletion of DNMT1 in normal hematopoietic stem cells
      (HSC) without cytotoxicity and subcutaneous (SC) instead of intravenous (IV) administration
      may avoid high peak levels that can cause apoptosis. Furthermore, the low toxicity associated
      with low dose decitabine would allow for more frequent (1 to 3 times weekly) administration
      of the drug which would catch more cells in S-phase via greater exposure time. Based on these
      findings, a starting dose of decitabine 5 mg/m2 SC twice weekly should be well tolerated and
      effective in patients with MF and MPN/MDS syndromes when combined with pacritinib 400 mg
      daily.

Pacritinib will be administered orally at a dose of 200 mg twice daily continuously for Days 1 through 28 of a 28-day cycle.
Decitabine will be administered as a subcutaneous injection in clinic on Days 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 19, 22, and 26 of a 28-day cycle.
Patients may continue treatment for up to 12 cycles.</description>
