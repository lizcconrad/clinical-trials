  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies patients' genomic sequencing in determining specific
      treatments, also called Precision Medicine, in patients with cancer that has spread to other
      parts of the body (metastatic) and/or cannot be removed by surgery. Examining the genetic
      code of a patient's tumor, a mutation (a change in the deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] sequence
      of a cell or gene) may be identified and matched with available treatment that targets the
      mutated gene or an alternative treatment that may provide benefit for the patient with the
      mutation identified. Precision medicine may impacts patient's response to treatment by
      targeting specific mutations and may increase survival and improve quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of implementing a Precision Oncology protocol in the treatment
      of patients who undergo genomic sequencing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine treatment response rates in patients who receive targeted treatment versus
      those who do not receive targeted treatment.

      II. To assess survival in patients who receive targeted treatment versus those who do not
      receive targeted treatment.

      III. To assess changes in patient-reported outcomes in patients who receive targeted
      treatment versus those who do not receive targeted treatment.

      IV. To perform exploratory statistical genetic and bioinformatics analyses using the data
      derived from the genomic sequencing to catalogue additional important variants and determine
      whether there are any patterns or associations among patient level risk factors, their
      outcomes and genomic information that was not identified by the original genomic sequencing
      analyses.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive treatment based on the results of their genomic sequencing analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
