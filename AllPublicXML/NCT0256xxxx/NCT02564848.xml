  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the outcomes of lumpectomy, surgery to remove a tumor, without
      sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for women at least 65 years of age with clinically node-negative
      breast cancer. Clinically node-negative means that during a physical exam your doctor cannot
      feel or see that any lymph nodes near the breast area are swollen and there is also no
      imaging evidence, such as from a mammogram, of nodal involvement.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether omission of sentinel node biopsy
      in patients who meet eligibility criteria results in an acceptable regional recurrence rate
      over a 6-year period. A regional recurrence is defined as any recurrence in the ipsilateral
      axillary nodes, supraclavicular nodes or internal mammary nodes.

      Eligible patients will undergo standard of care lumpectomy without sentinel node biopsy
      followed by radiation and hormonal therapy or have already undergone the procedure prior to
      enrollment in the study. She may also receive chemotherapy as determined by her treating
      physician. A physical examination of the affected breast and regional lymph nodes will be
      conducted every six months for the first two years of follow up and then yearly for the last
      3 years of follow up. Imaging of the affected breast will occur every 12 months after surgery
      per standard of care.
