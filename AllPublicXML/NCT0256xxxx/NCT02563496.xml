  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, non-comparative, single arm study of
      pediatric subjects with Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) malaria, aged 6 months to &lt;16 years of
      age. A total of 60 subjects will be enrolled. Potential subjects who are slide-positive for
      P. vivax will be started by the site on chloroquine (CQ) per local/national guidelines. Sites
      will have up to 48 hours to obtain consent. Once full consent is provided, all subjects will
      be screened and, if eligible, receive Tafenoquine (TQ), given as a single dose on Day 1. All
      study medication should be taken with food. After the treatment period, subjects will attend
      up to 7 follow-up visits through Day 120 (Days 3, 8, 15, 29, 60, 90 and 120). The main cohort
      will consist of subjects aged &gt;=2 years to &lt;16 years with no restriction on gender. Subjects
      will be dosed according to four weight bands. Within the total of 60 enrolled pediatric
      subjects, a second cohort of up to 6 infants aged &gt;=6 months to &lt;2 years (weighing &gt;=5
      kilogram [kg]) will be recruited following completion of a planned first interim analysis. An
      interim analysis will be conducted once sufficient data from 16 subjects is available to
      assess pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety parameters. If needed, a second interim analysis will
      be conducted after a total of 32 subjects have enrolled. The primary objective of this PK
      bridging study is to adequately characterize the systemic TQ exposure in the pediatric
      population.
