      The goal of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of exergaming
      (i.e. video gaming that involves physical activity) to reduce adiposity in overweight and
      obese children.

      The GAMESQUAD study is a 6-month, 2-arm randomized controlled trial among 46 overweight/obese
      children (aged 10 to 12 years) assigned to: 1) 3 hours/week of in-home exergaming or 2) a
      control group. An innovative aspect is the inclusion of a fitness trainer who will regularly
      video chat with the participant and virtually monitor gameplay. The study will advance the
      field by: 1) establishing the efficacy of exergaming to reduce BMIz among overweight and
      obese children and 2) demonstrating the potential of exergaming to reduce body fat and
      improve children's cardiovascular health.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in body mass index z-score (BMIz) compared to a control group</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Height and weight will be collected at Screening, Week 0, and Week 24 using standardized clinic procedures. Standing height will be measured in centimeters with a Harpenden stadiometer (Holtain Limited, Crymych, UK) with shoes removed while the participant inhales/holds breath and an assessor applies light traction to align the participant's head along the Frankfort Horizontal Plane. Weight will be measured in kilograms with a Michelli GSE 460 scale (G.T. Michelli Co., Baton Rouge, LA) while wearing only a hospital gown and undergarments. The gown will be weighed separately and subtracted from the participant's weight to calculate metabolic weight. All anthropometric measures will be taken twice and recorded to the nearest 0.1 units, with a third measure if the initial 2 measures are greater than 0.5 units apart. BMIz will be calculated based on the child's age, sex, height, and weight using the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Growth Charts and/or SAS macro.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in body fat</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be completed at Week 0 and Week 24 with a GE iDXA whole-body scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) to measure adiposity, including total body fat mass and regional fat mass in the extremities and trunk.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Resting blood pressure will be assessed at Screening, Week 0, and Week 24 using standard clinical procedures on a standard mercury manometer. The participant's age-, sex-, and height-specific percentile will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in total cholesterol and fasting glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A blood sample will be taken at Week 0 and Week 24 by a trained phlebotomist following standard clinic procedures after an 8-hour fast. The full amount of blood drawn will be less than 2.5 Tablespoons. Serum concentrations of glucose will be obtained from a DXC600 by Beckman Coulter, and total cholesterol will be assayed on a DXC600 from Trinity. The majority (~2.0 Tablespoons) of the blood sample will be archived for future analysis</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be assessed with an Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer (ActiGraph, of Ft. Walton Beach, FL) to determine changes in habitual physical activity outside of the gaming intervention. Participants will wear the accelerometer for two bouts of 7-days following Week 0 baseline clinic visit and Week 24 clinic visit, but not during the gaming intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in diet</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary information will be collected from the participant at Week 0 and Week 24. Healthy diet score will be determined by the NCI Self-administered 24-hour Dietary Recall (ASA24-Kids). This survey is administered on a computer through a web-based program.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in health behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants, with help from a parent if necessary, will complete a questionnaire at Week 0 and Week 24 to collect information about the participant's lifestyle, including physical activity and diet habits, smoking status, media use, quality of life, friends, confidence, and development level. This questionnaire will be completed on a computer using the REDCap secure survey system.</description>
