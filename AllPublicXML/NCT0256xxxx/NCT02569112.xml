      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect on the subject outcome using the
      combination of the Zeltiq Cryolipolysis device and the Venus Concept multipolar
      radiofrequency device with varipulse technology for the enhanced non-surgical treatment of
      skin laxity in the flank area.

      Commercially available as the Zeltiq CoolSculpting system, cryolipolysis is FDA cleared for
      use in the United States for an indication of fat layer reduction in the flanks, thighs, and
      abdomen through cold-assisted lipolysis. CoolSculpting has been clinically proven to
      non-surgically reduce subcutaneous fat bulges, allowing patients to achieve noticeable and
      measurable aesthetic results without the pain, expense, downtime, and risks associated with
      existing invasive and minimally-invasive procedures. The Zeltiq CoolSculpting System is a
      non-invasive device designed to cool subcutaneous fat without affecting adjacent or
      underlying structures.

      The RF device to be used in this study is a FDA cleared device used for aesthetic
      non-surgical skin tightening procedures including wrinkles, skin rhytides and cellulite in
      the face and body. The Venus Legacy utilizes a multi-polar radiofrequency system to deliver
      homogenous heating to multiple tissue depths. The Venus Legacy device also utilizes pulsed
      magnetic field technology as well as pulsed negative pressure technology.

      The flanks of Ten (10) healthy adults (male and female), 21 to 50 years of age, who desire a
      reduction in focal fat of the flanks will be recruited from the investigator's subject
      populations. Informed Consent will be obtained from each subject during a screening visit.

      The photos will be taken prior to the treatment series, one week post treatment series, at 3
      and 6 months post treatment series for the evaluation of two blinded reviewers as well as for
      the investigator to assess.

    <description>Venus Legacy is a multi-polar Radio frequency (RF) technology combining pulsed electro magnetic fields (PEMF) and mild suction stimulation (varipulse). RF technology works by exciting fat molecules 2-3 million times per second to achieve desired heating effects on fat. RF has been shown to increase the production new collagen and other cell enhancing biological molecules. PEMF delivered in synergy with RF assists in the creation of FGF-2 (fibroblast growth factors 2), TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-a) and TGF-β (transforming growth factor-b) increasing fibroblasts. Varipulse technology increases the movement of fluids in the lymphatic system and manually stimulates fibroblasts.</description>

    <description>Cryolipolysis has been developed and commercialized to non-invasively reduce subcutaneous fat. The cryolipolysis technology utilizes the sensitivity of fat cells to cold injury in order to selectively eliminate subcutaneous fat tissue without affecting the skin or other surrounding tissues. Cryolipolysis technology enables a non-invasive alternative for subcutaneous fat reduction through cellular apoptosis.</description>
