    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to develop and test the effectiveness of a 24 month,
      patient-centered, pragmatic and scalable obesity treatment program delivered within primary
      care, inclusive of an underserved population. Half of the participants will receive a
      behavioral intervention delivered in a primary care setting and half of the participants will
      receive usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster-randomized, two-arm controlled trial in primary care settings. A
      total of 18 primary care clinics inclusive of low income populations with a high percentage
      of African Americans from urban and rural areas across Louisiana will be randomized to either
      1) intervention or 2) usual care. The sample will include 800 obese (BMI 30-50 kg/m2)
      patients (18 clinics, 44 patients / clinic). The primary aim of this trial is to develop and
      test the effectiveness of a 24 month, patient-centered, pragmatic and scalable obesity
      treatment program delivered within primary care, inclusive of an underserved population.
      Patients in the intervention arm will attend weekly (15 in-person) sessions in the first six
      months, followed by monthly sessions for the remaining 18 months. The behavioral intervention
      will be delivered by a trained health coach embedded in the primary care clinic. Primary Care
      Practitioners in the intervention arm will receive a series of webinars on obesity science to
      help them manage and treat obese patients. Patients assigned to the usual care arm will
      continue to interact with their Primary Care Practitioner according to their usual schedule,
      and will receive a series of newsletters on topics of interest, including importance of sleep
      for health, household money management, family coping skills, smoking cessation, etc. Primary
      Care Practitioners in the usual care arm will receive a webinar describing the current
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approach to reimbursing for obesity
      treatment, and a reminder informational brochure will be sent to the Primary Care
      Practitioners each year. Patients in both arms will be assessed on primary and secondary
      outcome measures at baseline, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of intervention.
