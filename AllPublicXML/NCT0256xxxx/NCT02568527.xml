  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to undertake a pilot safety and efficacy study of a
      synthetic biodegradable membrane as a substitute for using donor human amniotic membrane
      (hAM) for the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) by combining this with freshly
      excised limbal tissue in theatre as a one stage procedure

    <textblock>
      This study will involve the used of a synthetic biodegradable Poly Lactide-co-Glycolic Acid
      (PLGA) biodegradable, synthetic carrier membrane (PLGA) membrane as a substitute for using
      donor human amniotic membrane (hAM) for the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD)
      by combining this with freshly excised limbal tissue in theatre as a one stage procedure.

      This has the potential to simplify the current procedure and make it safer and accessible to
      more surgeons and eventually benefit more patients. The use of PLGA membrane, in place of hAM
      for limbal transplants, is a novel technique and has a lot of promise and potential, which
      will potentially benefit patients at large and significantly bring down costs for the limbal
      transplants while reducing the disease transmission risks of using human donor tissue.
