  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common Female endocrine disorder , with a
      prevalence ranging between 6% to10% based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria
      and when the broader Rotterdam criteria are applied it reaches as high as 15%. Typically,
      PCOS can identify during the early adolescence. Insulin resistance is a common finding in the
      obese women with PCOS. It is most prevalent and severe in PCOS phenotype involving
      hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. Women with PCOS who have regular cycles are
      metabolically less abnormal. Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a dermatosis characterized by
      velvety, papillomatous, brownish-black, hyperkeratotic plaques, typically of the
      intertriginous surfaces and neck. Although AN is associated with malignancy, the recognition
      of its more common connection to obesity and insulin resistance allows for diagnosis of
      related disorders including type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and polycystic ovary
      syndrome. Significant improvements in ovulation and pregnancy rates as a result of clomiphene
      treatment after metformin in women with clomiphene-resistant PCOS were reported in a popular
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial . The first pharmacological approach to
      induction of ovulation in women with PCOS is clomiphene citrate
