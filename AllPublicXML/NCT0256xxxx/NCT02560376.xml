  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to
      investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 in
      insulinoma and nesidioblastosis patients. A single dose of 55.5-111 Mega-Becquerel (MBq)
      68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will
      be used to assess the PET/CT images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 is an optimal probe targeting GLP-1R. The investigators will determine
      the use of 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 PET/CT in the detection of insulinomas, and to compare its
      diagnostic value with conventional imaging. GLP-1R imaging, specifically expressed on
      pancreatic beta cell surface, might help with diagnosis of different types of
      nesidioblastosis (ie. focal or diffuse type), and may improve the treatment strategy of
      nesidioblastosis. The investigator will determine the use of 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 PET/CT in
      differentiating nesidioblastosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hypoglycaemia in the presence of neuroglycopenic symptoms and documented
             Whipple's triad.

          -  Biochemically proven endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose
             concentration &lt;3.0 mM, insulin &gt;3 ÂµU/ml, and C-peptide &gt;0.6 ng/ml).

          -  Conventional imaging within 1 month
