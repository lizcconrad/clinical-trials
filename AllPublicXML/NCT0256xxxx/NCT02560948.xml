  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      gpASIT+TM product is based on highly purified allergen fragments obtained from grass pollen.
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of a
      subcutaneous immunotherapy with gpASIT+™ in patients with grass pollen-induced allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis compared to placebo.
