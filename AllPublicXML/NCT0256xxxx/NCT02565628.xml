    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data for multiple
      doses of PF-06669571 in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In addition, this study
      will assess whether PF-06669571 is able to demonstrate superior efficacy compared with
      placebo in the treatment of the motor symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

    <measure>Maximum Percent Change From Baseline in Movement Disorder Society-Sponsor Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III at Day 7.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The total MDS-UPDRS score is the most common method of evaluating the severity of Parkinson's disease across behaviors, activities of daily living, motor abilities, and other complications of Parkinson's disease. The MDS-UPDRS focuses primarily on measuring impairments associated with Parkinson's disease, with subsections organized according to motor and non-motor aspects of the disease. Part III assesses the motor signs of Parkinson's disease. Higher total scores indicate more severe motor signs of Parkinson's disease. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement. MDS-UPDRS Part III total motor score is comprised of 33 sub-scores based on 18 items, several with right, left or other body distribution scores. Each question is anchored with five responses that are linked to commonly accepted clinical terms: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe.</description>

             usually improve after their next dose of Parkinson's disease medication. Subjects
             should be able to recognize drug-induced dyskinesias and verify whether or not they
             are troublesome.

        <title>Maximum Percent Change From Baseline in Movement Disorder Society-Sponsor Revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III at Day 7.</title>
        <description>The total MDS-UPDRS score is the most common method of evaluating the severity of Parkinson’s disease across behaviors, activities of daily living, motor abilities, and other complications of Parkinson’s disease. The MDS-UPDRS focuses primarily on measuring impairments associated with Parkinson’s disease, with subsections organized according to motor and non-motor aspects of the disease. Part III assesses the motor signs of Parkinson’s disease. Higher total scores indicate more severe motor signs of Parkinson’s disease. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement. MDS-UPDRS Part III total motor score is comprised of 33 sub-scores based on 18 items, several with right, left or other body distribution scores. Each question is anchored with five responses that are linked to commonly accepted clinical terms: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe.</description>
