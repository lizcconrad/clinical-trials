  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, observational study examining the factors leading to the
      therapeutic decision to use MabThera (rituximab) in participants with RA. Routine
      rheumatology clinical practice data of participants who are being or have been treated with
      rituximab for RA will be collected and analysed in this chart review.
