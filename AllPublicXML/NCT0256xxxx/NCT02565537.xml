      The investigators are comparing outcomes of LASIK surgery using a high definition
      wavefront-guided laser to a wavefront-optimized laser in patients with nearsightedness with
      and without astigmatism.

      The patients will have a comprehensive eye examination once they express an interest in the
      study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated
      fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would
      exclude the patient from the study, then the investigators will inform the patient and make
      an appropriate referral. if the patient is deemed appropriate for the study after a
      comprehensive examination included computerized videokeratography, then they can be enrolled.
      The patient will undergo bilateral simultaneous eye surgery. Which eye is treated with the
      CustomVue and which eye is treated with Wavelight will be randomized so there is a 50% chance
      for either eye to receive one treatment. The patients will be seen on the day of surgery,
      post op day one, one month, three months, six months and one year. The patient will receive
      topical antibiotics in each eye for one week following the procedure. The patient will
      receive pred forte 1% ophthalmic drops for one week after treatment. The patient will also
      receive vigamox ophthalmic drops for four days after treatment. All of this is within the
      usual and customary standard of care for the treatment of patients undergoing LASIK surgery.
