    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a multifaceted disorder and a major public health problem. In addition to
      recurrent and unpredictable seizures, abnormalities in psychiatric status, cognition and
      social-adaptive behaviors are potential major sources of disability in children and adults
      with epilepsy disorders. Recent studies have unequivocally documented raised psychiatric
      comorbidities in children with epilepsy, particularly emotional regulation disorders such as
      depression and anxiety, as compared to both the general population and the children with
      other medical disorders, neurological and non-neurological. A prevalence of 12% to 35% has
      been reported, compared to 3-8% in the general population.

      Major advances have begun to uncover the potential mediators of emotional regulation
      disorders and social comorbidities in epilepsy, but important gaps remain in the early
      detection, treatment and prevention of these disorders. A very small number of investigations
      have examined children with epilepsy at or near the time of diagnosis. This is a time during
      which the effects of chronic epilepsy, potential averse social effects of epilepsy, and other
      complicating aetiological effects are minimized.

      Epilepsy syndromes provide a useful framework for considering the risk and type of emotional
      dysregulation comorbidities. But variability within and across syndromes needs to be taken
      into account thus requiring a strict phenotyping by specialists in the filed of pediatric
      epileptology. Retrospective studies, usually including patients with chronic epilepsies and
      suffering from a mixed spectrum of epilepsy syndromes introduce biases leading to rather
      disparate findings.

      Are such disorders the result of common physiopathological mechanisms, which precede the
      development of the epilepsy? The link between an underlying brain disorder and psychiatric
      comorbidities has emerged in recent literature, with evidence based on studies in adults,
      suggesting bidirectional relations between epilepsy and neurobehavioural comorbidities.
      Emotional regulation disorders can follow the onset of epilepsy, but they can also precede
      it, thus serving as a possible risk factor. The clinical implication of such a bidirectional
      association is that neurobehavioural comorbidities might be present at diagnosis and even
      before epilepsy onset. There is a need for greater understanding of the causes of these
      conditions in younger people.

      The degree to which specific epilepsy syndromes are associated with the relative risk of
      emotional dysregulation disorders in children with new- or recent-onset (within six months
      prior to enrolment) has rarely been comprehensively examined and represents the focus of the
      current investigation.

      The investigators study will be based on a prospectively recruited cohort of 280
      children/adolescents with recently diagnosed epilepsy. All participating centres dispose of
      the necessary competences for a precise diagnosis of the epilepsy syndromes and the tools for
      a per case appropriate aetiology screening. Following a first seizure children are usually
      first examined at hospital based emergency departments. Prompt referral to the epilepsy teams
      participating at the present study will significantly reduce the population biases and
      shortcuts encountered in studies that recruited patients with chronic epilepsy followed in
      tertiary care epilepsy units.

      The investigators expect their results to provide a greater understanding of both the shared
      and the unique features of emotional regulation disorders, in relation to specific epilepsy
      categories defined on the basis of the underlying physiopathological mechanisms.

      Such knowledge will also assist clinicians and families in the planning of both diagnosis and
      management resources.
