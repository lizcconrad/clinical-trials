  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test effectiveness of different deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) stimulation patterns on symptoms that may also improve the life of the
      battery. If these patterns are effective, the implanted batteries will be drained more slowly
      and last longer than currently expected. An increase in battery life may reduce the number of
      surgeries needed to replace them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical therapy for medication-refractory
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease, tremor, and dystonia. Patients implanted with DBS experience
      a significant improvement of their symptoms with relatively low risk of intolerable side
      effects. Implanted patients must undergo repeat surgeries to replace the Implantable Pulse
      Generators/batteries (IPG) approximately every 2 to 5 years. The DBS program (at the
      University of Florida) has studied battery consumption and has been interested in potential
      strategies to extend the life of the IPG to reduce the need for frequent battery replacement
      surgeries, while improving symptom-relief, patient satisfaction, and the potential associated
      financial burdens.

      The research study will evaluate the effects of novel stimulation patterns on tremor,
      bradykinesia, rigidity and gait in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the efficacy of novel stimulation patterns by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is used by neurologists to rate the motor impairment of people with Parkinson's Disease. The rater obtains the score by observation and questioning the participant. Higher scores represent greater impairment and scores range from 0-108. The subject will be videotaped and two raters blinded to conditions will score the UPDRS.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the efficacy of novel stimulation patterns by the Tremor Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Tremor Rating Scale (TRS), consists of 11 items that evaluate tremor in the head, arms, and legs. The rater assigns a score of 0 to 4 for each item, in ascending order of severity. The subjet will be videotaped and two raters blinded to conditions will score the TRS.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesia accelerometer to measure motor dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Kinesia system includes a unit worn by the subject and software that is used to collect, manage, and analyze data. The system measures three-dimensional motion using three orthogonal accelerometers and three orthogonal gyroscopes located in the sensor module.The digital data is received by the Receiver connected to a computer and processed by the Kinesia software package.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trigno wireless system to measure motor dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>This system has sensors with a multi-function design and therefore along with recording of surface EMG signal, it allows Triaxial Accelerometry. This wireless EMG machine will measure muscle contractions.</description>

    <measure>GaitRite walking assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The GaitRite is an automated floor that when the subjects walk on the floor it records the gait pattern.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Battery Consumption compared between pre and post settings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Battery consumption will be calculated and compared between the new settings and subjects' baseline settings. The Medtronic battery estimator helpline will be used to calculate battery life, as well as the University of Florida calculator.</description>
