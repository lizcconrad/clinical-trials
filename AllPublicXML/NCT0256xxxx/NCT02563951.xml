    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of
      3 intranasal (IN) doses (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg) of Granisetron Hydrochloride Nasal Sprays (GNS)
      as compared to Granisetron IV Injection and Granisetron Tablet in healthy Volunteers.
