      The PLE²NO (in Portuguese Education and Exercise Free Program for osteoarthritis) is a
      self-management and exercise program specific for elderly with knee osteoarthritis (OA), with
      the goals of managing OA symptoms, improving physical fitness, and developing self-efficacy
      and self-management of pathology.

      Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) Self-management and Exercise
      (2) Educational. Both groups received glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplement during
      the intervention. Blinding of participants was not possible due to the nature of the
      intervention; however, assessors were blinded to group allocation. The PLE2NO (in Portuguese
      Education and Exercise Free Program for osteoarthritis) is a community-based program with two
      components: self-management and exercise. Each session lasted 90 minutes, and the first 30
      minutes corresponded to a self-management part and the remaining 60 minutes to the exercise
      program. The program was offered in a group format, encouraging peer interactions and
      socialization that can help counteract feelings of depression and isolation. The
      self-management program is based on the program developed at Stanford University, the Chronic
      Disease Self-Management Program which the purpose is developing self-efficacy based on social
      cognitive theory. The exercise program comprised both health related (strength, flexibility)
      and skill-related (agility, balance, speed and power) physical fitness components, and was
      based on Fit an Strong Program, on Exercise for People with Arthritis (FEPA) and also on the
      program Takin Control with Exercise (Arthritis Foundation). The program will last for 3
      months and 6 months of follow-up.
