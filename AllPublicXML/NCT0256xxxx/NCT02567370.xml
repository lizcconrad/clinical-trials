  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the time it takes to absorb, distribute, breakdown
      and remove the drug from the body, safety and tolerability of AMG 581 in healthy participants
      and subjects with schizophrenia.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      profile of single-ascending oral doses of AMG 581 in healthy subjects and subjects diagnosed
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving antipsychotic treatment.

      This will be a placebo-controlled, single-ascending oral-dose study of AMG 581 with a
      food-effect cohort. Approximately 70 subjects will be enrolled. This study will enroll
      healthy subjects into 8 cohorts (Cohorts 1,2,3,4,5,6,8 and 9), and subjects with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving antipsychotic medication into a single
      cohort (Cohort 7).
