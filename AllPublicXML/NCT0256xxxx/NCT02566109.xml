      The overall of this proposal is to test in community hospitals the utility of a 10-min
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan protocol combined with proprietary image analysis
      algorithms for detecting early cardiovascular (CV) injury during receipt of chemotherapy for
      breast cancer (BrC) and lymphoma. This technology provides health-care delivery systems with
      a time-efficient method to identify those at risk of a future CV event so that prevention can
      be implemented to prolong survival and reduce morbidity in cancer survivors.

    <textblock>
      While recent research indicates that conventional MRI, advanced echocardiography (global
      longitudinal strain and 3D) and serum biomarkers can detect CV injury early after receipt of
      Chemotherapy, these methods require lengthy and difficult examinations that are not routinely
      executed in community hospitals where the majority of patients with BrC &amp; lymphoma are
      treated. Yet, 1-month deteriorations in traditional 45-min MRI measures are known to forecast
      6-month subclinical deteriorations in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that are
      associated with CV events. At the same time, new observational data indicate therapy with
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors/statins administered early during receipt of Chemotherapy may
      prevent subsequent cardiac dysfunction and CV events. Our MRI fast scanning techniques remedy
      these community hospital implementation obstacles.

      In this proposal, the investigators propose to test the utility of these fast scans within an
      existing funded randomized clinical trial R01HL118740 of generic atorvastatin that is
      researching methods to prevent cardiotoxicity in patients treated with Chemotherapy for BrC
      and lymphoma (taking advantage of significant existing clinical trial resources). This study
      allows us to address our over-arching goal: to determine the optimal implementation (alone or
      in combination with other tests) of our proprietary MRI processes for forecasting CV injury
      in patients treated with Chemotherapy in community hospitals through performance of a Phase
      II comparative effectiveness study within an ongoing clinical trial.

    <description>The Self-Reported questionnaires are a collection of well-validated, brief, fee-free instruments assessing key patient reported outcomes related to this study. For this study, we are using the short forms for quality of life. The total administration time for these questionnaires is 5 minutes.
Self-Report questionnaires will be obtained monthly. As part of this study, an additional measurement of ultrasensitive Troponin I will be collected at 2-months, as well as, a Fast MRI and 3D ECHO.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed Stage I-III breast cancer (including inflammatory and newly diagnosed
             recurrent breast cancer) or lymphoma with a &gt; 2 year life expectancy

          -  Scheduled to receive chemotherapy with an Anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)

          -  = or &gt; 21 years of age

          -  Prior cancers allowed if no evidence of disease

          -  ECOG 0 or 1

          -  Enrollment in NCI Protocol #: WF 98213. Patients must receive Fast MRI and 3D ECHO
             along with Baseline (98213) MRI prior to first chemotherapy treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ferromagnetic cerebral aneurysm clips or other intraorbital/intracranial
             metal; pacemakers, defibrillators, functioning neurostimulator devices or other
             implanted electronic devices.

          -  Most breast tissue expanders are not allowed. (If uncertain, inform the MRI tech to
             confirm eligibility status.)

          -  Unable to provide informed consent

          -  Symptomatic Claustrophobia

          -  Pregnant or breasting feeding. Due to unknown risks and potential harm to the unborn
             fetus a negative serum pregnancy test within 10 days prior to registration is required
             in patients with child-bearing potential. For this reason patients of child-bearing
             potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
             birth control; abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, intrauterine device
             (IUD), DeProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed negative
             sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, although
             less reliable method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel
             and/or cervical cap or sponge prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately.
