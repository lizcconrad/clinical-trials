    <textblock>
      The study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the serum lactate concentration ed
      cumulative Pringle time after liver resection. In addition, the correlation between lactate
      clearance and clamping time was investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During liver resection high serum lactate (sLac) concentration can be related to several
      clinical factors: impairment in lactate metabolism (i.e. extraction and utilization by the
      liver) or overproduction by splanchnic tissues; restrictive fluid regimen in order to limit
      the intraoperative back-flow bleeding; ischemia-reperfusion syndrome. However, the Pringle
      maneuver (temporary clamping of the hepatic hilum) seems having a sensible effect in inducing
      a significant increase in sLac levels during liver resection, particularly in the event of
      compromised liver function such as in cirrhosis.

      Although the peak of sLac concentration may correlate with outcome, the lactate clearance
      (cLac) seems to be a better predictor. To date, this relationship has been mainly
      demonstrated in severe sepsis and shock septic. However, the effective correlation between
      the cumulative clamping time and cLac has not been clearly investigated. The correlation
      between cumulative hepatic ischemic time and sLac trend in the perioperative period after
      liver resection with intermittent PM was investigated.
