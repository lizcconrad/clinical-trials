  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the barriers to receiving HIV testing and retention of care for
      at risk and HIV positive young adults. This study also seeks to determine the feasibility and
      acceptability of HIV testing in a non-clinical setting.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify factors that can facilitate or impede the use of non-clinical HIV
      testing venues as well as identify potential testing sites and assess acceptability of an HIV
      prevention intervention. In addition, the study will implement a pilot intervention to test
      the feasibility non-clinical HIV testing and follow up events for HIV positive youth.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Days to Linkage to Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Diagnosis (Up to 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who test positive, linkage to care is measured as the number of days to seek HIV treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of medical care visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Diagnosis (Up to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who test positive, engagement to care is measured as the number of medical care visits in a six month period after diagnosis. One HIV medical care visit every six months is considered engaged.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CD4 count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Post Diagnosis), One year assessment (Up to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>A CD4 count is a lab test that measures the number of CD4 T lymphocytes (CD4 cells) in a blood sample. A very low CD4 count (less than 200 cells/mm3) is a way to determine whether an HIV infection has progressed. Change is measured as the difference in CD4 count from baseline to the end of the study period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in viral load</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Post Diagnosis), One year assessment (Up to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>A viral load test is a lab test that measures the number of HIV virus particles in a milliliter of blood. A high viral load indicates the presence of more HIV within the body. Change is measured as the difference in viral load from baseline to the end of the study period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of venue acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>One year assessment (Up to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of venue acceptance is measured as the number of venues that allow rapid HIV testing over he number of venues approached.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of study subject acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>One year assessment (Up to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of study subject acceptance is measured as the number of participants who agree to participate in rapid HIV testing over the number of people approached.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HIV stigma scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Post Diagnosis), One year assessment (Up to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>The HIV stigma scale is a ten question self report measure that assesses perceived feelings of being stigmatized. Answers are reported on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). A higher score indicates feelings of greater stigmatization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HIV-AIDS stress scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Post Diagnosis), One year assessment (Up to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>The HIV-AIDS stress scale is a self report measure that assesses perceived emotional stress related to HIV. Answers are reported on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). A higher score indicates more emotional stress.</description>
