  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if individuals with colorectal cancer enjoy yoga
      and to begin to assess whether yoga is effective in improving attention and immune function
      in individuals with colorectal cancer compared to physical activity and usual care.

      The proposed study will use a prospective RCT pilot design with three arms (yoga, resistance
      and flexibility exercise, usual care) and a total of 60 men and women who have completed
      therapy (&gt; 6 months post primary or adjuvant therapy) to accomplish the specific aims. Equal
      numbers of men and women will be randomized into each arm of the study. Participants will be
      tested before, immediately after, and 3-months after treatment or similar time points for the
      usual care group. After data has been collected, participants who were randomized to the
      resistance and flexibility exercise group (active control group) or to the usual care group
      will be provided with the opportunity to participate in the yoga intervention.

    <measure>Attention Network Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Attention Network Test is a computerized test that asks participants to determine the direction of an arrow in the center of the screen (left or right). The center arrow can be located above or below the center fixation and is accompanied by flankers and cues. Overall attention and the three networks are assessed by measuring accuracy and response times for correct answers and how response times for correct answers are influenced by flankers, alerting cues, and spatial cues.</description>

The score is the time taken to complete the task. The Trail Making Test is a test of attention and cognitive control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attentional Function Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Attentional Function Index is a questionnaire that asks participants to rate their function on everyday tasks requiring attention and cognitive control from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely well or a great deal). The score is the average of 13 questions. The internal consistency ranges from 0.76 to 0.94 in individuals with cancer.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function is a questionnaire that measures perceived cognitive function and impact on quality of life from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). It includes 27 items grouped into 5 subscales The internal consistency is 0.96 on each subscale in individuals with cancer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Pro-inflammatory Markers</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serum levels of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-12, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor II, and c-reactive protein will be determined by cytometric bead array assay on a Luminex analyzer (MPXHYCTO-60K, Millipore; LXSAH, R &amp; D Systems). Serum levels of neopterin will be determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (RE59821, IBL International). Blood samples will be collected between 8 am and 10 am.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence and Attrition Log</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of signed informed consent until last yoga/physical activity class or research visit - up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The adherence and attrition log was developed by the investigator to describe reasons for not attending a class or dropping out of study. Participants will be asked if they would like to tell research team reason for missing a class or dropping out (e.g. too busy) so we can improve the intervention.</description>
