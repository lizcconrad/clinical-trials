  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with MSI-H or dMMR advanced colorectal carcinoma will be randomly
      assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or the Investigator's choice of 1 of 6 standard of
      care (SOC) chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma. The
      primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will prolong progression-free survival (PFS)
      or overall survival (OS) compared to current SOC chemotherapy.

    <description>Participants receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (Q3W) for up to 35 treatments (approximately 2 years). Participants that have stopped the initial course of pembrolizumab and have stable disease but progress after discontinuation can initiate a second course of pembrolizumab for up to 17 cycles (approximately 1 year additional).</description>

    <description>Participants receive 1 of 6 possible standard chemotherapy regimens: mFOLFOX6, or mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle, or mFOLFOX6+cetuximab 400 mg/m^2 IV over 2 hours then 250 mg/m^2 over 1 hour weekly in each 2-week cycle, or FOLFIRI, or FOLFIRI+bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle, or FOLFIRI+cetuximab 400 mg/m^2 IV over 2 hours then 250 mg/m^2 over 1 hour weekly in each 2-week cycle. Participants with documented disease progression following chemotherapy can crossover to receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years). Participants that have stopped pembrolizumab and have stable disease but progress after discontinuation can initiate a second course of pembrolizumab for up to 17 cycles (approximately 1 year additional).</description>
