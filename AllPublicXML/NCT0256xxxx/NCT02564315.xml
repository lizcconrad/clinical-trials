      Relapse after a serious quit attempt occurs in 70-90% of smokers who try to quit smoking.
      This study utilizes a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design - - an
      innovative multi-phase approach - - to test post-relapse treatments designed to assist
      smokers to make a new, successful quit attempt. This study will test Relapse Recovery (RR)
      treatments that are applied at two stages following relapse: 1) RR Preparation Phase
      treatments for smokers who relapse after an initial quit attempt, and 2) RR Cessation Phase
      treatments for relapsed smokers who decide to make a new quit attempt. Smokers motivated to
      quit smoking will make an initial quit attempt in the Quit Phase (cessation medication +
      counseling). Participants who relapse will be randomized to one of three RR Preparation Phase
      treatments (Behavioral [Smoking] Reduction Counseling + the Nicotine Mini-Lozenge; Recycling
      Counseling that encourages participants to quit again as soon as possible; and Preparation
      Phase Control). RR Preparation Phase participants (other than controls) who elect to try a
      new quit attempt will be randomized to one of four RR Cessation Phase treatments based on a
      2X2 fully-crossed factorial design testing two factors: Supportive Counseling (vs. Brief
      Information) and Skill Training (vs. Brief Information). All RR Cessation Phase participants
      will receive 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch + nicotine
      mini-lozenge). The investigators hypothesize that RR Preparation Phase Reduction treatment
      will significantly increase long-term abstinence rates relative to the Preparation Phase
      Control condition.

      This study aims to identify effective Relapse Recovery (RR) treatments to assist smokers who
      relapse after an initial quit attempt. The study will use a sequential, multiple assignment,
      randomized trial (SMART) design with three phases. In a SMART design, randomization occurs at
      more than one stage, with randomization at a later stage based on response to treatment at an
      earlier stage. The three phases in this SMART study are as follows:

        1. Phase 1 consists of the Quit Phase in which all participants (smokers motivated to quit
           smoking) will be offered evidence-based cessation treatment (cessation medication plus
           counseling). Participants who relapse will be eligible to proceed to the next phase
           which involves Relapse Recovery (RR) Preparation treatment.

        2. Phase 2 consists of RR Preparation Phase treatments in which relapsed participants from
           the Quit Phase will be randomized to three arms: (a) Recycling Counseling (where
           participants are encouraged to quit again as soon as possible); (b) Behavioral Reduction
           Counseling + Nicotine Mini-Lozenge (which targets smoking reduction and preparation for
           a new quit attempt); and (c) Preparation Phase Control (continuation of Quit Phase
           treatment plus advice to seek additional help from the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line or
           their clinic care provider).

        3. Phase 3 consists of RR Cessation Phase treatments in which non-control (i.e. Recycling
           or Behavioral Reduction) Preparation Phase participants who elect to make a new quit
           attempt will be randomized to one of four treatment conditions in a 2X2 fully-crossed
           factorial design: (a) Supportive Counseling + Skill Training; (b) Supportive Counseling
           + Brief Information; (c) Skill Training + Brief Information; and (d) Brief Information
           Only. All participants will receive 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy
           (Nicotine Patch + Nicotine Mini-Lozenge). Brief Information will consist of generic
           information about the importance of taking the medication and how to use it, information
           about side effects/safety and what to do in case of problems, and participants will also
           be given encouragement.

      Smoking status will be assessed 14 months after randomization to RR Preparation Phase
      treatment. The investigators hypothesize that 7-day point point-prevalence abstinence rates
      will be 15% for the Preparation Phase Control condition, 25% for the Recycling condition, and
      35% for the Behavioral Reduction condition. The investigators propose that any increase in
      abstinence of 15% or higher would be clinically significant. The investigators did not power
      the study to demonstrate a significant difference between the two active RR Preparation Phase
      treatments. Therefore, the investigators anticipate that only the RR Behavioral Reduction
      treatment will significantly increase long-term abstinence rates (primary outcome:
      Biochemically-confirmed 7-Day Point Prevalence Abstinence at 14 Months post-randomization to
      Phase 2 Preparation treatment) over those produced by the Preparation Phase Control
      condition. Because of limitations in statistical power, analyses of RR Cessation Phase
      treatments will be exploratory only (secondary outcome: Self-Reported 7-Day Point Prevalence
      Abstinence at 26 Weeks post-randomization to Phase 3 Cessation treatment).

    <description>Participants randomized to receive this treatment receive manual-based counseling calls and visits over the course of 11 months. The ultimate goal will be smoking that is reduced in amount and location. Case managers and participants will collaboratively identify a set of steps to progressively reduce smoking. The primary vehicles for change are to encourage substitution of the nicotine mini-lozenge for cigarettes and to reduce the contexts in which smoking occurs. Counseling will counter post-lapse demoralization by emphasizing participants' progress, the value of smoking reduction as a transitional goal, and the critical value of ongoing treatment engagement. Evidence of progress in reduction of smoking, and smoking contexts will be used to build self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Skill training Counseling will: 1) carefully assess smoking cue contexts and opportunities to smoke, to identify problems encountered in the prior quit attempt; 2) develop specific plans for avoiding such contexts and identify skills for coping with them; 3) develop plans for negotiating with others who smoke; 4) develop lifestyle changes to reduce future smoking opportunities and contexts; and 5) assign homework and assess execution of assigned skills. Participants will receive coping menus that provide personalized coping/avoidance options and &quot;coping reports&quot; that assess coping execution over time and troublesome contexts and cues around which counseling will be focused. There will be praise for any progress and a collaborative determination of barriers to skill execution.</description>

Nicotine patch dosing will be based on current cigarettes smoked per day, per package insert: for those who currently smoke &gt;10 cigs/day=4 weeks of 21 mg, 2 weeks of 14 mg, and 2 weeks of 7 mg nicotine patches, along with nicotine mini-lozenges; for those who currently smoke &lt;=10 cigs/day=6 weeks of 14 mg and 2 weeks of 7 mg nicotine patches along with mini-lozenges. Mini-lozenge dosing will be based on how soon participants currently smoke after waking before their initial quit attempt and will be consistent with the package insert (4 mg for participants who smoke within 30 minutes of waking and 2 mg for participants smoke more than 30 minutes after waking).</description>
