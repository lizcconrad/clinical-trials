      This study aims to compare the analgesic efficacy of transversus abdominis-plane block with
      bupivicaine versus bupivacaine with morphine in patients undergoing major abdominal cancer
      surgery.

      This randomized study will be approved by the local ethics committee of South Egypt Cancer
      Institute, Assuit University, Egypt after written informed consent. This study will include
      approximately 60 ASA I-II cancer patients with age range (18-60) years, weight (50- 85) kg
      who will be scheduled for lower abdominal cancer surgery (abdominal hysterectomy,
      oophorectomy and radical cystectomy). Exclude from the study Patients with known drug allergy
      to study drugs, significant cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, coagulation
      disorders and those with psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with perception and
      assessment of pain. Preoperatively, patients will be taught how to evaluate their own pain
      intensity using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), scored from 0-10 (where 0= no pain and
      10=worst pain imaginable).

      Patients will be randomly assigned using an online research randomizer into two groups, 30
      patients in each group:

      Group 1:

      30 patients receive ultrasound guided transversus abdominis-plane block with local anesthetic
      20 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % diluted in 20 ml saline (total volume 40 ml) in two divided doses
      i.e. 20 ml is administered on each side of the abdominal wall.

      Group 2:

      30 patients receive ultrasound guided transversus abdominis-plane block with local anesthetic
      20 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% + 10 mg morphine diluted in 20 ml saline (total volume 40 ml) in
      two divided doses i.e. 20 ml is administered on each side of the abdominal wall.

      Surgery will be performed under standard general anesthesia and ultrasound guided TAP block
      will be performed before induction of GA.
