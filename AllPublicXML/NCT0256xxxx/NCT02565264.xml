    <textblock>
      This study is an open prospective clinical trial. The objective is to evaluate the effect of
      autologous exosomes rich plasma on cutaneous wound healing. The participants are patients
      with intractable cutaneous ulcers (e.g. rheumatic disease, peripheral arterial disease,
      chronic venous insufficiency, decubitus or burns). The participants will be treated
      autologous exosomes rich plasma every day for 28 days. The cutaneous wound healing will be
      evaluated by the length, width and depth of the wound.

      Exosomes are small vesicles 0.03-0.1 μm in size, which are shed from most cell types into the
      extracellular space via intracellular endocytosis. They are found abundantly in body fluids
      such as blood. They consist of lipid bilayer so that their structure is stable. They can be
      preserved for 2 weeks at 4℃. They contain proteins, lipids and nucleic acids including coding
      or non-coding RNA. Resent studies have revealed that exosomes have an important role in
      cell-to-cell communication.

      The investigators found that serum exosome levels were significantly decreased in scleroderma
      patients with vascular involvements such as cutaneous ulcers and/or pitting scars compared to
      in normal subjects. The investigators also elucidated that serum-derived exosomes accelerated
      cutaneous wound healing in BALB/c mice. Exosome supplementation to cutaneous ulcers seems to
      have significant therapeutic value.

      The objective of present study is to evaluate the effect of exosomes derived from plasma on
      intractable cutaneous ulcers (e.g. rheumatic disease, peripheral arterial disease, chronic
      venous insufficiency, decubitus or burns).

      Autologous exosomes are obtained from the participants' own plasma. The duration of study is
      28days. The cutaneous wound healing will be evaluated at day1, day2, day7, day14, day 21 day
      28.

    <description>Plasma samples from the participants will be filtered through 0.45 μm and 0.20 μm filters. The samples will be filtered through 0.02 μm filter to trap exosomes with the filter. Saline solution will be loaded from the other side of the 0.02 μm filter to obtain exosome rich buffer. The plasma-derived exosomes will be applied to the participants' ulcers daily for 28 days.</description>
