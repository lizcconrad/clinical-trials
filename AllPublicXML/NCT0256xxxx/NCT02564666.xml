    <textblock>
      Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects
      used as systemic treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Although sorafenib has demonstrated many clinical benefits in patients, its adverse cannot be
      ignores.

      This drug occasionally causes severe adverse events (AEs), which include hand-foot skin
      reaction (HFSR), hypertension, diarrhea, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, and so on. Although
      most adverse events are reversible, they can significantly impact a patient's quality of life
      and occasionally result in dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy Patients are also
      more likely to remain on treatment if they are guided over the difficult initial 4~6wks of
      therapy during which time the development of adverse events following sorafenib treatment
      initiation are most likely to occur.

      Patient education, proactive management and establishing and maintaining open communication
      between patients and the nurse are crucial to the effective management of these adverse
      events.

      This study design is a randomized controlled trial and 64 patients will be randomized to one
      of 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio. 32 patients will be enrolled into the controlled group and the
      rest of 32 patients will be enrolled into the intervention group. The intervention group will
      be received the routine telephone calls of six times at intervals of once a week during 10~15
      minutes (from a well-trained nurse)

      The purpose of this study is to confirm whether an effective intervention that telephone
      counseling and education by a nurse can increase drug compliance for patients with HCC who is
      taking Sorafenib and is to use for developing individual educational program as a fundamental
      data that can be applied for patients taking Sorafenib after investigating patient
      satisfaction by &quot;The Satisfaction with information about Medicines Scale(SIMS)&quot; tool.
