  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether exercise leads to changes in the blood that
      are produced by exercised muscles and if these changes produce new hormones that affect the
      body's regulation of sugar and body weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent work in the laboratory at the Joslin Diabetes Center and elsewhere has shown that when
      small animals exercise they improve their muscles and improve their blood sugar levels. Also,
      these animals show changes in their abdominal fat tissue, compared to animals that did not
      exercise. Our data suggest that factors released from exercised muscle and fat tissue from
      exercised mice also has a positive effect on other tissues in the same animal. Therefore,
      there could be new factors or hormones, which come from the trained animals' muscles or fat
      tissue and which exert a positive effect on the animals' blood sugar levels. Large studies
      with human volunteers have shown that exercise can improve blood sugar uptake into skeletal
      muscle and lower blood sugar levels, thereby preventing type 2 diabetes. The purpose if this
      study is to evaluate if a single exercise bout leads to changes in circulating factors in the
      blood. We plan to detect if there are hormones being produced in the body that have a
      beneficial effect elsewhere in the body.
