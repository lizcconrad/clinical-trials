  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of the small bowel length studied by anatomists, surgeons and radiologists.
      Results were highly different among these series. Technical and mechanical factors have major
      effects on measures. Investigators decided to reach a standardization for the measurement of
      small bowel length.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel length will be measure in patients undergoing intraabdominal surgery. This will
      be establish by two surgeon from Treitz ligament to ileocecal valve two, consecutively. For
      measurement, a tape will place to antimesenteric, mesenteric border and the midline between
      these two sides.

      Exclusion criteria include patients with inflammatory bowel disease, peritonitis, prior
      abdominal surgery.

      Demographic data, patients clinical details and small bowel length will be recorded.
