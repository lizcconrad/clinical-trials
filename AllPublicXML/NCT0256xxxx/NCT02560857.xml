  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will prospectively determine the clinical utility of non-pathogen specific cellular
      immunity assessment using the Quantiferon-Monitor to quantify the degree of
      immunosuppression. The investigators will use the results of the assay to predict whether
      patients develop opportunistic infections and predict organ rejection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients undergo life-long immunosuppression to prevent
      allograft rejection. However, this also puts patients at significant risk for opportunistic
      infection. The degree of immunosuppression varies for each individual and is likely
      influenced by a combination of clinical factors such as antirejection medication,
      comorbidities, patient age as well as the state of patient immune system. Thus far, there
      have been no standardized methods to quantify the degree of global immunosuppression. A new
      blood test (Quantiferon-Monitor) has been recently developed that might help predict the
      level of immune suppression. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this new test
      will help determine a person's level of immune suppression after organ transplant. This will
      be done by trying to relate the level of immunity with the development of infection or
      rejection. If the test for immunosuppression is helpful, it may help us to better take into
      account the differences in patients when designing therapy. Ultimately, it may help develop
      better ways for preventing infections and transplant rejections.
