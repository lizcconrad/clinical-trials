  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether rivaroxaban is safe and effective to use in
      children age newborn to less than 6 months and how long it stays in the body and how it is
      used in the body. Safety will be assesed by looking at the incidence and types of bleeding
      events. There will also be a check for worsening of blood clots.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonates and infants aged less than 6 months who pass the screen of in- and exclusion
      criteria, who have been treated for at least five days with heparin and /or VKA for confirmed
      symptomatic or asymptomatic arterial or venous thrombosis are eligible for the study. Study
      treatment consists of a 7-day treatment with an age- and body weight-adjusted three times
      daily, approximately 8 hours apart oral rivaroxaban dosing to achieve a similar exposure as
      that observed in adults treated for venous thromboembolism (VTE) with 20 mg rivaroxaban once
      daily. Rivaroxaban will be provided as granules for preparation of an oral suspension (1
      mg/mL after re-suspension) using a t.i.d. regimen with 8-hour intervals. An ultrasound will
      be performed before starting rivaroxaban at treatment day 1 and after the end of rivaroxaban
      treatment at day 8. The last dose of rivaroxaban treatment will be followed by a 30-day post
      study treatment period, regardless of the duration of study drug administration. After
      cessation of rivaroxaban, it is at the investigator's discretion to continue with
      anticoagulants. The principal safety outcome is the combination of major and clinically
      relevant non-major bleeding. The efficacy outcome is the composite of all symptomatic
      recurrent thromboembolism and asymptomatic deterioration in thrombotic burden on repeat
      imaging. All suspected recurrent thromboembolism, asymptomatic deterioration in thrombotic
      burden on repeat imaging, deaths, as well as all episodes of bleeding will be evaluated by a
      CIAC. Adjudication results will be the basis for the final analyses.

      For all children, visits are scheduled at regular time points (see Table 1). Enrolled
      children who are not treated or those with premature discontinuation of rivaroxaban will at
      least be seen at the end of the study treatment period. During all contacts, the treatment
      and clinical course of the child will be evaluated. Children with suspected efficacy or
      safety outcomes will undergo confirmatory testing as per standard of care. Blood samples for
      PK/PD will be taken at defined time points (see Table 2).

      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the children's safety during the
      study and give recommendations to the steering committee.
