    <textblock>
      This study of the tolerance and acceptability of an amino acid based feed will assess
      gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance, product intake and acceptability in relation to taste,
      smell, texture in 20 patients between 1-10 years currently using or requiring an amino acid
      based feed for the dietary management of Cows' Milk Allergy and food-allergy-associated
      conditions, over 4 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Dietary management of Cows' Milk Allergy (CMA) involves avoiding cow's milk protein in the
      diet, whilst ensuring that an adequate nutritional intake is achieved with suitable
      alternative foods or prescribable feeds. A number of studies and clinical insights indicate
      that CMA is persisting longer than infancy, into later childhood and becoming more complex.
      If a child has CMA, eliminating the offending allergens whilst maintaining an intake of food
      that meets their nutritional requirements for growth and development is challenging due to
      the significant nutritional contribution these foods make to a child's diet, particularly
      milk and dairy products. This supports the need for alternatives to cow's milk to be
      available for children &gt;1year of age to help meet their nutritional needs. Aminoacid based
      feeds are already widely used in clinical practice to meet this need. A new nutritionally
      complete amino acid based powdered feed for the dietary management of CMA, or other
      conditions where an amino acid based is recommended, in children aged 1-10yrs old, has been
      developed.

      This study is to support the use of this new amino acid based feed in clinical practice. The
      study will evaluate the tolerance and acceptability of the amino acid based powdered feed in
      20 children aged 1-10yrs of age receiving or requiring an amino acid based feed for the
      dietary management of CMA and food allergy associated conditions, over 4 weeks. The primary
      outcome will be gastrointestinal tolerance, with secondary outcomes of compliance,
      acceptability, nutrient intake and anthropometry.

    <description>Gastro-intestinal tolerance will be recorded at baseline and on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 of week 1 of the study. During weeks 2 and 3 tolerance will be recorded once at the end of each week on days 14 and 21. During week 4, tolerance will be recorded on days 26, 27 and 28. Tolerance will be recorded using a standardised gastro-intestinal tolerance questionnaire, to be completed by the parents/carer</description>

    <measure>Compliance with feed prescription (amount prescribed versus consumed)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance with feed prescription will be assessed daily throughout the study by recording how much feed was received, to be recorded by the parents/carer. The amount prescribed by the Dietitian will be recorded at the start of the study, and any changes to this prescription also noted</description>

    <description>Feed acceptability (ease of use) will be assessed at the end of week 4 by questionnaire completed by the parents/carer.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nutrient intake, including the intake of all nutrition provided (including the study product, any parenteral feeding, other enteral tube feeding, foods, drinks etc) will be recorded at baseline and on Day 28 by the Dietitian using 24hour recall, and then in 3 day food diaries at baseline (Days 1, 2 and 3) and Week 4 (Days 26, 27 and 28) by the parent/carer. A dietary analysis program will be used to calculate total dietary intake</description>

    <description>For safety purposes, at baseline and at the end of week 4, body weight (kg) will be measured where possible using standard methods, to the nearest 0.1kg using a weighing scale without heavy clothing. Height will also be measured, wherever possible, using standard measures to the nearest 0.1cm. For children up to 2yrs of age, head circumference will be measured where possible, using standard methods to the nearest 0.1cm</description>
