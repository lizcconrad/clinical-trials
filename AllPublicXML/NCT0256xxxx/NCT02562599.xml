      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of raltitrexed and cisplatin
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent radiotherapy with raltitrexed and cisplatin
      in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Although concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment modality for locally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high incidences of distant metastases and severe treatment
      related toxicities have become an obstacle to be overcome. A phase Ⅱ study conducted by Hui
      et al. showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy was
      superior to the standard concomitant chemoradiation in terms of the 3-year OS without
      significantly exacerbating the acute toxicities.

      At present, PF regimen has been considered as the most classic chemotherapy regimen of
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but its efficiency is about 40%-60% , and always with severe
      gastrointestinal reactions, renal toxicity and oral mucosa reaction. Therefore, it is
      imperative to find a more safe and effective chemotherapy regimen.

      Raltitrexed is a specific thymidylate synthase inhibitor with a convenient administration
      schedule,acceptable and manageable toxicity, radiosensitising properties. It may offer
      advantages compared with standard 5-FU chemotherapy regimens used in locally advanced NPC.

      Therefore, the investigators initiated this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      raltitrexed and cisplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent radiotherapy with
      raltitrexed and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced NPC.
