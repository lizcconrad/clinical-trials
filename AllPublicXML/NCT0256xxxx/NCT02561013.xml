      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the product performance of a new adjustable
      compression system for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. The new compression system
      consists of a compression stocking and and adjustable compression sleeve. It will be used
      over primary dressings to provide compression that is beneficial to the healing of venous leg
      ulcers.

    <description>3M™ Coban™ Custom Fit Compression System will be custom-fitted at first subject visit and will thereafter be applied and removed daily by the study subject. It will be worn throughout the day by the study subject and removed before bedtime. It will provide therapeutic compression for edema control to help in the healing of venous leg ulcers.</description>

    <description>3M Coban™ Fit is a compression system that consists of two components: 1. A Compression Stocking and 2. Coban™ Fit Sleeve.
The stocking provides compression to the foot and improves wearing comfort in the calf area under the sleeve. The compression sleeve is intended to provide the therapeutic compression to the calf, with the initial fitting to be done by a health-care professional. The compression sleeve is customized according to the anatomy of the patient's leg; both components are designed to be used together.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is the subject 21 years or older?

          2. Does the subject have an active venous leg ulceration? If multiple ulcers are present,
             the investigator will need to select a single ulcer of the study leg that is &gt; 2cm
             apart from any other ulcer?

          3. Does the subject have an ulcer size between 1cm2 and 12cm2?

          4. Does the subject have an ABPI between 0.8 and 1.3 that was taken within the past 28
             days?

          5. Is the subject ambulatory?

          6. Is the subject or family member willing to self-manage the venous leg ulcer therapy at
             home in collaboration with the medical staff, including the ability to properly
             readjust the closure straps as indicated by tension indicators, and apply new
             dressings when needed?

          7. Is the subject able to understand questionnaire items and action items (e.g., Subject
             Diary)?

          8. Is the subject willing to give written informed consent, including permission to take
             photographs of the study leg?

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Does the subject have severe arterial occlusive disease?

          2. Does the subject have decompensated heart insufficiency NYHA Class IV, ACC.AHA Stage
             D?

          3. Does the subject have septic phlebitis?

          4. Does the subject have severe deep vein thrombosis (phlegmasia cerulea dolens) and
             other conditions contraindicated according to established guidelines and local
             procedures?

          5. Does the subject have known hypersensitivity to any of the component materials?

          6. Does the subject have a suspected clinical infection of the ulcer or any other
             systemic infection (requiring antibiotics)?

          7. Is the subject scheduled for surgery for the ulcer during the 12 weeks following
             inclusion?

          8. Does the subject have a hospital stay planned for the 12 weeks following inclusion?

          9. Does the subject have a suspected or confirmed cancerous ulceration?

         10. Does the subject have severe peripheral sensitive neuropathy?

         11. Is the subject participating in any other prospective study interfering with this
             study?

         12. Does the subject have any medical condition which in the professional opinion of the
             investigator disqualifies the subject from enrollment into the study?

         13. Does the subject have a history of noncompliance to therapies?
