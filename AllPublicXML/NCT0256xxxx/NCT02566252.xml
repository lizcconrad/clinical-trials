  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of pre-treatment with either cromolyn sodium or albuterol
      sulfate on the safety and tolerability or PUL-042 Inhalation Solution in healthy subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects (8 per cohort) will be randomized to either pre-treatment or no
      pre-treatment (4 per group). The initial cohort will receive pre-treatment with cromolyn
      sodium. Subjects will be followed for 2 weeks for safety and tolerability, undergo a 2 week
      washout period and then be assigned to the alternative treatment (i.e., subjects who received
      cromolyn sodium prior to PUL-042 inhalation solution will not receive pretreatment) and then
      followed for an additional 2 weeks.

      Subsequent cohort will receive pre-treatment with albuterol sulfate in a like manner.
