  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the Injection Related Erythema (IRE)
      mitigation effect of a single administration of brimonidine tartrate in comparison with a
      vehicle gel (placebo).

      The secondary study objectives are to evaluate the IRE mitigation effect of a single
      administration of brimonidine tartrate in comparison with a vehicle gel on a more stringent
      definition scale, in accordance with the primary endpoint of the original brimonidine pivotal
      trials and participants' satisfaction with the overall appearance of their skin.

      Participants naïve to treatment with subcutaneous (SC) interferons or oral Disease Modifying
      Therapy (DMT) who are about to start PLEGRIDY PEN therapy will be screened for participation
      in this Phase IV trial. Participants will remain on Plegridy therapy as prescribed by their
      physician. Plegridy will not be provided to participants by Biogen as a part of this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in either Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA) or Patient Erythema Self-Assessment (PSA) scale measured as at least 1-grade improvement on CEA and/or at least 1-grade improvement on PSA scale assessed by the physician and participant</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 6 hours of gel application</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator will evaluate participant's erythema (redness) at the site of injection on a scale of 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) with higher scores indicating higher levels of erythema. Participants rate erythema at the site of injection on a scale of 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) with higher scores indicating higher levels of erythema.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite change in both CEA and PSA scale measured as at least 1-grade improvement on CEA and 1-grade improvement on PSA respectively</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 6 hours of gel application</time_frame>
    <description>This composite endpoint is considered to be sensitive enough and directly correlated with participants' satisfaction therapy outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite change in both CEA and PSA scale measured as at least 2-grade improvement on CEA and 2-grade improvement on PSA</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's self-assessment of satisfaction with the overall appearance of their skin by using a Patient's Assessment of Appearance (PAA) grading scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 6 hours of gel application</time_frame>
    <description>PAA satisfaction score will describe how satisfied the participants are with the overall appearance of skin on a scale of 0 (very satisfied) to 4 (very dissatisfied).</description>
