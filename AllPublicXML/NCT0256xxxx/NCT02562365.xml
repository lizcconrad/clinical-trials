  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer was mostly diagnosed at late stage (III/IV) with high rate of recurrence after
      first line of therapy by optimal cytoreductive sugery and 6-8cycle of TP chemotherapy. We
      developed an adjuvant chemotherapy of &quot;three steps&quot; (ACTS). It is adding CTX+VP-16(second
      step)6cycle and CTX+CBP(third steps) to firstline chemotherapy (first step). The aim of this
      study is to verify the effectivity and safety of ACTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 70 percent of ovarian cancer patients were diagnosed in the advanced stage.
      Currently the 5-year disease free survival (DFS) of stageⅢC-Ⅳovarian cancer patients was
      about 10 percent after first line chemotherapy. Dr Cai shumo developed adjuvant chemotherapy
      of &quot;three steps&quot; (ACTS) for advanced ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery, based on his
      60+ years experience on gynecologic oncology. After the first step 6-8 cycle paclitaxel plus
      carboplatin chemotherapy, the chemo-sensative cancer cells were killed, but
      resistant/dormancy cell remained. The second step chemotherapy which is 6 cycle CTX+VP-16
      every 4weeks, using different mechanism to kill cancer cells, may decrease the rate of
      recurrence within 6 month after first step chemotherapy, prolong platinum-free duration and
      also with acceptable side effects. After second step chemotherapy, in absence of 6 months
      platinum treatment, the previous G0 dormancy cell may become flexible to platinum treatment.
      Therefore, in the third step chemotherapy, CTX+CBP is used in every 8 week for 6 cycles.
      Comparing to using targeted therapy for maintaining therapy, the ACTS cost less.

      In the previous observation study(CHINA ONCOLOGY 2013 Vol.23 No.12 p980), In study arm A, the
      patients received three-step chemotherapy after primary debulking surgery, step one with
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin (TC regimen), every 3 weeks for 6 to 8 cycles; step two with
      etoposide plus cyclophosphamide, every 4 weeks for 6 cycles; step three with carboplatin plus
      cyclophosphamide every eight weeks for six cycles. In control arm B, investigators
      retrospectively analysed 51 cases withⅢC-Ⅳstage ovarian cancer, who had completely response
      after standard chemotherapy with six to eight cycles of TC after primary surgery during 2007.
      Investigators compared the 5-year DFS between the two arms. Results: The 5-year DFS of 15
      cases in arm A was 80%(12/15), which was signiifcantly higher than that of arm B (5.9%, 3/51,
      P&lt;0.01). Therefore we start this randomized open control clinic trial to evaluated the effect
      of ACTS on overall survival and its safety.
