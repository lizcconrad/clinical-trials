  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) over the premotor cortex on training-related improvements in motor
      performance and associated neural plasticity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor training is an important part of recovery after stroke. During motor training, stroke
      patients practice performing a movement and become better at performing the trained movement
      over time. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which uses magnetism to
      excite neurons near the surface of the brain, may further improve performance. Healthy adults
      made larger training-related improvements in their motor performance when they received rTMS
      over the primary motor cortex during motor training. There is evidence that the premotor
      cortex may be a more effective target than the primary motor cortex for rTMS for some stroke
      survivors. In the current study, the investigator will determine the effect of rTMS over the
      premotor cortex on training-related improvements in motor performance in healthy adults.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in wrist acceleration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-motor training (1 minute, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after completion of motor training)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will be asked to perform 7 isometric wrist extensions before and after motor training. Wrist acceleration will be measured by a gyroscope taped to the dorsum of the subject's hand undergoing motor training. An increase in the maximum acceleration that persists at least an hour after training is indicative of motor learning. We will compare the effect of the rTMS protocols on the change in the wrist acceleration associated with motor learning (baseline to post 1 min, baseline to post 30 mins, baseline to post 60 mins).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stimulus response curve (SRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-motor training (1 minute, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after completion of motor training)</time_frame>
    <description>The stimulus response curve (SRC) is a set of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) collected in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses of increasing intensities. The SRC can characterize input-output parameters of the corticospinal tract and organization of the primary motor cortex. A change in the SRC parameters after training will reflect a change in the organization of the primary motor cortex associated with motor learning. We will compare the effect of the rTMS protocols on the change in the SRC parameters associated with motor learning (baseline to post 1 min, baseline to post 30 mins, baseline to post 60 mins).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-motor training (1 minute, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after completion of motor training)</time_frame>
    <description>Short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is an inhibitory phenomenon in the motor cortex. To test for SICI, a sub-threshold conditioning stimulus (CS) will precede a supra-threshold test stimulus (TS) by 2 milliseconds (ms). The amplitude of a conditioned TS-evoked MEP will be expressed as a percent of the amplitude of an unconditioned TS-evoked MEP. A decrease in the percent MEP after training would indicate a increase in SICI. An increase in the percent MEP after training would indicate a decrease in SICI. We will compare the effect of the rTMS protocols on the change in SICI associated with motor learning (baseline to post 1 min, baseline to post 30 mins, baseline to post 60 mins).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in wrist force</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-motor training (1 minute, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after completion of motor training)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will be asked to perform 7 isometric wrist extensions before and after motor training. A force transducer transducer will record the maximum force produced during the wrist extensions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in reaction time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-motor training (1 minute, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after completion of motor training)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to perform 7 auditory-cued ballistic wrist extensions before and after motor training. Electomyographic (EMG) activity recorded during the ballistic wrist extensions will be used to measure reaction time. Reaction time is the length of time between the auditory cue and the onset of the movement-related EMG burst of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in task accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-motor training (1 minute after completion of motor training)</time_frame>
    <description>Task accuracy will be determined by the number of successful trials over the number of total trials. A trial will be considered successful when the subject moves a cursor from the home position into a target box by modulating the acceleration of their wrist. An increase in task accuracy after training will indicate motor learning.</description>
