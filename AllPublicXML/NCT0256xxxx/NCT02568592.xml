  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The capacity to burn fat as fuel for exercise may have important implications for sporting
      performance, with dietary fat intake positively influencing this ability.

      Endurance performance and the ability to burn fat will be measured in women runners following
      the consumption of 3 diets varying in the amount of fat and carbohydrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fat intake positively influences the ability to burn fat during exercise in women but
      not men, whereas carbohydrate intake negatively influences fat oxidation in both sexes. The
      independent nature of dietary fat intake as a predictor of the ability to burn fat in women
      suggests that in conditions of adequate carbohydrate intake providing additional fat may
      increase fat oxidation in women whereas it does not in men. It is of interest to explore if
      indeed women are responsive (i.e., increase in fat oxidation) to short-term increases in
      dietary fat intake induced by overfeeding (adequate carbohydrate) or if as appears to be the
      case in men reduced carbohydrate intake as typically employed in high-fat, low carbohydrate
      dietary studies is also a prerequisite for enhancing fat oxidation in women, and whether this
      translates into a difference in exercise endurance performance.
