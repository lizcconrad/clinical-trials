  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how red blood cell transfusions, particularly the
      length of storage time of units of packed red blood cells, affects the cardiovascular
      function in patients receiving transfusions. This study will also determine the most ideal
      way of storing and processing blood, and assess how transfusion affects a person's ability to
      exercise and how their blood vessels relax and contract.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine red blood cell transfusion, particularly the length of
      storage time of units of packed red blood cells, affects cardiovascular function in patients
      receiving transfusions. Transfusion of red blood cells is often used clinically in patients
      with low red blood cell counts in order to prevent disease progression and death. Recent
      studies suggest that the use of &quot;aged&quot; versus &quot;fresh&quot; red blood cells is associated with
      worse clinical outcomes, but there is no clear understanding on how this happens. The
      investigators want to determine the most ideal way of storing and processing blood, and learn
      how transfusion affects the ability to exercise in the study subjects and assess the
      relaxation and contraction of the blood vessels.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to transfusion), Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) will be performed by using ultrasonography. The brachial artery of the non-dominant arm will be imaged using a high-resolution 13 MHz ultrasound transducer. A blood pressure cuff on the forearm will be inflated to supra-systolic pressures to produce 5 minutes of ischemia. After cuff deflation, imaging of the brachial artery will be performed continuously for the next 120 seconds and the flow-mediated dilation will be calculated. Change in FMD is the percent change in the diameter of the brachial artery from baseline (prior to transfusion) to Day 1 (first post-transfusion day). A higher FMD indicates better nitric oxide-dependent endothelial function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in reactive hyperemic index (RHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to transfusion), Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) will be measured using Pulsatile Arterial Tonometry (PAT). Baseline blood pressure of both hands is measured and PAT probes are placed one on each hand at the same finger (fingers 2, 3 or 4). Following an equilibration period of 10 minutes, the blood pressure cuff will be inflated to 60 mmHg above systolic pressure for 5 minutes followed by deflation of the cuff and the pulsatile recordings from both study and control fingers will be measured. RHI will be calculated from the ratio of the digital pulse volume during reactive hyperemia (following cuff deflation) and baseline. A higher RHI indicates better nitric oxide-dependent endothelial function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2Max)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo graded treadmill testing following American Heart Association guidelines using the modified Balke protocol. A treadmill with full metabolic cart will be used for the cardiopulmonary testing. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2Max) is the value achieved when the oxygen uptake remains stable despite a progressive increase in the intensity of exercise. The VO2Max will be calculated from the cardiac output and the arteriovenous oxygen difference during peak exercise. VO2Max is expressed in milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight (ml/min/kg). A higher VO2Max indicates better vascular reactivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory exchange ratio (RER):</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo graded treadmill testing following American Heart Association guidelines using the modified Balke protocol. A treadmill with full metabolic cart will be used for the cardiopulmonary testing. RER is the ratio of VCO2 (carbon dioxide output) to VO2 (oxygen uptake). A higher RER indicates better vascular reactivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>O2 pulse</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo graded treadmill testing following American Heart Association guidelines using the modified Balke protocol. A treadmill with full metabolic cart will be used for the cardiopulmonary testing. O2 (oxygen) pulse is the amount of O2 consumed from the volume of blood delivered to tissues by each heartbeat; this index is calculated as: O2 pulse = VO2 / heart rate. A higher O2 pulse indicates better vascular reactivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak VO2 lean</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo graded treadmill testing following American Heart Association guidelines using the modified Balke protocol. A treadmill with full metabolic cart will be used for the cardiopulmonary testing. Peak VO2 lean is the peak oxygen uptake adjusted for lean body mass and is reported as a lean body weight-adjustment parameter in mL/kg per minute.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in oxidative stress markers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to transfusion), Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Oxidative stress will be measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to collect plasma cystine, cysteine, glutathione, and glutathione disulfide levels. Higher levels of cystine, cysteine, glutathione, and glutathione disulfide indicate higher levels of vascular inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in levels of nitric oxide metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to transfusion), Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Nitric oxide metabolites like nitrite, nitrate, S-nitrosothiols (SNO-Hb and SNO-thiol) will be measured from blood samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Higher levels of nitric oxide metabolites indicate higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and better vascular reactivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)hsCRP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to transfusion), Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in the blood will be measured by using Dade Behring nephelometry. Higher levels of hsCRP indicate increased vascular inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in levels of IL-6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to transfusion), Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma IL-6 concentration will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Change is the difference in the levels of IL-6 from baseline to Day 1 (first post-transfusion day). Higher concentrations of IL-6 indicate increased vascular inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in levels of IL-2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to transfusion), Day 1 (first post-transfusion day)</time_frame>
