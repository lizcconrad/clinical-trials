  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASD is a diverse disorder starting in early childhood and characterized by social
      communication impairment as well as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. It affects
      1:68 children and is an enormous medical and economic problem for which there is no
      established, mechanism-based treatment. Sulforaphane is an isothiocyanate derived from
      broccoli, and has potent activity in transcriptionally up-regulating genes that control
      mechanisms whereby aerobic cells protect themselves against oxidative stress, mitochondrial
      dysfunction, and inflammation.

      This study is a clinical trial of oral sulforaphane (as broccoli seed powder) in 50 boys and
      girls (3-12 years) with ASD in 3 phases over 36 weeks. In Phase 1, 25 children will receive
      active drug and 25 will receive placebo for 15 weeks; in Phase 2, all children will receive
      sulforaphane from 15-30 weeks; in Phase 3, children will receive no treatment for 6 weeks.
      Study visits will take place at screening, 7, 15, 22, 30 and 36 weeks, when the Ohio Autism
      Clinical Clinical Impressions Scale - Severity and Improvement (OACIS-S and OACIS-I),
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) will be recorded.
      Children will be monitored with physical examinations and for toxicity with clinical
      laboratory studies and examine possible biomarkers: Nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2 (Nrf2),
      oxidative stress and mitochondrial function, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      pathway and cytokine expression. In addition, prior to the main clinical trial, a pilot study
      will be carried out in 10 children with ASD, 6-12 years of age, who will receive
      sulforaphane, 2.2 micromoles/kg daily for 14 days. Blood and urine samples before and at the
      end of treatment will be collected, in order to measure several parameters that are likely to
      demonstrate expected effects of sulforaphane, to standardize the assays and procedures, and
      to determine the most effective measures.

      Background: ASD is a diverse disorder starting in early childhood and characterized by social
      communication impairment as well as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. It affects
      1:68 children and is an enormous medical and economic problem for which there is no
      established, mechanism-based treatment. Sulforaphane is an isothiocyanate derived from
      broccoli, and has potent activity in transcriptionally up-regulating genes that control
      mechanisms whereby aerobic cells protect themselves against oxidative stress, mitochondrial
      dysfunction, and inflammation.

      Hypothesis: Based on the observation that fever is frequently associated with behavioral
      improvements in children with ASD, it is hypothesized that sulforaphane might lead to
      functional improvements in ASD because it can up-regulate cell-protective responses, such as
      heat shock proteins and related mechanisms that are also up-regulated during fever. These
      mechanisms are central to multiple cellular processes in the central nervous system,
      including synaptic transmission, and may improve long-range cerebral cortical connectivity,
      which is depressed in ASD.

      Specific aims: The 3 specific aims in this study are: 1) To determine if there are measurable
      effects on social responsiveness and problem behaviors during treatment of children with
      sulforaphane; 2) To determine if treatment with sulforaphane in children is safe and well
      tolerated; and 3) To elucidate cellular biomarkers that respond to treatment with
      sulforaphane.

      Design: This is a randomized, double blind, single-arm crossover phase 1/2 clinical trial of
      orally administered sulforaphane (as broccoli seed powder) in 50 boys and girls (3-12 years)
      with ASD in 3 phases over 36 weeks.

      In Phase 1, 25 children will receive active drug and 25 will receive placebo for 15 weeks; in
      Phase 2, all children will receive sulforaphane from 15-30 weeks; in Phase 3, children will
      receive no treatment for 6 weeks. Study visits will take place at screening, 7, 15, 22, 30
      and 36 weeks, when the Ohio Autism Clinical Clinical Impressions Scale - Severity and
      Improvement (OACIS-S and OACIS-I), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Social
      Responsiveness Scale (SRS) will be recorded.

      The children will be monitored with physical examinations and for toxicity with clinical
      laboratory studies and examine possible biomarkers: Nrf2, oxidative stress and mitochondrial
      function, mTOR pathway and cytokine expression.

      In addition, prior to the main clinical trial, a pilot study will be performed in 10 children
      with ASD, 6-12 years of age, who will receive sulforaphane, 2.2 micromoles/kg daily for 14
      days. Blood and urine samples before and at the end of treatment will be collected, in order
      to measure several parameters that are likely to demonstrate expected effects of
      sulforaphane, to standardize the assays and procedures, and to determine the most effective
      measures.

    <description>Sulforaphane (SF) will be administered once a day orally in an approximate dose of 1 µmol/lb (2.2 kg µmol/kg) body weight. Each SF tablet will contain 125 mg broccoli seed powder (equivalent to ~ 15 µmol SF). The total dose per day will depend on participants' body weight:
30-50 lb: 3 tablets (45 µmol/day) 50-70 lb: 4 tablets (60 µmol/day) 70-90 lb: 6 tablets (90 µmol/day) 90-110 lb: 7 tablets (105 µmol/day) 110-130 lb: 8 tablets (120 µmol/day)
For pilot study, all participants (n=10) will receive SF for 14 days. For main clinical trial, 25 participants will randomly receive SF for 15 weeks (phase 1). During phase 2, a single-arm crossover from placebo to sulforaphane arm will take place, and all participants will receive SF from 15-30 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis of moderate or greater severity

          -  Age 3 through 12 years inclusive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absence of a parent or legal guardian and consent

          -  Inability to speak/understand English language

          -  Seizure within 1 year of screening: This exclusion is based on the theoretical concern
             that cellular activation by sulforaphane might exacerbate seizures in patients with
             known seizure disorders. As noted in our previous trial of sulforaphane in young adult
             males, a seizure occurred in each of 2 participants: one during treatment (in a
             participant with a previously undisclosed seizure), the other 3 weeks after
             discontinuing sulforaphane.

          -  Impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl), impaired hepatic function
             (SGOT/SGPT&gt; 2x upper limit of normal), impaired thyroid function (Thyroid Stimulating
             Hormone (TSH) outside normal limits): This exclusion is based on a theoretical
             possibility of activation of underlying cellular metabolic abnormalities by
             sulforaphane. Current infection or treatment with antibiotics: this exclusion is to
             avoid complications of inter-current illness that may occur due to the clinical trial
             or obscure possible effects of sulforaphane.

          -  Medications that may modify the course or testing of ASD parameters (e.g.,
             prednisone): This exclusion is necessary in order not to interfere with or complicate
             effects of sulforaphane.

          -  Chronic medical disorder (e.g., cardiovascular disease, stroke or diabetes) or major
             surgery within 3 months prior to enrollment: Serious medical illness in the child may
             be complicated by the clinical trial and make it difficult to discern a change in ASD
             associated with treatment.

          -  Less than 3 years or more than 13 years of age: this age range was selected to cover
             the ages from usual diagnosis of ASD up to adolescence.

          -  A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder of mild severity (for example, earlier
             categories of Asperger disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise
             Specified (PDD-NOS)), according to Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)
             criteria.
