  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous Platelet Rich
      Plasma (PRP) and Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP) eye drops four times a day in the treatment of
      ocular graft versus host disease (O-GVHD). In addition to their current medication (except
      autologous serum drops), patients will receive PRP and PPP drops.

    <textblock>
      Ocular involvement can be quite symptomatic in patients with chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD). The impact of ocular GVHD on quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic
      GVHD has been studied in a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal, observational study and
      showed that ocular GVHD affects 57% of patients within 2 years of chronic GVHD diagnosis.
      Strong evidence suggested that ocular GVHD is associated with worse overall health-related
      QOL. Significant worsening of vision-related QOL in ocular GVHD has been reported. Ocular
      GVHD is devastating and there is no effective treatment available so far. The importance of
      this study is that for the first time in the nation, our institute will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of topical autologous blood product (PRP and PPP) to treat ocular surface
      disease associated with ocular GVHD.

    <description>Safety and tolerability of topical autologous PRP and PPP four times a day will be monitored by the occurrence of systemic and ocular adverse events in addition to symptoms directly related to the instillation or use of the autologous blood products. The severity of each adverse event and relation to the study medication will be graded possibly, probably, or definitely related. Tolerability measures will be graded from trace to severe using a direct query method at each visit.</description>
