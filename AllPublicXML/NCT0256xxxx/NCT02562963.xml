    <textblock>
      Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that present a mixed T-NK
      phenotype. Our hypothesis is that Natural killer T cells may decrease the tumor burden and
      improve overall survival. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Natural killer T
      (NKT) cells are effective and safe in the treatment of patients with unresectable advanced
      solid tumor.

      According to the Annual Report of Cancer Registration in China 2014, lung cancer, gastric
      cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer have become the top 4 solid tumors with the
      highest morbidity and mortality rates. So far, the main treatment modalities for these tumors
      have been surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the effect of conventional therapy
      on advanced cancer is limited, tumor metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with
      advanced cancer. With the development of oncology and immunology in recent years,
      immunotherapy represents a novel path to obtain a durable and long-lasting response in cancer
      patients.

      Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that present a mixed T-NK
      phenotype. NKT cells are expanded conventionally from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by
      addition of a variety of cytokines in vitro culture. Our previous studies demonstrated that
      the expansion of NKT cells in a clinical usage scale from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      is feasible. Those expanded NKT cells exhibit antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo (tumor
      -bearing nude mice) against a variety of tumor cells. Furthermore, intravenous infusion of a
      single dose of 4X10^9 NKT cells in mice has been proved safe.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKT cells in patients
      with unresectable advanced solid tumor.
