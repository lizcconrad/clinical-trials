  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many large-scale epidemiological studies have established a link between the average
      consumption of table salt (sodium chloride) and blood pressure. In France a survey conducted
      in 2001 showed that the average consumption of salt is 9 to 10g per people / day, and health
      authorities considered it appropriate to reduce consumption about 20%, by limiting
      contributions of sodium in prepared foods, bread.

      In terms of basic and clinical research, the biological effects of sodium chloride dietary
      intake, have been the subject of numerous studies for several decades. This work showed that
      all subjects do not react uniformly to sodium chloride flows, determining what the
      investigators call people &quot;sodium-sensitive&quot;. For these people the sodium intake elevated
      blood pressure, much more marked than in subjects called &quot;sodium-resistant.&quot;

      &quot;Sodium-sensitive&quot; people represent 10 to 30% of the population. A marked over-representation
      of this phenotype was observed in patients with hypertension or a family history of
      hypertension.

      In addition, studies conducted in animals and humans indicate that sodium intake has a
      different impact on biological parameters mentioned above, as is done in the form of chloride
      salt or bicarbonate of sodium.

      Based on these factors, investigators developed a clinical trial protocol intended to
      highlight a possible differential effect in the biological effects of the same sodium intake
      (2.56 g / day) orally, depending on the nature salt.

      Visit 5 (Day 14) :

        -  Return of the urinary bottle, of the empty treatment (to check compliance), of the diet
           record and of the booklet

      Visite 7 (Day42) - end of period 2 and end of study

      This second period is the same as the first period, except that the subject will not have the
      consultation with the dietetician and will receive the other study treatment according to the
      randomization plan.

      Ancillary Study This trial contains an ancillary study of genotypage (optional with specific
      consent of the subject) with the aim of the confrontation with the phenotyping.

      For that purpose, a blood sample will be made in the period of selection on the subject who
      gives their consent, in the same time of the blood sample for renal biology at visit 1.

      These results would allow to identify biomarkers of blood pressure sensibility at the sodium.
