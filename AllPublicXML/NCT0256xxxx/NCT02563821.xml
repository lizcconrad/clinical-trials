      Background : Recently, delivery of local anaesthetics via Programmed Intermittent Epidural
      Bolus (PIEB) has been shown to improve labour epidural analgesia compared to delivery via
      Continuous Epidural Infusion (CEI).

      Purpose : However, the superiority of PIEB compared to CEI has not been investigated for
      third trimester voluntary termination of pregnancy.

      We hypothesized that PIEB administration would result in a better degree of satisfaction of
      the patients compared with CEI for third trimester legally induced abortion analgesia.

      Abstract : The recent technical advances in antenatal diagnosis have led to an increase
      number of legally induced abortion at the third trimester of pregnancy. Psychological pain is
      frequently associated to physical pain in these kinds of interventions. So anaesthetists are
      more and more involved in voluntary termination of pregnancy analgesia.

      In France, Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA) with CEI mode is usually used for
      voluntary termination of pregnancy analgesia. But recent studies have shown that PIEB mode as
      compared to CEI mode increases maternal satisfaction during labour. This may be attributed to
      a more extensive spread of epidural solution when delivered as a bolus rather than continuous
      infusion.

      Few trials have been interested in investigating the best mode of PCEA for legally induced
      abortion analgesia.

      This study includes women who undergo voluntary third semester termination of pregnancy.
      Patients are randomized to PIEB or CEI for pain analgesia. In this randomized, double-blind
      study, the investigators assess the degree of satisfaction of the patients (primary outcome),
      the incidence of motor block, total drug consumption and adverse events (secondary outcomes)
      between the two study groups.

      The different values are collected during the intervention on a specific paper for each
      patient and the degree of satisfaction is reported on this paper just before the patient
      leaves the birth room (approximatively 2 hours after the expulsion).

    <description>Injection of a 2 mL initial epidural loading dose consisting of a blend (10 mL) of levobupivacaine 20 mg, sufentanil 10 µg to assure the absence of motor block and so exclude intrathecal placement of the epidural catheter.
Injection of the rest of the loading dose (8mL).
In this group the pump is programmed to deliver a continuous infusion at 10 mL /h consisting of levobupivacaine 0,573 mg/mL, sufentanil 0,37 µg/mL, clonidine 1,38 µg/ mL. Additional 5 mL patient-activated boluses will be allowed with a lockout interval of 10 minutes.
If the parturient feels she has inadequate analgesia after having activated the PCEA bolus twice in a thirty minutes period, an additional manual bolus of 6 mL of levobupivacaine 2,5 mg/mL will be administered until the Pain Visual Analog Scale (PVAS) is &lt; 3/10.</description>

In this group the pump is programmed to deliver automated mandatory boluses of 5 mL consisting of levobupivacaine 0,573 mg/mL, sufentanil 0,37 µg/mL, clonidine 1,38 µg/mL every 30 minutes. Additional 5 mL patient-activated boluses will be allowed with a lockout interval of 10 minutes.
If the parturient feels she has inadequate analgesia after having activated the PCEA bolus twice in a thirty minutes period, an additional manual bolus of 6 mL of levobupivacaine 2,5 mg/mL will be administered until the Pain Visual Analog Scale (PVAS) is &lt; 3/10 (0 = no pain and 10 = insufferable pain).</description>
