      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of polyphenol supplementation on plasma
      levels of prostaglandin E2 in women during the reproductive period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of anti-inflammatory substances on the constriction of the fetal ductus arteriosus
      is well documented, but the anti-inflammatory property of polyphenols and their effect on the
      metabolism of prostaglandins are not established. Evidence indicates that foods rich in
      polyphenols consumed from the third trimester of pregnancy may interfere with anatomical and
      functional activity of the fetal heart, presumably by the action similar to anti-inflammatory
      drugs nonsteroidal, causing inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis. Objective: The
      objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of polyphenol supplementation on plasma
      levels of prostaglandin E2 in women of childbearing age use of hormonal contraceptives. As
      secondary endpoints were also evaluated other markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.
      The selected women were randomized to receive capsules polyphenol at a concentration of 3000
      mg / day or placebo capsules to be consumed daily for fifteen days. Was applied dietary
      recall to assess intake of polyphenols, measured height and weight and carried blood samples
      for prostaglandin analysis E2 (PGE2), high sensitive C-reactive protein, and urine for
      analysis of total polyphenols and F2 isoprostane (8 iso-PGF2a). Statistical analysis: The
      results will be expressed through absolute and relative frequencies and mean ± standard
      deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range. For analysis, Pearson correlation is used.
      To compare the means will be used Student's t test. The level of significance is 5%.
      Considering a 90% power, with absolute error margin of 5% in the present study, 13 patients
      were needed in each group.
