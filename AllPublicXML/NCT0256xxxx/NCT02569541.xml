      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of oral sodium fusidate (CEM-102) as chronic
      antibiotic for the treatment of bone or joint infections.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm trial to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of CEM-102 for chronic antibiotic suppressive therapy of bone or joint
      infections. Subjects enrolling in this study must have a refractory staphylococcal bone or
      joint infection that requires suppressive antibiotic therapy (e.g. having an infection that
      cannot be managed by complete removal of the infected bone or foreign material, a refractory
      infection not responding to previous treatment, or not being a candidate for long-term
      intravenous antibiotic therapy).
