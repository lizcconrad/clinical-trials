  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a progressive, enduring, and often
      irreversible condition featuring pain, numbness, tingling and sensitivity to cold in the
      hands and feet (sometimes progressing to the arms and legs) that afflicts between 30 and 40
      percent of patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidance on The Journal of Clinical Oncology
      (JCO, 2014 April 14) does not recommend any prophylaxis regimen for CIPN.

      PerOx Quench has unique membrane protection and anti-oxidative function as a special food,
      that's why to try to explore its preventive effects on CIPN prevention induced by Oxaliplatin
      for colorectal cancer or gastric cancer chemotherapy.

      This study uses two stage group-sequential sampling design, based on current data, assumed
      the CIPN incidence rate is 50% in placebo arm, while 20% in PerOx Quench arm（60% reduction）,
      set a=0.05，80％ power, random allocation ratio is 1:1, obtained the subjects number is
      41（total 82) by PASS 11 software for superior design; considering 10% drop out rate, final
      number of subjects totally is 90.

  <why_stopped>
    Subjects' not-well compliance due to diarrhea and softening stool after taking PerOx Quench 4
