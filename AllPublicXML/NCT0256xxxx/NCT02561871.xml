  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intramuscular
      prime-boost regimens of Ad26.RSV.FA2 given either once or twice followed by Ad35.RSV.FA2
      (human adenovirus-vectored vaccine candidate) in healthy participants.

      This is a single-center, randomized (study vaccine assigned to participants by chance),
      placebo-controlled study (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no vaccine in it]
      that is compared in a clinical trial with a vaccine to test if the vaccine has a real
      effect), double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving) Phase 1 study in healthy participants. The study comprises a 4-week
      screening period; vaccination for each participant on Days 1, 85, and, 169; a 28-day
      follow-up period performed after each vaccination and a final visit at Day 337. Approximately
      32 Participants will be randomized in parallel in a 3:3:2 ratio to 3 treatment groups (Group
      1/2/3) to receive either Ad26.RSV.FA2 or Ad35.RSV.FA2 or placebo. The study duration will be
      approximately 52 weeks. Blood samples for immunogenicity will be collected. Participant's
      safety will be evaluated throughout the study.

             disorders, bleeding/clotting disorder, autoimmune disease, active malignancy, poorly
             controlled asthma, active tuberculosis or other systemic infections)

          -  Participant has had major surgery within the 4 weeks prior to randomization or has
