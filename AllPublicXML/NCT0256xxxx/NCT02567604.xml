      This study will explore experience of AMD caregivers in order to develop a core outcome set
      (COS) for age related macular degeneration (AMD) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) trying
      to capture what research outcomes are important from their perspective.

      People 18 years of age and older who have been AMD caregivers for at least 6 months may be
      eligible for this study.

      The aim is to conduct three focus groups lasting approximately one hour. The plan is to enrol
      18-24 participants (6-8 participants per each of 3 focus groups).Two researchers will be
      involved in conducting the focus groups. A moderator will ensure fluid discussion, while the
      second investigator will be taking notes and audio-recording the discussion.

    <textblock>
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are widely employed interventional studies in medicine,
      yet many times their outcomes are presented inconsistently. The COMET Initiative (Core
      Outcome Measures for Effectiveness Trials) suggests that a solution for that issue would be
      preparation of a core outcome set (COS)a minimal group of outcome measures relevant to
      different group of stakeholders (e.g. clinicians, patients, carers) that would be implemented
      in each RCT in a particular area. The overall aim is to prepare a COS for age related-macular
      degeneration (AMD) RCTs. As first step to develop a COS for AMD, the investigators conducted
      a systematic review that confirmed variability in AMD trials' outcome selection. The current
      step encompasses involvement of different stakeholders' groups in focus groups: patients and
      caregivers (current project) such as family members and friends helping AMD patients with
      their everyday living. Knowledge of caregivers' perspective on living with, treatment and
      outcomes for AMD is a key consideration when building up a COS, because they may not only
      evaluate existing outcomes, but also their experience may be translate into new outcomes. In
      the current focus group study, caregivers will be invited for a one hour discussion. The
      investigators plan to arrange three focus groups with approximately 8 participants each. Two
      researchers will be present to help facilitate discussion. Participants will be asked about
      their experience related to their help brought to AMD patients, observations of living with
      and treatment of AMD as well as about AMD study outcomes and their importance.

    <description>The expected list of COS (core outcome set) elements will plausibly include some of the visual function or anatomical measures as well as aspects of the quality of life. This study is a qualitative research study. No interventions will be given to the participants. No questionnaire or scale will be administered. The focus group discussions will aim to explore opinions of caregivers on outcomes used in AMD trials. Repeating themes of the discussions will be captured to form a potential COS for AMD trials.</description>
