    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        IInclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has provided written consent.

          2. In the Investigator's opinion, the subject is able to understand and comply with
             protocol requirements, instructions, and protocol stated restrictions and is likely to
             complete the study as planned.

          3. Male or female, 18-70 years of age.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) 18-35 kg/m^2, inclusive.

          5. A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (β-human chorionic
             gonadotropin) pregnancy test at screening.

          6. Female subjects must either:

               -  not be of childbearing potential defined as: i. Postmenopausal for at least 12
                  months (i.e., 2 years of amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause) and a
                  serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (per
                  reference laboratory), OR ii. Surgically sterile (e.g., underwent total
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal
                  clips without reversal operation), or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant,
                  OR

               -  be of childbearing potential AND

               -  not heterosexually active (e.g., abstinent or homosexual) from screening until 6
                  months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by local
                  regulations), OR

               -  if heterosexually active

                    -  have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile per verbal account of the
                       subject), OR

                    -  using an acceptable method of birth control from screening and agree to
                       continue to use the same method of contraception throughout the study and
                       for 6 months after study drug administration (or longer, if dictated by
                       local regulations). Oral hormone based contraceptives are not allowed from
                       14 days before the planned study drug administration until 6 months after
                       the last dose of treatment due to the potential for drug-drug interactions
                       which might undermine their efficacy. An IUD, being either hormonal (i.e.,
                       IUS*) or non-hormonal, is considered highly effective and reliable;
                       therefore subjects using an IUD/IUS are not required to use additional
                       contraceptive methods (no double-barrier method is required). Other non-oral
                       hormone-based contraception methods (e.g., injectable, implants, transdermal
                       system, vaginal ring) may be continued, but as the interaction of the study
                       drug with hormone-based contraception is unknown, these methods are not
                       considered to be reliable and therefore subjects should use a double-barrier
                       method (e.g., male condom+either diaphragm or cervical cap with or without
                       spermicide).

                         -  An IUS does not rely on systemic plasma concentrations and is therefore
                            not expected to be impacted by a potential DDI.

             Note 1: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated
             with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
             relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject.

             Note 2: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of breakage
             or damage caused by latex friction.

          7. A post-menopausal female who is receiving hormone replacement therapy and is willing
             to discontinue hormone therapy 30 days before study drug dosing and agrees to remain
             off hormone replacement therapy for the duration of the study may be eligible for
             study participation.

               -  Male subjects must either:

               -  be surgically sterile (had a vasectomy), or otherwise incapable of fathering a
                  child, OR

               -  not be heterosexually active (e.g., abstinent or homosexual) from enrollment (Day
                  1) in the study until at least 6 months after study drug administration, OR

               -  if heterosexually active:

                    -  have a partner who is postmenopausal (2 years amenorrhea), surgically
                       sterile (e.g., has had a total hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                       bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clips without reversal operation),
                       or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant OR

                    -  be practicing an acceptable method of birth control from enrollment in the
                       study (Day 1) and agree to continue to use the same method of contraception
                       throughout the study and for at least 6 months after study drug
                       administration (or longer, if dictated by local regulations). An acceptable
                       method of birth control for male subjects is a double-barrier method (e.g.,
                       male condom+either diaphragm or cervical cap with or without spermicide).

             Note: Male subjects with a female partner who uses hormonal contraceptives (oral,
             injectable, implants) or a hormonal (IUS) or non-hormonal IUD and male subjects who
             are vasectomized or otherwise incapable of fathering a child are not required to use
             additional contraceptive methods.

             Note 1: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as
             refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated
             with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
             relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject.

             Note 2: A male and female condom should not be used together due to risk of breakage
             or damage caused by latex friction.

             NOTE: Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations
             regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects participating in clinical
             studies if these are stricter than what is proposed in these inclusion criteria

          8. Subjects must agree to refrain from sperm/egg donation from start of dosing through 6
             months after the completion of study drug administration.

          9. GT1a or 1b or GT2 or 3 CHC, depending on cohort, with positive HCV antibody and a
             positive HCV RNA at screening including documentation of CHC infection for at least 6
             months. Genotype testing must occur at a screening visit. NOTE: GT1 patients are
             eligible for inclusion even if they cannot be successfully subtyped unless a specific
             subtype is required for a cohort.

         10. Screening HCV RNA viral load ≥50,000 IU/mL, except for subjects with compensated
             cirrhosis (Child Pugh Class A) who may have HCV RNA viral load ≥10^4 IU/mL.

         11. No prior treatment for CHC (defined as no prior exposure to any approved or
             investigational drug including direct-acting antivirals, and interferon-based
             treatments)

         12. Fibroscan, collected within 6 months of baseline visit, with liver stiffness score
             ≤12.5 kPa to be eligible (except for subjects with cirrhosis, see below).

             • Subjects with compensated cirrhosis must meet the Child-Pugh Class A definition (see
             Appendix G) and at least one of the following criteria: i. Liver biopsy result
             indicating the presence of cirrhosis (e.g., Metavir F4; Ishak &gt;5) or ii. Fibroscan
             evaluation with a liver stiffness score &gt;12.5 kPa

         13. Subject is otherwise in good health as deemed by the investigator, based on the
             findings of a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory tests and ECG.

         14. Willing to avoid prolonged sun exposure and use of tanning devices while taking SMV
             and through 4 weeks of follow up. Subjects should also be advised to use a
             broad-spectrum sunscreen and lip balm of at least sun protection factor &gt;30 to help
             protect against potential sunburn.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant (during treatment and up to 6 months after the
             EOT), or breast-feeding female subject, or male subject whose female partner is
             pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant (during treatment and up to 6 months after
             the EOT)

          2. Other than CHC with or without compensated cirrhosis, clinically significant

             interval &gt;120 msec or corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;450 msec for male subjects and &gt;470
             msec for female subjects), based on an average of triplicate ECGs. Any evidence of
             heart block or bundle branch block is also exclusionary.

         12. History or family history of abnormal ECG intervals, for example prolonged QT syndrome

               -  Prothrombin time ≥1.5 × ULN

               -  Albumin ≤32 g/L, bilirubin ≥1.5 mg/dL at screening (subjects with documented
                  Gilbert's disease allowed)

               -  Serum ALT concentration ≥5× ULN

               -  CK &gt;1.5× ULN A single repeat laboratory evaluation under appropriate conditions
                  (e.g., fasted, no antecedent exercise) is allowed for eligibility determination.

         15. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy or other
             significant gastrointestinal tract surgery, such as gastroenterostomy, small bowel
             resection, or active enterostomy).

         16. Clinically significant blood loss or elective blood donation of significant volume
             (i.e., &gt;500 mL) within 60 days of first dose of study drug; &gt;1 unit of plasma within 7
             days of first dose of study drug.

         17. Evidence of clinically relevant active infection that would interfere with study
             conduct or its interpretation.

         18. History of regular alcohol intake &gt;10 standard drinks per week of alcohol for females
             and &gt;15 standard drinks per week for males (one unit is defined as 10 g alcohol)
             within 3 months of the screening visit.

         19. The use of prohibited medications, including prescription, over the counter (OTC)
             medications, herbal medications, inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes or drug
             transporters (including P-gp) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication is excluded, unless previously approved by the Sponsor's Medical Monitor.
             NOTE: Chronic medication use is permitted so long as they are medically necessary,
             deemed acceptable by the Principal Investigator and Medical Monitor, and not
             Prohibited Medications (see Section 5.12).

         20. Hypersensitivity to the active substances (including sulfa allergy) or to any of the
             excipients of AL-335, ODV or SMV.

         21. Evidence on recent (within 6 months) liver ultrasound of hepatic mass or lesion
             concerning for malignancy (subjects with cirrhosis only).
