  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine subjective gastrointestinal tolerance response and
      differences in breath hydrogen response following the consumption of two types of juice. This
      double-blind crossover study requires participants to arrive to the lab 12 hours fasted,
      consume 12 oz of juice and complete gastrointestinal tolerance questionnaires as well as
      produce samples for breath hydrogen analysis at various time points over the next 3 hours.
      Subjects will be asked to complete additional questionnaires at 12 and 24 hours post
      consumption, from home. Subjects will also be asked to keep a food record for 24 hours prior
      to their scheduled visit times to assure compliance.

    <description>Subjects will answer a 7 symptom questionnaire regarding the intensity of gastrointestinal symptoms experienced following juice consumption. Questionnaire is adapted from the validated Bovenschen gastrointestinal tolerance questionnaire. Questionnaire is to be completed at the following time points: baseline, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 180 min, 12 hours, 24 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Breath Hydrogen from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to exhale a full breath into a sample collection bag. The breath samples will be extracted and measured using the Quintron BreathTracker Analyzer at time points: baseline, 60 min, 120 min. This will be a marker of carbohydrate fermentation in the colon.</description>
