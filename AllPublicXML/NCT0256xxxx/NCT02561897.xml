  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized comparative evaluation of Edoxaban and Warfarin for safety
      and efficacy in perioperative use in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF)
      undergoing clinically indicated implantation or replacement of cardiovascular implantable
      electrical devices.The primary objective is to compare the rates of local and systemic
      bleeding in subjects randomized to Edoxaban compared to subjects randomized to continuous
      warfarin in within 30 days of cardiac rhythm device implant with concomitant non-valvular AF.

      This is a prospective randomized comparative evaluation of Edoxaban and Warfarin for safety
      and efficacy in perioperative use in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
      undergoing clinically indicated implantation or replacement of cardiovascular implantable
      electrical devices. This study is a randomized, open label, active-controlled trial with an
      open-label safety extension, designed to compare local and systemic bleeding within 30 days
      of cardiac rhythm device implant among subjects randomized to continuous Warfarin or
      interrupted (&lt;24 hours) Edoxaban. The study will have three phases, a run in phase to
      establish stable warfarin therapy, an acute open label 30 day phase when subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive interrupted edoxaban or continuous warfarin followed by
      an open label follow up phase for an additional 5 months for safety monitoring. Drug
      transitions will be performed according to approved drug labeling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with established atrial fibrillation (AF) and bradycardia on long term (&gt;3
             weeks) therapeutic oral anticoagulant (OAC) with warfarin or another OAC who are
             undergoing new pacemaker system implant or existing pacemaker system revision.

          -  Subjects with newly detected bradycardia -tachycardia syndrome and AF who have been
             recently (less than 3 weeks) started on warfarin, have a therapeutic international
             normalized ratio (INR) and no thrombus on trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) who
             are undergoing a new pacemaker system implant or revision.

          -  Subjects with AF and ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT or VF) or acquired structural
             heart disease who are candidates for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)
