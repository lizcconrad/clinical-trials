  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this small pilot study, participants (patients and healthy volunteers) will have blood
      drawn before and after the study intervention (hyperbaric chamber session or normal pressure
      oxygen breathing. This blood will be analyzed for neutrophil oxidative burst and cytokine
      analysis.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators are interested in studying the influence of hyperbaric oxygen on
      neutrophils (a kind of white blood cell) and cytokines (cell proteins). Hyperbaric oxygen can
      enhance the way the immune system works, but the investigators don't fully know how that
      happens. the investigators are doing this study to learn more about this question.
