  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An electrical-inhibition (EI) uterine pacemaker device similar to an electrical heart
      pacemaker delivers a weak electrical current to the human uterus during active preterm labor
      to rapidly and safely inhibit the unwanted premature uterine contractions and possibly a
      preterm birth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrical intervention (EI) uses bipolar, constant-current (1-20 mA), square-wave pulses in
      20% duty cycles. Women in active preterm labor have an electrode catheter placed into the
      posterior fornix of the vaginal canal. The EI current is given up to 80 minutes while
      monitoring tocodynamometric (toco) contractions and adjunct electrohysterographic (EHG)
      activity while continuously monitoring maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate and
      electrocardiogram (fECG). The study includes a pre-EI control period (C1); the EI period,
      when a 10-second current burst is delivered only during a contraction; and a post-EI control
      period (C2). The whole study will take a maximum of two hours.

      The uterine toco contraction frequency and adjunct EHG electrical activity are analyzed for
      changes caused by EI. Changes in maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate and fECG will
      determine EI side-effects.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    FDA/IRB approved but hospital administration vetoed the study fearing litigation of a preterm
    birth though the electrical uterine pacemaker/EI is not the cause.
