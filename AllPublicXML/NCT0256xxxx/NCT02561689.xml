  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Occlusal caries is the main reason for restorative therapy in the young permanent
      dentition, but restorations have limited survival time and may also weaken the tooth. An
      intact fissure sealing is an effective preventive treatment of occlusal caries lesions and
      may be used therapeutically to arrest the caries progression. However, the major challenge
      with fissure sealants is the frequent need for re-treatments, mostly due to inadequate
      retention.

      Purpose: To quantify the longevity and effectiveness of the 6 resin sealants used
      prophylactically and therapeutically in permanent molar teeth.

      Study design: The study is carried out as a prospective, clinically controlled study with
      split-mouth design, where each of the 60 dentists/dental hygienists from 13 municipalities in
      Denmark uses 2 of the 6 sealants. The treatments are examined clinically and radiologically
      after 1, 2, 3, and 5 years.

      The choice of the two materials is randomized and carried out so that all materials are used
      equally frequent and with an even distribution between dentists and dental hygienists.

    <description>Procedure:
The included teeth of the participating patients will in any case be sealed, but in this study, the operator is not free to choose the material, the material choice is determined by randomisation
Standardized radiographs (bitewings) will be taken before treatment and after 1, 2, 3 years and possibly after 5 years. Baseline radiograph can be taken up to six months before treatment. If using conventional radiography, double-film packs will be used. A maximum of 8/10 bitewings will be taken during the study period of 3/5 years
The occlusal surface is sealed by the dentist or dental hygienist.
Clinical evaluation of the quality of sealants and the need for re-treatments during the follow-up will be performed after 1, 2 and 3 years and possibly after 5 years</description>
