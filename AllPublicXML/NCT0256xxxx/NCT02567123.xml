  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether changing foot strike pattern from a
      rearfoot strike to a forefoot strike reduces chronic running-related knee pain. It is
      believed that switching foot strike pattern from a rearfoot strike to a forefoot strike
      pattern will reduce associated running-related patellofemoral knee pain.

      Runners will come to the Gait Analysis Lab on north campus of the University of New Mexico,
      HSSB 168, for the first running trial. During this time you will fill out a health
      questionnaire, receive an assessment by a physical therapist, and be given a new pair of
      running shoes to use for the duration of the study.

      Runners will be equipped with several reflective markers, which will be placed on your lower
      body. Runners will then complete several passes across a runway while we record your running
      with a motion analysis system. Runners will be equipped with a mouthpiece and nose clip. You
      will run for 10 minutes while we collect the gases you breathe.Twenty-four hours after you
      complete this running trial, you will come to our Exercise Physiology lab in Johnson Center,
      B143 to perform the training sessions. During this time you will run for about 10-30 minutes
      in front of a mirror and receive feedback from the research team. You will perform these
      training sessions eight times over two weeks. Twenty-four hours after your last training
      session, you will perform another follow-up running trial, which will be the same as the
      first trial. After completing the second running trial, you will be allowed to return to your
      normal running routine for about one month. After one month, you will return to the Gait
      Analysis lab to perform a final running trial, which will be the same as the first and second
      running trials.
