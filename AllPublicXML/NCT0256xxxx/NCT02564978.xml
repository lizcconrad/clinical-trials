      Background:

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main reason older people lose their vision. It
      affects the macula, the center of the retina needed for sharp, clear vision. Researchers want
      to see if an antibiotic can help people with an advanced form of AMD, Geographic Atrophy
      (GA).

      Objective:

      To see if minocycline is safe for people with GA and if it helps preserve their vision.

      Eligibility:

      People age 55 and older who have GA in at least one eye.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with physical exam, medical history, blood tests, and eye exam.

      Participants will take minocycline. They will take 1 pill twice a day for at least 3 years.

      Participants will have a minimum of 11 study visits. (But they are not every 3 months.). At
      each visit, participants will have a medical history. They may have:

      Blood tests.

      Eye exam. Vision, eye pressure, and eye movements will be checked. The pupils may be dilated.
      The inside of the eyes may be photographed.

      Their thyroid gland felt while they swallow.

      Microperimetry. They will sit in front of a computer and press a button when they see a light
      on the screen.

      Fluorescein angiography. An intravenous line (IV) will be placed in an arm vein. A dye called
      fluorescein will be placed in the IV and travel through the veins to the blood vessels in the
      eyes. A camera will take pictures of the dye as it flows through the eye blood vessels.

      Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people
      over age 65 in the United States, is a heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal
      degeneration occurs predominantly in the macula in the context of aging and leads to
      impairment of central visual acuity (VA). AMD occurs in two general forms, one of which
      involves choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with subsequent formation of a disciform scar.
      This is often referred to as the neovascular or wet form. A second form, the subject of this
      study, is termed dry /atrophic macular degeneration or otherwise geographic atrophy (GA) and
      involves a slow progressive atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and
      photoreceptors in the macula, also resulting in central vision loss. GA is estimated to
      affect up to 1 million persons in the U.S. and there is no current treatment that can prevent
      its onset or retard its progression. While the etiology of GA is not completely understood,
      inflammatory processes involving the activation of resident immune cells of the retina called
      microglia is likely to contribute. Minocycline inhibits the activation of microglia which
      produce inflammatory factors implicated in GA development. The objective of this study is to
      investigate the safety and possible efficacy of oral minocycline in patients with GA.

      Study Population: Forty-five participants with unilateral or bilateral GA associated with AMD
      will be enrolled. However, up to an additional 15 participants may be enrolled to replace
      participants who may withdraw from the study prior to reaching the Month 33 visit.

      Design: This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, Phase II study to evaluate
      minocycline as a potential treatment to decrease the rate of worsening of GA associated with
      AMD. Participants will assignedundergo a nine month run-in phase prior to receiving
      investigational product (IP). During this run-in phase, participants will have a total of
      four pre-treatment visits. Following the run-in phase, beginning at Month 9, participants
      will receive an oral dose of 100 mg of minocycline twice daily for 36 months. There will be a
      common termination date, which will take place when the last recruited participant has
      received 36 months of treatment. Participants who were recruited in the earlier part of the
      study will continue treatment and be followed every six months until the common termination
      date.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the rate of change in area of GA based on grading by
      an external Reading Center of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images in the assigned study eye.
      The primary outcome will compare the rates of GA area expansion as determined on FAF images
      before and following the initiation of IP until 24 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes
      will compare differences in rates of change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
      low-luminance VA, area of GA based on fundus photography, and macular sensitivity as measured
      using microperimetry between the run-in and treatment phases. Safety outcomes will include
      the number and severity of adverse events (AEs). Ocular safety outcomes will be indicated by
      changes in VA, ocular surface changes, intraocular inflammation and any other ocular changes
      not consistent with the natural progression of GA.

             Acceptable methods of contraception include:

               1. hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal

                       methods of contraception.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present.

          -  Participant is actively receiving study therapy in another investigational study.

          -  Any female participant of childbearing potential (see Appendix 1 for definition) that

          -  Participant is currently taking minocycline or another tetracycline medication.

          -  Participant is taking any medication that could adversely interact with minocycline
             such as methoxyflurane.

          -  Participant has a prior history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

        STUDY EYE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        The participant must have at least one eye meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the
        exclusion criteria listed below.

        STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The study eye must have at least (Omega) disc area (approximately 1 mm(2)) of GA
             compatible with dry AMD. GA is defined as one or more well-defined and often circular
             patches of partial or complete depigmentation of the RPE, typically with exposure of
             underlying choroidal blood vessels. Even if much of the RPE appears to be preserved
             and large choroidal vessels are not visible, a round patch of RPE partial
             depigmentation may be classified as early GA. The GA in the study eye must be able to
             be photographed in their entirety, and it must not be contiguous with any areas of
             peripapillary atrophy, which can complicate area measurements.

          -  The total area of GA lesions combined should be less than 7.0 MPS disc areas (DA)
             (17.78 mm(2)) as evident on FAF imaging.

          -  The VA of the study eye should be &gt;19 E-ETDRS letters (i.e., 20/400 or better).

          -  The study eye must have clarity of ocular media and degree of pupil dilation
             sufficient to permit adequate fundus photographs.

        STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Current evidence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as determined by the treating
             physician or a history of treatments for CNV

          -  Evidence of retinal atrophy due to causes other than atrophic AMD.

          -  Current evidence or history of ocular disorders in the study eye that in the opinion
             of the investigator confounds study outcome measures, including (but not limited to):

               1. non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy involving 10 or more hemorrhages or
                  microaneurysms, or active proliferative diabetic retinopathy

               2. Branch or central retinal vein or artery occlusion

               3. Macular hole

               4. Pathologic myopia

               5. Uveitis

               6. Pseudovitelliform maculopathy

          -  History of vitreoretinal surgery.

          -  Need for ocular surgery during the course of the study.

          -  Recent history of lens removal (less than 3 months) or Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG)
             laser capsulotomy (less than 1 month).
