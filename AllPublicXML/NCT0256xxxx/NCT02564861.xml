  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study designed to
      explore the safety, tolerability and PK of DS-1971a following oral administration over 14
      days to healthy male and female subjects. Each participant receives lidocaine as a local
      anaesthetic before inserting the intravenous cannula.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within strictly defined limits, the protocol permits the dose escalation committee to amend
      the dose escalation rules, doses proposed in the study protocol and to change the timing of
      or to add additional assessments following review of the safety, tolerability and plasma
      DS-1971a concentration data. The decisions to change the doses will be documented in the
      minutes of the dose escalation committee.

             the first dose of study medication; use of any other prescription or OTC medicine
             (with the exception of acetaminophen (paracetamol)), including dietary supplements or
             herbal remedies, during the 7 days before the dose of study medication.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Consumption of certain foods or beverages before the first dose and throughout the
             study period.

             blood components during the 3 months before the first dose of study medication, or

             study medication.

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol during the 2 years before the first dose of study
             medication, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly for male subjects and 14
