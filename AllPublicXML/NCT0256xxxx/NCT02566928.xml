  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the project is to develop and evaluate a home-based intervention to
      prevent re-infection and transmission of Community-Acquired Methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) in patients presenting to primary care with skin or soft
      tissue infections (SSTIs). Centers for Disease Control (CDC) CA-MRSA guidelines include
      incision and drainage, antibiotic sensitivity testing and antibiogram-directed prescribing.
      Re-infections are common, ranging from 16% to 43%, and present significant challenges to
      clinicians, patients and their families. Several decolonization and decontamination
      interventions have been shown to reduce Hospital-Acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) re-infection and
      transmission in intensive care units. Few studies examine the feasibility and effectiveness
      of these infection prevention interventions into primary care settings, and none employ
      Community Health Workers (CHWs) or &quot;promotoras&quot; to provide home visits for education and
      interventions about decolonization and decontamination. This comparative effectiveness
      research/patient centered outcomes research builds upon a highly stakeholder-engaged
      community-academic research and learning collaborative, including practicing clinicians,
      patients, clinical and laboratory researchers, and barbers/beauticians. Clinical Directors
      Network (CDN), an established, NIH-recognized best practice Federally Qualified Health Center
      (FQHC) Practice-based Research Network (PBRN), and The Rockefeller University propose to
      address this question through the completion of four aims: (1) To evaluate the comparative
      effectiveness of a CHW/Promotora-delivered home intervention (Experimental Group) as compared
      to Usual Care (Control Group) on the primary patient-centered and clinical outcome (SSTI
      recurrence rates) and secondary patient-centered and clinical outcomes (pain, depression,
      quality of life, care satisfaction) using a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT). (2) To
      understand the patient-level factors (CA-MRSA infection prevention knowledge, self-efficacy,
      decision-making autonomy, prevention behaviors/adherence) and environmental-level factors
      (household surface contamination, household member colonization, transmission to household
      members) that are associated with differences in SSTI recurrence rates. (3) To understand
      interactions of the intervention with bacterial genotypic and phenotypic variables on
      decontamination, decolonization, SSTI recurrence, and household transmission. (4) To explore
      the evolution of stakeholder engagement and interactions among patients and other community
      stakeholders with practicing community-based clinicians and academic laboratory and clinical
      investigators over the duration of the study period.
