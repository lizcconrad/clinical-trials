  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a single-blind randomized clinical trial to test the
      efficacy of a computerized cognitive remediation intervention program on improving locomotion
      in sedentary seniors, a group at an especially high risk for disability. The hypothesis is
      that executive functions will respond to the cognitive remediation program and in turn
      enhance locomotion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence indicates that Executive Functions play an important role in maintaining
      locomotion in aging and preventing mobility disabilities. However, use of cognitive training
      programs to improve executive functions as a strategy to increase mobility has not been
      explored. Exciting results from the preliminary study support the efficacy and feasibility of
      the cognitive remediation approach to improve locomotion in older adults.

      The premise of this clinical trial is that disability among seniors is a potentially
      preventable chronic condition rather than an irreversible consequence of aging and disease.
      The investigators proposed novel approach to locomotion has the potential to shift treatment
      paradigms in the field of disability by introducing cognitive approaches to mobility that can
      be applied to prevention and rehabilitation in diverse settings. Through this 'proof of
      concept' secondary prevention trial the investigators will fill an important gap in knowledge
      for practicing evidence-based medicine and developing effective interventions for a major
      health outcome affecting a substantial proportion of the U.S. aging population.

             expectancy less than 12 months.

          5. Presence of progressive, degenerative neurologic disease (e.g., Parkinson's disease or

          6. Hospitalized in the past 6 months for severe illness or surgery that specifically
             affects mobility (e.g. hip or knee replacement) and that prevent subjects from
             completing mobility tests or plans for surgery affecting mobility in the next 6
             months.

          7. Severe auditory or visual loss.

          8. Active psychoses or psychiatric symptoms (such as agitation) noted during the clinic
