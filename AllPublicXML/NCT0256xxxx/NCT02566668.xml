  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to learn more about severe asthma by comparing people with
      severe asthma to those with milder forms of asthma and people without asthma, at baseline and
      over time. Individuals are being asked to join a research study to help understand the
      differences in the lungs and blood of participants with severe asthma compared to those with
      milder asthma and healthy individuals, as well as differences in overall health.
      Investigators also want to determine whether these differences predict asthma-related and
      biologic outcomes over 1 year of follow up.

      This study will obtain human lung samples by bronchoscopy from a range of asthmatics and
      healthy controls to address questions related to the mechanisms for the development of the
      complex immune processes observed in the lungs. Samples will be evaluated for Type-1, Type-2
      and Interleukin-27 (IL-27) expression (and their downstream signatures). In addition, these
      samples will be evaluated for the presence or absence of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) as a counter
      regulatory pathway. These pathways will be directly evaluated in epithelial brushings and
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, as well as BAL fluid. Broad gene expression profiling
      (Ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing) will also be performed to determine the range of
      immune-inflammatory markers present in these severe asthmatics. Investigators will
      specifically address the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) signaling
      pathways, particularly STAT-1 and STAT-3 to determine the pattern of activation and
      downstream responses to develop new therapies. Additionally, in a subset, investigators will
      compare targeted and untargeted gene expression as obtained from bronchoscopic samples with
      expression obtained from clinically performed video assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) biopsies of
      very severe systemic corticosteroid dependent patients. The ultimate goal of this studies is
      to determine whether a predictive biomarker panel can be identified in the less invasive
      bronchoscopic samples which predict the findings seen on VATS biopsy.
