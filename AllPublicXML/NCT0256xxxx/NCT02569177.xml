  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction and subsequent myocardial injury after cardiac surgery occurs in 7-15%
      of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased length of stay,
      and reduced short- and long-term survival. Cardiac troponin is considered to be a cornerstone
      in the diagnosis of a myocardial infarction. Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP)
      is a new sensitive biomarker for myocardial injury. The effectiveness of using the
      combination of H-FABP with Troponin to diagnose myocardial injury within 6 hours after the
      onset of ischemia is well reported. Previous studies in non-surgical patients have associated
      increased H-FABP with an increased risk of subsequent death and major cardiac events. The
      prognostic value in cardiac surgery patients has not been studied extensively.

      The objective is to estimate the association between biomarkers of myocardial injury and
      myocardial infarction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Myocardial infarction will be
      established with both a new and very early marker of myocardial injury (Heart-type Fatty Acid
      Binding Proteins) as well as to a known early marker of such injury (Cardiac troponin).

      Specific aims:

        1. To obtain an estimate of the association between a new very early marker of
           postoperative myocardial injury H-FABP and postoperative myocardial infarction.

        2. To obtain an estimate of the association between cTn-I and postoperative myocardial
           infarction.

        3. To obtain an estimate of the correlation between H-FABP elevation and cTn-I elevation in
           patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      Blood samples will be drawn before incision (baseline), during cardiopulmonary bypass and
      after release of the aortic cross clamp. Subsequently, blood samples will be drawn on arrival
      at the intensive care unit and three and six hours after arrival. On post-operative day 1 and
      2 blood samples will be drawn on the ICU or the medium care. All samples will be stored
      according the hospital blood banking protocol and analyzed at once at the end of the study.
      Left over material will be discarded after all necessary analysis has been conducted.
