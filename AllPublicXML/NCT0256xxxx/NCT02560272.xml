      The study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a haemophilus influenzae type b
      conjugate vaccine (Hib) in Healthy Children 2 Months to 5 Years of Age who have not been
      previously immunized with a Hib vaccine. Children 2 to 5 months of age will receive 3 doses
      of Hib vaccine, Children 6 to 11 months of age will receive 2 doses of Hib vaccine, Children
      1 to 5 years of age will receive 1 dose of Hib vaccine, with each dose given approximately 1
