      This study will assess the effectiveness of MEDIHONEY® sinus rinses (alone or in combination
      with intranasal corticosteroids) vs. intranasal corticosteroid sinus rinses on mucosal
      healing and polyp recurrence in the post-operative period following functional endoscopic
      sinus surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with refractory CRSwNP, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), is intended
      to restore physiologic sinus ventilation and drainage, which can facilitate the gradual
      resolution of mucosal disease. However, because FESS does not directly treat the underlying
      inflammatory disorder, a successful sinus surgery must be followed by medical maintenance
      therapy to control inflammatory processes.

      The current mainstay of treatment of CRSwNP includes antibiotics and topical and systemic
      steroids. There is evidence that administration of systemic steroids in the postoperative
      period for patients who have polyps may have a significant impact on their postoperative
      course. However, the chance of significant side effects increases with the dose and duration
      of treatment and therefore the minimum dose necessary to control the disease should be given.
      Antibiotics also have their limited but documented side effects and can induce resistance.

      A semi-natural product like manuka honey (brand name MEDIHONEY®), with antibacterial and
      anti-inflammatory properties, might prove as a useful alternative since it has no major
      adverse events documented in the literature, does not induce resistance and is effective
      against resistant pathogens common in this patient population.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, pilot clinical trial that will determine if the use
      of MEDIHONEY® sinus rinses (alone or in combination with intranasal steroids) in the
      postoperative period enhances recovery and prevents polyp recurrence in patients after
      functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), compared with the standard regimen of topical
      corticosteroid sinus rinses. The study will collect and compare subjective and objective
      efficacy assessments of both types of rinses.

    <measure>Lund-Kennedy endoscopic scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Characteristics are assessed endoscopically of each sinonasal cavity to provide a score - polyp disease, mucosal edema/crusting/scarring and nasal secretion each receiving a score from 0 to 2. This scoring system has since been the instrument of choice to endoscopically evaluate outcomes of interventions in non-neoplastic sinonasal disease prospectively over time in research and clinical practice. Endoscopy scores from the 3 study groups will be compared for the average percent change between a patient's 6 scores at the 6 different study visits.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SNOT-22 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SNOT-22 consists of 22 questions; items 1 to 12 represent the physical problems associated with rhinosinusitis, items 13 to 18 represent the functional limitations, and items 20 to 22 represent the emotional consequences. Each question is scored by the patient from 0 (no problem) to 5 (the problem is as bad as it can be). The overall score can theoretically range from 0 to 110, with higher scores reflecting more severe quality of life impairment as subjectively reported by the patient. Overall SNOT-22 scores from the 3 study groups will be compared for the average percent change between a patient's 6 scores at the 6 different study visits.</description>
