  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study of the safety and tolerability of PBI-4050
      800 mg daily oral administration in type 2 diabetes patients with metabolic syndrome.

      A total of 12 patients will initially be enrolled for study participation. A Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will continuously review data obtained from the 12 patients. When the
      12 patients have completed at least one month of study treatment, the DSMB will meet and
      determine whether additional patients may be enrolled or the study should be stopped. If the
      safety is deemed acceptable to continue with the study, the study will enroll a maximum of 36
      patients.

      This Phase 2 study will be performed by 1 site in Canada. The total duration of study
      participation for each patient is at least 18 weeks and comprises 6 study visits.

      Patients who choose to participate in the extension study will be in the study for a total of
      up to 32 weeks.
