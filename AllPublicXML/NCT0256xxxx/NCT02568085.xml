      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Arista
      hemostatic matrix powder (Arista® AH, C. R. Bard, Inc. Davol, Warwick, RI) in reducing
      drainage output after total thyroidectomy with and without lateral neck dissections.
      Increased drainage in total thyroidectomy and neck dissection wound beds can lead to seroma
      formation with possible secondary infection, delayed hospital discharge, and additional home
      care needs for drain care. Arista is an inert plant based absorbable surgical hemostatic
      powder that can be easily applied to broad surgical fields to reduce bleeding and seroma
      rates. Therefore, its application to thyroidectomy and neck dissection wound beds may bear
      significant potential benefit.

      Specific Aim 1: The main hypothesis of the study is that the use of Arista in total
      thyroidectomy with and without lateral neck dissections prior to closure will reduce
      postoperative drain outputs and time to drain removal compared to total thyroidectomy with
      and without lateral neck dissection closed without Arista.

      Specific Aim 2: This study will also evaluate the secondary hypotheses that Arista will
      reduce postoperative hematoma and seroma rates and hospital length of stay in total
      thyroidectomies with and without lateral neck dissections.

      INTRODUCTION

      Total thyroidectomy is an increasingly common procedure performed where the entire thyroid
      gland is removed for either benign or malignant disease. Common indications include
      multinodular goiter, Graves disease, and thyroid carcinoma. Between 2006 and 2011 the number
      of total thyroidectomies performed in the United States increased by 12% per year, from
      45,558 to 72,344 according the to the American Cancer Society.1-2 In 2011 48,000 total
      thyroidectomies were performed for malignant disease which often requires additional lateral
      neck dissection.2

      Although patients do very well after total thyroidectomy with over 90% 5-year survival for
      patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, total thyroidectomy with and without
      lateral neck dissection still carries the potential for serious complications including neck
      hematomas or seromas. Postoperative fluid collections continue to be problematic after
      thyroidectomy with or without lateral neck dissection with hematoma rates of 1-3% and seroma
      rates of 4-7%. 3-5 In order to try and reduce the rate of hematomas and seromas after total
      thyroidectomy with or without lateral neck dissection, the majority of surgeons place closed
      suction drains (CSDs) in the wound prior to closure. Surgeons generally use drains in an
      attempt to identify, reduce, and or prevent hematomas and seromas even though there is little
      evidence to support this practice.3-5

      At this institution, it is common practice to place single drain in the thyroid bed and
      another drain in the neck of a lateral neck dissection is preformed and only remove drains
      once the output is less than 30ml over a 24-hour period or 15ml over a 12-hour period with a
      downward trend. Meeting this output volume criterion often takes several days. Often, a
      patient will be given the decision to be discharged home with a drain or wait and continue
      inpatient hospitalization until drain output requirements are met. Prolonged drain can lead
      to increased infection risks and unnecessary hospital stay. According the Healthcare Cost and
      Utilization Project, an average inpatient hospitalization in 2009 cost $2,000 per day, and is
      increasing6. The reduction of an average of just one hospital day per thyroidectomy patient
      could potential save $144,688,000 dollars a year. An evaluation of Arista use on reducing
      drain output may reveal unnecessary expenses related to increased hospital length of stay and
      could lead to significant cost savings. Further, the associated morbidity and health care
      costs of potential seroma or infected seroma complications may be avoided.

      According to the manufacturer, Arista uses Microporous Polysaccharide Hemospheres (MPH)
      technology to catalyze the clotting cascade and effectively dehydrate tissue to initiate
      hemostasis in broad areas. Major advantages of Arista are that it has been shown to be safe
      and effective across multiple surgical disciplines, is completely absorbed in 24-48 hours,
      and contains no human or animal components.7-9

      Sindwani et al. was the first to report effectiveness and safety of Arista as a hemostatic
      agent in otolaryngology demonstrating its application in controlling postoperative bleeding
      after endoscopic sinus surgery.7 Zhang et al. demonstrated success rate of 100% in the
      prevention of seromas in patients undergoing resection of malignant tumors in multiple
      locations, including the lower extremity.8 Arista was recently shown to be useful in reducing
      postoperative chest tube output and hemostasis time in patients undergoing cardiothoracic
      surgery.9

      These previous works support the idea that Arista could be effective in reducing
      postoperative fluid collection and drainage time in free flap donor sites. However, this
      would be a new application of Arista with wide applicability that has not been previously
      described.

      Possible Influence On Clinical Practice

      Total thyroidectomies with and without lateral neck dissections, and surgery in general, have
      evolved in an era of increased attention to quality of life and cost savings. The most
      radical neck dissections are increasingly being replaced by more focused &quot;functional&quot; and
      &quot;selective&quot; neck dissections, during which the spinal accessory nerve, sternocleidomastoid
      muscle, internal jugular vein, and cervical sensory nerves are preserved and a more narrowly
      defined set of lymph node levels are excised, based on oncologic risk profiling. Finding
      Arista can decrease total thyroidectomy with or without lateral neck dissection drain output
      and lead to earlier drain removal could improve the quality of life of patients,
      significantly decrease the cost of care, and potentially decrease drain-associated
      infections.

      This study seeks to critically evaluate current clinical practice paradigms to better
      understand the potential benefit of Arista post thyroidectomy with or without lateral neck
      dissection wound beds. A prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial is the
      clearest methodology to evaluate the possible by limiting bias and confounding variables. No
      clinical trial of this level has been performed on this topic; thus, this proposal is novel
      and the findings of the study are potentially important.

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS

      Patient Population and Enrollment

      All adult patients (18 years old and over) undergoing total thyroidectomy with or without
      lateral neck dissection by one of two Head and Neck Surgery faculty members at UCSF will be
      included in enrollment for the study and consecutively registered.

      Exclusion criteria will consist of patient age under 18, requirement of postoperative
      anticoagulant medications other than routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis (such as
      warfarin), and presence of clotting or bleeding disorder.

      Approval from the intuitional review board (IRB) will be required prior to initiation of
      enrollment. Patients eligible for inclusion in the IRB approved study will be approached for
      study enrollment. Written consent will be discussed with the patient by the approved study
      investigators and/or research assistants. Further details are provided below (Section 3.0
      Patient Selection).

      Study Protocols and Surgical Description

      If successfully enrolled to the study, a randomized packet containing the patient's research
      ID number will be pulled and included into the patient's chart. Randomization will be done at
      the initiation of the study by creating a randomization list with blocking and stratification
      by surgeon. An envelope containing the patients randomized group assignment will not be
      opened until the end of the procedure just prior to closure.

      The patients will be randomized to one of four groups. Groups 1 and 2 will consist of
      patients undergoing total thyroidectomy with possible central neck dissection but not lateral
      neck dissection. Patients in Group 1 will have 3 grams of Arista applied diffusely to the
      wound bed before primary closure. Patients in Group 2 will not have any Arista applied. Per
      routine, patients in both groups will have a single 10 French Jackson-Pratt drain will be
      placed within the thyroid bed and removed per a standardized protocol.

      Groups 3 and 4 will consist of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy with lateral neck
      dissection. Patients in Group 3 will have 3 grams of Arista applied diffusely to the thyroid
      and neck wound bed before primary closure. Patients in Group 4 will not have any Arista
      applied. All incisions will be closed in 3 layers with 3-0 vicryl, 4-0 monocryl, and 5-0 fast
      absorbing sutures. All patients will receive standardized postoperative orders including
      inpatient antibiotics not to exceed 24hrs (unless an infection is suspected) and DVT
      prophylaxis; either weight based subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin.

      The drain will only be removed once output is less than 30ml per 24hr or 15ml per 12hr with
      downward trend. All patients will receive similar postoperative instructions including wound
      care, with and without drain. If the patient requires the drain to remain at time of
      discharge, the patient is fully instructed on drain care, emptying, and recording. The
      patient is then seen in the outpatient clinic, typically at approximately 7 after the
      surgery, the drain is removed regardless of output.

      A standardized physical exam will be performed on all patients every day of inpatient stay by
      the chief resident and on postoperative appointment (5-8 days post-operatively) by the
      attending surgeon to evaluate for clinical evidence of seroma and hematomas.

      Physical exam will specifically include:

        1. Inspect and palpate for presence fluctuance.

        2. Inspect for color change, erythema or ecchymosis

        3. Palpate for tenderness

      All patients will be given a patient satisfaction questionnaire at their first postoperative
      visit to evaluate their overall satisfaction with their hospital stay, their recovery and
      healing of their wound, their comfort with home care, and level of pain. The validated
      questionnaire, the measurement of quality of recovery (QoR-40), will be used. See outline of
      Study Schema below in Figure 1.

      Primary Endpoints and Outcomes

      The primary outcome analyzed in this study will be total drain output (mL) in an effort to
      determine if the addition of Arista to the wound bed decreases overall wound drainage and
      drain output. Given that drain output influences time of drain removal, assessment will be
      made to determine if timing of drain removal differs between groups.

      Secondary Endpoints

      Secondary outcomes will allow for a robust analysis and will include:

        1. Development of hematoma.

        2. Development of seroma.

        3. Requirement of patient to be discharged with drain.

        4. Hospital length of stay.

        5. Need for any additional procedures secondary wound complications.

        6. The quantitative outcome from the patient satisfaction questionnaire
