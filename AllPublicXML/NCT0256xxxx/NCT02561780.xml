      This study examines the effectiveness of a school based mental health literacy intervention
      for high school students, on improving mental health knowledge and reducing stigma.
      Twenty-four high schools in the regional area of Ottawa, Canada were randomly assigned to
      either the curriculum or control condition at a two to one ratio. The educational curriculum
      was integrated within grade 11 and 12 Provincial &quot;Healthy Living&quot; courses, delivered by
      teachers, and replaced existing educational content on mental health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited evidence and consensus on the effectiveness of school-based mental health
      educational programs, and no standardization for mental health education being taught in
      schools. This study examines the effectiveness of a school-based mental health literacy
      intervention for adolescents, on knowledge and stigma. A secondary objective was to determine
      the generalizability and applicability of an educational resource for mental health in high
      schools.

    <description>The curriculum is a mental health literacy resource designed to inform high school curricula and contains six distinct modules: 1) stigma of mental illness; 2) understanding mental health and mental illness; 3) information on specific mental illnesses; 4) experiences of mental illness; 5) seeking help and finding support; and 6) the importance of positive mental health.
A research assistant trained teachers on The Curriculum Guide content in a half-day session. Teachers implemented The Curriculum Guide, which requires approximately 6 hours of classroom time, during regular instruction of the Healthy Living course.</description>
