  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disease and the pathogenesis of this disease
      includes central and peripheral mechanisms. In recent years, there were many studies
      suggesting that microbiota in the intestine may play an important role in the IBS.What's
      more, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may be an important pathogenic factor for
      IBS and the use of antibiotics may be beneficial. Therefore, the investigators intend to
      explore the efficacy of rifaximin for IBS-D in Chinese population.

    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that a shift in the host-gut microbial relationship as seen in small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBS.Overgrowth
      of microbiota in the small intestine can cause excessive gas production and malabsorption
      with a variety of nonspecific symptoms, such as diarrhea, gas bloating, abdominal pain and
      constipation.Glucose (GBT) and lactulose (LBT) breath test have been proposed as simple,
      inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tools for detecting SIBO with respect to the gold
      standard (the culture of intestinal aspirates). Many antibiotics have been proposed in the
      last years for SIBO eradication.Rifaximin is a rifamycin derivative with antibacterial
      activity caused by inhibition of bacterial synthesis of RNA and which is effective against
      both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including aerobes and anaerobes.As &lt;0.1% of its
      oral dose is absorbed, rifaximin administration is associated to a very low side-effect
      incidence. However,there are still no effective and reliable treatment for IBS,so we intend
      to explore the prevalence of SIBO in IBS-D patients and evaluate the efficacy of rifaximin
      for IBS-D in Chinese population.

        A total of 40 cases of LHBT positive and 20 cases of LHBT negative IBS-D patients will be
        included in this study. The estimate of the LHBT positive rate was 40%, so we need to
        screen about 100 IBS-D patients. We are going to recruit 120 IBS-D patients in our center
        with respect to patients lost to follow up.
