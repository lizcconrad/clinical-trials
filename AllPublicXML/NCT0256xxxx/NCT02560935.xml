      The overall goal of this proposal is to conduct a partial double-blind randomized Phase III
      clinical trial for primary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in
      sub-Saharan Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strokes in sickle cell anemia (SCA), particularly in children living in Africa, are
      associated with significant morbidity and an increased risk of premature death. In the US,
      primary stroke prevention in children with SCA involves screening for elevated transcranial
      Doppler ultrasound (TCD) velocity coupled with regular blood transfusion therapy for those
      with elevated velocities. However, regular blood transfusion therapy is not feasible in
      Africa due to inadequate supply of safe blood and the reluctance of parents to accept regular
      blood transfusion therapy for their children. Promising preliminary data from our feasibility
      trial in Kano, Nigeria (1R21NS080639-NCE, NCT01801423; October 2012 - August 2014) support
      the potential use of moderate dose hydroxyurea (HU) therapy of 20 mg/kg/day for primary
      prevention of stroke in children with SCA. In the feasibility trial, we screened 331
      participants; 92% (25 of 27) of participants with elevated TCD measurements elected to enroll
      and receive HU therapy. About 75% (210 of 280) of the screened participants with non-elevated
      TCD measurements agreed to be followed for a minimum of three years to assess the background
      rate of morbidity and mortality. Among those on HU therapy, 80% (20 of 25) of the
      participants who reached their third month on HU therapy dropped their elevated TCD value to
      below 200 cm/sec in both middle cerebral arteries. Based on the results from the recently
      completed Transcranial Doppler (TCD) With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea trial
      (NCT01425307), demonstrating that children with an elevated TCD measurement can be switched
      to HU therapy after one year of blood transfusion, coupled with our preliminary trial results
      indicating a decrease in TCD velocities in 2/3rds of the participants over 3 months, we
      propose a three center randomized partial double-blind Phase III clinical trial
      (1R01NS094041-01; September 2015 - July 2020) to test the following hypothesis: There will be
      a 66% relative risk reduction of primary strokes in children with SCA, and elevated TCD
      measurements (n=220), randomly allocated to moderate dose vs. low dose HU therapy (10 vs. 20
      mg/kg/day) for 3 years. The aims of the randomized partial double-blind Phase III clinical
      trial are to: 1) determine the efficacy of moderate vs. low dose HU therapy for primary
      stroke prevention; 2) determine the efficacy of moderate dose HU therapy for decreasing the
      incidence of all cause-hospitalization for any cause (pain, acute chest syndrome, infection,
      or other) when compared to low dose HU therapy; and 3) assess long-term safety of HU therapy
      (mean 6.5 years) in participants from the feasibility trial with an elevated TCD measurement
      (n=25), when compared to children with an initial normal TCD (n= 210, followed for at least 3
      years). In preparation for this application, the teams from Nigeria have received 1 month of
      patient-oriented research training at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. This trial
      will help us to determine whether moderate dose HU therapy can prevent thousands of strokes
      in children at high risk in Africa, while simultaneously helping build research capacity
      among the next cadre of physician scientists in Nigeria.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for initial screening inclusive of CBC:

          1. Patients with hemoglobin SS or SB0 thalassemia, S variant with baseline hemoglobin
             less than 10 g/dL or other sickle cell syndromes apart from SC confirmed by hemoglobin
             electrophoresis, HPLC, or IEF;

          2. Informed consent from a parent or legal guardian and assent of participant ages 5
             through 12 (in best estimate pre-puberty, if no date of birth is documented, a
             frequent event in this region of Nigeria, then we will use the pediatricians best
             estimate and the patient must be pre-pubertal);

          3. Patient must be 5 through 12 years of age (i.e., must have attained their 5th but not
             their 13th birthday when the consent and assent is signed, or best estimate based on
             absence of documentation. For such patients we will use July 1st of the postulated
             birth year as their birth date).

        Inclusion criteria for continuance of study screening to determine eligibility for study
        therapy:

        1. Hemoglobin greater than 6.0 g/dL based on initial CBC completed after study consent was
        obtained for screening, before neurological evaluation and TCD measurement are done.
        Participants will continue study screening with neurological evaluation and if no evidence
        of stroke, a TCD will be completed.

        Exclusion Criteria for screening:

          1. Prior overt stroke (a focal neurological deficit of acute onset) by history, focal
             neurological deficit on standardized neurological examination, or concern for moderate
             or severe neurological deficit (which could be due to stroke) based on a positive &quot;10
             questions&quot; screening (an established tool in resource poor countries).1,2 A &quot;positive&quot;
             screening is defined as answering yes to any one of the 10 questions. The negative
             predictive value (child does not have moderate or several neurological impairment) of
             the &quot;10 questions&quot; is greater than 94% in children;1

          2. Other exclusions: significant cytopenias [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1.5 X
             109/L, /µl, platelets &lt;150,000/µl, reticulocytes &lt;80,000/µl, unless Hb is &gt; 9 g/dl],
             renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 0.8 mg/dl);

          3. Patients for whom are currently receiving hydroxyurea therapy or under consideration
             prior to study consent/education;

          4. Patients who have previously been treated with hydroxyurea and are being considered to
             restart hydroxyurea therapy;

          5. Other chronic comorbid disease other than asthma;

          6. History of seizures or diagnosis of epilepsy;

          7. Any other condition illness, which in the opinion of the site's Principal Investigator
             (PI) makes participation ill-advised or unsafe;

          8. Participants of child bearing age who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not
             take hydroxyurea. If a participant becomes pregnant during the study, their
             hydroxyurea therapy will be stopped immediately. The onsite will notify the
             Coordinating Center and the principal investigators of the case. The site principal
             investigator and study principal investigators will determine what therapy the
             participant should receive during pregnancy that is of standard care;

          9. Hemoglobin less than 6.0 g/dL based on initial CBC completed after study consent was
             obtained for screening, before TCD measurement is done. These patients will be
             excluded because of evidence that TCD is correlated with anemia. Children with very
             low hemoglobin levels less than 6.0 g/dL are likely to have nutritional deficiency
             most likely iron that can be corrected with supplementation.

        Inclusion Criteria for participants that are not eligible to receive hydroxyurea therapy,
        but willing to be followed for a minimum of three years in the non-elevated TCD group:

          1. Successful completion of screening procedures inclusive of cerebral blood flow
             velocity less than or equal to 199 cm/sec in the terminal portion of internal carotid,
             middle cerebral artery, or both vessels;

          2. Informed consent from a parent or legal guardian and assent from the participant;

          3. Acceptance to be followed for a minimum of three years in the study. Hydroxyurea may
             be given for other reasons as part of the participant's ongoing care, but it will not
             be given as part of the study (SPRING Trial), unless annual TCD reading meets criteria
             of an elevated TCD measurement based on eligibility criteria for study therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria for participants that will be randomized to hydroxyurea therapy for 36
        months:

          1. Successful completion of screening procedures inclusive of cerebral blood flow
             velocity greater than or equal to 200 cm/sec measured twice or at least one
             measurement greater than or equal to 220 cm/sec in the middle cerebral artery,
             internal carotid, or both vessels with non-imaging or imaging technique and greater
             than or equal to 180 cm/sec in the middle cerebral artery with non-imaging or imaging
             technique performed by two study personnel;

             If the participant has elevated TCD levels (greater than or equal to 200 cm/sec on two
             consecutive measurements or a single measurement greater than or equal to 220 cm/sec),
             they will be offered blood transfusion first, as standard care at the clinical site.
             If the participant and family elect not to receive blood transfusions, they will be
             invited to participate in the study.

          2. Informed consent from a parent or legal guardian for study therapy and assent of the
             participant completed;

          3. Participant is able to swallow a capsule, as observed by study personnel;

          4. Acceptance of hydroxyurea therapy for at least three years. At 36 months, a decision
             between the family and provider can be made whether to continue with hydroxyurea
             therapy until the end of the study (7/31/2020). If the study is terminated early,
             families will be informed of optimal dose and given the option to continue hydroxyurea
             therapy until 7/31/2020. The provisions of hydroxyurea will be continued to assess the
             toxicity of the study medication among study groups.

        Exclusion criteria for study therapy and non-elevated TCD group:

        1. Unable to commit to follow up visits for the duration of the study.
