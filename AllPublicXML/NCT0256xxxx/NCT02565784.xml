    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects intent to undergo facial filler treatment for either volume loss or
             contouring

          -  Subjects requiring treatment in two to four of pre-defined areas in the face (upper
             cheeks, nasolabial folds, temples, nose and chin)

          -  Require 3-5 ml of investigational products to achieve a clinically meaningful
             improvement in appearance

          -  Facial appearance as Han Chinese

          -  Non-pregnant, non-breast feeding female

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous facial surgery (e.g. rhinoplasty) or permanent implant in the area to be
             treated.

          -  History of chronic sinusitis or rhinitis (only applicable for subjects injected in the
             nose).

          -  Subjects who needs to use heavy glasses during the study (only applicable for subjects
             injected in the nose).

          -  Previous tissue augmenting therapy or contouring with permanent filler or fat
             injection in the facial area.

          -  Previous treatment with Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers or Restylane Skinboosters in the
             facial area within 12 months before treatment.

          -  Previous treatment with non-HA fillers such as CaHA (Calcium Hydroxylapatite) or PLLA
             (Poly L-Lactic Acid) within 24 months before treatment.

          -  Previous revitalization with neurotoxin in the facial area within six (6) months
             before treatment.

          -  Previous tissue revitalization treatment with laser or light, mesotherapy, chemical
             peeling or dermabrasion in the facial area within six (6) months before treatment.

          -  Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject
             unsuitable for inclusion (e.g. a chronic, relapsing or hereditary disease that may
             interfere with the outcome of the study).
