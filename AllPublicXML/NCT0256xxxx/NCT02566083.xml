        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Minimum 22 years of age

          -  Bilateral cataracts

          -  Preoperative keratometric cylinder in both eyes

          -  Most appropriate toric IOL model choice (ZCT300 or ZCT400)

          -  Predicted residual refractive cylinder, based on the AMO Toric IOL Calculator, must
             be:

             ≤ 0.69 D for a ZCT300 IOL or ≤ 0.88 D for a ZCT400 IOL

          -  Clear intraocular media other than cataract in each eye

          -  Availability, willingness, ability and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures and study visits

          -  Ability to understand, read and write English in order to consent to study
             participation and complete a study questionnaire

          -  Signed informed consent and HIPAA authorization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Irregular corneal astigmatism

          -  Any corneal pathology/abnormality other than regular corneal astigmatism

          -  Previous corneal surgery

          -  Recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery that is not resolved/stable or may affect
             visual outcomes

          -  Any pupil abnormalities

          -  Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture, including
             capsular or zonular abnormalities that may lead to IOL decentration, including
             pseudoexfoliation, trauma, or posterior capsule defects

          -  Known ocular disease or pathology that may affect visual acuity or that may require
             surgical intervention during the course of the study

          -  Concurrent participation or participation during 30 days prior to preoperative visit
             in any other clinical study

          -  Planned monovision correction

          -  Patient is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, is lactating or has another condition
             associated with the fluctuation of hormones that could lead to refractive changes
