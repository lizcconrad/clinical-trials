  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose

      Common mental disorders (CMD:s) are the leading cause of sick-leave spells in Sweden,
      resulting in suffering for the individual and financial costs for the employer as well as for
      society at large. Studies on interventions that address stress and mental ill-health and that
      focus on sick leave and return to work (RTW) show little or no effect of commonly used
      methods such as medication or psychological approaches. Furthermore, these interventions
      often focus on the individual's symptoms without considering their work situation. The
      occupational health services (OHS) has knowledge of the employee's work environment and can
      offer treatment facilitating the employee's RTW and improving the employee's work ability
      while taking into account both the individual and the work situation. The intervention in the
      current study will be performed at the OHS.

      The study aim is two-fold: first, an intervention that addresses both individual and
      workplace related aspects among employees with work-related CMD:s and/or stress related
      symptoms will be evaluated. In particular, the treatment's cost-effectiveness and impact on
      sick leave and mental health will be studied. Secondly, the concerned OHS staff's adherence
      to the intended treatment and associations with the outcome of the intervention will be
      assessed.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Problem-solving based intervention with a participative approach. During the intervention a systematic assessment of the match between the employee and the work environment is considered. The intervention applies a participatory approach where the supervisor and the employee are guided by the OHS consultant and encouraged to actively take part in problem solving concerning the work situation. The intervention consists of three meetings, one between the OHS consultant and a representative for the employer (usually the nearest supervisor), one between the consultant and the employee and then a third meeting where all three parties participate.</description>

    <description>The control intervention consists of the usual interventions given at the participating OHS. These interventions are also work-directed and usually also include participation of both the employee and the supervisor. However, structured problem solving methods and the systematic consideration of the match between the employee and the job situation are not applied. The content of the control condition will vary between different occupational health service units.</description>
