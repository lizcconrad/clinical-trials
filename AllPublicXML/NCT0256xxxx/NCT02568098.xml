      Primary Objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of co-administered single dose
           Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHA-PQP), Ivermectin (IVM), Primaquine (PQ), and
           Albendazole (ABZ) in healthy subjects.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize the potential pharmacokinetic interactions between DHA-PQP, IVM, PQ, and
           ABZ in healthy adult subjects.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of PQ (and its major metabolite),
           DHA-PQP, IVM, and ABZ (and its major metabolite) when given alone and in combination.

        -  To investigate pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting drug levels of PQ, DHA-PQP, IVM,
           ABZ and their metabolites.

        -  To determine mosquito lethal efficacy of IVM, PQ, ABZ, and DHA-PQP combinations against
           Anopheles dirus and Anopheles minimus.

        -  To determine if IVM concentrations in venous blood differs from capillary blood.

      This is an open-label, sequential pharmacokinetic study in 16 healthy glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal Thai subjects. These 16 subjects have previously participated in
      either study:

        1. Open-Label Study to Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Orally
           Administered Primaquine (PQ) and Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHA-PQP) in Healthy
           Adult Subjects (TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)) or study

        2. Comparison of the electrocardiographic effects in relation to Pharmacokinetic profile of
           chloroquine (CQ) and piperaquine (PQ) in healthy Thai subjects (TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref.
           39-14)) or

        3. subjects who not previously participated in study &quot;TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)&quot; and
           study &quot;TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14)&quot;.

      The study team will use the results of DHA-PQP regimen of the subjects from the above
      mentioned studies to compare with combination regimens in this study. This is to avoid
      unnecessary exposure of Subjects from (TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)) and (TMEC 14-022
      (OxTREC ref. 39-14)) to the subjects. In addition, subjects have previously been tested for
      G6PD deficiency during screening process from the above mentioned study with result showed as
      normal. Therefore, a G6PD deficiency test is not needed. A G6PD deficiency test is needed for
      subjects who not previously participated in study subjects who not previously participated in
      study &quot;TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)&quot; and study &quot;TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14)&quot; for this
      study.

      Subjects will be admitted in the inpatient ward to receive single dose of 6 regimens
      (regimens 1-4 and 8-9) described below. Every subject will have at least 6 admissions in the
      hospital.

      1: IVM (400 μg/kg) via 6 mg tabs, w-o** &gt;4wks; 2: IVM (400 μg/kg)+PQ (15 mg): 2 tabs), w-o
      &gt;4wks; 3: IVM (400 μg/kg)+DHA-PQP (40mg/320 mg): 3 tabs), w-o &gt;8wks; 4: IVM (400
      μg/kg)+DHA-PQP+PQ, w-o &gt;8wks; 5*#: PQ (15 mg): 2 tabs, w-o &gt; 2wks; 6#: DHA-PQP (40mg/320 mg):
      3 tabs, w-o &gt;8wks; 7*#: DHA-PQP (40mg/320 mg): 3 tabs +PQ (15 mg): 2 tabs, w-o &gt;8wks; 8: ABZ
      (200 mg) 2 tabs, w-o &gt;2wks; 9: IVM (400 μg/kg)+DHA-PQP (40mg/320 mg): 3 tabs+PQ (15 mg): 2
      tabs +ABZ (400 mg): 1 tab, w-o &gt;8wks

      * The subjects from TMEC-14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14) will have two additional admissions to
      receive two additional regimen PQ, and DHA-PQP with PQ

      # Subjects who not previously participated in study &quot;TMEC 12-004 (OxTREC ref. 58-11)&quot; and
      study &quot;TMEC 14-022 (OxTREC ref. 39-14)&quot; will have three additional admissions to receive
      three additional regimens PQ, DHA-PQP, and DHA-PQP with PQ.

          5. A creatinine clearance (CLcr) &lt;70 mL/min as determined by Cockcroft-Gault equation:

             CLcr (mL/min) = (140 - age) * Wt / (72 * Scr) (multiply answer by 0.85 for females)
             Where age is in years, weight (wt) is in kg, and serum creatinine (Scr) is in units of

             Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 times
             the drug half-life (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication
             until the completion of the follow-up procedure, unless in the opinion of
             investigator, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety; the investigator will take advice from the manufacturer
             representative as necessary.

          8. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study
             medication.

          9. The subject is unwilling to abstain from ingesting alcohol within 48 hours prior to
             the first dose of study medication until collection of the final pharmacokinetic
             sample during each regimen.

         10. Subjects who have donated blood to the extent that participation in the study would
             result in more than 300 mL blood donated within a 30-day period. Plasma donation

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates participation in the trial. In addition, if heparin is used during
             pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

         12. Lack of suitability for participation in this study, including but not limited to,
             unstable medical conditions, systemic disease manifested by tendency to
             granulocytopenia e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus that in the opinion
             of the investigator would compromise their participation in the trial.

             normal (ULN)

         17. Subject who received quinacrine in last 30 days.

         18. The subject is unwilling to abstain from the consumption of vitamin C 24 hours before
             and after drug ingestion.

             does not have Loa loa infection.

         20. G6PD deficient detected by Beutler's dye test.
