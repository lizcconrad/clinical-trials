  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dosage errors are common in the stressful situation of a pediatric resuscitation. In addition
      to that, studies have reported that delays to provide medication is associated to worst
      survival rate for very sick children. To minimize delays and error, the investigators
      recently published a resuscitation handbook who provides drug dosages for each weight for
      children thus eliminating the need for dosage calculation. Once the weight of the patient is
      known, the physicians only have to open the book at the page corresponding to the weight and
      all the medications with their calculated dosage are provided. The primary goal of this study
      is to evaluate the number of dosage error during simulated pediatric resuscitation comparing
      residents using the handbook vs. utilisation of a chart providing non-calculated dosage. This
      will be an experimental crossover trial among 40 residents performing four simulated
      case-scenarios in a high-fidelity simulation lab.
