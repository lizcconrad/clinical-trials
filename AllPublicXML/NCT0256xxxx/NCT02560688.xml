  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to test the hypothesis that coadministration of clopidogrel
      with DS-1040b will be safe and well tolerated. Subjects entering the study will initially
      receive a single 12 hour infusion of DS-1040b, to generate data on the effect of DS-1040b
      alone. After a wash-out period (to ensure that no DS-1040b is left in the blood) subjects
      will receive repeated clopidogrel doses over 5 days to generate data on the effect of
      clopidogrel alone. On the sixth day subjects will receive both DS-1040b and clopidogrel, and
      the effects will be compared to when the two treatments were given alone.
