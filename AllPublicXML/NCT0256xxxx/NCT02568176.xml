  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the induction potential of repeated
      administration of intranasal esketamine on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2B6 activity in
      healthy participants using orally administered midazolam and bupropion as probes,
      respectively and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of esketamine after a single dose and
      repeated administration.

      This is a parallel group, single-center, repeat-dose, fixed-sequence, open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), study. The effects of repeated administration of
      intranasal esketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and bupropion will be evaluated in
      Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. Participants in Cohort 1 will receive a single oral dose
      of midazolam in the morning of Day 1 and Day 17. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive a
      single oral dose of bupropion in the morning of Day 1 and Day 19. In Cohort 1 and 2
      participants will self-administer 5 doses of intranasal esketamine over a 15-day period. The
      duration of study, from the Screening Phase through Follow-up, is up to 51 days and 54 days
      for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. Blood samples for participants in Cohort 1 will be
      collected for up to 24 hours after dosing on Days 1 and 17 (midazolam) and for up to 24 hours
      on Days 2 and 16 (esketamine); For participants in Cohort 2, blood and urine samples for
      assessment of bupropion pharmacokinetics will be collected for up to 72 hours after dosing on
      Day 1 and Day 19. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
