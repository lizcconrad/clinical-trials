    <description>Participants will be enrolled sequentially in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design to receive escalating dose of ENTO + VCR at dose levels 1 to 4 with the objective of defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose for the dose expansion stage. Following the determination of the MTD of the dose levels 1 to 4 (or concurrently with the opening of dose level 4), the safety of administering ENTO with VCR when administered as a 4-day prolonged continuous infusion may be evaluated in the continuous infusion dose escalation level (dose level C1) with the objective of investigating the schedule of dosing ENTO when administered with VCR as a continuous infusion</description>
