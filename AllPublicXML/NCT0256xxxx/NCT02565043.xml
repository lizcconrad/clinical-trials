  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is looking at the clinical efficacy, functionality and device performance of a new
      Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) system in the management of a variety of wound types,
      in a real-life clinical setting. The study will comprise a prospective, open-labeled,
      multi-center study in a number of care-settings (both hospital and community) in South
      Africa. The patient's reference wound will be randomized to treatment with either
      intermittent or continuous NPWT mode to assess whether the delivery of NPWT via each of these
      therapy settings will have an effect on the rate and quality of wound healing.

      The study will comprise a prospective, open-labeled, multi-center study to assess the
      clinical efficacy, functionality and device performance of the new portable negative pressure
      wound therapy system in the management of acute, sub-acute and chronic wounds.

      The patient's reference wound will be randomized to treatment with either intermittent or
      continuous NPWT mode to ensure minimum numbers in each group for analysis.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the time (days) to achieve the point where
      the reference wound is ready to be closed either by surgical intervention (STSG, simple flap
      or suturing) or by secondary intention.
