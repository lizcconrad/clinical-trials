  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America. The aim of the trial is to
      investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the
      body) for single doses and multiple doses of NNC0165-1562 in overweight to obese but
      otherwise healthy subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part I (SD):

          -  Male, aged 18-55 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 34.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive). Overweight should
             be due to excess of adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator

          -  Considered to be generally healthy based on the medical history, physical examination,
             and the results of vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
             performed during the screening visit, as judged by the investigator

          -  Part II (MD):

          -  Male or female, aged 18-55 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed
             consent

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 27.0 and 39.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive). Overweight should
             be due to excess of adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator

          -  Considered to be generally healthy based on the medical history, physical examination,
             and the results of vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
             performed during the screening visit, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant weight change (at least 5% self-reported change during the
             previous 3 months), dieting attempts (e.g. participation in an organised weight
             reduction programme within the last 3 months), prior obesity surgery, or medications
             affecting body weight within 3 months prior to screening

          -  Male subjects who are not surgically sterilised (vasectomy) and are sexually active
             with female partner(s) who are not using a highly effective method of contraception
             (such as condom with spermicide) combined with a highly effective method of
             contraception for their non-pregnant female partner(s) (Pearl Index 1%, such as
             implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, diaphragm or
             cervical cap+spermicide), and/or intend to donate sperm in the period from screening
             until 3 months following administration of the investigational medical product

          -  Female subjects who are of child bearing potential (pre-menopausal and not surgically
             sterilised) and are sexually active with male partner(s) who are not surgically
             sterilised (vasectomy) and are not using highly effective contraceptive methods (Pearl
             Index 1%,such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm or cervical cap+spermicide) combined with a highly effective method of
             contraception for their male partner(s) (e.g. condom with spermicide), and/or are
             pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant) (applicable to Part II (MD)
             only)
