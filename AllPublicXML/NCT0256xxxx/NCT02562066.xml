  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, controlled, outpatient two-period, two-treatment crossover
      study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amifampridine phosphate in patients
      (ages 2 and above) diagnosed with certain genetic subtypes of CMS and demonstrated open label
      (amifampridine phosphate) or history of sustained amifampridine benefit from treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will participate in an open-label unblinded drug escalation/treatment run-in
      phase for up to 4 weeks until stable dose and frequency of amifampridine phosphate is
      achieved for 7 days. After this phase, blinded treatment effect will be assessed in a
      randomized fashion of continuation or cessation of drug (Placebo) starting with Period I
      (duration 7 days). Following experimental Period 1, patients will be returned to the stable
      dose administered at the end of the open-label run-in period for approximately 2 weeks,
      followed by cross over treatment in Period 2 dosing for 7 days. After completion of Period 2,
      patients will be eligible for expanded access with restoration of open-label amifampridine
      phosphate at the same dose and frequency as established in the run in phase of the study.

    <description>Each patient will participate in an open-label unblinded drug escalation/treatment run-in phase for up to 4 weeks until stable dose and frequency of amifampridine phosphate is achieved for 7 days. After this phase, half of the subjects will be randomized to receive amifampridine in Period I and then crossed over to receive placebo in Period II. Each randomized treatment period is 7 days in duration and is separated by a re-stabilization period of approximately two weeks where the subject will be returned to the stable dose administered at the end of the open-label run-in period. Dosing will be between 20 - 80 mg per day and frequency will be between 2-4 times per day.</description>
