      To investigate natural killer (NK) cell activities, circulating cytokine levels and
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokine production status in critically ill
      patients.

      Blood samples were collected &lt; 24 hours after admission from 24 intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients and 24 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls. NK cell
      activities, cytokine concentrations and cytokine production by PBMCs and lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-stimulated PBMCs were measured.

        From April 2014 to July 2015, 24 critically ill patients were enrolled in this study after
        admission to the ICU at Yonsei University Severance Hospital. For validation of the
        experimental findings, age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy subjects were enrolled as
        controls among individuals seen at a health evaluation center during the same period.
