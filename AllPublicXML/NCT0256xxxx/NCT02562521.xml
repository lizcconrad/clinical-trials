    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a smoking cessation program for employees at the
      Yale University dining hall. Two pilot dining halls and six paired dining halls (3 test and 3
      control sites) will be offered a contingency management/pharmacotherapy smoking cessation
      intervention at the work site.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test the effect of a smoking cessation intervention
      provided to Yale University dining hall employees on smoking quit rates and quit attempts at
      the end of six weeks of treatment. It is hypothesized that participants from the test site
      will have higher rates of smoking cessation and quit attempts compared to participants from
      the control site. In addition, this study will examine the number of participants who enroll
      in the smoking cessation program who successfully quit smoking at 6 months.

      There will be 3 test sites and 3 control sites in this study (broken down into 3 pairs of
      test/control). Each test site will be matched to on a control site. Self-reported smoking
      status will be obtained for all participants in the test and control sites at 3 time points
      (baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months). The study start time for each pair will be delayed by 4-8
      weeks for feasibility issues.

    <description>The intervention will consist of Contingency management (CM) in conjunction with effective first line pharmacotherapy (dual nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] or varenicline) and brief counseling to rapidly induce cessation and to maintain abstinence long term. Pharmacotherapy will be flexible. Participants will also be given the option of receiving additional behavioral support by being referred to the CT Quitline and using text or mobile phone apps for quitting.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Smoking Quit Attempt in the Prior Six Weeks</title>
        <description>A survey of dining hall employees will be used to determine the proportion of the dining hall employees who made a quit attempt in the prior six weeks in the treatment and delayed treatment control groups. Values present the proportion of dining hall employees who smoke who reported making a quit attempt.</description>

            <title>Smoking Cessation Treatment</title>
            <description>The intervention will consist of Contingency management (CM) in conjunction with effective first line pharmacotherapy (dual nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] or varenicline) and brief counseling to rapidly induce cessation and to maintain abstinence long term. Pharmacotherapy will be flexible. Participants will also be given the option of receiving additional behavioral support by being referred to the CT Quitline and using text or mobile phone apps for quitting.
Contingency management: Participants in the intervention group will receive a tailored intervention that utilizes contingency management in which they receive monetary rewards for reducing or quitting smoking.
Nicotine replacement therapy: Participants have the option of using nicotine patch in combination with nicotine gum or lozenge
Varenicline: Individuals who do not respond initially to Nicotine Replacement Therapy will be offered varenicline as an alternative
Additional behavioral support: Based on interest,</description>

          <description>Smoking cessation is operationally defined as successfully quitting smoking at 6 months measured with TLFB (a standardized, validated, and reliable experimenter-administered rating scale that will be used to obtain quantity and frequency estimates of smoking) and confirmed with expired breath carbon monoxide reading (CO less than or equal to 4 parts per million).</description>
          <population>These analyses are conducted for the subset of dining hall employees who enrolled in the treatment program. Results are combined across the treatment and delayed control groups during the follow-up period because both groups received the same treatment components so we did not differentiate outcomes between arm/group during the follow-up period.</population>
