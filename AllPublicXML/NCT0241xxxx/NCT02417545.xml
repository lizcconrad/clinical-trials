  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the differences in gaze and gait during the stair and ramp
      negotiation (+transition to normal level walking) between healthy controls and vestibular
      patients (fallers and non-fallers).

      For a better understanding of falls in patients with vestibular disorders it might be
      important to identify the challenging environmental that provoke functional deficits; e.g.
      stair or ramp negotiation. The three steps at the ground and at the top of stairs is the most
      common location for missteps and stair accidents. This is supported by the observation made
      in a 12-month prospective study were 32% of the falls happened during the last step going
      down stairs in vestibular patients.

      It remains open if patient's vestibular dysfunctions have a different gaze or gait behavior
      than healthy individuals.

    <description>The recording gait system is a pair of inlay soles with sensors. The sensors sampled the force distribution beneath the subjects' feet. The inlay soles are recording acceleration, rotation rates and magnetic field readings, each in 3 dimensions.</description>

    <measure>Fall Calendar</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>A fall-Calendar with questions will be used to assess falls. These questions will be placed on each page of a 12 month calendar. The &quot;fall calendar&quot; pages also contain questions about the circumstances surrounding falls, including the day time, lighting situation, fall location, activity performed, injuries and whether medical assistance was needed. As soon as possible after the fall the fallers have to fill in the date of the fall, its cause, and fall-related injuries. At the end of each month, a calendar page should be sent by each patient to the investigators.</description>

        The study sample includs patients with vestibular disorder and age matched healthy
        participants. Patients with vestibular disorder will be diagnosed by a pathological
        horizontal head impulse test to both sides (&lt; 0.80), as assessed by using a video-based
        system and the presents of saccades.
