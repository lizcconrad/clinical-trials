  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of children living apart from their fathers has grown nationally, and the greatest
      percentage is evident among African American (AA) families; two-thirds of all African
      American children live in households without their biological father. Research supports the
      importance of positive fathering in the lives of children. But in order for children to
      benefit from their fathers' involvement, the father-child relationship must be timely and
      sustained. This study will test culturally relevant interventions aimed at increasing
      non-resident (not living with the child) AA fathers' involvement with their children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this competing continuation study is to test the efficacy of the core
      9-session BBTF program (held over12-weeks) on: (1) improving father outcomes (psychological
      well-being, relationship quality with the child's mother, parenting competence); (2)
      father-mother relationship quality; (3) father involvement (material support, in-kind
      support, direct father-child interaction); and (4) child outcomes (behavioral, social,
      emotional). The study will use an experimental design and randomly assign 180 AA fathers who
      are not currently involved with the criminal justice system and their 2-5 year old children
      to the BBTF or an attention control condition and assess outcomes at baseline, 12 weeks, and
      24 weeks. Custodial mothers of the children will be recruited to concurrently complete child
      outcome measures, measures of father-mother relationship quality, and father involvement
      measures.

      The specific aims and hypotheses are as follows:

      Aim 1: Test the direct effects of the 9-session BBTF program on: (1) father's outcomes
      (psychological well-being, parenting competence, and communication and problem solving) and
      (2) paternal involvement (material support, in-kind support, and direct father-child
      interaction), controlling for father characteristics (demographics, history of criminal
      justice system involvement, social support) and child characteristics (age, gender).
      Hypothesis 1: BBTF program fathers will report better father outcomes and greater paternal
      involvement than the attention control group at 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

      Aim 2: Test the mediating effects of father-mother relationship and father outcomes on
      paternal involvement across the two conditions. Hypothesis 2: Father-mother relationship
      quality and father outcomes will mediate intervention effects on paternal involvement.

      Aim 3: Compare the effects of the BBTF program, controlling for father outcomes,
      father-mother relationship, and paternal involvement on child outcomes (behavioral,
      emotional/social development) as compared to the attention control group. Hypothesis 3a: BBTF
      children will have improved child outcomes relative to the control group at 12 weeks and 24
      weeks. Hypothesis 3b: Child outcomes will be mediated by improvements in father outcomes,
      paternal involvement and father-mother relationship.

    <description>The Financial Literacy Program (FLP) attention control condition will not receive any information on fatherhood. They will participate in a nine-session financial education program, called &quot;Money Smart,&quot; which has modules that will be facilitated by a group leader that focus on banking, borrowing, checking accounts, money management, saving, establishing and repairing a credit history, using credit cards responsibly and learning about borrowing and home ownership. They will also receive a booster session 6 weeks after the final session that focuses on setting financial goals.</description>

    <description>The Building Bridges to Fatherhood (BBTF) intervention employs the following key features: a collaborative model for working with parents; vignettes of father-child models engaged in situations typical of non-resident fathers with young children for stimulating discussion and problem-solving; group discussion format, which allows fathers to support one another and share ideas on using program principles to fit within the contexts of fatherhood; &quot;homework assignments&quot; that help fathers practice the new skills at home; weekly handouts summarizing the major points discussed each week, which can be shared with others and used to gain greater support from extended family; and a Leader's Manual that standardizes the program across groups and group leaders.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AA biological father of a child 2 to 5 years old

          -  Child lives with father no more than 48 hours per week (e.g., spends the weekends with
             his or her father)

          -  The child lives with the biological mother (or other custodial relative such as
             grandmother) in the metropolitan Chicago area.

          -  These fathers are referred to as AA non-resident fathers. Additional criteria include:
             (1) child's mother is willing to consent to complete the child assessments; - Child's
             mother is amenable to facilitating opportunities for fathers to interact with their
             children in order to practice skills learned in the program

          -  Father is able and willing to travel to one of two intervention sites to attend a
             weekly program.

          -  The study is limited to fathers with a target child aged 2-5 years.

          -  The rationale for this limit is based on the developmental phase when families are
             most vulnerable to decreased father involvement and children are highly dependent on
             parenting for their growth and development.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fathers with histories of child abuse, neglect, or violence perpetuated against the
             child or the child's mother (based on mother or father report).
