    <textblock>
      Diabetic Foot as the popular chronic complications of diabetes, is one of the main factors
      leading to limb amputation, it was reported that the amputation rate is 15 times of the
      non-diabetic patients. Common surgical amputation is not only about high plane amputation but
      also bring a tremendous mental stress to patients which may affect the quality of life
      seriously. Diabetic foot patients facing the great risk of serious infection, endotoxemia ,
      and septic shock which could be the main cause of death before amputation. It become an
      important topic that how to control the infection, reduce the amputation plane, save the
      function as possibility, and improve the life quality of the patients as well.

      This study is based on years of clinical experience of and brings out &quot;early-stage
      amputation&quot; concept firstly in China with a systematic exposition, experimental research and
      clinical research. Early-stage amputation refers to cut in the normal tissue from the
      inflammatory tissue at the junction line of limbs, in order to achieve more retained stump,
      block endotoxin absorption and improve the quality of life of patients. External therapy of
      herbs chitosan can promote granulation tissue regeneration and control of local infection, it
      solved the problem of difficult wound healing and it is a reliable guarantee of early-stage
      amputation.
