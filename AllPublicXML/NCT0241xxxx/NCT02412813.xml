  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, metal hypersensitivity study comparing
      OXINIUM and cobalt chrome femoral components in subjects with failed total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 230 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either an OXINIUM or cobalt
      chrome femoral components as part of their LEGION revision procedure. The objective of this
      study is to assess a lower serum metal ion concentration level in at least one of the three
      major mLTTs (Co, Cr or Ni) over 5 years in subjects receiving OXINIUM versus Cobalt Chrome
      femoral components as part of the LEGION Revision Total Knee System.
