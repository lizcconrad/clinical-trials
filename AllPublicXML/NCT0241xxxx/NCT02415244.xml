      The aim of this prospective observational study is to assess whether transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE) can be used to identify the structures within the vertebral foramen of
      the spinal column and to determine the range of spinal segments which can be visualized.

      The aim of this prospective observational study is to assess whether transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE) can be used to identify the structures within the vertebral foramen of
      the spinal column and to determine the range of spinal segments which can be visualized. Data
      will be collected from both pediatric and adult patients undergoing cardiothoracic and
      interventional cardiac surgeries under general anesthesia. Because use of TEE is a standard
      surgical procedure and because TEE will already be in place to visualize the heart, no
      additional processes will be required to collect data, minimizing patient risk. TEE will be
      monitored and controlled by a trained anesthesiologist or TEE technician and visualization of
      the spinal cord will be confirmed. Real-time TEE images will then be captured and later
      graded by a trained sonographer as high, medium or low quality. Starting at the level of the
      tracheal bifurcation, corresponding to thoracic vertebral level T5 (Mirajalili 2012), the TEE
      probe will be advanced cranially to determine the spinal levels visualized above T5 and
      caudally in order to determine the spinal levels below T5 that can be seen on TEE. At each
      level seen on TEE, pictures will be taken for confirmation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients scheduled for cardiothoracic or interventional cardiac surgeries under
             general anesthesia

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will exclude any patients with known esophageal abnormalities, lesions or disease
             that would disqualify the patient for the use of TEE as standard procedure.

          -  We will also exclude any patients that come to the catheter laboratory exclusively for
             TEE exam as our study will only occur in patients already scheduled to undergo TEE use
             in surgery or diagnostic procedure.
