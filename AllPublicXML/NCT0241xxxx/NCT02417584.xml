      The aim of the study was to determine the long term effects of compliance with positive
      airway pressure therapy on blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive patients with
      obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Scientific data about the causal role of obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS)
      in the development of systemic hypertension and the effects of positive airway pressure (PAP)
      treatment on blood pressure (BP) control are continuously increasing; however they are
      controversial. We aimed to determine the long term effects of compliance with PAP therapy on
      BP in both hypertensive and normotensive patients with OSAHS.
