  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some individuals smoke with the perception that smoking helps control body weight. Smokers
      gain an average of as much as 10 pounds in the months following smoking abstinence, with
      heavier and more-dependent smokers gaining more weight. T The Mayo Clinic Nicotine Research
      Program will randomize 100 nondiabetic, overweight or obese adult smokers to active
      lorcaserin or placebo for 24 weeks; all of the subjects will receive open-label varenicline
      for 12 weeks. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a 24-week course of
      lorcaserin for decreasing weight gain after stopping smoking.

      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Nondiabetic,
      overweight and obese adult smokers will be randomized to one of three arms:

        -  lorcaserin for 24 weeks in combination with varenicline for 12 weeks;

        -  placebo for 24 weeks in combination with varenicline for 12 weeks;

      We will assess the following:

        -  changes in weight and Weight Concern

        -  7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence weekly through week 24 and prolonged smoking
           abstinence at 24 and 52 weeks. Subjects will have a target quit date 8 days after
           starting medication.
