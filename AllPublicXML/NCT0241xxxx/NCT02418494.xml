    <textblock>
      This research trial studies health-related symptom questionnaires in measuring quality of
      life in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants treated with or monitored
      for anal lesions. Collecting information and symptoms from patients diagnosed with anal
      lesions may help reduce the risk of anal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop an Anal Cancer/HSIL Outcomes Research Study (ANCHOR) high-grade squamous
      intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) Index (HQI) using
      state-of-the-art measure development methodology that captures the most important HRQoL
      symptoms and concerns of those persons diagnosed with anal HSIL and either treated or
      untreated for anal HSIL.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete the ANCHOR HSIL HRQoL interview over 45-60 minutes, comparing the list
      of symptoms, concerns, or HRQOL impacts related to HSIL diagnosis and treatment. Some
      patients also complete a cognitive interview for up to 3 sessions.
