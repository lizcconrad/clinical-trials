      The aim of this study is to compare outcomes of quality-of-life measures and evaluate the
      body image and cosmesis between Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (SILC) and
      Conventional Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (CLC).Twenty eight patients underwent SILC and 30
      underwent LC.Fifty-eight patients were included the study and divided into two groups. The
      results of the questionnaires were statistically compared.

      Recently, single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is one of the minimally
      invasive technique, developed to reduce the need of multiple ports and has become popular
      among the surgeons. This study was conducted with fifty eight patients between January 2011
      and March 2013 in Turkey. Fifty-eight patients were included the study and divided into two
      groups. Quality-of-life measures was evaluated by the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire.Cosmesis
      and body image were evaluated with the Body Image Questionnaire. All statistical analyses
      were performed by IBM Statistics 21.0 and MS-Excel 2007. A value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted as
      statistically significant.
