    <textblock>
      The primary objective for this study is to monitor the change in patient assessed symptoms of
      constipation in subjects taking the proprietary probiotic blend compared to those taking the
      placebo. The secondary objective for this study is to additionally monitor changes in stool
      consistency, stool frequency, quality of life and microbial composition of feces from
      baseline to Day 29, in all subjects. Safety considerations monitored any changes in blood
      safety parameters as well as incidence of adverse events throughout the entire study for all
      subjects.
