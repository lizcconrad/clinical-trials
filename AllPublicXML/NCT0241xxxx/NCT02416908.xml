  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selinexor has shown single-agent activity in a current phase I study enrolling patients with
      relapsed/refractory AML with durable complete remissions (CR), complete remissions with
      incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), partial remissions (PR), and stable disease (SD)
      observed. Furthermore, common toxicities included nausea, fatigue, and anorexia and were
      manageable with supportive care agents. Additionally, CLAG chemotherapy has proven activity
      in relapsed and refractory AML, and has been shown to be a relatively well tolerated regimen
      without significant non-hematologic toxicity. Given the established role of CLAG
      chemotherapy, the single agent activity of selinexor, and their non-overlapping toxicities,
      the investigators propose a phase I/II open label study of selinexor in combination with CLAG
      for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

    <measure>Phase I only: Safety and tolerability of treatment as measured by adverse event grade and frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated to be 12-18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The phase I portion will use a Bayesian optimal interval design to identify a schedule with grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity that does not exceed 20%.
There is no de-escalation below the starting schedule. If 1 DLT is observed in the initial cohort with schedule A dosing and the schedule A dosing is repeated in the second cohort, the study will be stopped if 3 DLTs are observed in the second cohort, a total of 4 DLTs in cohorts 1 and 2 together.
If the schedule is intensified after schedule A dosing and de-intensification is indicated after schedule B dosing, 6 additional patients will be treated using the schedule A.
Schedule A dosing will be accepted if no more than 2 DLTs are observed in a maximum of 18 patients treated using that schedule.
All AEs will be classified using the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0</description>

               -  First relapse with no prior unsuccessful salvage chemotherapy, or

               -  Relapsed or refractory to hypomethylating agent, defined as a lack of response,
                  disease progression, loss of response, or intolerance as deemed by the study
                  investigator

          -  Age between 18 and 70 years old.

                  infiltration or biliary obstruction due to leukemia) or Gilbert's disease

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;50 ml/min, calculated using the formula of Cockroft and
                  Gault: (140-Age) x Mass (kg) / (72 x Creatinine mg/dL); multiply by 0.85 if
                  female.

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥ 40% by MUGA scan or echocardiogram

             area (BSA) calculated by Dubois method must be &gt;1.43 m^2

          -  Patients should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because the

             of child-bearing potential. Acceptable methods of contraception are condoms with
             contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive
             patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a sexual partner who is
             surgically sterilized or post-menopausal. For both male and female patients, effective

             least 2 months must have elapsed since completion of an allogeneic stem cell
             transplantation.

          -  Less than 2 weeks from the completion of any previous cytotoxic chemotherapy (with the
             exception of hydroxyurea).

          -  Concurrent active malignancy under treatment except prostate or breast cancer
             undergoing treatment with hormonal therapy.

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within three weeks prior to first dose in
             this study.

          -  Active CNS involvement with leukemia.

               -  symptomatic ischemia, or

               -  uncontrolled clinically significant conduction abnormalities (i.e. ventricular
                  tachycardia on antiarrhythmics are excluded and 1st degree AV block or

               -  myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to KPT-330 or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals
             within one week prior to first dose. Infections controlled on concurrent
             anti-microbial agents are acceptable, and anti-microbial prophylaxis per institutional
             guidelines is acceptable.

          -  Any medical condition which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the
             patient's safety.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             within 5 days of study entry.

             significantly affecting gastrointestinal function.

          -  Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or C virus (HCV) infection; or known to be
             positive for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen).
