    <textblock>
      Hypoxemia may be refractory to protective ventilation during the acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS), justifying the use of other therapies that improved oxygenation and
      decreased mortality, including prone position (PP).

      During ARDS, the majority of patients are responders to PP with increased PaO2 due to
      homogenization of the ventilation-perfusion ratio. Despite changes in intra-thoracic and
      intra-abdominal pressure, hemodynamic parameters are not changed.

      Besides the fact that the PP improves systemic oxygenation is it the same on cerebral
      oxygenation? No study has investigated the cerebral oxygenation during PP in patients with
      ARDS. The cerebral oxygenation may be altered due to the position of the patient and high
      levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. This decrease oxygenation may be responsible for
      cognitive impairment when patients awake.

      NIRS (Near Infrared Spectroscopy) is a noninvasive tool, capable of delivering information on
      cerebral oxidative metabolism and its hemodynamic status. It can be used routinely for the
      management of resuscitation in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. This study is to
      investigate cerebral oxygenation during prone position in the investigators' patients of ICU.
