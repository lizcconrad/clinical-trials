      This extension study will allow participants that completed Study HGT-HIT-094 to continue
      receiving Elaprase treatment in conjunction with idursulfase IT or to continue receiving
      Elaprase treatment and begin concurrent IT treatment for those that did not received
      idursulfase IT treatment in Study HGT-HIT-094.

    <description>All patients in this study will be treated with intrathecal idursulfase-IT in conjunction with Elaprase therapy. Patients who complete Visit Week 52 assessments of Study HGT HIT 094 and who meet the eligibility criteria and for whom informed consent is provided will be enrolled in this extension study. All patients will receive idursulfase-IT at the same dose and frequency (10 mg once every 28 days) as selected for the HGT-HIT-094 study. Patients who are younger than 3 years of age will continue to receive an adjusted dose.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have completed Visit Week 52 assessments in Study HGT-HIT-094

          2. The patient's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) must have voluntarily signed
             an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved
             informed consent form after all relevant aspects of the study have been explained and
             discussed. Consent of the patient's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) and
             the patient's assent, as relevant, must be obtained

          3. The patient has continued to receive Elaprase on a regular basis in Study HGT-HIT-094

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has experienced, in the opinion of the Investigator, a safety or medical
             issue that contraindicates treatment with idursulfase-IT, including, but not limited
             to,uncontrolled seizure disorder, bleeding disorder, and clinically relevant
             hypertension

          2. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of idursulfase-IT

          3. The patient has clinically relevant intracranial hypertension

          4. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study, other than HGT-HIT-094, that
             involves clinical investigations or use of any investigational product (drug or
             [intrathecal/spinal] device) within 30 days prior to study enrollment or at any time
             during the study

          5. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to anesthesia or is thought to
             be at an unacceptably high risk for anesthesia due to compromised airways or other
             conditions.

          6. The patient has a condition that is contraindicated as described in the SOPH-A-PORT
             Mini S IDDD Instructions for Use, including:

               1. The patient has had, or may have, an allergic reaction to the materials of
                  construction of the SOPH-A-PORT Mini S device

               2. The patient's body size is too small to support the size of the SOPH-A-PORT Mini
                  S Access Port, as judged by the Investigator

               3. The patient's drug therapy requires substances known to be incompatible with the
                  materials of construction

               4. The patient has a known or suspected local or general infection

               5. The patient is at risk of abnormal bleeding due to a medical condition or therapy

               6. The patient has one or more spinal abnormalities that could complicate safe
                  implantation or fixation

               7. The patient has a functioning CSF shunt device

               8. The patient has shown an intolerance to an implanted device
