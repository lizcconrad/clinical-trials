    <description>Safety as measured by dose limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as:
Grade 3 or above local adverse event (pain, cutaneous reactions including induration)
Grade 3 or above systemic adverse event (temperature, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and myalgia)
Grade 3 or above other clinical or laboratory adverse event confirmed at examination or on repeat testing respectively
Any event attributable to vaccination leading to discontinuation of the immunisation regimen</description>

    <description>Effect of vaccination on plasma viral load (pVL) (ultrasensitive assay) at screening and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24. Low-level HIV-1 viral loads will be measured using the Single copy assay (SCA). The limit of detection of the SCA will be standardized to the highest limit for any individual (0.7 copies/ml)</description>

    <description>Intracellular HIV RNA species at week 0, 4, 6, 8 and 24. Cell-associated HIV-1 RNA (CA-RNA) will be isolated from cryopreserved PBMCs.

    <measure>Genome wide transcriptome and microRNA analysis at weeks 0 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Transcriptome analysis at weeks 0 and 6 Genome wide transcriptome and microRNA analysis on the same PBMC samples will be performed. Plasma samples will be analyzed for protein expression patterns using multiplex ELISA (Luminex technology). All data will be integrated into the multidimensional database &quot;VASP&quot; a web based &quot;-omics&quot; data analysis and storage pipeline developed by Erasmus University Rotterdam to ensure data consistency and ease of analysis to all partners. Advanced bioinformatics and statistical analysis will be used to reveal the impact of vaccination on the virus-host interaction in chronic HIV infection</description>
