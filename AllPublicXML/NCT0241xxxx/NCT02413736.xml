  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who have been diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
      and have been treated with adjuvant imatinib for 3 years after surgery will be randomly
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive imatinib (Gleevec) for 2 more years (Arm A) or to stop
      imatinib (Arm B). The study participants are required to have histologically verified GIST
      with a high risk of GIST recurrence despite removal of all macroscopic GIST tissue at surgery
      and 3 years of adjuvant imatinib. The high risk of GIST recurrence is defined as one of the
      following: gastric GIST with mitotic count &gt;10/50 high power fields (HPFs) of the microscope,
      non-gastric GIST with mitotic count &gt;5/50 HPFs, or tumor rupture. Study participants
      allocated to Arm A will receive imatinib 400 mg/day for 24 months after the date of
      randomization. All study participants will be followed up using blood tests and computerized
      tomography (or MRI) of the abdomen. The computerized tomography examinations will be
      performed at 6 month intervals. A total of 300 patients will be entered to the study. The
      study hypothesis is that adjuvant imatinib given for a total of 5 years may prevent some of
      the GISTs to recur as compared to patients who receive adjuvant imatinib for 3 years, and
      there may be a difference in the rate of GIST recurrence between the two groups.

             and/or DOG-1 positive, or mutation of KIT or PDGFRA present in tumor tissue).

          -  Macroscopically complete surgical resection of GIST (either R0 or R1 resection).

          -  Mutation analysis of KIT and PDGFR genes has been carried out.

          -  A high risk of GIST recurrence; either gastric GIST with mitotic count &gt;10/50 HPFs, or
