    <textblock>
      Background Intraoperative hypotension is a common problem that significantly contributes to
      perioperative mortality and morbidity. At the moment the &quot;gold standard&quot; for perioperative
      fluid management is the so called &quot;goal-directed therapy&quot; that features fluid resuscitation
      followed if necessary catecholamines if needed for perioperative cardiocirculatory support.

      Worldwide the so called &quot;physiological&quot; sodium chlorid (0.9% NaCl) solution is the most often
      used infusate for perioperative fluid management. Despite its widespread use physiological
      saline has its major disadvantages such as the increased incidence of metabolic acidosis.
      Nevertheless catecholamines have their significant side effects as well (eg diminished renal
      perfusion, increased cardiovascular morbidity) and they therefore should be used with
      caution.

      In a prior study by group members on patients undergoing renal transplantation receiving
      either physiological saline or an acetate-buffered infusate showed a 50% decrease in
      catecholamine necessity in the acetate-buffered infusate group. The investigators therefore
      would like to evaluate the effects of the perioperative fluid choice on the necessity of
      catecholamine use.

      Aim

        -  Evaluation of the perioperative fluid choice on the necessity of catecholamines for
           cardiocirculatory support.

        -  Description of the relationship between perioperative fluid choice and minimal blood
           pressure as well as the time to catecholamine use and their dosage.

      Methods The investigators plan a prospective randomized-controlled trial of all patients
      undergoing major abdominal surgery at the Vienna General Hospital and Medical University of
      Vienna. Fluid management and catecholamine use will be based on a oesophageal Doppler -based
      treatment scheme.
