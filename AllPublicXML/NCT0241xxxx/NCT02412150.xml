  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine which is
      administered during emergence in adult patients undergoing elective thyroidectomy on smooth
      emergence form general anesthesia (reducing agitation or coughing, signs of hypertension or
      tachycardia, or etc.) and postoperative outcome (postoperative bleeding and hospital
      staying).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smooth emergence from general anaesthesia after surgery is important to prevent potentially
      dangerous effects such as hypertension, tachycardia, myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmias and
      increased intracranial and intra-abdominal pressure. After thyroidectomy, activities during
      emergence such as agitation or coughing, signs of hypertension or tachycardia, or etc. may
      lead to postoperative bleeding, resulting in acute airway obstruction or reoperation.

    <description>After induction of anesthesia, anesthesia is maintained with desflurane and remifentanil during thyroidectomy.
Fifteen minutes before the end of surgery, infusion of remifentanil for surgery is discontinued.
Then, dexmedetomidine has started infusion for 15 min (rate of 0.6 ug/kg/hr). Vital signs and complications of testing drugs are measured before and after infusion of testing drugs.
Five minutes before the end of surgery, anesthetic gas (desflurane) is discontinued.
After patient has awake, extubation has done. Extubation time and Recovery time,Cough reflex,Ramsay Sedation Scale, Visual analogue scale, and surgical outcomes such as postoperative bleeding, time to remove drainage and duration of hospital staying, postoperative complications are measured until POD#3.</description>
