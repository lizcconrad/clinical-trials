  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this survey is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fomepizole intravenous
      infusion in Japanese patients with ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings in daily medical
      practice.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies for fomepizole intravenous infusion have not been conducted in Japan, and
      there are few reports of data on drug-use, including in the literature, in Japanese patients;
      therefore, an evaluation of the safety and efficacy of fomepizole intravenous infusion is
      required.

      This specified drug-use survey for fomepizole intravenous infusion (Fomepizole Intravenous
      Infusion 1.5 g &quot;Takeda,&quot; hereinafter referred to as &quot;the drug&quot;) was planned to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the drug in patients with ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning in
      daily medical practice.

    <description>The frequencies of all adverse reactions observed during the observation period will be tabulated by symptom, day of onset, and severity. An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; an abnormal exacerbation of the target disease (an unexpected exacerbation other than the natural course of the target disease) is also defined as an adverse event; however, an expected exacerbation of the target disease is not considered an adverse event.</description>
