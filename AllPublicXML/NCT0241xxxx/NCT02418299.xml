      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a non-invasive Er:YAG thermal laser
      therapy in treating female stress and mixed urinary incontinence.

    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common disorder that affects women of various ages and impacts
      all aspects of life. Therapeutic approaches range from conservative therapy, which is heavily
      dependent on patient compliance, to different, more invasive, surgical procedures.

      The aim of the study was to evaluate the non-invasive erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG)
      laser treatment (IncontiLase) as a potential treatment strategy for stress UI (SUI) and mixed
      UI (MUI). The treatment works by thermally affecting vaginal mucosa, with an emphasis on the
      anterior vaginal wall, resulting with partial denaturation of collagen fibres and stimulation
      if new collagen formation, all of which leads to firmer support for the urethra and the
      improvement of incontinence symptoms.

      The investigators included 175 women with newly diagnosed SUI (66% of women) and MUI (34 %),
      respectively and performed on average 2.5±0.5 procedures in each woman separated by a
      two-month period, using Er:YAG laser. Patients were clinically examined and classified by
      incontinence types (SUI and MUI) and grades (mild, moderate, severe and very severe) using
      International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire (ICIQ) and assessing
      Incontinence Severity Index (ISI): ISI before the therapy was 5.7±2.1 points. Treatment
      discomfort was measured at every session with visual analogue system pain scale, and adverse
      effects and patients' satisfaction were followed. Follow-ups were performed at two, six and
      twelve months after the treatment.
