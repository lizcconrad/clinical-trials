  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the potential impact of switching inhalers by assessing the
      handling error rate (critical and non-critical) in controlled asthmatics currently treated
      with, and using correctly, SERETIDE via the DISKUS Inhaler who are switched to receiving
      SERETIDE via the Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) (EVOHALER) without training by a Healthcare
      Professional (HCP).

      This will be a descriptive, multi-centre, open-label, non randomized 14 day study assessing
      MDI technique in subjects with controlled asthma (Asthma Control Test [ACT] score &gt;= 20 at
      Visit 1) currently treated with, and able to use correctly, SERETIDE via the DISKUS Inhaler.
      All the eligible subjects will be switched to an equivalent dose of SERETIDE via the MDI.
      Subjects will need to use the MDI inhaler in accordance the accompanying patient information
      leaflet (to be read prior to use) for approximately 14 days. No instruction, coaching or
      comment on inhaler technique will be provided by the HCP. MDI technique of subjects will be
      assessed at Visit 2 (after 14 days) and the errors will be recorded. Subject will revert back
      to using their SERETIDE DISKUS inhaler again from Visit 2. Subjects will be followed up by
      telephone for approximately 1 week after Visit 2.

      A maximum of 110 subjects will be enrolled such that approximately 100 evaluable subjects
      complete the study. The total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 21
      days.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Critical Error After the First Assessment of Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) Technique on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's inhaler use was assessed on Day 14 by the health care professional (HCP) against a predefined list of critical errors (CEs). Critical errors were defined as errors that were most likely to result in no or only minimal medication being inhaled. The participants were asked to demonstrate their usage of the MDI using a placebo demonstration MDI by HCP, critical or non-critical errors (N-CEs) and even no errors made by the participants while using the MDI were recorded. Critical errors in using the MDI were defined as: failure to remove the cap; failure to shake the device; failure to place the device in mouth; no dose actuated during an inhalation manoeuvre; dose coordination that was so poor that the patient was likely to have received no dose or only received minimal dose. 95% confidence interval (CI) is for the % of participants making at least one critical error after the first assessment of the MDI technique, and was calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Overall Error After the First Assessment of MDI Technique on Day 14.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Inhaler use was assessed on Day 14 for overall errors. Overall errors included CEs or N-CEs. Demonstration of usage was with MDI and placebo, CE or N-CEs and even no errors were recorded. CEs were defined as: failure to remove the cap; failure to shake the device; failure to place the device in mouth; no dose actuated during an inhalation manoeuvre; dose coordination that was so poor that the patient was likely to have received no dose or only received minimal dose. N-CEs were defined as: failure to inhale within 5 seconds of shaking the device; no exhalation before an inhalation; the inhalation manoeuvre was not slow and/or was not deep; dose coordination was sub-optimal but patient likely to have received some dose; more than one actuation during an inhalation manoeuvre; did not hold breath. The exact 95% confidence interval is for percent of participants making at least one CE after the first assessment of the MDI technique, and was calculated using exact binomial distribution.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Health Care Professional (HCP) Instructions Required on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's inhaler use was assessed on Day 14 by the HCP against a predefined list of critical errors. If a participant made a critical error during this initial assessment, the HCP demonstrated the correct use of the inhaler to the participant and gave verbal instructions. The participant was then asked to demonstrate inhaler use. Any errors were recorded by the HCP. If the participant made a critical error then the HCP repeated the demonstration of inhaler use to the participant for a second time. If the participant continued to make a critical error in the use of the inhaler, the HCP demonstrated the correct use of the inhaler and gave verbal instructions one more time and the participant was then asked to demonstrate inhaler use. Instructions are only given to subjects who make a critical error. Any errors made after this final demonstration were recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Taken to Correctly Completing Inhaler Use at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>If a participant made a critical error during the initial assessment, the HCP demonstrated the correct use of the inhaler to the participant and gave verbal instructions. The HCP could have demonstrated the use of the inhaler a maximum of three times. Any errors made after this final demonstration were recorded. The time taken for the HCP to train the participant in the correct technique was recorded as T1: the time from when the participants started their demonstration of MDI use until they had completed their demonstration of MDI use (i.e., with no HCP support), T2: the time from when the HCP started to demonstrate/instruct device use until correct use was demonstrated by the participant (up to a maximum of three attempts only). T3 is defined as T1+T2, which is the time from when the participant started to demonstrate MDI use until correct use was demonstrated by the subject (up to a maximum of three attempts following demonstration by HCP).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &gt;=18 years of age at the time of informed consent.

          -  A diagnosis of asthma as defined by the National Institutes of Health, 2007.

          -  Must be currently treated with SERETIDE via the DISKUS Inhaler and have been
             maintained on this dose for 3 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Have controlled asthma defined as a total ACT score &gt;= 20

          -  Must be able to use their DISKUS inhaler correctly. Correct use is defined as making
             no critical errors during the assessment of DISKUS inhaler use at Visit 1.

          -  Male

          -  Female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a
             negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least
             one of the following conditions applies: 1. Non-reproductive potential defined as:
             Pre-menopausal females with one of the following; documented tubal ligation,
             documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of
             bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, documented bilateral Oophorectomy.
             Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels
             consistent with menopause). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective
             contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise,
             they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to
             study enrolment. 2. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options
             listed below in the GSK modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding
             pregnancy in females of reproductive potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior
             to the first dose of study medication and until after the last dose of study
             medication and completion of the follow-up contact.

        GSK modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in FRP: a.
        Contraceptive subdermal implant that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP)
        effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1percent rate of failure per year, as stated in the
        product label. b. Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP
        effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1 percent rate of failure per year, as stated in the
        product label. c. Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone. d. Injectable
        progestogen. e. Contraceptive vaginal ring. f. Percutaneous contraceptive patches. g. Male
        partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry
        into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. h. Male condom combined
        with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository). GSK modified list of
        highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in FRP does not apply to FRP with same sex
        partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will
        continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent
        basis. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently,
        correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for
        ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a current diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

          -  Have experienced an asthma exacerbation within 3 months of Visit 1 or a lower
             respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks of Visit 1. An exacerbation is defined as
             worsening asthma requiring any treatment other than rescue salbutamol. This includes
             requiring the use of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids and /or emergency room visit
             or hospitalisation.

          -  Other Concurrent Diseases: A subject must not have any clinically significant,
             uncontrolled condition or disease state (such as severe cardiovascular disorders or
             heart rhythm abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected
             hypokalaemia or predisposition to low levels of serum potassium) that, in the opinion
             of the investigator (in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor if required), would
             put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or would confound
             the interpretation of the results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the
             study. Please refer to the SERETIDE Product Label for a full list of conditions for
             special warnings and precautions for use.

          -  Currently taking potent Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) inhibitors

        <title>Percentage of Participants Making at Least One Critical Error After the First Assessment of Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) Technique on Day 14</title>
        <description>Participant's inhaler use was assessed on Day 14 by the health care professional (HCP) against a predefined list of critical errors (CEs). Critical errors were defined as errors that were most likely to result in no or only minimal medication being inhaled. The participants were asked to demonstrate their usage of the MDI using a placebo demonstration MDI by HCP, critical or non-critical errors (N-CEs) and even no errors made by the participants while using the MDI were recorded. Critical errors in using the MDI were defined as: failure to remove the cap; failure to shake the device; failure to place the device in mouth; no dose actuated during an inhalation manoeuvre; dose coordination that was so poor that the patient was likely to have received no dose or only received minimal dose. 95% confidence interval (CI) is for the % of participants making at least one critical error after the first assessment of the MDI technique, and was calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>

        <title>Time Taken to Correctly Completing Inhaler Use at Day 14</title>
        <description>If a participant made a critical error during the initial assessment, the HCP demonstrated the correct use of the inhaler to the participant and gave verbal instructions. The HCP could have demonstrated the use of the inhaler a maximum of three times. Any errors made after this final demonstration were recorded. The time taken for the HCP to train the participant in the correct technique was recorded as T1: the time from when the participants started their demonstration of MDI use until they had completed their demonstration of MDI use (i.e., with no HCP support), T2: the time from when the HCP started to demonstrate/instruct device use until correct use was demonstrated by the participant (up to a maximum of three attempts only). T3 is defined as T1+T2, which is the time from when the participant started to demonstrate MDI use until correct use was demonstrated by the subject (up to a maximum of three attempts following demonstration by HCP).</description>

            <description>Participants received fluticasone propionate/salmeterol via MDI for 14 days at a dose equivalent to their pre-study fluticasone propionate/salmeterol dose which was administered via DISKUS inhaler. Participants were instructed to read the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol MDI PIL and then to use the provided MDI in accordance with the PIL for approximately 14 days, in replacement of their DISKUS inhaler.</description>

          <title>Time Taken to Correctly Completing Inhaler Use at Day 14</title>
          <description>If a participant made a critical error during the initial assessment, the HCP demonstrated the correct use of the inhaler to the participant and gave verbal instructions. The HCP could have demonstrated the use of the inhaler a maximum of three times. Any errors made after this final demonstration were recorded. The time taken for the HCP to train the participant in the correct technique was recorded as T1: the time from when the participants started their demonstration of MDI use until they had completed their demonstration of MDI use (i.e., with no HCP support), T2: the time from when the HCP started to demonstrate/instruct device use until correct use was demonstrated by the participant (up to a maximum of three attempts only). T3 is defined as T1+T2, which is the time from when the participant started to demonstrate MDI use until correct use was demonstrated by the subject (up to a maximum of three attempts following demonstration by HCP).</description>
