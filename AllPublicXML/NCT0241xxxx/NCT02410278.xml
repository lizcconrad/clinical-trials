    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether montelukast can reduce the
      severity of gastrointestinal (GI) events, measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating
      Scale (GSRS), after oral administration of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in participants with
      relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The secondary objectives of this study are as
      follows: To evaluate whether montelukast after oral administration of DMF in participants
      with relapsing forms of MS decreases discontinuations due to GI events and reduces the number
      of participants taking symptomatic therapies for GI events; To investigate the effect of
      montelukast on the incidence of flushing events after oral administration of 240 mg DMF in
      participants with relapsing forms of MS.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Reside in the United States and have a confirmed diagnosis of a relapsing form of MS
             and satisfy the therapeutic indication as described in the local label

             hypersensitivity, abnormal laboratory results indicative of any significant disease,
             and/or a major disease that would preclude participation in a clinical study
