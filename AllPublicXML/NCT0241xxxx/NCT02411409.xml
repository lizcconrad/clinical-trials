  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CommunityRx system generates patient-centered e-prescriptions for community services
      (HealtheRx) via an interface between the electronic health records (EHR) and a comprehensive
      community resource database. Based on a patient's diagnoses, a HealtheRx will be printed
      automatically at the end of the ambulatory care visit and will provide patients with a
      customized map and/or list of places in their community that provide health and social
      services as well as contact information for a local community health worker who can provide
      limited case management support. The CommunityRx program aims to promote: 1) better
      healthcare, 2) better health, and 3) lower cost. The purpose of this research is to
      systematically evaluate the impact of CommunityRx on health outcomes as well as health care
      service utilization and total cost of care for Medicaid, Medicare and other beneficiaries.
      The investigators hypothesize that beneficiaries who participate in the CommunityRx
      intervention will experience better healthcare, better health and lower total cost of care.
