    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial uses an educational brochure and online tutorial program to
      assess sun-protective behavior and skin self-examination among African Americans. Skin cancer
      is very common among African Americans, with a disproportionately high mortality rate.
      Providing a brochure and an online educational program about sun-protective behaviors may
      encourage African Americans to take preventative measures against skin cancer, help improve
      early skin cancer detection, determine how far the disease has spread, and plan the best
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether an educational brochure and online program will increase sun-protective
      behaviors among African-American patients who present at the general dermatology clinic.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether the educational brochure and online program will improve skills for skin
      self-examinations among African-American patients who present at the general dermatology
      clinic.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive a skin cancer educational and preventive brochure distributed by
      the National Cancer Institute and watch a 30-minute online tutorial video called X-Plain
      about skin cancer, preventative behaviors, and skin self-examinations.

      ARM II: Participants receive an educational brochure as in Arm I.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 30 days.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sunscreen use among African-American patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Change in sun-protective behaviors among African-American patients. Measured by sunscreen use. All responses for questions about sun-protective behaviors are on a 5-point Likert scale. Summary scores will be created at baseline and short-term (1 month) follow-up for both control and treatment groups. The outcome variable is a continuous variable. Treatment scores individuals on the intervention group will be compared. T-tests will be used to compare mean scores for sun-protective behaviors between control and treatment groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in skin self-examinations among African-American patients as measured by knowledge, behavior and anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Analyzed by looking at increase or decrease in skin self-examinations the patients report from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Performance of skin self-examination is measured by knowledge, behavior, and anxiety. Most responses for questions about skin self-examinations are on a 5-point Likert scale, while some are yes/no or true/false. Summary scores will be created at baseline and short-term (1 month) follow-up for both control and treatment groups. The outcome variable is a continuous variable. T-tests will be used to compare mean scores for skin self-examinations between groups.</description>
