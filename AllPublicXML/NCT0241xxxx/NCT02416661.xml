  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder. The disease
      is caused by the hereditary deficiency of the glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme that
      breaks down glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide. Gaucher disease is the most common
      sphingolipidosis and it is among the most frequent inherited diseases among the ethnic group
      of Ashkenazi Jews. The gene that encodes for glucocerebrosidase is located on the long arm of
      the chromosome 1 and contains 11 exons. So far, more than 400 different mutations have been
      described in Gaucher patients, the most frequent of which is the missense mutation but also
      the frame-shift and splice-site mutation and insertions and deletions are known. The more
      frequent mutations are N370S, L444P, IVS2+1G&gt;A, c.84insG, R463C, and R496H. Clinical symptoms
      are numerous. The classical symptoms affect visceral organs (hepatosplenomegaly) and the
      skeletal system (bone marrow infiltrations up to bone infarcts and pathological fractures)
      with consecutive changes in the blood panel (anemia, thrombocytopenia) (Sidransky, 2004).A
      major distinguishing factor is the occurrence of neurological manifestations (myoclonus
      epilepsy, hydrocephalus, eye motion disorders). Today, it is discussed whether the division
      into the classical three types of disease (type 1: non-neuronopathic form; type 2: the acute
      neuronopathic form; type 3: the chronic neuronopathic form) are still applicable because in
      clinical practice the presenting symptoms are only insufficiently reflected with this
      classification.

      There is no clear genotype-phenotype relationship. The same DNA mutation is seen in patients
      with a completely different characterization of the disease. An exception is the mutation
      N370S, which so far has been found only in the visceral form (type1), but still may have a
      high phenotypic heterogeneity in GD Type 1 (Fairley et al., 2008).

      The outcome of the non-neuronopathic diseases could be improved greatly with the introduction
      and widely available enzyme replacement therapy. Among these are the reductions of the size
      of the liver and spleen as well as normalization in the blood count (Elstein and Zimran,
      2009). The glucocerebrosides that are not metabolized are stored in the entire
      reticuloendothelial system. The macrophages enriched with glycolipids form the pathoanatomic
      basis of the so-called &quot;Gaucher cells&quot; which can be verified with the light microscope. The
      accumulation of Gaucher cells in liver, spleen, and bone marrow is thought to underlie the
      characteristic hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and bone complications of GD patients
      (Beutler 2001). There are no causative cures for lysosomal storage diseases and treatment is
      mostly symptomatic, although mostly enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been demonstrated
      especially for the treatment of non-neuronopathic GD with good success (Elstein and Zimran,
      2009). In addition, substrate reduction therapy (SRT), a method used to decrease the
      accumulation of storage material, is currently being evaluated for some of these diseases. In
      SRT, oral administration of the iminosugar N-butyldeoxynojirimycin aims to reduce
      Glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthesis and thus limit its accumulation. However, SRT is only
      approved for mildly tomoderately affected patients in whom ERT is not a therapeutic option
      (Ficicioglu, 2008). Additionally, Eliglustat is currently under investigation for the primary
      oral treatment of GD type 1 patient (Lukina et al., 2014).

      To date a definitive diagnosis of Gaucher's disease can only be made applying biochemical
      testing measuring the reduced enzymatic activity of the beta-glucosidase together with
      genetic confirmation. Since numerous different mutations may be the cause of a particular
      lysosomal storage disease the sequencing of the entire beta-glucosidase gene is applied in
      Gaucher's disease in order to confirm the genetic diagnosis (Zimran, 2011). Although there
      are attempts to apply easy diagnostic methods based on associated biochemical abnormalities
      such as high alkaline phosphatase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and immunoglobulin
      levels, or, in case of Gaucher's disease, by cell analysis showing &quot;crinkled paper&quot; cytoplasm
      and glycolipid-laden macrophages, there is an unmet need for a simple biochemical test
      exhibiting highly specific and highly sensitive detection at an early stage, monitoring
      progression of the disease and early monitoring the efficacy of applied therapies.

      A biomarker should be technically feasible in many hands, easy to measure; useful, with a
      consistent, relative magnitude between patients and controls, or treated and untreated
      patients; reliable, precise, and accurate clinically, and classifiable as strongly predictive
      or prognostic. In GD some lysosomal enzymes, used as indirect biomarkers, were found to be
      elevated, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, hexosaminidase, and a human
      chitinase, chitotriosidase. Thus, there are attempts to monitor the reduction of storage
      cells in tissues by measurement of such surrogate markers of Gaucher cells like
      chitotriosidase and CCL18 (Hollak et al., 1994; Boot et al., 2004). However, the use of
      plasma chitotriosidase as a Gaucher cell marker is hampered by the fact that patients,
      including those with Gaucher's disease, may be deficient in chitotriosidase activity due to a
      24-base pair (bp) duplication in the chitotriosidase gene. Obviously these individuals cannot
      be monitored by the measurement of plasma chitotriosidase activity. The frequency of the
      homozygous 24-bp duplication in the chitotriosidase gene depends on the ethnicity and can
      vary between 6% and nearly 35% in the Latino population (unpublished data). In these cases
      the marker CCL18 is used. Furthermore, elevated levels of CCL18 were also found to be
      associated with a variety of diseases, such as different types of cancer and inflammation of
      joints, lungs and skin. For example, the ascitic fluid of patients suffering from ovarian
      cancer contains a significantly elevated level of CCL18 compared to patients without this
      carcinoma (Budd-Chiari syndrome). Since it attracts and activates specific immune cells CCL18
      plays a role in tumor suppression. Furthermore, children having acute lymphocytic leukemia
      are found to exhibit elevated levels of CCL18. Plasma CCL18 levels do not reflect one
      particular clinical symptom, but rather are a reflection of the total body burden of Gaucher
      cells. The use of primary storage molecules as biomarker was assessed for glucosylceramide
      (Gb1) in plasma of Gaucher's disease patients and compared to the level of Gb1 in healthy
      individuals (Groener et al. 2008). Already in 1989 Rosengren et al. (1989) showed that in
      lipidoses not only the catabolism of the major sphingolipid but also its deacylated compound
      is affected. It is important to note that until today no use of a highly specific and highly
      sensitive biomarker is routinely used beside the methods described above, that exhibits an
      unsatisfactory limit of detection, sensitivity and/or specificity and thus proved to be
      unsuitable for clinical application
