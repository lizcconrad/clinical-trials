  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The polyglucosamine, specification L112 is a medical device and in this clinical trial used
      for weight reduction of overweight and obese participants. The rationale for this study is to
      show that overweight can be reduced by taking 2 times daily 2 tablets with the main meals
      with the highest fat content.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To have a comparable diet condition, all participants in both groups had to follow the
      recommendations of the German clinical practice guidelines on the management and prevention
      of obesity.

      One group had to take the polyglucosamine tablets and the other group placebo tablets for at
      least 24 weeks. It is known, that polyglucosamine is a fat binder acting in a
      physical-chemical manner, the positive charged fiber is bound to the negative charged dietary
      fat and this complex in unable to pass the gut wall into the body but is naturally excreted,
      hence this energy is not available. Therefore, this medical device should show a measurable
      reduction in body weight.
