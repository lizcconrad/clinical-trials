    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma that have spread to other
      places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Ribociclib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may
      work better in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase II dose of the combination of LEE011 (ribociclib) and gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of LEE011 and gemcitabine.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) of LEE011 in combination with gemcitabine.

      III. To describe preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination of LEE011 and
      gemcitabine.

      IV. To evaluate the correlation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) amplification (testing by
      fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]), retinoblastoma (RB) and P16 expression (by
      immunohistochemistry) in archived and biopsied tumor tissue with treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) on days 1-14 and gemcitabine hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
