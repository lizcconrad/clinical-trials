  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disordered iron metabolism characterizes an important determinant of impaired exercise
      tolerance and work capacity. Iron-deficiency anemia commonly features impaired aerobic
      capacity caused by decreased oxygen carrying capacity, and has been associated with a
      negative effect on dyspnea and walking distance.

      Apart from that, iron deficiency without anemia was shown to affect endurance and energetic
      efficiency via decreased tissue oxidative capacity. Consequently, depleted iron stores could
      be capable of causing fatigue, breathlessness and impaired exercise tolerance, which are
      common features of chronic cardiopulmonary diseases like chronic heart failure (CHF) and COPD
      (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). Indeed, a current surge of interest aimed at
      potential underlying determinants in CHF and COPD independent of the primarily disordered
      organ.

      Recent studies identified iron deficiency without anemia as an independent factor of reduced
      exercise intolerance in CHF as well as in COPD. Moreover, intravenous iron application
      significantly improved exercise capacity in CHF patients with iron deficiency in presence as
      well as in absence of anemia. Comparable to CHF, the daily living of patients with COPD is
      compromised by impaired exercise tolerance.

      However, airflow limitation, as the foremost characteristic of COPD shows only weak
      associations with exercise capacity. In line with that, exercise capacity showed no
      remarkable improvement in lung transplant recipients, underlining the presence of systemic
      determinants of limited exercise tolerance like iron deficiency. The investigators showed
      that iron deficiency is present in 50% of stable COPD patients (unpublished data), which is
      according to recently published data.

      The investigators presume that iron deficiency contributes to limited exercise capacity in
      COPD patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine whether iv iron is associated with
      increases exercise capacity in COPD.

      Therefore the investigators hypothesize that filling up depleted iron storages will increase
      exercise capacity, measured by the 6-MWT (Minute Walking Test).
