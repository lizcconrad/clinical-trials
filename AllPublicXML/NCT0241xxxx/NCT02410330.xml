  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In acute coronary artery disease, pre-clinical studies have indicated that, during a
      continuous infusion of intravenous perfluorocarbon containing microbubbles, the ultrasonic
      power delivered from a diagnostic ultrasound transducer is capable of restoring
      microcirculatory flow and improving epicardial recanalization rates obtained by conventional
      therapy, a process known by Sonothrombolysis. The investigators proposed to examine the
      feasibility, safety and efficacy of such an ultrasound guided approach in 100 patients with
      ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

      In acute coronary artery disease, pre-clinical studies have indicated that, during a
      continuous infusion of intravenous perfluorocarbon containing microbubbles, the ultrasonic
      power delivered from a diagnostic ultrasound transducer is capable of restoring
      microcirculatory flow and improving epicardial recanalization rates obtained by conventional
      therapy, a process known by Sonothrombolysis. Since both diagnostic ultrasound and
      intravenous infusions of microbubbles are a Class I indication to assess regional and global
      left ventricular function and risk area in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI). The investigators propose to examine the effectiveness of microvascular
      sonothrombolysis.

      A total of 100 patients with acute STEMI will be randomized to receive diagnostic ultrasound
      guided high mechanical index (MI) impulses in different approaches applied within and outside
      the risk area during a continuous infusion of intravenous 3% Definity® or placebo. The
      different ultrasound regimens are: Group I - a custom designed high mechanical index (MI)
      impulses at 4-20 usec and &gt;1.0 MI designed for the 1.7 MHz S5-1 transducer; Group II -
      repeated diagnostic high MI impulses (all &lt;2 usec pulse duration; MI=1.0 whenever very low MI
      perfusion imaging detected microbubbles within the microvasculature; Group III (control),
      where a few limited diagnostic high MI impulses (n&lt;5 per patient) will be applied to assess
      myocadial perfusion before and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). All patients
      will receive the conventional PCI approach, including 325 milligrams Aspirin, 600 milligrams
      Clopidogrel, and heparin bolus (5000 units), followed by primary PCI using glycoprotein 2b/3a
      inhibitors as anti-thrombotic agents using established protocols. Besides angiographic
      recanalization rates at the time of presentation to the catheterization laboratory, the
      patients will have a magnetic resonance exam performed at 72-96 hours post infarcton to
      quantify the myocardial salvagability index. Quantitative assessments of ejection fraction
      will be made at this time as well.Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the start
      of treatment to death from any cause, will be evaluated.Comparisons between the three groups
      will be made on door to dilation times, survival, angiographic recanalization rates (ARR) at
      initial angiography, and reduction in infarct size determined by the salvagability index (SI)
      at magnetic resonance imaging 72-96 hours post STEMI. Left ventricular function and perfusion
      parameters by echocardiography will also be evaluated during, at 72-96 hours and at 6 months
      in all subjects.
