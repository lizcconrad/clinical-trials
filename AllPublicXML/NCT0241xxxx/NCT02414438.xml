  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a randomized controlled study design of pediatric neurologists and
      developmental pediatricians and front-line (primary care) pediatricians to determine if use
      of FirstStepDx PLUS and Next StepDx PLUS are associated with higher clinical quality, less
      variability in clinical practice, and lower costs from decreased resource utilization. The
      Clinical Performance and Value Vignettes (CPV) used in this study simulate a clinical
      encounter for individuals with an atypical phenotype and clinical presentation indicative of
      a possible genetic disorder. We will measure the difference in combined diagnostic and
      treatment CPV® domain score post-intervention versus baseline comparing intervention and
      control groups

  <detailed_description>

      The study is an interventional longitudinal study design of physician practice. 225
      specialist and general pediatricians without previous exposure to FirstStepDx PLUS or
      NextStepDx PLUS will be selected from a nationally representative list of approximately
      25,000 board-certified pediatricians and 5,000 specialists. These physicians will be
      randomized into one of three arms: to receive information regarding FirstStepDx PLUS
      (&quot;Intervention A&quot;), to receive information about FirstStepDx PLUS and NextStepDx PLUS
      (&quot;Intervention B&quot;) for use in clinical practice, and controls not receiving any intervention.
      Specifically we will test the hypotheses:

        1. Clinical practice, specifically decisions around treatment of individuals with disorders
           postnatal development including DD, ASD, and ID will vary widely among all physician
           types. This documentation of variation in practice will demonstrate the need for a new
           diagnostic service that FirstStepDx PLUS and NextStepDx PLUS would fulfill

        2. FirstStepDx PLUS and NextStepDx PLUS will improve the quality and appropriateness of
           care and therapeutic plans, as measured by the number of physicians that correctly act
           on the results of the assay

      A Physician Questionnaire will be administered to all physicians. This questionnaire will
      assess physician, patient and practice characteristics. Data gathered from this set of
      questions will become part of the baseline (pre-intervention) assessment and used for
      analysis. At the baseline assessment, Clinical Performance and Value (CPVs) Vignettes, a
      validated tool to measure physician performance and behavior will be used. CPV vignettes have
      been used to establish clinical utility in the molecular diagnostic space.

      The CPV vignettes used in this study will simulate a clinical encounter for a patient with an
      atypical clinical presentation indicative of a possible genetic developmental disorder. Each
      physician will provide open-ended responses regarding clinical care. These responses are
      scored in five domains (taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, ordering
      appropriate tests, making a diagnosis and prescribing treatment against explicit evidence and
      criteria as determined by the literature and by expert physicians. Results are presented as
      percentage correct controlling for primacy effects using case within pair randomization. Each
      case will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. All case responses will be completed
      electronically online and confidential. No physician or practice names are used when
      reporting the results of the study.

      The CPVs will be randomly assigned to physicians for each to complete 3 CPVs™ (one from each
      type). Each of the CPVs will be scored by physicians for changes in clinical practice
      including treatment changes, frequency of follow up, laboratory tests and imaging studies
      ordered - see for scoring sheet.

      The objective of this study is to assess how FirstStepDx PLUS (and NextStepDx PLUS) testing
      affects the variability of clinical practice and resultant impact.

      Primary Endpoint Differences in CPV diagnosis/treatment domain score post-intervention versus
      baseline for the intervention and control group physicians).

      Secondary Endpoints

        -  Difference in utilization of appropriate treatment including indicated versus
           unnecessary therapy pre- and post-intervention between intervention and control groups

        -  Difference in utilization of laboratory testing such as fluorescence in situ
           hybridization (FISH) analyses, global assessment, and utilization of other laboratory
           tests pre- and post-intervention, between intervention and control groups

        -  Difference in overall Clinical Performance and Value Vignettes (CPV®) scores
           post-intervention versus baseline between intervention and control groups
