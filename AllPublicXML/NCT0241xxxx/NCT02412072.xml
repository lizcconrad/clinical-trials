      A prospective multicenter trial has been started in Korea to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy
      of endometrial aspiration biopsy compared with D&amp;C in patients treated with progestin for
      endometrial hyperplasia (EH). For conservative treatment of EH, oral progestins are most
      commonly used method with various treatment regimens and more recently, the
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) also has been used successfully to
      treat EH. However, there is no report about the accuracy of endometrial sampling during
      hormonal treatment for follow-up evaluation of EH. Patients with histologically confirmed EH
      are offered hormonal treatment, one of the following 3 options: oral medroxyprogesterone
      acetate(MPA) 10mg/day for 14days per cycle, continuous oral MPA 10mg/day, or insertion of
      LNG-IUS. Histological surveillance is performed at 3-months or 6-months following initial
      treatment. Endometrial tissues are obtained via endometrial aspiration biopsy using a pipelle
      and D&amp;C. In case of using LNG-IUS, endometrial aspiration biopsy will be done with LNG-IUS in
      uterus and then, after removal of LNG-IUS, D&amp;C will be done. The biopsy findings will be
      compared. The primary endpoint is the consistency of the results of the endometrial
      aspiration biopsy and D&amp;C. The secondary endpoint is the response rate with 3 types of
      progestin treatment at 6 months.

      Endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is a premalignant lesion of endometrial cancer (EC), which is
      the most common gynecological malignancy in developed countries [1]. Therefore, accurate
      diagnostics and proper management of EH are clinically significant to prevent EC development.

      The treatment modality of EH mostly depends on the histological diagnosis and the woman's
      desire to retain fertility. The risk of cancer progression is low for women with non-atypical
      EH (&lt;5%) but increases up to 30% for women with atypical EH [2, 3]. In this respect,
      hysterectomy is recommended for the treatment of atypical EH. Meanwhile, for patients with
      non-atypical EH or for young patients with atypical EH who strongly desire to preserve their
      fertility, various conservative therapies using progestin have been used. Traditionally,
      orally administered progestins such as megestrol acetate (MA) and medroxyprogesterone acetate
      (MPA) are most commonly used method with various treatment regimens [4, 5]. More recently,
      the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), which achieves higher local
      concentrations of progestogens in the endometrium, with lower systemic side effects, also has
      been used successfully to treat EH [6-12].

      However, there is no report about the accuracy of endometrial sampling during hormonal
      treatment for EH or the best technique for follow-up evaluation of EH. A recent study
      comparing the histological results of pipelle biopsy and D&amp;C reported almost equal
      EH-diagnostic success rates [13]. Meanwhile, these results were obtained for cases where the
      LNG-IUS was not in the uterus and where there were no progestin effects on the endometrium.

      Therefore, the investigators conducted a large multicenter prospective study to compare the
      diagnostic accuracy of endometrial aspiration biopsy with dilatation &amp; curettage (D&amp;C) in
      follow up evaluation of patients treated with progestin for EH.
