      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of replacing diet beverages with
      water on weight loss and biochemical indicators for insulin sensitivity and cardiometabolic
      risk factors of diabetic obese and overweight female adults when they are in a
      multidisciplinary weight loss plan.
