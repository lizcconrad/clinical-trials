      This is a two arm, open label, multi-center, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Melphalan/HDS in patients with unresectable HCC or ICC confined to the liver.

      Eligible patients will receive up to 2 Melphalan/HDS treatments. Each treatment cycle
      consists of 6 weeks with an acceptable delay for another 2 weeks before next planned
      treatment. Tumor response will be assessed at the end of cycle 2.

      The Melphalan/HDS treatment will be terminated in patients with progressive disease (PD)
      after the 1st treatment and based on safety in patients with &gt; 8 weeks delay of recovery from
      toxicity.

          6. No prior radiation therapy to the liver including Y90-, I131-based loco-regional
             therapy. Prior loco regional therapy, including resection, based on other technology
             for HCC, if any, must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to baseline imaging.
