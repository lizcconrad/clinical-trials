  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the effect of substituting General Practitioners (GPs) by
      Physician Assistants (PAs) in out-of-hours primary care. Effects are measured in terms of the
      implication for the care model, quality of care delivered by PAs in comparison to GPs; the
      complaints treated by PAs in comparison to GPs; safety, efficiency and patient satisfaction.
      Lastly, this study will provide insight in the changes in costs of healthcare.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hours care in the Netherlands is under pressure. Workload for general practitioners
      (GPs) during out-of-hours care is high and there are concerns about maintaining the quality
      of care. Since 80% of the complaints shown in out-of-hours care are low complex and not
      urgent, not all patients necessarily have to be seen by a physician. Shifting care from GPs
      to physician assistants (PAs) is considered to be a possible method to reduce workload while
      maintaining high quality and safety of care.

      Previous research, on PAs in primary care during office hours, has shown PAs were found to be
      acceptable, effective and efficient in complementing the work of GPs.

      We hypothesize that in a team of PAs and GPs working out-of-hours primary care, the PAs will
      deliver care to less urgent and complex complaints, deliver quality of care comparable to GPs
      and their implementation will lead to a reduction in cost of healthcare.

      We compare care provided by a team of PAs and GPs with a team of only GPs. Within the team of
      PAs and GPs we make a comparison between the two healthcare professionals.

    <measure>Adherence to the practice guidelines for General Practitioners</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence of the PA to the practice guidelines for General Practitioners will be measured by video recordings of in total 30 consultations/visits of the PA. Two independent General Practitioners will score the adherence by a list of indicators. Outcomes will be compared by scores of GPs and Nurse Practitioners (measured in previous research).</description>

    <description>Patient satisfaction will be measured using an abridgment of the CQ-index questionnaire. During the intervention period 200 questionnaires will be sent to patients who had either a consult with the PA or with the GP at the out-of-hours primary care service. Results will be compared with results on the CQ-index of the GP and NP (measured in previous research)</description>
