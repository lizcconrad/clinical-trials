  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease where genetics play an important role in
      predisposing children to early onset obesity. Though many obesity susceptible genes and
      variants have been identified with obesity, the most common obesity gene, MC4R only accounts
      for 5% of all early onset obesity cases. This implies that there may be more obesity related
      genes and variants that need to be unravelled to further delineate the relationship between
      obesity and genetics. The investigators propose in screening the exonic regions of all the
      genes in obese subjects using whole-exome sequencing (WES) to discover novel obesity related
      variants and genes.

      Primary hypothesis The investigators hypothesized that our paediatric subjects with
      early-onset severe obesity will have strong genetic predisposition and therefore the cohort
      would be enriched with obesity susceptibility genetic variants.

      Secondary hypothesis The investigators hypothesized that there is increasing prevalence of,
      and possibly worsening, obesity-related complications (namely glucose intolerance,
      hypertension, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) in our severely obese
      children, as compared to 15 years ago, due to an increasingly obesogenic environment
      promoting unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits.

      Number of subjects to be enrolled:

      As our study aims to identify susceptible genetic variants associated with early onset
      obesity, we will be recruiting 400 obese children to participate in this genetic study, in
      addition to the existing DNA samples we collected in a previous study (DSRB Ref C/00/501).
      These 400 obese children will be recruited through NUH paediatric clinic and School Health
      Clinic at Health Promotion Board. We will also recruit family members of the obese children
      who are interested to join the research study. We will be using the DNA samples and
      information of 250 obese children previously recruited to the Obesity Genetic Study from
      January 2000 to December 2004 (DSRB Ref C/00/501). We will also be performing WES on 500 lean
      adults (as controls) recruited for an ongoing study titled &quot;Whole exome sequencing to
      identify genes for extreme Myopia in Asian populations&quot; (NUS-IRB reference code: 12-466).

      Total number of new obese children subjects to be recruited: 400 Total number of family
      members (Parents and siblings): 500 Total number of existing obese children subjects to be
      used: 250 Total number of existing lean adult controls to be used: 500

      Criteria for Recruitment:

      The doctor will ask a few simple questions regarding the age and medical history of subjects.

      For obese subjects: Overweight before 10 years of age, and the body weight is 40% above the
      ideal body weight for height, or BMI for age above 97th percentile without any major medical
      illness.

      For family members: Parents or direct siblings of obese children (no selection criteria) For
      controls: Lean adults of ongoing study (NUS-IRB reference code: 12-466) with BMI between 18.5
      kg/m2 and 23 kg/m2

      Inclusion Criteria:

      The obese subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this
      study:

        1. Ideal body weight for height (WFH) of at least 140% or BMI for age above 97th percentile

        2. Overweight before 10 years of age

        3. Informed consent from both obese children subject and legal representative e.g. parents

      Family member must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study:

        1. Must be parent or direct sibling of obese subject

        2. Informed consent from both subject and parent is subject is below 21 years of age

      Exclusion Criteria:

      All subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from
      participation:

        1. Unfit for blood testing and OGTT testing

        2. No informed consent

      Withdrawal Criteria:

      The study may be discontinued if:

        -  No OSHE approval

        -  No DSRB approval

        -  Complaints of any inappropriate procedures performed on subjects

        -  Laboratory toxicity

      Study Visits and Procedures:

        1. Screening Visits and Procedures The subject will be screened at the school health clinic
           at HPB or NUH paediatric clinic. The subject's age, weight and height will be taken.
           Only those who the doctor determined to have an ideal body weight for height of greater
           than 140% or BMI for age at greater than 97th percentile of the local children
           population will be invited for the study. The subject will be allowed to go home with
           the consent form and reply within 3 months before recruitment.

        2. Study Visits and Procedures Study visit 1: Trained doctor will carry out an interview
           regarding the medical history if the subject and performed physical examination. 15ml of
           blood will be drawn from the subject (after overnight fasting) for testing of liver
           panel, lipid panel, fasting insulin level, fasting C-peptide level. The subject will
           also go through an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) where 2ml of blood will be drawn
           at both 0 min and 120min time-interval during OGTT. During the 2 hr OGTT, the subjects
           will be required to fill in 3 sets of questionnaire regarding motivational level,
           socio-economic status and physical activity and diet.

           The family member of the obese subject is required to go through all testing as
           described above for the subject except that they do not need to undergo OGTT.

        3. Final Study Visit:

           The final study visit will be scheduled 2-3 weeks after the first visit. The screening
           report of the subject will be reviewed and evaluated by the attending doctor to the
           subject.

        4. Post Study Follow up and Procedures The subject will be able to keep a copy of their
           health screening test reports. For subjects who are found to suffer from medical
           conditions such as dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, high body fat percentage, liver
           malfunction or glucose intolerance, they will be referred to other departments for
           further testing and medical attention to confirm outcome measures. Subjects found to
           have a rare genetic variant through genetic testing will also be called back for further
           and repeat clinical examination and testing.

        5. Discontinuation Visit and Procedures Subjects may withdraw voluntarily from
           participation in the study at any time. The biological samples of the subject will be
           discarded upon the request of the subject. However, if the patient was found to be
           suffering from any other complications during the study health screening, they will be
           advised and referred to other departments for medical treatment.

      Data Quality Assurance:

      The electronic input of patients' data into the system will be handled by 2 research
      coordinators who will perform the data entry independently. Thus, data of each subject will
      be entered twice into the system by the 2 independent research coordinators. We will do a
      system comparison between the 2 entries for per subject to ensure that all information of the
      subject was entered correctly and accurately. The principal investigator will also randomly
      check through the system every month for data quality assurance.

      Data Entry and Storage:

      The clinical testing data and questionnaire will be entered by the subjects on paper. The
      paper documentations will be transferred or transported back to the PI's office and each
      subject's data will be entered electronically by 2 independent research coordinators to
      ensure data quality assurance. All electronic entry of the documentations can only be
      performed within the office using the office computer and all paper documentations must be
      returned for lock-up at the end of the day. The electronic documentations will be password
      protected and the hard copy of the paper documentations will be stored in a lock and key
      access cabinet in PI's office. Briefly discuss where data will be entered (i.e. will these
      entries be on paper or electronically), stored and handled.

      Determination of Sample Size:

      Power calculations were carried out using Quanto (ver 1.2.4). To detect variants at a power
      of odd ratios of 2.0-5.0 in the discovery stage at varying MAF (α=0.01), the sample size of
      400 obese children is approximately 51% to 98% power to detect variants with large effects
      (OR = 3.5) in our discovery stage, at MAF between 0.5% and 3.0%, respectively (α=0.01).

      Statistical and Analytical Plans:

      All prioritized damaging non-synonymous variants will be tested for statistical association
      in a case-control design using SPSS. The 2-tailed Fisher's exact test will be utilized for
      variants with MAF &lt; 3% and logistic regression, adjusting for sex will be performed for
      variants with MAF ≥ 3%. These will be done using PLINK. We will also carry out a gene-level
      burden tests using the Sequencing Kernel Association Test (SKAT) software. All single-variant
      and gene-level results will be corrected for multiple tests using a Bonferonni correction.
      Any variants identified by prediction tool (Polyphen2) to be highly disruptive (defined as
      nonsense, splice site and frameshift changes, which severely disrupt protein structure) will
      be prioritized for validations.

      Statistical analyses of de novo genotyping data will be similar to that in primary aim 1.
      Subsequently, we will meta-analyse data from the discovery and validation stages using an
      inverse variance-weighted method, assuming a fixed-effect model, to derive overall pooled
      estimates and two-sided p-values. Heterogeneity checks will be conducted (Cochran's Q and I2
      indices), and at variants where significant (Q p-value &lt;0.05 and/or I2 index &gt;40%)
      heterogeneity is detected the meta-analysis will be carried out in the random effects mode as
      well.

      RETENTION OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS:

      The records for all participants which include the medical history, clinical report, blood
      test results, questionnaire, OSHE documentation, IRB documentation and DSRB documentation
      will be kept by the principal investigator in a lock-up cabinet in his card access office.
      Only the principal investigator will hold the key and have direct access to the lock-up
      cabinet. These documents will be retained for a period of 6years after the end of the
      research study.

      For Principal Investigator initiated Trials:

      All serious adverse events (SAEs) that are unexpected and related to the study drug must be
      reported to HSA.

      &quot;A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence
      at any dose that:

        -  Results in death.

        -  Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death).

        -  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.

        -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.

        -  Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.

        -  Is a Medically important event.

      Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is an
      important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life threatening
      and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may
      jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse
      event outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.&quot;

      All SAEs that are unexpected and related to the study drug will be reported. The investigator
      is responsible for informing HSA no later than 15 calendar days after first knowledge that
      the case qualifies for expedited reporting. Follow-information will be actively sought and
      submitted as it becomes available. For fatal or life-threatening cases, HSA will be notified
      as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after first knowledge that a case
      qualifies, followed by a complete report within 8 additional calendar days.
