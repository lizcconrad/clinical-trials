      Smoking-related diseases contribute to the death of more than 37,000 Canadians annually. Of
      that number, almost one-third die of cardiovascular-related causes. Smoking cessation can
      decrease the additional risk of heart disease by 50% after 1 year. However, even using
      smoking cessation therapies, only 10-20% of smokers will be able to successfully quit smoking
      long-term. Therefore, new and alternative treatments are needed.

      The e-cigarette is a battery-powered device approximately the size and shape of a cigarette
      that creates a smoke-free vapour which is inhaled by the user. Since it feels like smoking a
      cigarette, using the e-cigarette may help some smokers quit. Some e-cigarettes also contain
      nicotine, which can reduce withdrawal symptoms from quitting smoking. However, e-cigarettes
      have not been approved for use for smoking cessation by Health Canada or the FDA. Despite
      this, these devices are rising in popularity. A recent US Centers for Disease Control survey
      found that of smokers who were motivated to quit within the next 6 months, 48.5% had tried
      e-cigarettes.

      The Evaluating the Efficacy of E-Cigarette Use for Smoking Cessation (E3) Trial will be the
      first large trial to address the important issue of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in
      Canada. The trial will randomly assign participants to receive nicotine e-cigarettes and
      minimal counseling, non-nicotine e-cigarettes and minimal counseling, or only minimal
      counseling for 12 weeks. Participants will then be followed for one year to see which (if
      any) group is more likely to have quit or reduced their smoking. Information about potential
      side effects and safety will also be collected. The E3 Trial will provide law-makers and the
      public with important information about the use of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation.

      I. OVERALL STUDY OBJECTIVE The Evaluating the Efficacy of E-Cigarette use for Smoking
      Cessation (E3) Trial is a 5-year, multi-centre, randomized controlled trial (RCT) that seeks
      to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of nicotine and non-nicotine electronic
      cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for smoking cessation in the general population.

      II. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

        1. To compare the efficacy of nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarettes used with individual
           counselling for smoking cessation, to that of individual counselling alone, in terms of
           biochemically-validated 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 52 weeks.

        2. To examine the effect of nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarettes on other measures of
           smoking reduction and cessation, including continuous abstinence and daily cigarette
           consumption at 4, 12, 24, and 52 weeks.

        3. To describe the safety and tolerability of nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarettes in
           terms of serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events (AEs), drop-out rates due to side
           effects, and therapy adherence over the 12 week treatment period.

      I. RATIONALE Smoking-related diseases contribute to the death of more than 37,000 Canadians
      annually. Of that number, almost one-third die of cardiovascular-related causes. Smoking
      cessation can decrease the additional risk of heart disease by 50% after one year of
      abstinence. However, even using traditional smoking cessation therapies, only 10-20% of
      smokers will be able to successfully quit smoking long-term. Therefore, new and alternative
      treatments are needed. The e-cigarette is a battery-powered device approximately the size and
      shape of a cigarette that creates a smoke-free vapour that is inhaled by the user, and is
      available in nicotine and non-nicotine varieties. Its mimicry of the act of smoking gives it
      the potential to target the habit-forming mechanism of smoking, and to mitigate withdrawal
      symptoms with nicotine replacement (in the case of nicotine e-cigarettes). However,
      e-cigarettes have not been approved for use for smoking cessation by Health Canada or the US
      Food and Drug Administration. Despite this, these devices are rising in popularity. A recent
      survey found that of smokers motivated to within 6 months, 48.5% had tried e-cigarettes. The
      E3 Trial will be the first conducted in the general population of Canadian smokers motivated
      to quit. It will also provide the longest-term (52 weeks) follow-up data on smoking reduction
      and cessation in smokers motivated to quit with the e-cigarette.

      II. METHODS The investigators will conduct a multi-centre RCT with a treatment period of 12
      weeks and follow-up of 52 weeks. A total of 486 participants will be randomized to one of
      three treatment arms: (1) nicotine e-cigarettes with individual counselling, (2) non-nicotine
      e-cigarettes with individual counselling, or (3) individual counselling alone. Eligible
      participants will be recruited from the general population, be at least 18 years of age, will
      self-identify as regular smokers (â‰¥10 cigarettes per day for at least one year), and be
      motivated to quit. Participants will complete telephone follow-ups at weeks 1, 2, and 8. The
      participants will also return for clinic visits at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 52.
      Biochemically-validated smoking abstinence will be measured at all clinic visits using
      exhaled carbon monoxide. At follow-up calls and visits, the investigators will collect
      information about self-reported smoking, e-cigarette use, withdrawal symptoms, and side
      effects. The primary analysis will compare point-prevalence abstinence at 52 weeks between
      participants randomized to nicotine e-cigarettes versus individual counselling alone. Similar
      analyses will be conducted to compare abstinence across other trial arms. With 162
      participants per arm, this trial will have 80% power to detect a 12% or greater difference in
      abstinence. In secondary analyses, the investigators will examine point-prevalence abstinence
      at other follow-ups, as well as the effect of treatment group on continuous abstinence, daily
      cigarette consumption, and the occurrence of clinical events and side effects.

      III. SIGNIFICANCE E-cigarettes are popular devices that may have the potential to facilitate
      smoking cessation. The E3 Trial will provide regulators, health care professionals, and
      smokers with important information about the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes for smoking
      cessation.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 52 weeks. Smoking abstinence for this measure is defined as self-report smoking abstinence for the previous 7 days, and a measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide less than 11 ppm, at 52 weeks.
The primary end point will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.This ITT analysis assumes that those who withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up had returned to smoking at their baseline rates. This assumption is common in smoking cessation trials.</description>

A SAE is defined as an adverse event which requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, that causes congenital malformation, that results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, that is life-threatening, or that results in death.
These SAEs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and Health Canada, as appropriate. The DSMB will provide oversight of safety and will establish stopping criteria for the trial at their first meeting. An Endpoints Evaluation Committee will be responsible for the evaluation and classification of all SAEs.</description>

    <description>As with standard nicotine replacement therapies, participants are expected to self-regulate administration of nicotine e-cigarettes according to their withdrawal symptoms. The manufacturer recommends each vaping session to last approximately 10 puffs, with one puff every 30 seconds over a span of approximately 4.5 minutes.
Smoking cessation/relapse prevention counselling will be provided for a minimum of 30 minutes at baseline, 10 minutes during telephone follow-ups, and 15 minutes at clinic visits (20 minutes at week 4). Counselling will consist of a number of approaches, including reviewing smoking history, development/revision of a quit plan, encouragement of self-monitoring, review of triggers and challenges, and skill development.</description>
