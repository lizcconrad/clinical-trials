  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of removal of the
      calcification in calcific tendinitis of the shoulder (supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus
      tendon) by aspiration with a needle and syringe (barbotage) and a corticosteroid injection is
      more effective than corticosteroid or sham injection alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Barbotage is a sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration and lavage of the
      calcium deposit in calcific tendinitis of the shoulder. Persisting pain in cacific tendinitis
      is considered to be a consequence of increased tendon volume or changed tendon texture in the
      area of the calcification which leads to secondary impingement and inflammation.
      Consequently, removal of the deposit should be a causal treatment measure.

      Scientific evidence for the efficacy of the barbotage procedure in patients with persistent
      symptoms from calcific tendinitis is still limited. The cyclic often self-limiting course of
      the disease, and an anticipated placebo effect, questions about the method's efficacy can
      only be answered by high-quality randomized studies. In this trial the investigators want to
      randomize a cohort of patients to (1) Ultrasound guided needling, lavage and subacromial
      steroid injection, (2) Ultrasound guided subacromial steroid injection or (3) Ultrasound
      guided lidocain injection (sham). The investigators want to follow the patients over two
      years with repeated testing with a set of validated outcome measures together with radiologic
      re-examinations. The investigators want to find out whether the active treatments (1, 2) are
      more effective than the sham treatment and whether there are differences in outcome between
      the two active treatments. To increase the generalizability of the investigators' results,
      the investigators want to perform the study as a multi-centre study.

    <description>A 18-gauge needle connected to a 5 ml syringe with 4 ml of saline solution will be used to puncture the calcification with freehand technique and under constant sonographic monitoring. With the tip of the needle placed in the center of the deposit, the calcification will be flushed. Finally, a new 21-gauge needle will be introduced into the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa and 9 ml of 1% Lidocain hydrochlorid and 1 ml (20 mg) of Triamcinolon will be injected into the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa. All patients will be instructed by a physioteherapist in home exercises.</description>
