  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the quality of generic metoprolol extended-release (ER) (Toprol XL,
      Activas,Wockhardt) products has been called into question with reports of inconsistent
      effects when switching from the brand name product to a generic formulation. Problems with
      how the body processes these drugs could have serious and widespread consequences given the
      high frequency of metoprolol ER use in the management of various cardiovascular disorders,
      including high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cardiac
      arrhythmias. Investigators hypothesize that both product- and subject-specific factors lead
      to variability in the way the body breaks down the drug (pharmacokinetics) and clinical
      response to generic versus name brand metoprolol ER formulation. Investigators will study the
      brand name and generic metoprolol ER formulations in subjects with high blood pressure to
      compare the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular responses among equivalent labeled doses of
      each product.

      The study objective is to provide information on how the body breaks down generic and brand
      name metoprolol ER products (pharmacokinetics) and how the body responds to generic and brand
      name metoprolol ER products (pharmacodynamics) to better understand if generic metoprolol ER
      products are as good as the brand name product.

      As a participant in this study the following will happen.

      A study nurse will draw 3 teaspoonfuls (15 ml) of blood. Two teaspoons (10ml) will be drawn
      for basic blood work and one teaspoon (5ml) will be drawn for genotyping. The study
      physician, Dr. Sigfried Schmidt will perform a physical exam and discuss all medical history.

      The study will be randomized to one of two groups like flipping a coin.

        -  Study Group A- start with Toprol XL, switch to Wockhardt metoprolol, switch back to
           Toprol XL, then switch to Activas metoprolol

        -  Study Group B- start with Toprol XL, switch to Activas metoprolol, switch back to Toprol
           XL, then switch to Wockhardt metoprolol.

      Each study group will consist of treatment with Toprol XL for 2 periods, treatment with
      Wockhardt metoprolol for one period, and treatment with Activas metoprolol for one period.
      The generic drug periods will be in a different order for each study group. During the times
      the switch will take place the following tests will be performed: 24-hour pharmacokinetic
      parameters, 24-hour heart rate, 24-hour blood pressure, 24-hour holter monitor, exercise
      treadmill to induced heart rate, and a 24-hour gastric pH through SmartPill Capsule.
