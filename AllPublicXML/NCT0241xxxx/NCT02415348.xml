  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if the Fibroscan (Echosens, Paris), a non-invasive,
      ultrasound-based device used to estimate fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease,
      interferes with implanted cardiac pacemaker and/or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.
      Recruitment consists of a total of 200 outpatients undergoing routine pacemaker interrogation
      at a teaching-hospital pacemaker clinic.

    <textblock>
      Assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases provides staging and
      prognostic information critical in establishing treatment priorities. The gold standard
      evaluation of liver fibrosis is hampered by the invasive nature of liver biopsies. FibroScan
      is a non-invasive alternative that has been extensively validated in chronic hepatitis C,
      chronic hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease, and non- alcoholic fatty liver disease
      patients.

      To avoid unknown risks of potential interaction, the manufacturer have advised against the
      use of the device in patients with active implantable medical device including cardiac
      pacemaker and/or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators(ICD). Review of the literature
      showed that these two population have been specifically excluded in all previously reported
      studies.

      At the time of writing, no specific reports have demonstrated either safety or potential harm
      of the FibroScan in patients with pacemaker/ICD. Given the proven benefit of the FibroScan in
      chronic liver disease and the current policy of excluding patients with pacemaker/ICD in
      clinical practice, this study aims to formally evaluate the safe use of the FibroScan in this
      population within the controlled environment of a pacemaker lab.
