  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence is a frequent pathology which concerns 10% of the general population and
      severely alters patients quality of life. The cost of urinary and faecal incontinence has
      been estimated to be $16 billions a year. Several treatments exist depending on the aetiology
      of the faecal incontinence: medical treatments, biofeedback and sacral nerve stimulation.
      Nevertheless, these treatments are not always effective (50-70% of success) and are not
      without side effects, particularly the sacral nerve stimulation (pain, infection, electrode
      displacement..).

      The intravesical injections of botulinum toxin have been used for several years for the
      treatment of urinary incontinence with overactive bladder. Several randomized trials have
      demonstrated the efficacy of these injections in patients with neurological disorders and
      overactive bladder, as well as in idiopathic overactive bladder. The toxin injections in the
      detrusor muscle increase the compliance and the bladder capacity and delay the initial
      appearance of detrusor uninhibited contraction. Furthermore, botulinum toxin decreases the
      urinary urgency. It maybe secondary to the reduction of the amplitude of the detrusor
      uninhibited contraction as well as to a direct effect of toxin on sensory pelvic nerve
      afferents.

      The botulinum toxin should play a role on motor afferents as well as on the sensory function
      of efferent nerves.

      The hypothesis is to demonstrate a decrease of active faecal incontinence and/or urgency
      episodes with improvement in quality of life, without any major side effects, in the patients
      included in this study. Nevertheless, the benefit of toxin injections are known to be
      temporary because of nerve re-growth. If we obtain similar results for fecal incontinence, it
      would be possible to schedule one to two injections a year because of the limited
      side-effects and invasiveness of the rectal injections.
