    <textblock>
      Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is an important option for patients with end-stage
      liver disease requiring liver transplantation. When performing LDLT, the safety and well
      being of donors is of the utmost importance. The conventional incision for donor hepatectomy
      is a right subcostal incision with a midline extension up to xiphoid. Minimally invasive
      liver surgery throughout a single 10 cm upper midline incision without laparoscopic
      assistance has been widely applied and considered to be safe and effective. Recently,
      laparoscopic and minimally invasive living donor hepatectomy via transverse incision has been
      suggested to reduce morbidity and the invasiveness of living donor hepatectomy. Although
      minimally invasive approach has become the surgical method of choice for many transplant
      centers, little data on comparing the impact of all three different type incision in living
      liver donors. In our center, the investigators have adopted three different incision
      according to surgical teams. The investigators undertook this study with the aims of
      comparing the pain and quality of life of donors according to type of three different
      incisions and assessing any benefits to the donor due to the smaller midline incision during
      the early postoperative period.

        different surgical technique. The living liver donors underwent hepatectomy using three
