  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study further evaluates the safety profile and efficacy of the Ellipse IM HTO Nail
      system in subjects with osteoarthritis and varus malalignment of the knee. All subjects will
      receive treatment with the Ellipse IM HTO Nail System and followed for six months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Ellipse IM HTO Nail is intended for open wedge proximal tibial osteotomies. The Ellipse
      IM HTO Nail is an intramedullary nail that operates on the principles of distraction
      osteogenesis.

      The Ellipse IM HTO Nail is used in valgizing HTO procedures to correct varus malalignment.
      The Ellipse IM HTO Nail is surgically placed in the intramedullary canal of the tibia. It is
      lengthened telescopically using the non-invasive external remote control.
