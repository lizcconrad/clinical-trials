      The coprecipitation method was used to prepare hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin complexed with
      insulin (HPβCD-I) by mixing insulin with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) in the molar
      ratio of 1:5 with the addition of 10 mL of purified water for every 100 mg of the complex.
      After complete dissolution of the material, the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room
      temperature (25°C), then left to rest for 60 min and lyophilized.

      The gel was prepared by dispersing the Carbopol 940® polymer in a known amount of purified
      water. Under mild heating the methylparaben (0.02%, w/v), propylparaben (0.01%, w/v) and
      propylene glycol were dissolved and incorporated in the dispersion of Carbopol 940® and left
      to rest for a period of 12h. After this time, the prepared gel was stirred and pH corrected
      to a range of 5.0 to 7.0 with triethanolamine. A set amount of insulin and the HPβCD-I
      complex were incorporated into the control gel for the preparation of other formulations.

      A randomized, double-blind, prospective clinical trial was conducted from March 2013 to April
      2014 at the Hospital Universitário Regional de Maringá (HUM), Paraná, Brazil, in order to
      determine the safety and efficacy of gel in patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit.

      Hyperglycemic volunteers and those with pressure ulcers other than grade II were excluded
      from the study. Grade II pressure ulcers were selected as they are a superficial lesion, with
      little tissue loss, and allow easy visualization of healing.

      A letter of free and informed consent was obtained. The study was conducted with each patient
      for a period of 15 days.

      The volunteers were divided equally into three groups A, B and C, with each group being
      formed by five volunteers (n=5). Group A was randomly selected for treatment with gel with
      HPβCD-I complex, group B for treatment with gel with insulin, and group C with the control
      gel.

      Blood glucose tests were performed in order to assess whether the insulin complexed or
      otherwise with HPβCD could cause an increase in the rate of insulin in the blood in patients,
      leading to hypoglycemia.

      An identical standardized procedure for gel placement was used for all patients. Initially,
      the pressure ulcer was cleaned with saline. With the aid of a paper ruler, the ulcer was
      measured and photographed, as the ruler included the date and the initials of the patient.
      After measuring, a quantity of 5 grams of gel was placed on the pressure ulcer and covered
      with sterile gauze and a transparent film.

      The curative was changed once a day during the treatment period, unless there was leakage of
      fluid, contamination, or signs of infection. Every three days the pressure ulcers of all
      patients were measured and photographed again, resulting in a total of six measurements per
      patient. The photos of pressure ulcers were evaluated for measurement of pressure ulcers and
      any kind of irritation. At the end of this stage, the properly gathered study data was
      interpreted using the analysis software Mobile Wound Analyzer® (MOWA).

      Data was evaluated by variance analysis (ANOVA), and means were compared with the Tukey test
      (p &lt; 0.05) using the software Statistica 8.0/2008 (Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, USA).

      Mixed model repeated measures methodology with some covariance structures was adopted for
      statistical analysis of the clinical trial (p &lt; 0.05). The Statistical Analysis System (SAS)
      for Windows, version 9.3 (SAS Inc., Chicago, IL) program was used for statistical analysis.

    <description>Every three days the pressure ulcers (PUs) of all patients were measured and photographed again, resulting in a total of six measurements per patient. The photos were evaluated for measurement of PUs and any kind of irritation. At the end of this stage, the properly gathered study data was interpreted using the analysis software Mobile Wound Analyzer® (MOWA). Healing efficacy indices (% EI) were calculated as percentage reduction in the wound size at days 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 from treatment beginning (d0). The % EI of the wound size was calculated by the following equation: %EI= ((Vsp.day-Vi)/Vi))x100. Vsp.day refers to the diameter (mm) values measured at day 3, 6, 9,12 and 15, while Vi refers to the baseline value measured before treatment (d0). The most representative result of treatment efficacy was observed on day 15, therefore it was used to calculate the % EI. For each group assessed, it was calculated the mean % EI of the five patients, resulting in a single value.</description>

    <description>Dosages were provided four times daily (04h, 10h, 16h and 22h) to each patient during the 15-day study period, giving a total of 60 doses. To obtain these dosages, a drop of blood of patients was placed on a colorimetric strip and blood glucose was measured with the use of an Accu Check Active® glucose meter. The mean of 60 dosages was calculated for each patient at the end of 15 days. For each group assessed, it was calculated the mean of the measurements of the five patients, resulting in a single value.</description>

        <title>Efficacy Index (%EI)</title>
        <description>Every three days the pressure ulcers (PUs) of all patients were measured and photographed again, resulting in a total of six measurements per patient. The photos were evaluated for measurement of PUs and any kind of irritation. At the end of this stage, the properly gathered study data was interpreted using the analysis software Mobile Wound Analyzer® (MOWA). Healing efficacy indices (% EI) were calculated as percentage reduction in the wound size at days 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 from treatment beginning (d0). The % EI of the wound size was calculated by the following equation: %EI= ((Vsp.day-Vi)/Vi))x100. Vsp.day refers to the diameter (mm) values measured at day 3, 6, 9,12 and 15, while Vi refers to the baseline value measured before treatment (d0). The most representative result of treatment efficacy was observed on day 15, therefore it was used to calculate the % EI. For each group assessed, it was calculated the mean % EI of the five patients, resulting in a single value.</description>

        <population>Brazilian, bedridden, of both genders, aged between 45 and 75 years old and diabetic or not. Hyperglycemic volunteers and those with pressure ulcers other than grade II were excluded from the study. Grade II pressure ulcers were selected as they are a superficial lesion, with little tissue loss, and allow easy visualization of healing.</population>

Gel with HPβCD-I complex: Initially, the pressure ulcer was cleaned with saline. With the aid of a paper ruler, the ulcer was measured and photographed, as the ruler included the date and the initials of the patient. After measuring, a quantity of 5 grams of gel with HPβCD-I complex was placed on the pressure ulcer and covered with sterile gauze and a transparent film.
The curative was changed once a day during the treatment period, unless there was leakage of fluid, contamination, or signs of infection. Every three days the pressure ulcers of all patients were measured and photographed again, resulting in a total of six measurements per patient.
