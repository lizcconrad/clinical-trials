  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the functional recovery of patients undergoing Total Knee
      Arthroplasty based on the administration of an adductor canal block during their anesthesia
      treatment

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The period after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery is known to be painful for the first 24
      hours, lasting up to 3 days in many cases. Successful management of pain after TKR is
      regarded as necessary to early recovery, rehabilitation and timely discharge. Severe pain
      following major joint arthroplasty can hinder early rehabilitation, may result in prolonged
      hospitalization and is a strong predictor of persistent pain beyond 3 months. Adequate
      analgesia following TKR is paramount to early recovery, rehabilitation and timely discharge.
      Therefore early postoperative analgesic and rehabilitation goals are intricately related.

      Until now, different methods of pain treatment have been used, including intravenous narcotic
      pain medication, continuous femoral nerve block (numbing medication to a nerve in the thigh)
      and epidural analgesia (identical to the numbing method for childbirth). These are all
      effective methods but each is limited by side effects. In recent years, research has focused
      on administering local anesthetic further down in the leg, trying to minimize quadriceps
      muscle weakness while giving adequate pain relief after surgery. Local Infiltration Analgesia
      (LIA) and Adductor Canal Block (ACB) are examples of new farther sites of administration.

      The purpose of this study is to determine which combination of analgesic interventions is the
      most effective treatment for pain and improvement in functional outcome for TKR.
