  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to preliminarily evaluate the effects of Tai Chi - a
      mind-body exercise - on motor and cognitive function as well as quality of life in
      individuals recently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining individuals with PD
      into a 6-month randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi exercise.

      Specific Aim 2: To collect preliminary data on the efficacy of Tai Chi on improving gait and
      balance dynamics, physical and cognitive function, exercise activity, self-efficacy, mood,
      and quality of life in individuals with PD.
