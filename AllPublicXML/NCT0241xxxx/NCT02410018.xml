  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pilot, open-label, uncontrolled, safety and effectiveness study of
      uterine artery embolization with OCL 503 in women with leiomyomata who are scheduled for
      hysterectomy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be allocated to Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. Following pelvic angiogram to delineate
      the uterine vasculature, embolization procedures of the left and right uterine arteries (as
      required) will be performed on each patient, using OCL 503 as the embolic agent. Patients in
      Cohort 1 will proceed to hysterectomy 1 week after embolization, and patients in Cohort 2
      will undergo hysterectomy 1 month after embolization. Tumor response, as measured by changes
      in leiomyomata size and perfusion, will be determined by MRI/MRA. Histology of the resected
      uterus will be conducted to evaluate inflammatory response and viable tumour tissue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of one or more of the following symptoms: abnormal menstrual bleeding,
             prolonged menstrual period, pelvic pain, or bulk-related symptoms that are attributed
             to uterine fibroids (bulk-related symptoms include pelvic pressure, abdominal
             distension, abdominal bloating, constipation, backache, urinary frequency, urinary
             retention, ureteral dilation, and rectal pressure), and the intensity of uterine
             fibroid-related symptoms, which are sufficiently sever to warrant hysterectomy, and
             the patient's medical history, physical examination, and the results of imaging by
             ultrasound or MRI;
