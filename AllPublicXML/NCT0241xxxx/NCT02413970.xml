  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm study conducted under a common protocol. Each
      subject will serve as their own control. Each subject will be followed for 5 years from date
      of implant.

      Potential study subjects will be considered for study participation and consented once
      pre-implant screening and implant qualification process have been completed. This includes an
      in-lab PSG, surgical consultation, and a drug-induced sleep endoscopy procedure.

      This study will collect pre-operative baseline data including, verification of ineffective
      CPAP treatment, PSG information, medical history and subject quality of life measures. Intra-
      and post- operative procedure data will be collected.

      Post-implant, procedure- and device-related adverse events, QoL questionnaires, Functional
      Tongue Exam, therapy usage and device adjustment data will be collected. In-lab PSG sleep
      study data will be collected during the 2-month and 1 &amp; 3 year follow-up visits, home sleep
      tests will be conducted and data collected at the 6-month and 2, 4, &amp; 5 year follow-up
      visits.

      The subject population will consist of otherwise healthy men and women that are at least 22
      years old and have: 1) Provided written informed consent to participate, 2) Indicated a
      willingness to comply with the study requirements for the specified follow-up duration, and
      3) Met all inclusion and exclusion criteria of this protocol.

      Up to 127 subjects will be implanted at a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20 qualified sites
      in the United States.
