  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study the safety and immune response of people who
      receive a personalized dendritic cell vaccine with the intention of stimulating the immune
      system to react to lung cancer cells.

    <textblock>
      Tumor vaccines represent a promising area of clinical investigation in solid tumors based on
      evidence of clinical activity and minimal toxicity. The underlying hypothesis of this
      research is that immunization against tumor neoantigens is effectively required to elicit
      antigen-reactive T cells capable of recognizing and eliminating cancer. Moreover, both
      quantitative and qualitative improvements in CD8 immunity are necessary (but not sufficient)
      for clinical response and improved survival. The goal of this study is to build on our prior
      clinical trial results in melanoma by studying the immune response to tumor neoantigens in
      patients with stage 1 NSCLC.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunological response as measured by increased numbers of peptide specific CD8+ T cells as calculated by the tetramer assay</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>-Blood for immunological response is drawn every week from Dose #1 to 6 weeks after Dose #3 (Day 1 to Day 126 = Week 18 and then every 4 weeks until Day 365)</description>

    <measure>Safety and tolerability of vaccine as measured by adverse events experienced and graded by NCI CTCAE Version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after last vaccine (approximately Day 115)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be closely monitored after vaccination. Patients will be observed for 2 hours after the first dose and vital signs recorded every 30 minutes during that time period beginning at the start of the infusion. For each dose thereafter, patients will be observed in the treatment area for 30 minutes after the infusion. The following parameters will be assessed:
Local signs and symptoms
Systemic signs and symptoms
Laboratory evaluations
Adverse and serious adverse events
Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI's CTCAE version 4.0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>These patients have been completed resected so there is no tumor response to monitor. CT scans evaluating for progression will be performed at baseline, following the third vaccine dose, and as per routine care during follow-up (generally every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months for the next 4 years thereafter).</description>
