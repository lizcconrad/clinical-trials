  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label fixed dose phase Ib of anti-CEA CAR-T cells hepatic artery infusions
      and yttrium-90 SIR-Spheres in patients with CEA-expressing liver metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergo leukapheresis from which peripheral blood mononuclear cells are purified. T
      cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
      specific for CEA. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the patient by percutaneous
      hepatic artery infusion at specific cell doses. Prior to the first dose, each patient will
      undergo diagnostic angiography to verify suitable arterial anatomy. Three anti-CEA CAR-T
      doses and one SIR-Sphere dose per patient are planned at 2-week intervals. Low dose
      interleukin-2 will be given via an ambulatory infusion pump for 6 weeks.Normal liver and
      tumor biopsies will be obtained at the time of the initial diagnostic angiogram and during
      the final infusion session.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with histologically confirmed diagnosis of CEA+ adenocarcinoma and liver
             metastases. Patient must have either histologic confirmation of the liver metastases
             or histologic documentation of the primary tumor and definitive radiologic evidence of
             liver involvement. Measurable disease is required with lesions of &gt; 1.0 cm by CT.
             Soluble CEA is not acceptable as the sole measure of disease. Limited extrahepatic
             disease is acceptable if confined to the lungs or peritoneal cavity.

          -  Tumor must be CEA-expressing as demonstrated by elevated serum CEA levels (≥10ng/ml)
             or immunohistochemistry on a biopsy specimen. Archived tissue is acceptable for
             determination of CEA expression.

          -  Patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patient able to understand and sign informed consent.
