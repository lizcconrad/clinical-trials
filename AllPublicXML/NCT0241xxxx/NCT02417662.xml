      The trial will assess the addition of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to standard
      chemotherapy in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be
      randomised to receive either standard treatment alone (platinum-based doublet chemotherapy)
      or standard treatment with conventional radiotherapy (RT) and SABR.

      SARON is a confirmatory phase III study examining the efficacy and safety of stereotactic
      ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and conventional radiotherapy (RT) alongside standard
      chemotherapy in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      Current treatment for this group of patients is platinum-based doublet chemotherapy alone.
      There is sufficient evidence regarding the safety of SABR, its effect on local control and a
      possible impact on overall survival. This trial will further examine overall survival,
      progression free survival and local control, as well as toxicity, feasibility, patient
      reported outcomes and health resource use.

      There will be a feasibility analysis performed after 50 patients have been randomised. This
      will assess the practicality of achieving recruitment targets, logistics of delivering the
      experimental treatment and the potential for contamination (as patients may seek SABR outside
      of the trial if randomised to the non SABR arm). There will also be a parallel thoracic SABR
      safety and feasibility study after recruitment and treatment of 20 patients with thoracic
      metastases.

      This is a multicentre randomised phase III study based on patients with oligometastatic
      NSCLC.

      Trial arms:

      Control Arm: standard treatment alone (platinum-based doublet chemotherapy) Experimental Arm:
      standard treatment plus radical RT to primary and SABR and/or SRS to metastases
