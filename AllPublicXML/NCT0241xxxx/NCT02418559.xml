  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      JNJ-63623872 following oral administration of single ascending dose of JNJ-63623872 in
      healthy Japanese adult participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (test or experiment in which neither the person giving the treatment
      nor the patient knows which treatment the patient is receiving), placebo-controlled,
      randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance) and single-center study of
      JNJ-63623872. The duration of study will be approximately 5.5 weeks for each ISO per
      participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening Phase (28 days before study commences
      on Day 1); double-blind Treatment Phase (single oral dose of JNJ-63623872 or placebo on Day 1
      under fasted condition); and Follow up Phase (up to 7-10 days after study drug
      administration). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups.
      The planned doses will be escalated in a stepwise fashion if the safety and tolerability in
      the preceding dose is found acceptable. Participants in Group 1 will receive JNJ-63623872 300
      milligram (mg) or placebo, Group 2 will receive JNJ-63623872 600 mg or placebo and Group 3
      will receive JNJ-63623872 1200 mg or placebo. Study drug will be administered following a
      10-hour overnight fast. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at
      pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Pharmacokinetics of JNJ-63623872 will be evaluated
      primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
