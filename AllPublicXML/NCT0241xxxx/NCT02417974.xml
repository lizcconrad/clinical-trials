      The objective of this trial is to assess if Fecal Microbiota Therapy (FMT) can reduce the
      risk of endoscopic recurrence of CD in patients after intestinal resection. The specific
      outcomes of FMT to be examined are: 1) endoscopic appearance, 2) clinical symptoms, 3) safety
      and tolerability, and 4) microbial diversity. The research team hypothesizes that FMT will
      prevent establishment of &quot;pro-inflammatory&quot; microbiome after surgery, leading to a reduced
      probability of recurrence of macroscopic inflammation. It is also hypothesized that FMT will
      be safe and well-tolerated in these patients.
