  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current standard of care is no pretreatment medications before the egg retrieval, and the
      investigators would like to evaluate if preoperative Tylenol improves procedure and post
      procedure pain control over the current practice (no pre-treatment). Specifically, this study
      will compare Tylenol with a placebo when given before retrieval procedures. The investigators
      believe that if Tylenol can offer better analgesic relief than no pretreatment medications,
      then it may reduce the amount of narcotics needed by patients during and after the procedure
      and contribute to better patient satisfaction. . This study will enroll 100 participants all
      from UAB.

    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for oocyte retrieval in IVF involves fentanyl, propofol, as well
      as oxycodone. However, there exists little data of alternatives to narcotic medications for
      analgesic purposes in oocyte retrieval procedures. A retrospective study published in 2013
      showed potential for NSAID's, specifically ketorolac, to significantly improve pain scores in
      women undergoing oocyte retrieval (Mesen et al). It was also shown that the use of these
      medications did not significantly alter pregnancy rate, live birth rate, or miscarriage rate
      in these patients. Few other studies have delved into the question of anesthetics for oocyte
      retrievals except a prospective study in 2006. This study, performed by Akande et al, shows
      that no significant difference in pregnancy rates of implantation occurs with the use of
      acetaminophen and diclofenac vs. acetaminophen alone if given post-operatively. However, pain
      was not measured in this study for either group. Therefore, it is clear that there exists
      limited data on the subject of analgesics used in oocyte retrievals for in vitro
      fertilization and that more exploration into alternative medications is required to find the
      most effective and least harmful option.
