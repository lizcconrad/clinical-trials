      This study will determine how common lifestyle practices affect the behavior of neutrophils
      (a type of immune cell) at shorter time scales than previously possible.

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how external factors implicated in immunity such as exercise,
      caffeine ingestion and ethanol consumption influence neutrophil migration.

      Neutrophils are the most prominent immune cell in human blood and are involved in a complex
      equilibrium of immune protection and autoimmune damage. Their recruitment to an inflammatory
      or wounding site is controlled by the sensing and directed migration to a concentration
      gradient of attractant molecules, a process called chemotaxis. Immune cells are also
      implicated in many diseases including cancer. The ability to measure the amplitude of a
      response over time for a specific patient, and the variation of this response when the
      patient engages in certain activities or consumes certain substances will improve
      understanding of how certain lifestyle factors impact the immune response. Traditional assays
      require large volumes of blood and a long purification process, which may affect neutrophil
      function and strictly limits the number of draws possible from a single patient. The novel
      microfluidic assay proposed limits these drawbacks as it has the capability to purify
      neutrophils from a 3 µL drop of blood in less than 5 minutes and measure their chemotaxis in
      a gradient of chemokines. Critically, the proposed studies will begin to fill a gap in
      current understanding of immune response as previous studies focused on single endpoints
      likely missing early events in the response to external stimulus. Understanding this temporal
      response may have implications in the development of new treatments as well as improvements
      in diagnosis of improper immune response.

      The KOALA (Kit On A Lid Assay) approach was developed in Professor Dave Beebe's lab and has
      been validated in a mouse model and in human asthmatic patients. In a collaboration with Dr.
      Anna Huttenlocher, it has been shown that, in contrast to traditional neutrophil
      purification, KOALA can be performed with small volumes of blood, and a much quicker
      purification time.

      Due to its unique qualities, KOALA allows for repeated evaluation of neutrophil adhesion and
      chemotaxis properties, thus making it an attractive method for studying dynamic neutrophil
      changes that may occur as a result of an external factor.

      Using traditional macrobiology tools, researchers have identified several factors that may
      play important roles in reducing neutrophil responsiveness and migration ability. Lifestyle
      and diet factors, amongst others, have been shown to impact neutrophil count, migration and
      biochemical function. For example, sleep deprivation has been linked with higher neutrophil
      count, despite a known immuno-depressive effect. Physical exercise results in increased
      neutrophil counts and increased neutrophil degranulation. Dietary factors, such as caffeine
      and ethanol have been shown to impact immune function.

      To build on this research, the investigators intend to probe the role of these lifestyle
      factors on neutrophil migration over much shorter time scales than has been previously
      studied. The investigators propose to examine the effects of exercise, ethanol ingestion and
      caffeine consumption on neutrophil behavior.

      Whole blood obtained from subjects by finger stick will be used in KOALA to isolate
      neutrophils. Neutrophil function will be assessed by measuring absolute migration speed,
      chemotactic index and chemotaxis velocity (directional velocity toward the formation of the
      gradient of chemoattractant).

      The primary outcome of this study will be to determine whether exercise, caffeine consumption
      and ethanol ingestion affect neutrophil chemotactic velocity. The secondary outcomes are to
      determine whether exercise, caffeine consumption and ethanol ingestion affect the absolute
      speed and chemotactic index of neutrophils.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will ride a stationary bike and maintain their target heart rate (according to the American Heart Association guidelines) for 30 minutes. For example, a 30 year old will have a target heart rate zone of 95-162 beats per minute. A baseline blood sample will be acquired before the subject begins exercising. In the following 30 minutes, subjects will ride the exercise bike, and their heart rate and general status will be assessed continuously. Specifically, heart rate will be monitored using a chest strap heart rate monitor. Two additional lancet punctures will be performed after the exercise to measure the changes in neutrophil function: one immediately following the 30 minute exercise period and one 30 minutes after the exercise has been completed.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Caffeine Consumption</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will be exposed to a moderate dose of caffeine (200 mg capsule in one sitting) from a common commercial product. After consent and screening, a baseline blood sample will be acquired using the lancet puncture procedure. The subject will then be instructed to swallow a 200 mg caffeine capsule. Two additional lancet punctures will be performed after the caffeine ingestion: one after 30 minutes post-ingestion and another one after 60 minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Ethanol Ingestion</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will be weighed and their required alcohol dose determined according to the equation used by the Madison Police Department during alcohol training workshops: 1 mL of 80 proof (40%) alcohol per pound of body weight. Subjects will be permitted to consume the drink at their own pace, although no slower than one drink per hour. Breath Alcohol Concentration (BAC) will be tested 20 minutes after drinking has ceased in order to clear mouth alcohol that may affect the BAC reading. Subjects at 0.05 BAC and above will have blood drawn via lancet puncture. In addition to the lancet puncture done once the alcohol level is reached, an additional lancet puncture will be performed 1 hour later.</description>
