  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This four-year, prospective, longitudinal study will evaluate and validate a patient-reported
      outcome measure, clinician-reported outcome measures, and imaging techniques in assessing
      characteristics, trajectory, and progression of lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF) in oral cavity
      and oropharyngeal cancer patients.

      This clinical trial studies patient-and-clinician-reported measures as well as standard
      imaging methods to see how accurate they are in identifying and evaluating lymphedema
      (swelling) or fibrosis (tough or tight tissue) in the head and neck region of patients
      receiving treatment for newly diagnosed stage II-IV oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer.
      Lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF) can lead to physical symptoms, such as trouble swallowing and
      chewing, as well as psychological and emotional symptoms, such as negative body image and
      avoiding social interactions. Finding an accurate test to identify and evaluate LEF may allow
      doctors to treat LEF more quickly and control symptoms more effectively, and thus provide
      patients with a better quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposed study is to establish a valid, clinically useful measurement
      battery for head and neck LEF by achieving these specific aims:

      Aim 1: To determine the reliability and validity of the patient-reported outcome measure
      (LSIDS-H&amp;N) for assessing LEF-related symptoms in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer
      patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival.

      Aim 2: To determine the reliability and validity of the clinician-reported outcome measures
      (HN-LEF Grading Criteria and Modified Patterson Scale) for assessing external and internal
      LEF in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients across the trajectory of treatment,
      recovery, and survival.

      Aim 3: To determine the reliability and validity of imaging techniques (CT scan and
      ultrasonography) in identifying site-specific LEF in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer
      patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival.

    <description>PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURE: Validity of LSIDS-H&amp;N will be assessed using 6 forms (e.g., Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey (v2.0); Neck Disability Index; and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).
CLINICIAN-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES: External LEF will be assessed using HN-LEF Grading Criteria, CTCAE (v4.03), and digital photos of the head and neck. Internal LEF will be scored using Modified Patterson Scale through an endoscopic exam. Both external/internal measures are re-assessed for intrarater and interrater reliability.
OBJECTIVE/TECHNICAL MEASURES: Patients undergo CT scans and ultrasound exams with results re-scored for intrarater and interrater reliability.</description>
