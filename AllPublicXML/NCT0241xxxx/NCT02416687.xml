      The etonogestrel (ENG) implant inserted immediately postpartum reduces the risk of pregnancy
      recurrence, especially in vulnerable populations. A limitation to recommending this practice
      universally is the low quality of evidence on the effect of the ENG implant on breastfeeding
      when inserted immediately postpartum. This study is the first assessing the impact of
      inserting the ENG implant immediately postpartum on the amount of milk using the gold
      standard method for this purpose.

      What is known already: The ENG implant inserted immediately postpartum reduces the risk of
      pregnancy recurrence, especially in vulnerable populations. A limitation to recommending this
      practice universally is the low quality of evidence on the effect of the ENG implant on
      breastfeeding when inserted immediately postpartum. This study is the first assessing the
      impact of inserting the ENG implant immediately postpartum on the amount of milk using the
      gold standard method for this purpose.

      Study design, size, duration: This randomized, single-blind and controlled clinical trial
      evaluated 24 postpartum women and their NBs and was conducted at the Women's Health Reference
      Center of Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. The mother-NB pairs were evaluated for six weeks
      postpartum.

      Participants/materials, setting, methods: Twenty-four mother-NB pairs were randomized into
      two groups: a) Implant group: ENG-releasing implant inserted within 48 h after delivery and
      b) Control group: absence of contraceptive method for six weeks after delivery.
      Anthropometric assessments and breastfeeding questionnaires were conducted at 4-time points
      of the 6-week monitoring period (at study admission and on the 14th, 29th and 43rd days after
      randomization). Saliva samples were collected from the mother-NB pairs prior to deuterium
      (D2O) dose administration. Totals of 5 g and 10 g D2O were orally administered to the
      postpartum women on the day of randomization (day 0) and the 29th study day, respectively.
      New saliva samples were collected on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 13 and 14 following intake of each D2O
      dose. The D2O isotope ratio was assessed in saliva samples using mass spectrometry to
      estimate the volume of breast milk ingested by the NB (daily average expressed as mL/day).
