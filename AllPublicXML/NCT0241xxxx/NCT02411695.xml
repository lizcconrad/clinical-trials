  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severely delibitating mental illness that affects approximately 1% of the
      world population. The onset of schizophrenia symptoms typically peaks in late adolescence and
      early adulthood. In a minority of cases, the initial episode may occur during childhood or
      early adolescence. Patients who experience this &quot;early-onset schizophrenia&quot; exhibit symptoms
      that are more severe and follow a more chronic course; adolescents with schizophrenia may
      never achieve full remission of the initial episode. The prognosis for early-onset
      schizophrenia tends to be poor, and cognitive impairment is greater compared with individuals
      whose onset of schizophrenia occurs later in life. Several antipsychotics have been
      investigated for the treatment of adolescent schizophrenia, however, there is a particular
      challenge because developing bodies are more sensitive to side effects of antipsychotics,
      particularly with respect to weight gain. In order to enroll a population that includes the
      younger ages, adolescents with other related psychiatric disorders are also included in this
      study.

    <description>Subjects who are deemed eligible for the trial will be assigned to a dosing cohort and will enter a Dose Titration Phase during which they will receive a starting dose of brexpiprazole for 2 to 10 days based on their assigned titration schedule. The Dose Titration Phase may be extended up to a maximum of 14 days, based on the observed safety and tolerability profile of the previous cohort's Dose Titration Phase. Following the Dose Titration Phase, subjects will enter the Fixed Dose Phase and will be administered the assigned dose for that cohort for 14 days.</description>
