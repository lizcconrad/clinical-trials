    <textblock>
      Intravaginal rings (IVRs) may offer an ideal way to deliver antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to
      prevent HIV infection. This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of two IVRs
      containing different doses of a combination of two HIV ARV drugs, vicriviroc (VCV) (MK-4176)
      and MK-2048, in healthy, HIV-uninfected women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of safe and effective HIV prevention strategies remains a global health
      priority. IVRs are currently being studied as a method to deliver HIV ARV drugs in women.
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of two IVRs containing different
      doses of a combination of two HIV ARV drugs, vicriviroc (VCV) (MK-4176) and MK-2048, in
      healthy, HIV-uninfected women.

      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected women, 18 to 45 years old. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive either the low dose MK-2048A IVR or the original dose
      MK-2048A IVR. Participants will receive their assigned IVR at the enrollment visit, and the
      IVR will be removed on Day 28. Participants will attend study visits at screening, enrollment
      (Day 0), and Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 35. Study visits may include
      medical history reviews, physical examinations, blood collection, pelvic specimen collection,
      urine collection, and counseling and adherence assessments.

          -  Born female. Note: Participants who were female at birth, who now identify as male,
             will not be excluded so long as they are not on female-to-male transition therapy.

          -  Age 18 through 45 years (inclusive) at screening, verified per site SOPs (standard
             operating procedures)

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to be screened for and take part
             in this study (MTN-028)

          -  Able and willing to provide adequate locator information, as defined by the site SOPs

          -  HIV-uninfected, based on testing performed by study staff at screening and enrollment
             (per applicable algorithm in Appendix II of the protocol) and willing to receive
             results

          -  In general good health at screening and enrollment, as determined by the site
             Investigator of Record (IoR) or designee

          -  At screening, participant states willingness to abstain from receptive sexual activity
             (including penile-vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, receptive oral intercourse,
             finger stimulation, and the use of sex toys) for the 5 days prior to the enrollment
             visit and for the duration of study participation

          -  Per participant report, using an effective method of contraception at enrollment, and
             intending to continue the use of an effective method for the duration of study
             participation. Effective methods for MTN-028 include: hormonal methods (except
             contraceptive IVRs), intrauterine device (IUD) inserted at least 28 days prior to
             enrollment, engages in sex exclusively with women, sterilized (self or partner),
             and/or sexually abstinent for the past 90 days

          -  Women over the age of 21 (inclusive) must have documentation of a satisfactory Pap
             within the past 3 years prior to enrollment consistent with Grade 0 according to the
             Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to the DAIDS
             Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004
             (Clarification dated August 2009), or satisfactory evaluation with no treatment
             required of Grade 1 or higher Pap result. If otherwise eligible women do not have
             documentation of a recent Pap test, one may be performed at the screening visit.

          -  Per participant report at screening and enrollment, agrees not to participate in other

             levonorgestrel-releasing IUD) nor to participants using continuous combination oral
             contraceptive pills, as the absence of regular menstrual cycles is an expected, normal
             consequence in this context.

             infectious disease

          -  Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities at screening:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) Grade 1 or higher

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault
                  formula, where creatinine clearance (female) in mL/min = (140 - age in years) x
                  (weight in kg) x (0.85)/72 x (creatinine in mg/dL)

               -  International normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5 × the site laboratory upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary test result (other
                  than HIV, hepatitis B virus [HBV], or HCV) can be re-tested during the screening
                  process. If a participant is re-tested and a non-exclusionary result is
                  documented within 45 days of providing informed consent for screening, the
                  participant may be enrolled.

          -  Pregnant at either screening or enrollment. Note: A documented negative pregnancy test
             performed by study staff is required for inclusion; however a self-reported pregnancy
             is adequate for exclusion from screening/enrollment into the study.

          -  Diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) at screening or enrollment. Note:
             Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during screening will be offered
             treatment. If within the 45 day screening window treatment is complete and symptoms
             have resolved the participant may be enrolled.

          -  Diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease, reproductive tract infection (RTI) or a
             sexually transmitted infection (STI) requiring treatment per current Centers for
             Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/) at
             screening or enrollment. Note: With the exception of gonorrhea, chlamydia and/or
             syphilis, otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with a RTI during screening will
             be offered treatment. If within the 45 day screening window treatment is complete and
             symptoms have resolved, the participant may be enrolled.

          -  At enrollment, has a clinically apparent Grade 1 or higher pelvic exam finding
             (observed by study clinician or designee) per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading
             the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004
             (Clarification dated August 2009), Addendum 1, Female Genital Grading Table for Use in
             Microbicide Studies. Note: Cervical friability bleeding associated with speculum
             insertion and/or specimen collection judged to be within the range of normal according
             to the clinical judgment of the IoR/designee is considered expected non-menstrual
             bleeding and is not exclusionary.

          -  At screening, severe pelvic relaxation such that either the vaginal walls or the
             uterine cervix descend beyond the vaginal introitus with valsalva maneuver or has
             pelvic anatomy that compromises the ability to adequately assess vaginal safety

          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study
             outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving study objectives
