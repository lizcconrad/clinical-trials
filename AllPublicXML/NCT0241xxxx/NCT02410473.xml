  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonates, children with single ventricle congenital heart disease, and those undergoing
      multiple complex cardiac surgeries are at high risk of increased perioperative blood loss,
      and blood product transfusions. In addition, some of these patients will present an increased
      risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications. For a long time, bleeding management has
      been based on the empiric administration of different blood products (e.g. platelet
      concentrates, cryoprecipitates, and/or activated factor VII), topical hemostatic agents, and
      surgical manipulation. Recently, the use of viscoelastic tests (e.g. thromboelastography
      (TEG) or thromboelastometry (ROTEM)) increased, and allowed a better assessment of
      perioperative coagulopathy, and a more 'rational' treatment of bleeding. While TEG and ROTEM
      record the viscoelastic properties of whole blood by measuring mechanical impedance and
      related changes during clot formation, T2MR, a miniaturized, magnetic resonance-based
      diagnostic platform, measures how water molecules react in the presence of magnetic fields to
      evaluate a broad range of hemostasis measurements. In this study, we will prospectively
      collect demographic data, surgical characteristics, the amount of perioperative bleeding and
      blood product transfusion, results of laboratory assays, and postoperative outcomes (30-day
      follow-up or until discharge), with the aim to assess our current practice, and develop an
      algorithm-based approach for the administration of targeted blood product and pro-coagulant
      therapies. Our goals are: the reduction of blood product utilization, the reduction of the
      incidence of massive bleeding and postoperative thrombosis.

      Collect discarded blood from 4 routine blood samples. These will be obtained at 4 different
      time-points: 1. After induction of anesthesia and placement of arterial line, 2. After
      cardiopulmonary Bipass (CPB), 3 minutes after protamine administration, 3. At the end of the
      surgery, before transfer to CICU, 4. 24- 48 hrs post-surgery in the ICU.

      Collect two 5 mL of urine samples. One sample prior to CPB, as well as following CPB, from an
      routinely placed Foley catheter.
