    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the most undesirable complications after
      general anesthesia, and may lead to increased hospital stay and health care costs. The risk
      factors for PONV include sex (female population), nonsmoking status, past history of motion
      sickness and/or previous PONV, duration of anesthesia and surgical type (particular
      gynecologic surgery) and postoperative use of opioids. The overall incidence of PONV has been
      reported to be 30% with considerable variability, but can increase up to 69%- 80% in women
      undergoing gynecologic surgery with general anesthesia and morphine-patient controlled
      analgesia (PCA). Serotonin receptor antagonists (5-HT3) have been suggested one of the first
      line therapies for preventing PONV because of their efficacy and few side effects compared
      with other antiemetics. However, despite the use of this treatment, the incidence of PONV has
      been reported to be between 48 % and 50%. Naloxone is a drug used to counter the effects of
      opioid. It was found that administration of low dose naloxone prevents opioid side effects
      such as nausea and pruritus without affecting analgesia or opioid requirements in patient
      receiving morphine PCA. It was reported that the use of two antiemetic acting at different
      mechanisms is better to prevent PONV than monotherapy.

      Therefore, this prospective, randomized, controlled study was designed to investigate the
      antiemetic efficacy of combination of ramosetron and premixture of naloxone with morphine PCA
      after gynecologic surgery.
