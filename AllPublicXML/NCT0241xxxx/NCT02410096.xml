    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the bronchial inflammation and
      hyperresponsiveness after oil supplementation. Before and after oil supplementation the
      investigators measure decrease in lung function after exercise-challenge in a cold chamber
      and increase of inflammatory markers in the blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects suffering form exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) usually have a normal lung
      function testing at rest and show a decrease in lung function when they do sports or an
      exercise-challenge. In a previous study the investigators could show, that the combination of
      exercise test and inhalation of cold air ist more sensitive and specific than
      exercise-challenge in ambient temperature.

      It is known that omega - 3 -fatty acids could reduce the production of inflammatory
      mediators.

      In this study the investigators will investigate the protective effect of oil supplementation
      with middle-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids in an exercise-induced asthma provocation
      model.

      Therefore the investigators will measure the decrease in lung function and a increase of
      inflammatory markers in the blood before and after oil supplementation.

      Before and after the exercise-challenge the investigators will measure spirometry and body
      plethysmography. The investigators want to examine if the body plethysmography is more
      sensitive in the measurement of exercise induced bronchoconstriction than spirometry.

      The investigators hypothesize that the oil supplementation can reduce bronchial inflammation
      and hyperresponsiveness.

    <measure>Decrease in FEV1 after exercise challenge in cold air as measured by spirometry (FEV1, percent predicted) - comparison verum vs placebo</measure>

    <description>The exercise challenge in cold air will be done on two timepoints. Before and after oil supplementation versus placebo supplementation. After exercise challenge spirometry will be measured. Decrease in FEV1 in verum and control group will be compared with t-test and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test.</description>

    <description>Both methods will be done in parallel before and 4 times after exercise challenge in cold air. Afterwards the investigators can compare both methods and calculate the sensitivity for both methods to indicate exercise induced bronchoconstriction.</description>
