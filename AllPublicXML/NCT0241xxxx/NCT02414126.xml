  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with heart failure (HF) have an increased work of breathing and are at
      increased risk for obstructive and/or central apnea during sleep. Noninvasive continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) has proved its efficacy in decreasing the work of breathing
      and improving sleep-disordered breathing in these patients.

      The aim of the study is to analyze the work of breathing and objective and subjective sleep
      quality in children with HF and to evaluate the ability of noninvasive CPAP to decrease the
      work of breathing and improve cardiac output during wakefulness.

    <textblock>
      The study starts with the measurement during wakefulness of

        -  the breathing pattern and work of breathing

        -  and cardiac function during 5 min after 10 min of stable and calm spontaneous breathing
           (SB) Then the same measurement are made during 5 min after 10 min of stable and calm
           breathing during non-invasive CPAP Then a third measurement is made of

        -  the breathing pattern and work of breathing

        -  and cardiac function during 5 min after 10 min a stable and calm SB

      Polysomnography is then performed during the following night during SB in order to assess
      objective sleep quality.

      Subjective sleep quality is assessed on the following morning in children &gt; 6 years of age by
      validated sleep questionnaires.
