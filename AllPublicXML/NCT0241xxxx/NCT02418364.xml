  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is expressed as an inability to conceive or carry a healthy pregnancy to the end.
      It is often said that the couple suffers from infertility if for a year they could not get a
      normal pregnancy. 30% of the reasons for this unsuccess are attributed to women, 30% are
      attributed to men, while the other 40% of cases are attributed to the combination between men
      and women and for unknown reasons. In women, the source of most of the problems of
      infertility are associated with different failures in ovulation (early ovulation, lack of
      ovulation or irregular ovulation). Other reasons are Blocked fallopian tubes (due to
      endometriosis, infection or surgery), problems in the uterus and endometrium. There is a
      group of women that apparently does not have the failures described above, and they have
      infertility that does not include pathological findings. Apparently chronic stress is a
      potential cause among couples who could not get pregnant (despite 6 months of focused sex) so
      there is a request for various techniques for reducing stress including yoga and meditation.
      One common option in various conditions of infertility is in vitro fertilization. This
      technique is also known as artificial insemination and is the most common technique used in
      Israel. Data from the Ministry of Health from the last years, indicate that the rate of
      successful pregnancies after embryo transfer is more than a third (in average), this is from
      an average of 20 treatment cycles.

      Researches in alternative medicine are not easy to carry out. The placebo group which is
      usually the control group tend to be a treatment group by itself and gives effective results
      than a group that does not receive treatment at all. Carrying out a strict study with a good
      control group such as reflexology research in multiple sclerosis, has brought significant
      results in various statistical measures examined in this study (movement, sensory mode and
      urinary tract symptoms).

      In the control group the calf was chosen as a place of a massage as a dummy treatment
      (gynecological place), which prevented contact with specific points of the feet like in
      patients in the treatment group. This study wishes to answer the research question: Does
      reflexology treatment increase the chances of pregnancy implantation in women without
      pathological findings that are treated with IVF. Other questions related to measures that
      could lead to the implant of pregnancy, are whether reflexology treatment affect the
      endometrial thickness, number of oocytes and embryo quality. Literature indicates the
      potential of reflexology treatment on ovulation induction (But requires a good control group
      and large sample size).

      The purpose of the study:

      Does reflexology treatment increase the chance of pregnancy in women treated with IVF?

      Research design:

      To the Study will recruited women who come for IVF treatments.

      Women who are fit to participate and give their consent, will be randomized to one of three
      treatment groups:

      Group 1 - placebo reflexology

      Group 2 - control group that receives no alternative treatment. Data will be taken from
      questionnaires

      Group 3 - will be receiving a built-in protocol reflexology treatment

      Reflexology treatment can begin at any stage up to the stage of the eggs implantation. If the
      patient is not pregnant, she will start another reflexology treatment cycle. Reflexology
      treatment will be minimum 4 treatments and up to six treatments for every cycle. Rate
      treatment will be two or three times a week. The patient can receive reflexology treatment
      for three cycles of IVF.

      Research tools and methods

        -  Photo of feet before the first treatment and before final treatment

        -  Permanent set by 4 parameters

        -  Questionnaire: to be transferred at baseline and after treatment and will be in a state
           of double blinded. There will be no connection between the treatment protocol and
           questionnaires. At the end of the study, the analysis and cross checking data will form
           their own measurements.

             1. Quality of Life Questionnaire

             2. Questionnaire &quot;dhak&quot;

             3. Mind-body questionnaire

             4. Family support questionnaire

      Medical tests (measurements taken any way and will be used for the study): blood tests,
      medical record indicating that there is no pathological findings, ultrasound, endometrial
      thickness, number of follicles, number of oocytes and embryo quality.

      Evaluation of Participants:

      80 - experimental group 80 - a control group that receives no alternative treatment 80 - a
      group that receives a placebo treatments

      Duration of participation in the study: Six months

      Treatment protocol:

      The treatment strengthens the natural healing of the body, in that it strengthens the blood
      flow and the release of endorphins, which can reduce pain, stress relaxation and a general
      feeling better (wellbeing). Recently a promising theory was added, a theory called Nerve
      Impulse the suggests that pressure points in the foot improve neural connection to other
      parts of the body through the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system,
      regulates body systems that are under unaware control such as respiratory, heart rate and
      blood pressure systems which are sensitive to pressure and vibration in accordance with
      Physical and psychological changes, and able to control the sympathetic system and moderate
      the fight or flight response. Recent meta-analysis that scanned many articles pointed out
      that there is no unity in studies about reflexology, that there are a wide range of
      parameters, methods and measurements of efficacy .Therapeutic Touch are complex and it is
      difficult to maintain such double-blind trials.

      Therefore, there is a great need for maintaining the uniformity of treatment. In the
      investigators' study, will be responsible coordinator of reflexology, Rachel Hoddov, to teach
      and train coaches participating in the study protocol the standard treatment in a way that
      will allow a free hand. In addition, Placebo treatment will be in superficial areas in
      particular, and will be directed to organs and organ systems which are not relevant to the
      research topic.
