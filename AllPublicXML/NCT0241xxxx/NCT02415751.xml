    <textblock>
      This study is assessing the effects of a new heart failure self-care education program in the
      Nebraska Heart Institute Heart Improvement Clinic. The new education program will consist of
      an initial intensive self-care education session with the Principal Investigator or her nurse
      practitioner. Topics to be discussed include medications, sodium and fluid consumption,
      alcohol restriction, exercise, preventive behaviors, and monitoring of signs and symptoms. As
      recommended in the ACCF/AHA guidelines, this education will be repeated on an annual basis as
      studies have shown that the impact of HF education is not always durable and must be a
      continual process. This study will assess the impact of this review on their medication
      knowledge, disease state knowledge, quality of life, disease state progression and clinical
      outcomes such as ejection fraction and number of hospitalizations.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational study as all patients in the heart failure clinic, regardless of
      whether or not they will choose to be in the study, will receive heart failure self-care
      education from now on.

    <description>It is defined as a naturalistic decision-making process that patients use in the choice of behaviors that maintain physiological stability (symptom monitoring and treatment adherence) and the response to symptoms when they occur (Riegel 2004). This includes following advice regarding medications, sodium and water consumption, alcohol restriction, exercise, preventive behaviors, and monitoring of signs and symptoms.</description>
