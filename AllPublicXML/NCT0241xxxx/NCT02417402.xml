  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate if patients treated by physical therapists who
      received an update on clinical practice guidelines and pain management have better outcomes
      than patients treated by physical therapists who did not received such training.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The training &quot;Update on the treatment of patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain&quot;
      will be announced in the social network by members of the study. Interested physical
      therapists will send an email to one of the study authors with their information regarding
      the inclusion criteria. After two months of notice, interested and eligible physiotherapists
      will be randomized into two groups of 15 participants each.

      The study arms are: 1) control group (physical therapist who will not receive training) and
      2) experimental group (physical therapist who will receive training). Before and after
      training, attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about low back pain guidelines will be evaluated.

      Each physical therapist will recruit for the study a total of fifteen consecutive patients
      with chronic nonspecific low back pain (total sample=150 patients). All the patients will be
      assessed before the first session by a blinded examiner who will be unaware about the group
      allocation.

      Clinical outcomes (pain, disability, fear avoidance beliefs and pain catastrophizing) will be
      collected at baseline and at 5 weeks, 3 and 6 months after randomization. All statistical
      analysis will be conducted following the principles of intention to treat analysis and the
      between-group differences will be performed using Mixed Linear Models.

  <why_stopped>
    We had many issues related to recruitment. After many attempts we want to suspend the study
    with 13 patients.

    <description>The patients allocated to the Experimental group will be treated by physical therapists who carried out the training before treatment. The training will be designed to guide the physical therapists beliefs and attitudes to a biopsychosocial model; update knowledge contained in clinical practice guidelines; and enable physical therapists to identify, integrate and address psychosocial factors in patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain. Patients will receive 10 sessions of treatment over a period of five weeks (two sessions/week). Each treatment session has an estimated duration of 50-60 minutes.</description>

             of motor, reflex or sensation deficit), serious spinal pathology (such as fracture,
             tumor, inflammatory and infectious diseases), serious cardiovascular and metabolic
             diseases, previous back surgery and pregnancy.
