    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact of an innovative patient engagement solution
      on patient's quality of life and asthma-related outcomes, and evaluate the correlation
      between a patient reported outcome measure and clinical outcomes.

      Patient engagement is a critical part of improving patient care and outcomes. Current patient
      engagement strategies only focus on the patient-physician interaction and have been shown to
      be ineffective.

      The need for a comprehensive approach to patient engagement is no different among patients
      with asthma as it is in any other chronic condition. Patients with asthma must make
      complicated health decisions daily that impact their social and occupational activities,
      quality of life, and treatment adherence. Obtaining, communicating, processing, and
      understanding non- biased health information are crucial in making appropriate and informed
      treatment decisions.

      Pack Health LLC and Duke will develop a patient engagement toolkit known as &quot;Packs&quot; to help
      empower and engage patients. These disease-specific, evidence-based kits are scientifically
      designed to improve patient involvement in their own care. Each Pack draws on the science of
      change management and patient activation and contains three categories of materials
