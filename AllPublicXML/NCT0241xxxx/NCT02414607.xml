  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderberries (Sambuci fructus) have been shown in a number of studies to have significant
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Multiple human and animal studies have supported
      the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of elderberry preparations and it has been used
      in natural medicine for hundreds of years. Studies examining factors that may decrease the
      risk of Alzheimer's disease have revealed that drinking juices with similar properties to
      elderberries is one of the most reliable way to decrease risk. As such the investigators wish
      to determine the effects of elderberry juice on cognitive decline in a group of subjects at
      high risk for Alzheimer's disease, those with mild cognitive impairment. Elderberry juice is
      a commercially available nutritional supplement and easily available to this population.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known history of sensitivity to elderberry products.

             (subjects showing the greatest cognitive decline and other signs of Alzheimer's
             disease may be prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors as this is a standard of care for
             Alzheimer's disease but not MCI).

          -  Presence of any condition the health professional believes will impair ability to
             complete study procedures (ex. terminal illness, comorbid major psychiatric disorders
             such as schizophrenia, or drug abuse).

          -  Potentially confounding neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. MS).
