  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to study the dose response effect of continuous Soluble Corn Fiber
      (SCF) intake over a 50 day period on bone resorption in healthy post menopausal women using
      the 41Calcium methodology. To further understand the dose response effect of SCF bone
      biomarkers will be studied.

      Our hypothesis is that soluble corn fiber will reduce bone resorption in a dose dependent
      manner in comparison to placebo when estimated by urinary 41Calcium excretion as well as bone
      biomarkers of resorption.

      Subjects will be dosed with 41Calcium , a long-lived radio isotope, which will become
      deposited in the skeleton after about 100 days. During this time subjects will collect 24 h
      urine monthly to monitor the decrease in 41Calcium urinary excretion. Subsequently, the
      baseline level of 41Calcium urinary excretion will be evaluated over a 50 day baseline period
      with 24 h urine collections every 10 days. Participants will then be randomized to one of
      three doses of soluble corn fiber (0,10,20 g/d) to be consumed in two equivalent doses per
      day for 50 days. Women will collect 24 h urine every 10 days. Each 50 day period will be
      followed by a 50 day washout period during which the subjects will continue to collect urine
      every 10 days.

    <measure>Change in 41Ca/Ca ratio in five 24 h urine collections during intervention periods compared to urinary 41Ca/Ca ratios during non-intervention periods</measure>
    <time_frame>24 h urine collections on days 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 of each of three intervention periods and 4 non intervention periods</time_frame>
    <description>41Ca/Ca ratio will be determined by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. A linear regression model including the data from the non-intervention ratios will determine the predicted 41Ca/Ca ratios over the course of the 350 day study. The percent change of 41Ca/Ca ratios in the 50 day intervention periods from the predicted values will determine the effect of the intervention.</description>
