      This study is a pilot trial investigating the effects of a high energy drink for children, in
      comparison to standard energy drink for children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A four week, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of a high
      energy density, low volume oral nutritional supplement versus standard energy density oral
      nutritional supplements in children aged 1-12yrs old requiring nutritional support. Fifty
      eligible children will be recruited and randomised to receive either the high energy density
      oral nutritional supplement or the standard energy density oral nutritional supplement for
      four weeks. The primary outcome is nutrient intake, with secondary outcomes of compliance,
      tolerance, acceptability, anthropometry and safety.
