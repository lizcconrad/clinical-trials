    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect of an
      experimental human monoclonal antibody (mAb), VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01), in adults infected
      with HIV who were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed as treatment for a variety of conditions
      including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infections. mAbs may also be a potential
      treatment for people infected with HIV. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of an experimental human mAb, VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01), in HIV-infected
      adults receiving ART. Study researchers will also evaluate the effect of VRC01 on the number
      of infected cells containing unspliced HIV-1 transcripts in the blood in participants.

      This study enrolled HIV-infected people 18 to 65 years old, who had been receiving ART for at
      least 2 years and who had a CD4+ count of 200 cells/mm^3 or greater. Participants were
      randomly assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Participants in Arm A received an intravenous (IV)
      infusion of VRC01 at Day 0 and Week 3 and an IV infusion of placebo (normal saline) at Weeks
      6 and 9. Participants in Arm B received an IV infusion of placebo (normal saline) at Day 0
      and Week 3 and an IV infusion of VRC01 at Weeks 6 and 9. Participants recorded their
      temperature and symptoms for 3 days after each infusion. Study visits occured at study entry
      (Day 0), and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, and 30. Study visits
      included physical examinations, clinical assessments, and blood collection.

      The primary safety outcome for this study was descriptive and assessed the occurrence of
      Grade ≥ 3 AEs including signs/symptoms, lab toxicities, and/or clinical events that are
      possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment (as judged by the core team,
      blinded to treatment arm) at any time from the initial dose of study treatment to the end of
      study follow-up. Since this outcome is descriptive, no statistical significance testing was
      performed.

    <description>Change from baseline (geometric average of screening and entry results) to week 6 in cell-associated HIV-1 RNA/DNA ratio in total CD4+ cells, using a last value carried forward approach if week 6 cell-associated HIV-1 RNA/DNA ratio was missing.

This comparison is the change from the average of screening and entry results to the week 6 value (if available), and if week 6 result was not available, the week 3 value was used instead of the week 6 value.</description>

             defined as the equivalent of prednisone less than or equal to 10 mg/day, will not be
             excluded. Stable physiologic glucocorticoid doses should not be discontinued for the

        <description>Summary of within-participant change across treatment arms from the pre-VRC01 time point to the post-VRC01 time point.

For Arm B, the pre-VRC01 time point used was the week 6 measure and the post-VRC01 time point was the week 12 measure. Change in CA-RNA/DNA ratio was calculated on the log10 scale.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA by Single Copy Assay (SCA) Below Assay Lower Limit</title>
        <description>The analysis of HIV-1 RNA SCA assessed the number of participants below the assay lower limit (1 copy/mL) at each measurement week. Specific specimens and time points were targeted based on Arm. Samples were not tested for Arm A at the Week 7 and Week 10 time points. Samples were not tested for Arm B at the Week 1 and Week 4 time points.
Testing of specimens at weeks 15, 18 and 30 has not been performed. The study team has decided in favor of saving these samples for future research purposes.</description>

      <desc>The SAE Reporting Category, as defined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual, was used for this study. At entry, signs, symptoms and laboratory values regardless of grade were reported. Post-entry, signs, symptoms and laboratory values grade ≥2, or those causing a change in treatment/ART, regardless of grade, were reported. Diagnoses identified on the study-specific list of diagnoses were recorded at entry and at all subsequent visits. Used DAIDS AE Grading Table, Version 2.0, November 2014</desc>
