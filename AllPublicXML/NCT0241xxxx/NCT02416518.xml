      This protocol is not designed as a treatment protocol. Patients enrolled on this study will
      be treated according to the treating physician's plan of care, independent of enrollment into
      the study. Once enrolled, the physician may proceed with the appropriate plan of care during
      the period of specimen analysis if indicated. Upon return of the results, therapy may or may
      not be altered based upon the patient's pathology, pertinent medical and treatment history,
      imaging studies, available clinical trials, and on the CLIA validated clinical molecular
      profiling results. Regardless of the results, the patient will be offered a treatment
      selected on an empirical basis by the treating physician at the individual site. All patients
      enrolled in the study will be followed for clinical outcome. Clinical molecular profiling
      results will expire 14 weeks following the date the Foundation One report is received. No
      investigational agents will be administered as part of this study. However, patients may be
      referred to open clinical trials based on the results of profiling. Patients referred for
      clinical trial may receive investigational agents under a separate clinical trial in
      accordance with the written protocol for which they are subsequently enrolled. All
      anti-neoplastic drugs used while participating in this study, whether used on-label or
      off-label, will be administered to the patient by the route of administration published in
      the FDA approved package insert. In addition, the dosing of the agent (including dose
      modifications) will be calculated based upon what is published in the FDA approved package
      insert.

             to prolong survival (or where a clinical trial recommended as the 1st-line option).
             Patients do not have to be off-treatment when enrolled on this trial. However, please
