  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If a termination of pregnancy procedure is performed by vacuum aspiration our patients
      receive a paracervical block. Nevertheless these patients are not free of pain. We randomised
      our patients: one group will receive additional orodispersible tramadol, the other group will
      receive a placebo.

      Patients were administered either 50 mg of fast-release orodispersible tramadol (Meda Pharma,
      Brussels, Belgium) or placebo 30 min before the procedure. Both, patient and gynecologist
      were blinded.

      Patients underwent the following procedure: a sterile bivalve speculum was introduced into
      the vagina, then cervix and vagina were washed with an antiseptic solution. The cervix was
      grasped with a tenaculum and straigthened. A paracervical block was achieved using a 27-gauge
      spinal needle. Lidocaine was injected and distributed equally around the cervicovaginal
      junction at 1, 5, 7 and 11 o'clock. The suction curettage was accomplished through the
      following steps: the cervix was dilated, in function of the gestation, to Hagar number 5 to
      11 (Aesculap, Ag and Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany); The uterine depth was measured using a
      hysterometry; suction curettage was performed by using plastic canula (Luneau Sas, France)
      and a classic suction pump (AMEDA Egnell SA, Switserland). The patients were observed for 2
      hours after the curettage procedure.

      Patients were asked to rate the pain during different steps of the procedure.
