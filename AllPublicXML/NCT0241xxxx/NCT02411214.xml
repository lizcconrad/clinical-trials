    <textblock>
      The survey analyses how to improve the decision-making process for fertility preservation in
      the pediatric population based on

        1. patient and parent feelings about fertility preservation counselling

        2. influence of the emotional state of patients and parents on fertility preservation
           acceptance

        3. support of medical staff and family The study revealed that attention to the fertility
           preservation pathways was important for the satisfaction of patient's and parent's
           expectations
