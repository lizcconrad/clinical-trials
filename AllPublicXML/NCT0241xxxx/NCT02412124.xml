    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies a peer-to-peer support program in improving quality of life
      outcomes in patients with gynecologic cancer and their caregivers. Peer-to-peer support and
      mentoring may help improve quality of life and reduce symptoms of distress in gynecologic
      cancer patients and their families.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the feasibility and acceptability of a Woman-to-Woman (W2W) program for patients
      with gynecologic cancer at City of Hope (COH). Address the following descriptive research
      questions: were patients, mentors, and patients' family caregivers satisfied with the timing,
      format, and content of the program? Did the program benefit patients, mentors, and patients'
      family caregivers?

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in the W2W program for which they are matched with a trained mentor and
      followed throughout treatment by phone, email, and/or in person.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 months.
