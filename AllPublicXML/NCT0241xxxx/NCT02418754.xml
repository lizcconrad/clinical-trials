      The primary objective of the study is to explore the effect of REGN2176-3 on the Early
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in patients
      with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), compared to intravitreal aflibercept
      injection (IAI) monotherapy.
