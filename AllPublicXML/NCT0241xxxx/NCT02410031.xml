      The study will be an observational, cross-sectional study of knowledge, understanding, and
      self-reported behavior among a sample of physicians with recent experience in prescribing
      Diane-35 or its generics in a total of five European countries. The primary objective of this
      study is to measure physician knowledge and understanding of the key information contained in
      the Diane-35 educational material: Patient information card, and Prescribers' Checklist.

      Specifically, the following objectives will be addressed:

        -  Investigate whether physicians have received any educational material related to
           Diane-35 or its generics

        -  Assess physicians' knowledge and understanding of key safety information pertaining to
           the patient information card

        -  Assess physicians' knowledge and understanding of key safety information pertaining to
           the following areas:

        -  Contraindications relevant to thromboembolism

        -  Risk factors for thromboembolism
