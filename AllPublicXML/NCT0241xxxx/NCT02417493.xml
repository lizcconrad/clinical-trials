      The purpose of the present study is to determine if asking adolescent patients (ages 13-17)
      to self-inject an empty syringe into their thigh during routine clinic visits results in
      increased reported comfort with self-injection, reduced anxiety regarding self-injection and
      food allergy management for both patient and caregiver(s), and in greater perceived
      likelihood of epinephrine self-injection, in the event of an emergency.

      The purpose of the present study is to determine if asking adolescent patients (ages 13-17)
      to self-inject an empty syringe into their thigh during routine clinic visits results in
      increased reported comfort with self-injection, reduced anxiety regarding self-injection and
      food allergy management for both patient and caregiver(s), and in greater perceived
      likelihood of epinephrine self-injection, in the event of an emergency. Forty participants,
      in total, will be recruited during routine visits to an outpatient allergy clinic. Half of
      all participants will be randomized to the behavioral self-management intervention; whereby
      patients will insert a needle attached to an empty syringe into their thigh (simulating an
      injection of epinephrine); the other half of participants will be randomized to the control
      condition, and will be encouraged to speak to their physician about self-injection, but will
      not undergo the self-injection protocol. Prior to randomization, baseline measures will be
      collected on patient's comfort with epinephrine self-injection. Following the self-injection
      protocol and/or the discussion of self-injection with the physician, all participants will
      complete immediate post-intervention questionnaires at clinic about comfort with
      self-injection, health care management and anxiety. One month following the clinic visit, all
      patients will be sent a follow-up questionnaire that will include items identical to the ones
      completed at immediate post-intervention.
