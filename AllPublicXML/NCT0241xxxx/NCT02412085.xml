  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase IV trial. Adult patients, with moderately to severe, steroid
      dependent, acute ulcerative colitis not previously exposed to anti-TNF, will receive
      subcutaneous golimumab treatment, according to EU marketing authorization from baseline
      through week 14.

      At week 16, patients achieving clinical and endoscopic remission will continue with
      Golimumab, 50 mg or 100 mg (depending on body weight) every 4 weeks, through week 52.

      Patients not achieving clinical and endoscopic remission will be treated with infliximab,
      according to marketing authorization, and followed through week 52. This is not considered as
      an interventional arm but, since infliximab in Italy is considered as the first-line
      treatment for UC patients, as the usual clinical practice.
