  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation(AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in humans. The loss of
      rate-dependent action potential duration(APD) adaptation is one of the characteristics of
      atrial fibrillation, but detailed understanding of mechanism is limited. Thus, we propose to
      utilize the monophasic action potential recording data from human patients in three groups,
      control, paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation, and apply reverse engineering method
      to quantify the extent of electrical remodeling of ionic channel parameters using a
      mathematical model of atrial cell. Our approach will be useful in developing drug targets for
      ion channels in atrial fibrillation patients.

    <description>The investigators will acquire monophasic action potential from patient's atrium. Then, we will estimate cardiac ion current status of the patients by reverse engineering and computer simulation. The patients will be followed up longer than 12 months based on 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines. Primary outcomes of the study are AF recurrence and antiarrhythmic drug sensitivity. Those data will be counted and compared with the patient's own ion current status deducted by simulation study with monophasic action potentials.</description>

    <description>After ordinary procedure for electrophysiologic study or catheter ablation, the investigators will replace conventional catheter to monophasic action potential (MAP) recording catheter through right femoral sheath. MAP recording catheter is introduced to endocardial surface of atrium, and we record atrial MAP at variable pacing cycle lengths: steady state cycle lengths of 600, 400, 300, 240, 220, 240, 260, 300, 400 and 600 ms. At each cycle length, pacing was applied for 20 sec. It takes less than 5 min to acquire MAP recordings.</description>
