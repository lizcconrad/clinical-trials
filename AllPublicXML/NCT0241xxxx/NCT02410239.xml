      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mesenchymal
      stem cells (IT-MSC) in patients with active, advanced cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD).

      This is a single-institution dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of intrathecally administered allogeneic, 3rd party mesenchymal stem cells (IT-MSC) in
      patients with active, advanced cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD).

    <measure>Radiographic Response</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the incidence of, and time to, radiographic response in patients receiving IT-MSC for active, advanced cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. Radiographic response is defined as the resolution of intravenous gadolinium contrast enhancement on brain MRI, or the absence of an increase in Loes score between the enrollment MRI and 6 month MRI.</description>

    <description>Third party donor Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) will be administered via intrathecal administration at the assigned dose on days 0, 7 and 14. Dose escalation will be guided by a fast track design. One patient is entered per dose level until a DLT is experienced. At that point, two additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. Dose levels will be 2.5 x 10e6 MSC/kg per dose, 5 x 10e6 MSC/kg per dose or 7.5 x 10e6 MSC/kg per dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 4 years at time of study enrollment

          -  Diagnosis of ALD - the diagnosis of ALD can be made by either biochemical or
             molecular/genetic evidence (plasma VLCFA or ABCD1 mutation analysis) supportive of ALD
             as the cause of cerebral demyelination

          -  Evidence of active cerebral disease - defined as the presence of gadolinium
             enhancement on a single brain MRI study - MRI used for eligibility determination may
             be performed at an outside institution; the most recent MRI used to determine
             eligibility must be within 2 calendar months of the date of enrollment on this study

          -  ALD MRI (Loes) score ≥ 10

          -  Off of N-acetylcysteine, systemic immunosuppressive drugs or any other therapeutic
             intervention (except hydrocortisone and/or fludracortisone for the treatment of
             adrenal insufficiency) for ≥ 10 days prior to the first IT-MSC dose

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;6 months as determined by the enrolling researcher and documented
             in the medical record

          -  Voluntary written consent provided by parent(s)/guardian(s)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A candidate for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as determined by
             the University of Minnesota Inherited Metabolic and Storage Disease group

          -  Inability to undergo sedation, lumbar puncture or MRI studies for any reason

          -  Inability to stay in Minnesota for therapy through the day 28 evaluation
