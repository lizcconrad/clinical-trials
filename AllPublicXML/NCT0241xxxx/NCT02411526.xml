    <textblock>
      Approximately 75 male and female patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder on
      antipsychotic maintenance medication will be enrolled into the study. There will be 4 planned
      cohorts of 14 patients per cohort.

      In Cohorts 1-3, patients' planned participation in the study is for a total of approximately
      22 weeks, including a Screening period of up to 35 days, and a study treatment period of 120
      days (including follow-up).

      In Cohort 4 planned participation in the study is for a total of approximately 18 weeks
      including a Screening period of up to 35 days and a study treatment of 92 days (including
      follow-up).

          5. Have a history of alcohol or drug-dependence as per DSM-V criteria during the 6-month
             period immediately prior to Screening.

          6. Have a history of epilepsy or risk of having seizures.

             30 days prior to Screening.

         10. Have a positive alcohol breathalyzer test at Screening or Admission.

         11. Have a positive Screening test for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV),

             benzodiazepines (unless prescribed), cannabinoids, etc.) at Screening or Admission.

         13. Excessive use of caffeine-containing beverages exceeding 500 mg caffeine/day (5 cups

         16. Donation of blood (&gt;500 mL) or blood products within 2 months (56 days) prior to
             Admission.

         17. Have used any concomitant medications significantly impacting CYP2D6 (moderate and
             strong inducers/inhibitors),within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior
             to Admission. Medications judged to not interact with risperidone may be continued at
             the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with the protocol requirements
             for tapering and washout.

         18. Are unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and study related

         20. Are unable to tolerate the Oral Risperidone Challenge
