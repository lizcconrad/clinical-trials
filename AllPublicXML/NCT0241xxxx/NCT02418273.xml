  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate denosumab as a novel treatment for bone loss in
      children treated with glucocorticoids for rheumatic disorders. This is a pilot Phase 1/2,
      randomized open-label, 12-month clinical trial of denosumab to assess its effect on bone
      resorption markers and bone mineral density (BMD) in children with rheumatic disorders, age 4
      to 16 years, recruited within 1 month of starting a chronic systemic glucocorticoid regimen.
      Primary outcomes include suppression of bone turnover markers and safety assessments.
      Secondary outcomes include changes in bone density as measured by dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) densitometry at
      the radius and tibia.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate denosumab as a novel treatment for bone loss in
      children treated with glucocorticoids for rheumatic disorders. Children with rheumatic
      disorders are at risk for low bone density and fractures from the inflammatory effects of the
      underlying disease, and also from direct effects of glucocorticoids on bone. This is a pilot
      Phase 1/2, randomized open-label, 12-month clinical trial of denosumab to assess its effect
      on bone resorption markers and BMD in children with rheumatic disorders, age 4 to 16 years,
      recruited within 1 month of starting a chronic systemic glucocorticoid regimen. Two different
      sequential doses will be administered to the intervention group and evaluation for safety and
      efficacy will be conducted at study visits. Primary outcomes include suppression of bone
      turnover markers and safety assessments. Secondary outcomes include changes in bone density
      as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed
      tomography (pQCT) densitometry at the radius and tibia.
