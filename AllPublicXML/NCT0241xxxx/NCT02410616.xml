      To compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)

      Background

      Depression is a common mental disorder with a negative impact on mental well-being, quality
      of life, and social and work-related functioning both in the short and longer term.
      Additionally, depression is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, health care
      utilization and health care costs. On a population level, depression is one of the most
      costly diseases. The economic costs of depression were estimated at â‚¬136.3 billion (EU25) in
      2010 in the EU and are still rising. European health care systems face the challenge of
      improving access to cost-effective treatments while simultaneously working to sustain
      budgetary stability in times of economic austerity.

      Internet-based depression treatment appears a very promising alternative to current routine
      depression treatment strategies. Meta-analyses have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness
      and potential cost-effectiveness of Internet-based treatment for depression in controlled
      research setting. Internet-based treatment thus has the potential to keep depression
      treatment affordable, as it enables mental health care providers to reach out to large
      populations needing depression treatment at a better cost-effectiveness than those of
      standard treatment as usual (TAU), but with similar levels of clinical efficacy and quality
      of care. The trials will be conducted in 8 European countries.

      Objective

      To compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended CBT and TAU in secondary care

      Methods

      In Switzerland, a randomized-controlled trial will be carried out in secondary care,
      comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of CBT and TAU for adults with major depressive
      disorder (MDD). Respondents will be followed until 12 months after baseline (measures will be
      taken at BL, 12 weeks, 18 weeks, 6 months and 12 months).

    <description>Internet based blended CBT depression treatment combines individual face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with CBT delivered through an Internet based treatment platform with mobile phone components. The core components of the CBT treatment are: (1) psychoeducation, (2) behavioural activation, (3) cognitive restructuring, and (4) relapse prevention.</description>

    <description>Treatment as usual (TAU) is defined as the routine care that subjects receive when they are diagnosed with depression in the secondary care system.
