    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 vaccination
      schedules of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo administered intramuscularly (IM) as heterologous
      prime-boost regimens.

      This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase
      2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 3 heterologous prime-boost
      regimens using Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo administered to healthy adults participants in
      Europe. The study consists of a screening period of up to 12 weeks, a vaccination period in
      which participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1), followed by a boost vaccination on
      Days 29, 57 or 85, and a post-vaccination phase until 6 month post-boost visit (Days 209, 237
      or 265). After unblinding, only participants who received Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo will
      continue the study until the Day 365 (or until the start of the roll-over study or for an
      additional 12 months [whichever comes first] for participants in France who agree to continue
      the long-term follow-up after Day 365) visit to assess long-term safety and immunogenicity.
      Participants will enroll into 3 cohorts: that is, Cohort 1(Participants will receive
      Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo in an open-label fashion), Cohort 2 (Participants will be
      randomized to receive the prime-boost vaccination with either Ad26.ZEBOV followed by
      MVA-BN-Filo, or placebo in a 14:1 ratio) and Cohort 3 (Participants will be randomized to
      receive the prime-boost vaccination with either Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo, or
      placebo in a 10:3 ratio). In Cohorts 2 and 3, core immunogenicity assessments (humoral and
      cellular assays) will be performed. In Cohort 2, additional immunogenicity assessments will
      be done. In Cohort 1, plasma blast response kinetics will be evaluated. Safety will be
      monitored during the study.

             local regulations], hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy); or
             otherwise be incapable of pregnancy

          -  Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at Screening and a negative urine beta-hCG pregnancy test
             immediately prior to each study vaccine administration

          -  Man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a
             vasectomy performed more than 1 year prior to screening must be willing to use condoms
             for sexual intercourse beginning prior to enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:
