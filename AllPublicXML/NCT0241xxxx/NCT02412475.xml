  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful treatment for children and young adults with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      continues to be a significant challenge. Despite relative improvements in survival for
      patients with newly diagnosed AML, an estimated 40-60% will relapse with the majority
      eventually dying of their relapsed disease. Attaining a subsequent remission in patients who
      relapse is the initial critical step toward achieving a potential cure. As chemotherapy
      resistance is one of the primary drivers of poor treatment response and subsequent relapse in
      AML, identifying methods to reverse this resistance are desperately needed. This clinical
      trial is aimed at improving the remission re-Induction rates for children and adults with
      relapsed or refractory AML through epigenetic modifying agents that have the ability to
      reverse chemotherapy resistance. Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and
      Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), are two epigenetic modifying drugs that
      act on the methylation of proximal promoter regions of genes and on proteins involved in the
      wrapping of DNA around histones, respectively. Both processes play a critical role in
      regulating gene expression, and frequently these genes are involved in chemotherapy
      resistance. These agents are FDA-approved for treatment in adult hematologic malignancies,
      making this an opportune time to begin testing these novel therapies in pediatric leukemia
      trials. This study will investigate chemotherapy priming of relapsed/refractory AML using
      Decitabine and Vorinostat given for 5 days prior to standard re-Induction with Fludarabine,
      Cytarabine and G-CSF for children and adults.

      Phase 1 Study Number of Patients: 12 to 24 evaluable subjects will be required to enroll
      subjects in all 4 dose levels.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine when used in this
           combination with vorinostat, fludarabine, high dose cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) for
           children and young adults with relapsed or refractory AML.

        -  To evaluate the ability to safely deliver the combination of decitabine and vorinostat
           followed by fludarabine, high dose cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) in pediatric and young
           adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

      Secondary Objectives o To establish the extent of hypomethylation of peripheral blood (PB)
      and bone marrow (BM) pre- and post- decitabine and vorinostat treatment by: LINE-1
      methylation assay as a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation. Direct Comprehensive DNA
      methylation analysis Gene expression profiling to assess genetic changes

        -  To analyze the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression pre- and
           post-treatment with decitabine and vorinostat.

        -  To analyze the correlation between biological changes and clinical response

      Selection of Study Patients:

      • Study entry is open to patients regardless of gender or ethnic background. While there will
      be every effort to seek out and include females and minority patients, the patient population
      is expected to be no different than that of other acute leukemia studies at the Medical
      College of Wisconsin.
