      This is a prospective, controlled, multi-country study to verifying the hypoallergenicity of
      the new amino acid-based formula in infants and children aged&lt; 12 years with documented cow's
      milk protein allergy (CMPA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with documented cow's milk allergy, confirmed by one of the following
             criteria, within six months prior to study start (visit 2):

               -  Positive double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCFC) with cow's
                  milk OR

               -  Positive open or single-blind oral food challenge with cow's milk carried out
                  under the supervision of a specialist in children with clear immediate reactions
                  and a positive test for specific IgE (in serum [sIgE&gt;0,35 KUI/L] or skin prick
                  test [SPT ≥ 3 mm]) OR

               -  Reported convincing allergic symptoms following an exposure to milk or a
                  milk-containing food product and detectable serum milk-specific IgE or positive
                  skin prick test

          -  Aged ≤12 years of age at screening.

          -  Expected consumption of a minimum of 250ml of study formula per day during the open
             challenge.

          -  Written informed consent from one or both parents (depending on the local legislation)
             or legal representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who receive breastfeeding at study enrolment.

          -  Had any chronic medical diseases, chromosomal or major congenital anomalies, or major
             gastrointestinal disease/abnormalities (other the CMPA); had immunodeficiency;
             antihistamine [excluding eye drops] use in 7 days prior to a food challenge or oral
             steroid use within 14 days prior to enrolment; unstable asthma; severe uncontrolled
             eczema;

          -  Severe anaphylactic reaction [required ≥ 2 doses of epinephrine] to milk or breast
             milk within the past 2 years;

          -  Existing illness that could interfere with formula acceptance or identification of
             allergic reactions.

          -  Investigator's uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the parents to comply
             with the protocol requirements.

          -  Participation in any other studies involving investigational or marketed products
             concomitantly or within two weeks prior to entry into the study.
