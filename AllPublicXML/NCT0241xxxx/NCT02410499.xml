    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effects of 85 days treatment with MLN1202 on
      urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in participants with type 2 diabetes, advanced
      kidney disease/diabetic nephropathy (DN) and macro-albuminuria (UACR&gt;300 mg/g) based on
      average of 3 consecutive first morning voids sample collection.

      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN1202. MLN1202 is being tested to treat
      people who have diabetes with macroalbuminuria. This study will look at the urinary
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio in people who take MLN1202.

      The study will enroll approximately 156 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  MLN1202 75 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection

        -  MLN1202 105 mg SC injection

        -  MLN1202 150 mg SC injection

        -  Placebo matching MLN1202 SC injection (dummy inactive solution) - this is a solution
           that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants will receive a loading dose of placebo or MLN1202 on Day 1 followed by
      once-weekly injections of the study medication they were randomized to receive.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 5 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 5
      weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

         14. Has hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or to any component of the
