  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate the Mindfulness Based Resilience Training (MBRT)
      intervention for Mayo Clinic employees in order to provide evidence for improved ability to
      cope with stress and decreased work-related burnout and stress-related symptoms as a result
      of MBRT training. In addition, the investigators aim to compare the effects of MBRT +
      smartphone sleep feedback, a smartphone resilience intervention + smartphone sleep feedback,
      or waitlist control +smartphone sleep feedback in a randomized clinical trial in a sample of
      75 Mayo Clinic employees.

      The investigators aim to compare the effects of MBRT + smartphone sleep feedback, a
      smartphone resilience intervention + smartphone sleep feedback, or waitlist control
      +smartphone sleep feedback in a randomized clinical trial in a sample of 75 Mayo Clinic
      employees. Specific self-report outcomes include: well-being, stress, anxiety, depression,
      fatigue, resilience, self-compassion, and burn-out, assessed at pre-, post- and 3-month
      followup. Objective outcomes, derived from smartphone-driven self-monitoring, include sleep
      quality and emotional experiencing, assessed throughout the six-week intervention period. The
      investigators will explore whether changes in objectively measured sleep quality and
      emotional experiencing will mediate treatment effects on self-report outcomes. The
      investigators will also explore whether treatment effects are more robust in self-selected
      versus randomized groups by drawing on the investigators' existing data.

    <description>2 hours/week for 6 week, in classroom intervention involving mindfulness based resilience training.focused on mindfulness and self-compassion training, including body awareness, breath awareness, mindful movement, awareness of thoughts, and awareness of emotion. Core concepts included: normalizing experience of stress and changing one's relationship with an experience; learning to be a compassionate observer of self in order to appreciate the moment; recognizing undue efforts to control something that has already happened; shifting attention to felt body sense and away from the narrative; and redirecting attention to a value as a way of evoking positive states that enhance the present moment experience. Participants also use the smartphone to track their sleep and subjective well-being.</description>
