          -  Participants who have hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≤9.4% (National Glycohemoglobin
             Standardization Program [NGSP]) at screening

          -  Participants who have HbA1c that has been measured 42 to 70 days prior to screening,

          -  Participants who have a score of at least 4 on the mean of the 24-hour average pain
             score measured using 11-point NRS in the daily diary (should be calculated from
             records 7 days immediately prior to randomization)

          -  Participants who have made complete daily diary entries 80% or more of the time from
