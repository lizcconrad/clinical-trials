  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators team had found that the presence of dynamic changes of Clopidogrel
      resistance are not associated with genetic factors. Currently, study on moderate doses of
      statins and dynamic Clopidogrel resistance has not been reported, therefore this study will
      observe 160 cases of open prospective secondary prevention in patients with cerebral
      infarction. Excluded: those patients occurs Clopidogrel resistance because of slow metabolism
      caused by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19（CYP2C19, and then observed the impact of the
      cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）-metabolized and non-cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4
      （CYP3A4）—metabolized statins dynamically on Clopidogrel resistance in the next 9 months,
      adverse events will be recorded, the metabolite of clopidogrel（H4 ）and the polymorphism of
      cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19 （CYP2C19）/cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）/ cytochrome
      P450 isoenzyme 2C9（CYP2C9）will be detected. Expected Result: the patients use the cytochrome
      P450 isoenzyme 3A4（CYP3A4）-metabolized statins will result in dynamic Clopidogrel resistance
      easily ,H4 levels will decline, and Clopidogrel resistance is not related to the polymorphism
      of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 （CYP3A4）.

    <description>Definition of clopidogrel resistance is the absolute change of 5 microliter adenosine diphosphate(ADP) induced PAR≤10% as compared to baseline. So, incidence of clopidogrel resistance= (PAR at monitor point - PAR at baseline) / PAR at baseline×100 %≤10 %。 Measures of PAR: PAR is measured by Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and according to the standard of Rev。</description>
