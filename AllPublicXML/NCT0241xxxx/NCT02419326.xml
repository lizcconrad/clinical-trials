  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
      of a novel couple-based intervention for binge-eating disorder (BED).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although current individual treatments exist for BED (e.g., cognitive-behavior therapy and
      interpersonal psychotherapy) about 20% of individuals who complete treatment and who are
      abstinent from binge eating post-treatment relapse within one year. In addition, dropout of
      BED treatment is high (approximately 10 - 33%), indicating that a significant number of
      individuals with BED fail to achieve relief from their symptoms. Couple-based interventions,
      which enlist the support of a partner into the treatment setting, are effective for treating
      anxiety and depression--frequently comorbid conditions with BED. Preliminary findings of
      couple-based treatment for anorexia nervosa suggests it assists in reducing drop out and
      improving outcome. Thus, the investigators developed a novel couple-based intervention for
      adult BED (UNITE-BED Edition) and plan to investigate it in an open treatment trial to
      examine it's feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Both patients and partners
      will be involved in all psychotherapy sessions of the treatment. Couples' progress will be
      followed for three months after completion of active treatment.
