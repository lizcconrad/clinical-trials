  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether reducing a patient's body temperature (mild
      hypothermia of 33 degrees Centigrade) will significantly reduce the risk of brain injury
      (notably reperfusion injury and hemorrhagic conversion) in patients who have suffered a
      significant interruption of blood flow to an area of brain (occlusion of large proximal
      cerebral artery) and have undergone successful removal of that interruption
      (revascularization).This will be achieved by comparing patients who have undergone
      hypothermia to those who have not.

      This study is designed to examine the safety and proof of concept of therapeutic hypothermia
      prior to conventional revascularization in subjects experiencing acute ischemic stroke by
      comparing the results to subjects who remain at normal body temperature (normothermic) and
      proceed directly to reperfusion via conventional reperfusion intervention.

      The investigational plan also examines the following outcomes in 85 subjects randomized to
      either hypothermia or normothermia:

        -  Regulation of biomarkers indicative of ischemia-reperfusion injury

        -  Changes in blood brain injury using the Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker (HARM)
           protocol MRI as a surrogate imaging biomarker

        -  Incidence of hemorrhagic conversion post reperfusion

        -  Neurologic function at 90 days post acute ischemic stroke.

      The results of this study will be used to power a definitive phase III clinical trial
      evaluating the combination of hypothermia and revascularization versus reperfusion alone.

Subjects will also have a catheter placed in the femoral vein (Zoll Thermogard XP technology with the Quattro catheter) and temperature brought to 33 degrees centigrade as quickly as possible. They will stay in mild hypothermia for 12 hours, and then be rewarmed very slowly.</description>
