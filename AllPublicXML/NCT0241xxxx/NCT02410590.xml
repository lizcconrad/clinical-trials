  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the preference between two strategies of
      neuromuscular blocking (NMB) / reversal in adult obese patients undergoing laparoscopic
      abdominal surgery: Rocuronium + Sugammadex versus Succinylcholine + Cisatracurium +
      Neostigmine/Atropine. This will be done evaluating the average verbal numerical scale (VNS)
      scores obtained from surgeons blinded to the drugs administered. The primary hypothesis is
      that the strategy &quot;Rocuronium + Sugammadex&quot; provides a better surgical visual field in obese
      participants undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery than the strategy &quot;Succinylcholine +
      Cisatracurium + Neostigmine/Atropine&quot; as measured by VNS scores.

    <description>Participants will receive rocuronium administered at a dosage adequate to make intubation possible and provide deep NMB (defined as no response to train-of-four stimulation but at least one response to five post-tetanic count [PTC]) for the duration of surgery, until the end of the procedure. Sugammadex will be administered to participants once at a dosage of 4 mg/kg real body weight (RBW) IV at the end of surgical procedure. Sugammadex will be used as the only reversal drug in all participants who receive rocuronium as a neuromuscular blocker.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>After receiving succinylcholine 1.0 mg/kg RBW for intubation, participants will receive cisatracurium administered at dosage adequate to have a moderate NMB (defined as a target of TOF ratio = 10% with a range: 2-3 twitches to TOF ratio of 20%) for the duration of surgery, until the end of the procedure. Neostigmine/Atropine will be administered to participants once at respective dosage of 0.05 mg/kg RBW and 0.01 mg/kg RBW at least after the reappearance of T2 after surgery completion. The maximum allowed dosage for Neostigmine is 5 mg. Neostigmine will be used as only reversal drug in all participants who received Cisatracurium as neuromuscular blocker.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  must be obese, with a Body Mass Index ≥30.0 to ≤50.

          -  must be scheduled to undergo an elective abdominal laparoscopic surgery, under general
             anesthesia. (Participants are expected to remain in the hospital for at least 24 hours
             following surgical procedure.)

          -  must be categorized as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 1, 2, or 3.

          -  clinical laboratory tests within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the
             investigator/sponsor.

          -  sexually active females of child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically
             accepted method of contraception while receiving protocol-specified medication and for
             the 30 days after stopping the medication. Medically accepted methods of contraception
             include condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent, diaphragm or
             cervical cap with spermicide, medically prescribed IUD, inert or copper-containing
             IUD, hormone-releasing IUD, systemic hormonal contraceptive, and surgical
             sterilization (eg, hysterectomy or tubal ligation). Postmenopausal women are not
             required to use contraception. Postmenopausal is defined as at least 12 consecutive
             months without a spontaneous menstrual period. Each sexually active male subject with
             a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must also provide written informed
             consent to provide information regarding any pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  has anatomical malformations that may lead to difficult intubation.

          -  is known or suspected to have neuromuscular disorders that may affect NMB and/or trial
             assessments.

          -  history of previous abdominal laparoscopy procedures.

          -  must not currently (within past 6 months) meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for substance abuse
             or dependence (excluding nicotine).

          -  history of a chronic pain condition (requiring continuous/daily pain medication prior
             to surgery).

          -  females who have given birth to one or more children in the last 12 months, or are
             pregnant or intend to become pregnant between randomization and &gt;Day 30 pregnancy
             follow-up contact [premenopausal female of childbearing potential].

          -  evidence of acute cholecystitis.

          -  dialysis-dependency or suspected of having severe renal insufficiency (defined as
             estimated creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min).

          -  significant hepatic dysfunction that would prevent participation in the trial, based
             on the summary of product characteristics of the study drugs.

          -  history of or family history of malignant hyperthermia.

          -  known allergy to trial treatments (rocuronium, sugammadex, succinylcholine,
             cisatracurium, neostigmine, atropine) or their excipients, to opioids/opiates, or
             other medication used during general anesthesia.

          -  expected transfer to intensive care unit after surgery.
