  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Norwegian Directorate of Health recently published the Norwegian food-based dietary
      guidelines (NFBDG) in 2011. The target for the NFBDG is the general population, and the main
      aims of these guidelines are to promote public health and prevent chronic degenerative
      diseases. Reaching the healthy population is crucial as only small proportion of the general
      population comply to the current public dietary advice in Norway. Thus, the objective of this
      study is to investigate whether a multi-faceted dietary intervention could increase
      compliance to the NFBDG and affect biomarkers of chronic degenerative diseases in a healthy
      population.

      The study was conducted as part of a master level course in Clinical Nutrition at the
      University of Oslo. Thus, the main objective of the study was to teach the master students
      about planning, conducting and analysing data from a clinical trial. The students themselves
      are subjects of the study, however the participation in the study was voluntary and did in no
      way affect the approval of the course.

      Since the primary objective of the study was teaching, the study was confirmed by the
      &quot;Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics&quot; (REC) to be exempt from REC
      approval.
