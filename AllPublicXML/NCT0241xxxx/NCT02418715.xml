  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of water-based exercises on lipid
      profile (LP) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) levels in premenopausal dyslipidemic women.

      It was hypothesized that a water-based aerobic interval-training period would decrease plasma
      concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins and concomitantly increase HDL and LPL levels, as
      well as maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) values.

    <description>The training period was composed by a 12-week macrocycle with two sessions per week. The macrocycle was divided into three four-week mesocycles that were, in turn, divided into four one-week microcycles composed by two training sessions. Each training session took 45 min. Nine different water-aerobics exercises were used during the training period. These exercises were performed alternating the right and left limbs. Exercise intensities were controlled using the Borg Scale. Interval training was used alternating intensities ranged between 9 (easy) and 15 (hard). During the first mesocycle, participants performed sets of 3min at intensity 13 interspersed by 2min at intensity 9; during the second mesocycle, sets of 3min at intensity 15 followed by 2min at intensity 9 were performed; finally, sessions of the third mesocycle were composed by sets of 3min at intensity 15 followed by 2min at intensity 11.</description>
