  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory, retrospective laboratory study is to assess the humoral
      immune response to H1 hemagglutinin stalk domain and other influenza A virus protein epitopes
      following administration, in adults and children, of GSK Biologicals' adjuvanted and
      unadjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccines, using archived serum samples from previously
      completed clinical trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Not applicable since no subjects will be actively enrolled in this study; only the sera
        samples of the subjects who were a part of previously conducted primary trials will be used
        for testing. However, the archived serum samples of only those subjects who satisfy the
        following criteria will be included in this study:

          -  Subjects who received two doses of influenza vaccine 21 days apart and were included
             in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity and Persistence cohort (depending on the study)
             in the primary studies listed.

          -  Subjects who had agreed that their blood samples could be used for further research
             while giving informed consent for any of the primary studies listed.

          -  Subjects who have sufficient residual sample volume (i.e., ≥0.5 mL) of serum at all
             time points.

          -  Subjects with vaccine homologous neutralizing antibody result available at Day 0 and
             at 21 (25 samples available per group in Study H9N2-001)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not applicable since no subjects will be actively enrolled in this study; only the
             serum samples of the subjects who were a part of previously conducted trials will be
             used for testing.
