  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy aging is associated with a decline in multiple cognitive domains, as well as motor
      control function. The long-term consequences of cognitive and functional impairment resulting
      from age-related cognitive decline are well documented in the scientific and clinical
      literature, with significant evidence of related problems with independent functional
      abilities. This study aims to understand how the experimental computer program can affect
      cognition and attention in participants with age-related cognitive decline.

      Following consent, participants will engage in an assessment process to determine
      eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be scheduled for another
      assessment session to determine current level of cognitive function. This process consists of
      paper-pencil surveys and computerized tests. Following the assessment process, participants
      will engage in an Internet browser-delivered training sessions conducted on any
      internet-accessible computer. The computerized training sessions can be done up to 7 times a
      week (once a day) or at the participant's convenience (the recommended time commitment is 5
      times a week). Following the completion of training, the participant's cognitive function
      will be re-assessed. Participation is voluntary and participants may withdraw from the study
      at any time.
