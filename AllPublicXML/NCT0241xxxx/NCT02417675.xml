  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Western Cape province of South Africa (SA) is changing the way it treats pregnant women
      with HIV. Now, all HIV-infected pregnant women, regardless of how sick or healthy they are,
      will receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) for life (&quot;Option B+&quot;). However, there are few
      well-developed models of service delivery to support this change to &quot;Option B+&quot; in the
      Western Cape and many parts of the continent.

      The parent study -- Strategies to Optimize ART Services for Maternal &amp; Child Health
      (MCH-ART)-- is testing two clinic-based models of service delivery for Option B+ . To
      complement MCH-ART, this study, PACER, will test whether community-based Adherence Clubs are
      an effective model for keeping breastfeeding women in HIV care after pregnancy. These clubs
      have been used to free up space at ART clinics by moving stable HIV+ patients to
      community-based services, but they have not been studied as an effective strategy among
      breastfeeding women after delivery. PACER seeks to address this gap.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Western Cape province of South Africa (SA) is implementing the policy of universal
      initiation of lifelong ART in all HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of CD4 cell count or
      disease stage (&quot;Option B+&quot;). However there are few well-developed models of service delivery
      to support implementation of &quot;Option B+&quot; in the Western Cape and many parts of the continent.
      In particular, while systems for initiation and follow-up of pregnant women on ART are based
      within well-established antenatal care clinics (ANC), there are major concerns regarding
      delivery of ART to HIV-infected women during the postpartum period. Multiple studies indicate
      high levels of non-retention in care, and/or inadequate ART adherence, during the postpartum
      period, presenting a threat to HIV-infected women and their infants.4-8 In turn, there is an
      urgent need for evidence-based approaches to support the growing number of HIV-infected
      mothers on ART.

      In this context, the parent study-- Strategies to Optimize ART Services for Maternal &amp; Child
      Health (MCH-ART)-- provides a rigorous implementation science framework for understanding
      optimal approaches for managing HIV-infected women and their HIV-exposed infants in the first
      year after delivery under &quot;Option B+&quot;. While MCH-ART focuses on clinic-based models of care,
      there is also growing attention to the role of community health workers (CHWs) in supporting
      patients on ART, including community-based distribution and adherence support away from
      health facilities.To complement MCH-ART, the PACER study aims to investigate community-based
      Adherence Clubs as an effective model for engaging and retaining breastfeeding women beyond
      pregnancy to maximize maternal and infant health. In Cape Town, specifically, Adherence Clubs
      have been developed in which ART services are located away from clinics and are led by CHWs
      with support from ART clinic nurses. These clubs have been implemented to help decongest ART
      clinics by shifting stable patients to community-based services, but they have not been
      studied as an effective strategy among breastfeeding women in the postpartum period. PACER
      seeks to address this gap by randomizing women in the parent study, MCH-ART, to either the AC
      system or to the nearest adult ART clinic. Infants in both arms will receive the same
      services, following the local standard of care.

    <description>Women who choose the Community-based Adherence Clubs (AC) will receive postpartum antiretroviral therapy (ART) services at an AC, rather than at their nearest primary care clinic as in the SOC arm. Details are provided in the intervention section.
Infants receive the same care in each arm, according to the Standard of Care for Infants.</description>

    <description>Women in the AC arm are prescribed 2 months of their current ART medication (compared to 1 month in the SOC) and will be advised to go to the AC office immediately, where they will be scheduled for their first session. Women will attend AC meetings every two months. At these meetings, women will receive a 2 month supply of medication, health education and peer-support. A trained Community Health Worker (CHW) will also collect blood samples, weight, and current signs/symptoms from women.
Each participant has 5 working days after their AC session to come and collect her medication. Those who have defaulted will be followed up by the CHW via phone calls and, possibly, home visits. If reached, women will be told to return immediately to the main ART facility for receipt of ART care.</description>

    <description>Women will be referred immediately from the maternity ART clinic to their nearest adult ART clinic at their first postpartum clinic visit. At referral, they receive an initial 1-month supply of their current ART medication. At the first appointment after transfer into the general ART service, patients undergo clinical history and examination by a doctor or clinical nurse practitioner. Laboratory investigations are ordered according to standard protocols or based on clinician discretion. For the 1st 4 months in the new service, stable patients are dispensed 1 month of ART; subsequent visits are 2-monthly for medication refill, with clinician review 6-monthly; patients with particular clinical or psychosocial concerns may be reviewed more regularly, or referred to higher levels of care.</description>

    <description>All infants will receive care at their nearest primary care clinic. Following national protocols, all HIV-infected mothers are issued a 6-week supply of nevirapine syrup after delivery and counselled on daily nevirapine prophylaxis. Infant follow-up takes place within 1 week postpartum with the mother (at the MOU) and then at 6 weeks postpartum (at the nearest primary care clinic) when HIV PCR testing of the infant is carried out. Following national protocols, infants who are breastfed beyond 6 weeks receive HIV PCR testing 2-4 weeks after the cessation of breastfeeding, again conducted at the nearest City of Cape Town primary care clinic.</description>
