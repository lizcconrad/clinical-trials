  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40 subjects will be enrolled, randomized and treated. Enrolled subjects will receive
      one, split-face Ulthera® treatment on the face and neck using a standard transducer on one
      side of the face and a simulines transducers on the other side of the face. Follow-up visits
      will occur at 90 and 180 days post-treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment,
      immediately post-treatment, and at each follow-up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, split-face, randomized pilot trial to determine the
      clinical feasibility of the simulines transducers, i.e., transducers which deliver two lines
      of treatment simultaneously (at once), in comparison to the standard transducers which
      deliver a single treatment line, by collecting average pain scores in the treated regions, as
      well as efficacy and treatment efficiency data. There will be 3 study arms with each arm
      having 2 treatment groups. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms, and
      one of two treatment groups within each study arm.to determine which side of the face will be
      treated with standard transducers and simulines transducers and the energy level for
      treatment. Subjects will receive one dual-depth treatment at 4.5mm and 3.0mm depths.

      Clinical feasibility will be assessed based on comfort level of standard transducers versus
      simulines transducers by comparing average pain scores obtained during study treatment.
      Efficacy will be determined based on qualitative masked assessment of post-treatment
      photographs compared to pre-treatment photographs and quantitative eyebrow lift measurements.
      Patient satisfaction questionnaires will be obtained.
