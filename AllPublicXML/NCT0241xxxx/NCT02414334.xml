    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      SABR (Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy) is one of the standard treatment options besides
      surgical resection for limited lung metastases (oligometastases) from colorectal cancer. High
      efficacy in terms of local control of metastatic lesions treated has been shown.
      Nevertheless, the precise effect of SABR upon progression-free- and overall survival in these
      patients is unknown. To further evaluate and develop local treatment options in metastatic
      disease, more information is necessary regarding the impact upon - and the pattern of -
      disease progression of local treatment options such as SABR.

      Objective:

      To determine the effect upon progression free survival and upon tumorload relative to
      baseline, both at one year after randomisation of immediate SABR versus delayed SABR (a
      scan-and-personalise policy). Secondarily, patterns of progression, patient-reported symptoms
      and quality of life will be monitored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  WHO-Performance status (WHO-PS) 0 - 1

          -  Patients with 1 to 3 lung metastases between 8 mm and 3 cm each, from colorectal
             cancer. Resection has been considered at a multidisciplinary conference but was not
             recommended or has been refused by the patient.

          -  Possibility to define target lesions that fulfil the following criteria:

               -  No lesion larger than 3 cm;

               -  Not more than 3 metastases ≥ 8 mm in total (lesions smaller than 8 mm in diameter
                  are NOT counted and will NOT be irradiated);

          -  No prior radiotherapy (SABR or other) within about 2 cm from target lesions (i.e., the
             distance between prior planning-target-volume (PTV) to actual intended PTV is more
             than 2 cm AND dose distribution of former radiation permits SABR).

          -  Primary tumour has been completely removed surgically.

          -  Metastases outside target organs (e.g. liver metastases or other) are radically
             treated locally (resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA),
             stereotactic radiotherapy, or other). Earlier resected or ablated (SABR, RFA, MWA)
             metastases to lung, liver, or other organ form no exclusion criterion. Brain
             metastases should be completely resected or treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.
             Bone metastases should be resected or treated with high dose radiotherapy (equivalent
             of &gt; 40 Gy) and be asymptomatic.

          -  Patients at reproductive potential must agree to practice an effective contraceptive
             method. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating.

          -  Proficiency in the Dutch language so that quality-of-life questionnaires can be
             completed in Dutch and absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or
             geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and
             follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before
             registration in the trial.

          -  Before patient randomisation, informed consent must be given according to
             International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration
             of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) of the European Union (EU) in accordance with
             good clinical practice (GCP), and national/local regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinical symptoms possibly or certainly caused by index lungmetastases

          -  Physical inability to undergo stereotactic radiotherapy (e.g., serious shoulder
             stiffness)

          -  Any uncontrolled malignancy other than index colorectal cancer

          -  Other malignancy within recent two years, even if completely under control (under
             control = no evidence of disease)

          -  Failure to comply with any of the inclusion criteria
