    <textblock>
      A total of 63 subjects will be recruited into three groups (18 subjects per group will
      receive MVA BN RSV vaccine and three subjects per group will receive placebo). Liquid frozen
      suspension of MVA BN RSV.

      Each subject will receive two vaccinations with either MVA-BN RSV vaccine 1 x 108 TCID50 per
      0.5 ml, 1 x 107 TCID50 per 0.5 ml or with placebo.
