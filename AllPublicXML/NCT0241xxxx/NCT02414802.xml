  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the novel aspiration thrombectomy device
      combined with catheter-directed thrombolysis is effective in the treatment of acute
      iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IF-DVT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-directed thrombolysis will be performed in eligible patients with acute IF-DVT. A
      combined mechanical thrombectomy will be used to clear the iliac thrombi in experimental
      group. The immediate, mid- and long-term outcomes will be recorded. Quantitative data wiil be
      expressed as mean ± SD, and will be compared with independent-sample t-test or paired-sample
      t-test. Count data will be expressed as a ratio (or percentage), and the chi-square test or
      the fisher's exact test will be used for comparisons. A difference with P &lt; 0.05 will be
      considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses will be performed using IBM
      SPSS, version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
