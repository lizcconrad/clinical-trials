      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of e-TNS with the Cefaly® device as
      an acute treatment for a migraine attack. This open clinical trial will study the acute
      treatment of migraine using the Cefaly® device, prior to development of a sham-controlled
      trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with a history of episodic or chronic migraine with or without aura, meeting
             the diagnostic criteria listed in ICHD-III beta (2013) section 1, migraine (1), with
             the exception of ''complicated migraine'' (i.e., hemiplegic migraine, migraine with
             brainstem aura, ophthalmoplegic migraine- recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic
             neuropathy, migrainous infarction)

          -  The patient must be experiencing a migraine attack lasting for at least 3 hours, with
             pain intensity stabilized for at least 1 hour. The location of the headache should be
             frontal, retro- or peri- orbital, on one or either side.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Patients having received treatment with onabotulinum toxin (e.g., Botox, Dysport,
             Xeomin) to the head in the prior 4 months

          -  Patients having received supraorbital nerve blocks in the prior 4 months

          -  Diagnosis of other primary or secondary headache disorders, except of Medication
             Overuse Headache

          -  Patients with only temporal or occipital headaches

          -  Patients taking opioid medications

          -  Patients having taken abortive migraine medication in the prior 3 hours

          -  Allodynia: intolerance to supraorbital neurostimulation (allodynia) that makes the
             treatment not applicable (the patients will be excluded while the neurostimulation has
             already started).

          -  Implanted metal or electrical devices in the head

          -  Cardiac pacemaker or implanted or wearable defibrillator
