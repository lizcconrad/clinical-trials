        <description>Steady-State Volume of Distribution is the theoretical volume that the total amount of administered drug would have to occupy (if it were uniformly distributed), to provide the same concentration as it is in blood plasma at steady state. Geometric coefficient of variation is given as the percent coefficient of variation. This outcome measure is for the Ertugliflozin intravenous drug profile only so no participants were analyzed in the Ertugliflozin oral arm.</description>
