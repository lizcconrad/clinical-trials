    <textblock>
      CC-122-NHL-001 study is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib study with dose escalation and
      expansion parts. It evaluates the safety, tolerability and clinical pharmacokinetics of
      CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab (GA101). The study is also assessing the preliminary
      efficacy of the combination as well as pharmacodynamic and tumor biomarkers as exploratory
      objectives. In the dose escalation part, the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of
      CC-122 administered with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab will be administered to identify the
      maximum tolerated dose. In the dose expansion part, more patients will be enrolled at a
      CC-122 dose selected from the escalation part of the study in combination with fixed dose
      obinutuzumab to further study safety and efficacy.

      The one or two cohorts during the dose expansion phase (Part B) will enroll subjects with
      relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who were either refractory to or relapsed
      after treatment with a lenalidomide-containing regimen (FL-1 cohort) or never been exposed to
      lenalidomide (FL-2 cohort). The FL-1 and FL-2 cohorts will enroll up to 20 and/or up to 30
      subjects, respectively.
