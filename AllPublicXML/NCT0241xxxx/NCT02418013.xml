  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to carry out a safety evaluation of human cord blood and frozen plasma as
      treatment for pre-frailty , to assess whether the treatment can prevent and improve the aging
      process, and to identify useful clinical markers of frailty.

      The study is a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled pilot clinical Trial
      conducted at CHA clinical trial institute.

      Assessment criteria for the study include (1) clinical indicators-weight loss, a decrease in
      physical activity, weak grip strength, depression; (2) Short Physical Performance
      Battery(SPPB); (3) SF-36; (4)cardiac output; (4)biomarkers for oxidative stress, inflammation
      and immune response; (5) methylation; (6) mitochondria DNA copy number; (7) growth factors;
      (8) antioxidant capacity; (9) hormone assay; (10) genome assay; (11) metabolite; (12) safety
      of intravenous administration.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to three experimental groups and one control group in
      a ratio of 1:1:1:1. At second visit, the participants will be administered with experimental
      and placebo agents. Follow-up visits are expected to be at 7 days, 1 and 6 months after the
      first treatment. Sixth visit is the completion of it.

      Primary end points are defined as severe clinical abnormalities, which could be observed
      until 1 month after administration of blood-derived products, including death, pulmonary
      embolism, stroke, respiratory stress and hospitalization due to abnormal findings in
      laboratory tests.
