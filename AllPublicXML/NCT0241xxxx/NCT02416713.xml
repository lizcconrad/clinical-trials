  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research participants will be recruited to take part in a randomized control trial.
      Participants' cellphone use will be observed during an initial baseline period. Participants
      will then be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: education only (control), opt-in
      blocking, opt-out blocking, and opt-out blocking with parental notification.

    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death in teens in the United State and for
      drivers aged 15-19 involved in fatal crashes, 21% of distracted drivers were distracted by
      the use of cellphones. Nearly 90% of teens expect a response to a text message within 5
      minutes, and the compulsion to respond is stronger for messages from close social contacts.
      This suggests that behavioral-economic interventions such as immediate and frequent
      incentives are needed to offset the disutility caused by not being able to communicate by
      cellphone while driving. If proven to be effective, incentives could be scaled up via auto
      insurance discount contributions, school programs, and parental contributions.
