  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second cause of death worldwide and represented the first cause of death in
      Brazil between 2006 and 2010. Most patients survive, and there is a need to develop
      cost-effective rehabilitation strategies to decrease the burden of disability from stroke.
      This study addresses this important issue, by combining two different interventions in the
      early phase post-stroke: robotic therapy associated or not with transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS), as adjuvant interventions to conventional physical therapy, for motor
      upper limb rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our main goal is to confirm the safety of robotic therapy associated with active tDCS and
      conventional therapy, compared to robotic therapy associated with sham tDCS and to
      conventional therapy, and to conventional therapy alone, for upper limb rehabilitation in an
      early phase (3-9 weeks) after stroke. Patients will be randomized to receive one of these
      three treatments, 3 times per week, for 6 weeks.

      Data about eventual adverse effect will be collected in each session of treatment. The
      working hypothesis is that robotic therapy associated with active tDCS and conventional
      therapy will be as safe as robotic therapy associated with conventional therapy, and as
      conventional therapy alone.

      We will aso preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of robotic therapy associated with active
      tDCS and conventional therapy, compared to robotic therapy associated with sham tDCS and to
      conventional therapy alone, in improvement of upper limb motor impairment.

      Our secondary goals are: 1) To evaluate safety and upper limb motor impairments in patients
      submitted to each of the three interventions, 6 months after end of treatment; 2) To compare
      effects of the abovementioned interventions on disability, spasticity and quality of life, in
      patients at an early stage after stroke, immediately after treatment and 6 months later.

      The working hypothesis is that the association of robotic therapy, tDCS and conventional
      therapy will lead to better outcomes than robotic therapy and conventional therapy, or
      conventional therapy alone.

      Patients will be assessed before the first session and after the last session of treatment,
      as well as 6 months after the last session of treatment.
