  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction is growing in prevalence all over the world and one of the most existing
      disease in old age patients There is many lines of treatment concerning the status of patient
      like psychosexual, medical, and surgical treatment But Pyronie's disease is common now among
      people especially diabetics, and the role of treatment still controversial in results We can
      start conservative treatment and then surgical treatment if fail but the outcome still not
      convinced Many patients refuse to fix penile prosthesis and to make operation like nesbite
      for probability of shortening of penis We start to use stem cell in patients have erectile
      dysfunction and Peyronie's disease The injection of stem cell will be at corpora cavernosa
      and intra dorsal penile artery under Doppler device guidance

      Peyronie's disease associated with erectile dysfunction nan be treated by different methods
      We start to treat such patients with adipose tissue stem cell Harvesting stem cell from
      adipose tissue and injected into corpora cavernosa and penile artery and we assess quality of
      erection through patient history and penile duplex and also assess plaque size and other
      symptoms related to Peyronie's disease
