      Our team will develop a prototype game (OnTrack&gt;The Game) in which users play the role of a
      person who has experienced First Episode Psychosis and move through animated role-playing
      scenarios, learning practical tips for engaging in care, playing mini-games to develop self-
      advocacy skills, and seeing stories of hope and recovery (brief video vignettes). The game is
      designed in an engaging comic book style in which the player is presented with realistic
      situations designed to promote engagement and the development of trusting relationships.

      Following development of the prototype, the investigators will conduct a pilot study to
      develop preliminary data to determine feasibility of a large-scale Phase 2 effectiveness
      study. This pilot study aims to demonstrate proof of concept for OnTrack&gt;The Game. The
      investigators will recruit a sample of patients/consumers (n=25) from OnTrackNY sites that
      offer services for those experiencing their first psychotic episode. Quantitative data will
      be collected through baseline and follow up surveys that utilize instruments to measure
      knowledge and attitudes about recovery, perceptions of stigma, feelings of empowerment and
      sense of hopefulness. The investigators will also conduct semi-structured interviews with a
      subset of participants to explore engagement in treatment and attitudes toward the game.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In light of research supporting early first episode psychosis (FEP) intervention models as
      well as the efficacy of video gaming to engage young people with FEP in treatment, the
      connection between the two needs to be explored. A gaming tool for first-episode psychosis
      has the potential to improve patient care; and, decrease stigma associated with
      schizophrenia.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that Phase 1 of this study will demonstrate that the videogame
      is comprehensible, engaging and easy to maneuver. The investigators hypothesize that the
      results from the pilot study will suggest that this technologically innovative tool has
      potential to enhance positive outcomes of research-tested interventions, such as OnTrackNY,
      for individuals with FEP.

      Approach:

      Our team will develop a prototype game (OnTrack&gt;The Game) in which users play the role of a
      person who has experienced FEP and move through animated role-playing scenarios, learning
      practical tips for engaging in care, playing mini-games to develop self- advocacy skills, and
      seeing stories of hope and recovery (brief video vignettes). The game is designed in an
      engaging comic book style in which the player is presented with realistic situations designed
      to promote engagement and the development of trusting relationships.

      Following development of the prototype, the investigators will conduct a pilot study to

      investigators will recruit a sample of patients/consumers (n=25) from OnTrackNY sites that
      offer services for those experiencing their first psychotic episode. Quantitative data will

    <description>The Herth Hope Index (HHI) will be employed to assess hope in adults immediately before (Month 9; week 36) and 2 weeks (Month 10; week 40) following game play. The instrument is a 12-item survey adapted from the Herth Hope Scale (HHS) (Herth, 1992). The Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ-16) will also be used, which helps consumers identify and think about their beliefs and attitudes toward recovery. The instrument is a 16-item survey that will be employed immediately before (week 36) and 2 weeks after game play (week 40) (Borkin et al, 2000).</description>

    <description>Consumers who have been referred to OnTrackNY sites at Washington Heights Community Service or Mental Health Association Westchester in the past six months will be recruited to participate in a product evaluation of OnTrack&gt;The Game.
Intervention: This is a behavioral/attitudinal intervention, using OnTrack&gt;The Game, which will include each participant sitting down at a computer for approximately one hour (over the course of one week) to complete the prototype game. Users will take on the role of a person who has experienced first-episode psychosis and moves through animated role-playing scenarios, learn practical tips for engaging in care, play mini-games to develop self-advocacy skills, and view stories of hope and recovery (brief video vignettes).</description>
