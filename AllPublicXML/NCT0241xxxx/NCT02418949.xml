    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a new rehabilitation approach for stroke survivors in the chronic phase
      of recovery in which the combination of drug therapy (cyproheptadine) and active movement
      practice (AMP) is used to encourage increased voluntary muscle control and strength.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this four arm parallel design you will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups:

      Group 1) cyproheptadine and active movement therapy, Group 2) placebo and active movement
      therapy, Group 3) cyproheptadine and passive stretching, or Group 4) placebo and passive
      stretching.

      The groups will be blinded so neither you nor the research staff (or even the study doctor)
      will know which drug (Cyproheptadine or placebo) you receive. Only the RIC pharmacist will
      have access to this information until all participants complete the entire study. Although
      you and the research staff administering the training sessions will know if you have been
      assigned to the active movement practice (AMP) or passive cyclical stretching group, it is
      important not to discuss this information with the rater (evaluator) or the study doctor.

      Cyproheptadine is an anti-serotonergic and anti spastic agent. It is expected to reduce the
      unwanted muscle hyper excitability (one measure of spasticity) common after stroke.

      During the course of the treatment you will be required to make several visits per week to
      RIC to either be evaluated or participate in the treatment sessions. Evaluations last
      approximately 2 hours and will be performed at the beginning of weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, during
      the middle of treatment (beginning of week 7), at the end of training (beginning of week 10)
      as well as a final follow-up visit one month after the end of treatment (beginning of week
      14). The training sessions will occur from weeks 4 through week 9 and will involve 1.5-hr.
      sessions (1 hr training plus setup time) 3 times per week.

      The investigators hypothesize that the group receiving the combined cyproheptadine and active
      movement therapy will have better outcomes than the groups receiving cyproheptadine or active
      movement therapy alone.

Week 1 dose: 4mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 2 dose: 8mg taken twice daily (orally) Week 3 dose: (chronic dose): 8 mg taken three times daily (orally). Chronic dose will be maintained throughout the 6 weeks of Active movement practice (AMP) treatment (1 hour sessions 3x/week).
