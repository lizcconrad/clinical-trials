  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients with complications of COPD and asthma have features mixed with two diseases,
      COPD and asthma. Therefore, the outcomes are worsened if the patients with COPD have symptoms
      overlapped with asthma, however, no sufficient data exist in Japan for estimating the
      prevalence of ACOS in patients with COPD. The primary objective of this NIS is to clarify the
      proportion of ACOS defined by GINA and GOLD in patients with COPD. The main secondary
      objectives are To explore the features of history of COPD exacerbations, symptoms,
      eosinophilic inflammation and patient background in patients with ACOS, to clarify the
      history of COPD exacerbations in patients with COPD, to evaluate the degrees of eosinophilic
      inflammation of the respiratory tract in patients with COPD and to evaluate the symptoms in
      patients with COPD. This is a cross-sectional study targeting COPD patients receiving
      outpatient treatment and follow-up by physicians in Japan. FSI is scheduled as 2Q 2015 and
      DBL would be locked by 3Q 2015.
