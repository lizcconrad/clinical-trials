      This study is being done to evaluate the effect of HIV and TB treatment on a commonly used
      birth control method. This study is being done on women who are infected with HIV and TB and
      are taking efavirenz (EFV; Sustiva®; an anti-HIV medication), rifampicin (RIF; an anti-TB
      medication) and isoniazid (INH; an anti-TB medication). The purpose of this study is to find
      out the best schedule to give depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA; a hormonal birth
      control method that is given as a shot every 3 months) in women with HIV and TB who are also
      taking EFV and RIF. This study will also try to find out if a 150 mg injection of DMPA is
      effective in preventing ovulation, the process by which the ovaries (the ovaries are part of
      the female reproductive system) release an egg for fertilization, for 12 weeks in women who
      are taking EFV and RIF. Another purpose of this study is to find out if it is safe to take
      RIF, EFV and DMPA at the same time.
