    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with lung cancer
      that is stage IV or has come back (recurrent) and has a mutation in the nuclear factor,
      erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) or kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) gene. Damage to
      these genes may cause the cancer to grow. Sapanisertib may stop this from happening by
      blocking enzymes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the overall response rate of the sapanisertib (TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor MLN0128
      [TAK-228]) in NFE2L2 or KEAP1 mutant stage IV squamous cell lung cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the median progression free survival of patients in each cohort. II. To
      explore the feasibility of performing reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA) in paired
      snap-frozen core biopsies from patients in this study prior to MLN0128 (TAK-228) dosing and
      during week 2 of treatment.

      III. To describe the effectiveness of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in suppressing activation of mTOR and
      PI3K signaling through the exploratory RPPA analysis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
