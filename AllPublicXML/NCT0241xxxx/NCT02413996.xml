  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of virtual rehabilitation through the Virtual
      Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS) versus traditional rehabilitation improving the
      functional outcomes after primary Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following ethics approval by the Ospedale San Raffaele, 142 adults aged between 45 and 80
      years old will be recruited for the study, excluding people with unstable serious disease
      (e.g., heart or lung disease), previous orthopedics pathologies on the same side (e.g., hip
      arthroprosthesis), pregnancy and intake of psychotropic drugs.

      Patients who consent to participate in this study will be randomized into two rehabilitation
      groups after TKA: experimental (virtual rehabilitation) and control (traditional
      rehabilitation). In the experimental arm 71 subjects will undergo a virtual rehabilitation
      training during the post-surgical rehabilitation period, in addition to passive knee range of
      motion device (kinetec) and functional activity (stairs). In the control arm: 71 subjects
      with similar demographic characteristics to those of the experimental arm will undergo the
      usual physiotherapy rehabilitation, in addition to passive knee range of motion device
      (kinetec) and functional activity (stairs). Both control and study interventions will be
      provided 60 minute daily session.

      General status of patients will be undertaken for the following outcomes at the baseline and
      10 days after surgery (at discharge).

      The primary outcome will be the visual analogue scale (VAS); the secondary outcomes will be:
      the disability knee assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC), the
      health related quality of life assessed by the EuroQol (EQ-5D), the global perceived effect
      assessed by the GPE score, the functional Independent measure assessed by the FIM
      questionnaire, the drugs assumption, the isometric strength of quadriceps and hamstrings
      assessed by dynamometer, the range of motion (R.O.M.) and proprioception assessed by VRRS.

    <measure>Knee disability: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>0-10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC consists of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing
Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day
Physical Function (17 items): stair use, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy household duties, light household duties</description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life: Euro Quality of Life five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Perceived Effect (GPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>10th day</time_frame>
    <description>GPE was assessed only at post treatment. The GPE scale asks the patient to rate, on a numerical scale, how much their condition has improved or deteriorated since some predefined time point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale</measure>
