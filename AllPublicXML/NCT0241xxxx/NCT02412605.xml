      Records of women who had trophectoderm biopsy for sex selection over the last 3 years will be
      reviewed and its outcome will be compared to other records of women who had IVF/ICSI without
      embryo biopsy.

      Records of women who had trophectoderm biopsy for sex selection over the last 3 years will be
      reviewed. Women will be divided into 3 groups: group 1 will comprise fertile women who had
      embryo biopsy for sex selection/family balancing, group 2 will comprise infertile women who
      had trophectoderm biopsy and group 3 will comprise infertile women who had IVF/ICSI without
      embryo biopsy.

      The pregnancy and miscarriage rates of the groups will be compared. Before starting the
      embryo biopsy process couples were seen by a geneticist to assess the feasibility of the
      procedure for each couple. Couples were then counselled by a gynaecologist specialised in IVF
      to assess their fertility status and explain the whole procedure including the expected
      success rates and risks of IVF.

      Women had standard pituitary down-regulation with GnRHa (Triptorelin 0.1mg, Decapeptyl®
      Ferring, Germany) day 7 after ovulation of previous cycle or on day 21 of the oral
      contraceptive cycles. GnRHa was continued for 2 weeks. Human menopausal gonadotrophin(HMG)
      (Merional ®IBSA) 150-300 IU/day was administered until the day of HCG administration,
      Transvaginal oocyte retrieval will be performed 34-36 h after the administration of HCG.

      Day 5 embryos were incubated in calcium/Magnesium free culture. A laser beam was used to
      produce a hole in the zona pellucida. Trophectoderm cells were collected by gentle suction
      using the biopsy pipette.

      Florescent in situ hybridization of the trophectoderm nuclei with probes specific to the X-
      and Y-chromosomes was performed. the embryos were frozen and the cycles deferred.The embryos
      were thawed in the following cycle and if possible 2 embryos of the desired sex were
      transferred.
