    <textblock>
      Background : Cervical degenerative disc disease is frequent and the consequence of aging.
      Degeneration may lead to disc herniation. Surgery is indicated in the presence of root
      compression with cervicobrachial neuralgia and/or myelopathy.

      Purpose: The main objective of the study is the comparison of efficacy between total disc
      replacement (TDR) and Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion (ACDF) as surgical treatment
      of symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease in term of &quot;Success&quot; rate, defined as
      preservation of adjacent segments, 24 months after surgery.

      In our knowledge, there are no published data about randomized clinical trials comparing
      these radiological parameters (worsening of degeneration signs on static cervical spine
      radiographs and worsening of disc degeneration signs on MRI) at levels adjacent to surgery,
      between these 2 surgical approaches in patients suffering from cervical degenerative disc
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment of cervical degenerative disc disease usually consists in neural
      decompression followed by intervertebral space reconstruction.

      ACDF consists in interbody fusion by replacing disc space with a cage packed with bone
      substitute, and inserted into the anterior portion of the interspace. Fusion is successful in
      approximately 95% of patients with good to excellent clinical results in most of them.
      Unfortunately, up to 25% of these patients will develop degenerative changes at adjacent
      levels after surgery.

      TDR consists in total disc replacement with preserved segmental motion decreasing load on
      adjacent levels.

      Worsening of radiological degeneration signs at adjacent levels seems to be an important long
      term prognostic factor for reoperation.

      In this trial, included patients will be randomly assigned to undergo either TDR or ACDF Six
      visits are planned during the study: pre inclusion visit within 3 months before surgery,
      inclusion/randomisation the day before surgery, 3 follow up visits (45 days, 6, and 12 months
      after surgery) and an end of study visit 24 months after surgery (or at time of withdrawal if
      relevant).
