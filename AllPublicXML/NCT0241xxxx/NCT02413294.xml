    <textblock>
      The investigators are aiming to examine the acceptability and feasibility of a portable
      bright light therapy instrument to improve sleep disturbance in a preventive intervention for
      depression. The investigators will conduct an intervention that trials the use of bright
      light glasses called &quot;re-timers&quot; as a preventive intervention in older adults with sleep
      disturbance and subsyndromal symptoms of depression.

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks after introduction of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a validated scale which measures self-reported sleep quality based on a wide variety of questions (duration, quality, disturbances, medication, etc.) and converts them to a scale which ranges from 0 to 21 where 6 or higher denotes poor sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks after introduction of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 Depression Scale is a validated scale ranging from 0 to 27 with higher numbers representing greater severity of depressive symptoms, based on 9 questions with each question on a scale of 0 - 3.</description>

    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index Sum Scores</measure>

    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index measures insomnia severity on a scale from 0 to 28. A score of 15 or higher is indicative of clinical insomnia.</description>

    <measure>Actigraph: Number of Awakenings</measure>
    <time_frame>daily for 4 weeks- baseline and intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy counts awakenings by using an accelerometer to assess motion during the night. The number of awakenings is the mean nightly number of awakenings during each of the two-week periods: baseline and intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraph: Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>daily for 4 weeks- baseline and intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency is calculated as a percentage reflecting the amount of time in bed spent asleep (time asleep/time in bed x 100). The mean for each of the two-week periods: baseline and intervention, is calculated.</description>

    <measure>Self-Reported Sleep Diary: Time at Which Participants go to Bed</measure>
    <time_frame>daily for 4 weeks- baseline and intervention period to be compared</time_frame>
    <description>Bed time represents the moment in time at which participants went to bed, measured on a revised clock where 6pm = 18, Midnight = 24 and 6am =30. Time between actual hours is calculated on a decimal basis, so an additional 6 minutes = .1. This revised clock is necessary in order to make means work properly in the nighttime hours. Otherwise, averaging between a 10pm bedtime and a 2am bedtime would give the impossible, inaccurate mean of being in the daytime between those two numbers.</description>

    <measure>Self-Reported Sleep Diary: Time at Which Participants Wake up</measure>
    <time_frame>daily for 4 weeks- baseline and intervention period to be compared</time_frame>
    <description>Wake time represents the moment in time at which participants awaken. Time between actual hours is calculated on a decimal basis so an additional 6 minutes = .1. so that 7.5 represents 7:30 a.m. and 7.8 represents 7:48 a.m.</description>

          <description>The Insomnia Severity Index measures insomnia severity on a scale from 0 to 28. A score of 15 or higher is indicative of clinical insomnia.
Data for all 11 participants is provided at two baseline time points:
prior to wearing a monitor at all, and after two weeks of wearing a monitoring device, prior to use of ReTimer glasses</description>

        <description>Bed time represents the moment in time at which participants went to bed, measured on a revised clock where 6pm = 18, Midnight = 24 and 6am =30. Time between actual hours is calculated on a decimal basis, so an additional 6 minutes = .1. This revised clock is necessary in order to make means work properly in the nighttime hours. Otherwise, averaging between a 10pm bedtime and a 2am bedtime would give the impossible, inaccurate mean of being in the daytime between those two numbers.</description>
