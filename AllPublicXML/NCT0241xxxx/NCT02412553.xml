    <textblock>
      The study is proposed as a 2-year single site, open-label clinical trial of enteral nutrition
      or the specific carbohydrate diet in patients with active CD or UC. Patients seeking care in
      the outpatient clinics of the Division of Gastroenterology at Massachusetts General Hospital
      will be approached for participation in the trial during their routine outpatient
      appointments. All patients are required to have a diagnosis of CD or UC confirmed using
      standard clinical, endoscopic, and histologic criteria. Eligible patients will complete an
      office visit to confirm eligibility for the study and informed consent will be obtained. They
      will then be scheduled for a routine colonoscopy as part of their standard clinical care to
      objectively confirm active disease and obtain biopsies for microbiome and gene expression.
      The investigators will obtain prior authorization from the subject's insurance company for
      such colonoscopy, or if it is not covered by the insurance, the investigators will use study
      funds to pay for the procedure. They will then be assigned to one of two dietary intervention
      arms based on their preference and will meet with the study registered dietician at the MGH
      Clinical Research Center (CRC) metabolism and nutrition unit. There, they will receive
      instruction on the components of the assigned dietary therapy arm - partial elemental diet
      (enteral nutrition) or specific carbohydrate diet, and will complete a baseline food record
      (FR). They will adhere to the dietary therapy for 6 weeks after which they can resume normal
      diet. Clinical, biochemical, nutritional, and microbiological parameters will be measured
      during and for 6 weeks following the study. They will have 5 study visits during this time.
