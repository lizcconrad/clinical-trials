      Safety and effect of SANGUINATE on Sickle Cell Disease patients experiencing a vaso-occlusive
      crisis

    <textblock>
      Patients who are experiencing a vaso-occlusive crisis will report to the clinic for treatment
      and screening into the SGSC-005 study. Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be randomized to receive either SANGUINATE 320 mg/kg or placebo (saline) over a 2 hour
      infusion period. Assessments of vital signs, ECGs, safety labs, adverse events as well as
      patient and physician questionnaires will be completed up to 6 hours after the start of the
      infusion. Patients will then be assessed for discharge either to home or admitted to the
      hospital for further treatment depending on their disease severity. Follow-up phone calls
      will be completed 24 hours and 7 days after initiation of treatment . A follow-up visit will
      be completed in the clinic at 72 hours after initiation of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years,

          2. Sickle Cell Disease (all genotypes),

          3. Diagnosis of a severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), based on the clinical judgement of
             the Investigator,

          4. Participant needs to be admitted to the ambulatory site for treatment of VOC requiring
             IV pain medication,

          5. Able to provide written consent,

          6. Able to receive IV infusion of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. In the judgment of the Investigator, the participant is not a good candidate for the
             study,

          2. An acute severe complication of SCD beyond VOC,

          3. Pregnant or actively trying to become pregnant, or breastfeeding,

          4. Participant had &gt; 6 urgent visits for SCD complications in the prior 3 months,

          5. Fewer than 30 days since any prior treatment with IV pain medication for VOC,

          6. Onset of current acute painful crisis &gt; 3 days prior to dosing,

          7. Evidence of moderate to severe renal insufficiency (CrCl &lt; 50 mL/min) or chronic
             kidney disease, or of moderate to severe hepatic disease (LFTs &gt; 2 x ULN) based on
             past medical history,

          8. Concurrent or prior treatment within 90 days with an investigational medication,

          9. Abnormal ECG due to cardiac ischemia and/or atrial fibrillation of acute onset, in the
             opinion of the Investigator.
