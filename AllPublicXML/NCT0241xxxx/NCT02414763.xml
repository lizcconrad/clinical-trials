  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study proposes to study the feasibility and acceptability of a brief psychosocial
      intervention delivered to suicide attempt survivors hospitalized on a medical/surgical floor
      or inpatient psychiatry unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The proposed study will
      involve training of care providers affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to
      deliver the brief intervention. Additionally, the participants will complete baseline, 1, 3,
      and 12-month assessments on outcomes of interest, including readiness to change problematic
      behaviors, engagement in outpatient mental health services, suicidal ideation, self-harming
      behavior, and reasons for living.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-hundred participants will be recruited from a medical/surgical floor or inpatient
      psychiatry unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The PI, other Attending
      Psychiatrists, Psychiatry Resident Physicians, Clinical Psychology Trainees, Psychiatric
      Nurse Practitioners, Psychiatric Social Workers, and Psychiatric Nurse Case Managers will
      serve as study therapists. A member from the Vanderbilt University research team will obtain
      informed consent for the participants and then administer the baseline assessment battery.
      Patients will then be randomized to either (1) a group receiving care as usual plus an
      experimental intervention targeting suicidal thoughts and behaviors or to (2) a group
      receiving care as usual. Patients randomized to the experimental group will receive the
      intervention prior to discharge from the medical center, most likely on the same day as the
      baseline assessment battery. Patients receiving the experimental intervention will then be
      asked to complete a brief post-intervention client satisfaction survey. All study
      participants will then complete telephone follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 12 months. The
      intervention will consist of no more than 90 minutes of 1:1 interaction with a study
      clinician. The baseline assessment battery will take approximately 30 minutes, the
      post-intervention measures will take approximately 10 minutes, and the 1-, 3-, and 12-month
      assessment batteries will take approximately 30 minutes. Maximum length of time in the study
      is approximately 3.75 hours.

    <measure>Change in Stages of Change Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-, 3-, and 12-months interviews</time_frame>
    <description>The Stages of Change Questionnaire is an 18-item measure based on the original, 32- item scale created by McConnaughy, Prochaska, and Verlicer. The measure has shown acceptable levels of internal consistency in an adult sample (Î± = .75 to .87) and predictive validity of response to treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Scale for Suicide Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-, 3-, and 12-months interviews</time_frame>
    <description>The Scale for Suicide Ideation is a 19-item assessment used to evaluate the current intensity of the patient's specific attitudes toward, behavior, and plans to commit suicide. The measure has been the primary outcome measure in several trials targeting suicidal patients and has evidence of strong psychometrics</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-, 3-, and 12-months interviews</time_frame>
    <description>The Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count is a brief two-page instrument determining for the first, most recent, and most severe suicide attempt or non-suicidal self-injury (SASI) the date, method of SASI attempt used in index and previous attempts according to the definitions of Linehan et al. (e.g., using definitions of self-inflicted injuries which include situations of actual tissue damage and situations where tissue damage would have occurred except for outside intervention or sheer luck [e.g., firearm jammed]), intent to die (i.e., intent to die, ambivalent, no intent to die), highest level of medical treatment received, and lethality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-, 3-, and 12-months interviews</time_frame>
    <description>The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire is a 25-item measure that inquires about the extent to which individuals feel connected to others (i.e., belongingness) and the extent to which they feel like a burden on the people in their lives (i.e., perceived burdensomeness). The measure has been used in previous research examining mechanisms underlying suicide attempt survivors and has demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Reasons for Living Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-, 3-, and 12-months interviews</time_frame>
    <description>The Reasons for Living Inventory is a 48-item measure that rates the importance of different reasons why people choose not to kill themselves. It has shown strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Services and Medication Use</measure>
    <time_frame>1-, 3-, and 12-months interviews</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Services and Medication Use measure will be utilized to examine history of mental health services and medication use in lifetime, previous year, and previous month time periods. The measure was developed and utilized in the National Study of Costs and Outcomes for Trauma.</description>
