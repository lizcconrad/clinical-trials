    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies patient derived cancer cell lines in identifying molecular
      changes in patients with previously untreated pancreatic cancer and are receiving gemcitabine
      hydrochloride-based chemotherapy. Cell lines refer to samples taken from the patient's tumor
      to grow for many months or years in a laboratory, and can therefore be studied
      scientifically. Studying cell lines in the laboratory may help doctors understand the genetic
      changes that occur to the tumor during chemotherapy that allows the tumor to resist or grow
      despite treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the genetic profile of the tumor after progression has occurred, to the tumor
      prior to treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Additional molecular patterns, beyond genetics, will be analyzed, including ribonucleic
      acid (RNA) and protein expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue and blood samples are collected for genetic analysis via sequencing from patients
      receiving gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously or gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation. Chemotherapy is not part of the protocol. Per
      standard of care, patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride (IV) the first 3 of 4 weeks (qw
      3/4 wk) or gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation IV qw 3/4 wk in the absence of disease progression or recurrence.

    <description>This method includes a preprocessing step to filter out unreliable reads, a statistical classification step to identify point mutations that differ from both the reference genome hg19 and the control sample at controlled false-positive rate, and a post-processing step to eliminate platform-specific artifacts inherent in next generation sequencing. ANNOVAR software will then be used to analyze candidate point mutations for their predicted impact on protein function, which will be used to select and prioritize specific mutations for validation and/or further study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of germline mutations in known cancer genes from whole blood genomic deoxyribonucleic acid, and somatic mutations in conditionally reprogrammed cells derived from pre-treatment and post-treatment (e.g., resistant) tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be considered a positive study if in any of the patients' samples, unique mutations are identified in the post-treatment derived cell lines that are not present in the pre-treatment derived cell lines from the same patient.</description>
