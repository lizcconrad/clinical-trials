  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 clinical study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of AB-16B5 in patients with an advanced solid malignancy. AB-16B5 is a
      humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of the secreted form of clusterin
      (sCLU), a potent inducer of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Eligible subjects
      will have a disease that has been refractory to prior therapy and is unlikely to benefit from
      known therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid malignancy
             that has been refractory to prior therapy and is unlikely to benefit from known
             therapies.

          -  Subjects may have measurable or non-measurable but evaluable disease.

          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             ≤ 2 and an estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Subjects must be ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Male, or female subjects who are post-menopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 months),
             or surgically or biologically sterile. Females of childbearing potential with a
             negative serum pregnancy test prior to entering the study and using adequate forms of
             contraception for the duration of the study, including 30 days after the last
             treatment. Males should avoid fathering children during the course of the study, and
             adequate methods of contraception should be used by both male and female subjects.
             Subjects and their partners with reproductive potential must use an effective
             contraceptive method while the subject is on the study treatment and for 30 days after
             the last treatment.

          -  Subjects must have adequate organ and immune function as indicated by the following
             laboratory values:

               -  ANC ≥ 1.5 X 109/L

               -  Platelets &gt; 100 X 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 132 µmol/L

               -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 X ULN* or;

                    -  5 X ULN* (if hepatic metastases present)

                         -  ULN: Institution's upper limit of normal

          -  Subjects enrolled in the standard dose escalation portion of the study must have a
             tumor lesion amenable for biopsy with no contraindications for biopsy.

          -  Subjects must understand and be able and willing and likely to fully comply with the
             study procedures, including scheduled follow-up, and restrictions.

          -  Subjects must have given written personally signed and dated informed consent to
             participate in the study, in accordance with the International Conference on
             Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, before completing any
             study related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with medical, social, or psychosocial factors that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could impact safety or compliance with study procedures.

             biological therapies within 3 weeks prior to study treatment.

          -  Uncontrolled brain metastases.

          -  Uncontrolled infection.

          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormalities.

          -  Known hypersensitivity of Grade &gt; 2 to previous monoclonal antibody therapy.

          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year.

          -  Use of another investigational agent in a clinical trial within the last 4 weeks prior
             to study treatment.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, including females with a positive
             pregnancy test at screening must be excluded.
