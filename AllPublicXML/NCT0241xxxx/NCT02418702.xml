  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression treatment typically is slow acting. Patients presenting with acute suicidality
      have few immediate treatment options. However, sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine have been now
      widely tested as a rapid-acting treatment for depression. Gregory Larkin et al at Yale showed
      this could be applied to suicidal patients, with 14 of 15 participants showing remission of
      suicidal thinking within 40 min of the administration of ketamine, with 13 showing lasting
      remission out to 10 days. No serious side effects were reported. This project proposes to
      conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of this, same intervention in military
      patients recently hospitalized for suicidal thinking. After being assessed, and giving
      informed consent, participants would receive 0.2mg/kg ketamine or placebo. Their suicidal
      thinking, depression, and other symptoms would be monitored acutely for 240 min after drug
      infusion, and the for lasting changes the next day, at hospital discharge, 2 weeks, and 10
      weeks. Potential adverse events will be monitored via the electronic medical record for up to
      a year.

    <textblock>
      Patients presenting for acute suicidality have few immediate treatment options to alleviate
      their suffering aside from psychiatric hospitalization for safety assurance. Therapy and
      psychiatry medication may decrease depression over time, but this does little to improve
      depression and suicidal thinking in the short term. Preliminary data from a recent study by
      Larkin et al at Yale University showed evidence to support a promising novel treatment
      modality with rapid effects on suicidal ideation for up to 10 days post infusion through the
      use of a single sub-anesthetic rapid intravenous bolus dose of ketamine (0.2-mg/kg)
      administered in the acute Emergency Department setting. This study showed favorable evidence
      to support further investigation into the use of a single sub-anesthetic bolus dose of
      ketamine in acutely depressed and/or suicidal patients in the emergency room setting. Based
      on the success of this study, Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) started the previously
      mentioned, small, unfunded randomized, placebo-controlled trial of this ketamine protocol for
      patients who were pending psychiatric hospitalization because of suicidal thinking. Data
      collection was highly flawed, but unpublished, preliminary results show that the ketamine
      treatment resulted in significant decreased in suicidal thinking.

      Of note, there were no adverse events associated with the ketamine administration. Although
      the infusion was done in an Emergency Department (ED) setting, the patients were seated in
      clinic chairs, and required no additional monitoring or intervention beyond what could be
      provided in any clinic our psychiatric hospital setting. It is the intent of the project to
      expand on our unfunded trial, allowing us to treat a wider range of participants who come in
      to the psychiatric ward because of suicidal thinking. This study is being pursued in the
      context that existing therapies for major depression have a lag of onset of action of several
      weeks, resulting in an increased risk of possible and considerable morbidity and possibly
      mortality through suicide. This study would explore the efficacy of Ketamine's (a
      N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist) rapid and potentially long-lasting
      antidepressant effects in a suicidal population. The Investigators hope to gather data that
      could potentially impact treatment practices in the military setting for acutely depressed
      patients. This may potentially shorten, delay, or even forgo admissions to the psychiatric
      ward in the future, as well as potentially reducing the long term suicidality.
