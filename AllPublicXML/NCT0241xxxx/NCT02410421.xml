  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective therapy for
      resistant depression, it still fail to remit up to 70% of these patients. We hypothesize that
      personalizing the procedure using functional MRI to better select dysfunctional regions and
      robotic coil placement to stimulate these regions homogeneously, will increase its efficacy.
      Individualized rTMS will be compared to traditional rTMS procedure and to trans-cranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS).

      In this small proof of principle study our primary outcome measure will be the correction of
      the MRI anomalies. Symptoms reduction and the proportion of remitters will be secondary
      outcome measurements.

    <description>Functional connectivity map of the target region will be performed by extracting its average temporal course and looking at the region(s) which activity is correlated (smoothed by a 8 mm Gaussian kernel). The contrast map of each patient will be compared to the one of a control population submitted to the same analysis. We will compare the number of above threshold voxels (F-test, p &lt; 0.05 uncorrected, extension &gt; 1 cm3) before and after the therapeutic procedure (ANOVA).

    <description>The target region will be defined by comparing the rCBF scan of the patient to a control population (n = 80). rCBF will be measured using the QUIPS2 arterial spin labeling sequence on a Siemens 3T Verio.
The therapeutic protocol will be design to correct the rCBF anomaly first by defining each point where to deliver the stimulation than the stimulation protocol for each point (180% of active motor threshold, 4-second 10 Hz train duration, with 26-second intertrain interval for a total of 3000 pulses). The whole target will be homogeneously stimulated.
The active motor threshold will be assessed. The programmed protocol will be delivered while a figure of eight coil will be positioned by a robotic device (Axilum Robotics).
The procedure will be repeated twice a day for 10 days over 2 weeks.</description>
