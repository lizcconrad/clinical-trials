    <textblock>
      Simulation training in surgical education in Urology specialist training in flexible
      cystoscopy has been demonstrated a valid and efficient learning instrument. The classical
      setup with a medical expert introducing the novices to the theoretical background and
      technics of the procedure is time-consuming and expensive. Directed self-regulated simulation
      training (DSR) is a validated method in simulation training. The power of testing in DSR and
      flexible cystoscopy is to our knowledge not known. We introduced a setup in which the novices
      started by training in a directed self-regulated simulation training environment and informed
      them that they would be tested by a medical expert afterwards. The intervention group novices
      were given only written theoretical information and anatomical pictures. The control group
      were first given a classical oral theoretical introduction by a medical expert and secondly
      did DSR training. We tested the outcome of the intervention by a validated rating scale for
      flexible cystoscopy. The novices in both the control and intervention group were tested on
      patients prescribed a flexible cystoscopy and evaluated by a specialist in Urology.

      The main hypothesis was that testing in relation to DSR would result in higher scores on a
      validated scale when performing a flexible cystoscopy on a patient evaluated by a specialist
      in Urology compared to a group having a oral lecture before DSR.

    <description>The subjects perform a flexible cystoscopy on two different patients and each cystoscopy are being scored by a specialist in Urology (the same in the entire study) using a validated scoring system for flexible cystoscopy, the Global Rating Scale. A previously validated assessment tool, Global Rating Scale (GRS) was used to assess the cystoscopy procedures. GRS is composed of five different parameters: respect for tissue, time and motion, handling of endoscope, flow of procedure, forward planning, and knowledge of procedure. Each parameter is assessed on a five point Likert scale with a minimum of one to maximum of five, giving the total GRS score a range of five to 25. At our institution we have defined a GRS score of three in each parameter (minimum total GRS of 15) as a minimum passing standard.</description>

        <title>Global Rating Scale</title>
        <description>The subjects perform a flexible cystoscopy on two different patients and each cystoscopy are being scored by a specialist in Urology (the same in the entire study) using a validated scoring system for flexible cystoscopy, the Global Rating Scale. A previously validated assessment tool, Global Rating Scale (GRS) was used to assess the cystoscopy procedures. GRS is composed of five different parameters: respect for tissue, time and motion, handling of endoscope, flow of procedure, forward planning, and knowledge of procedure. Each parameter is assessed on a five point Likert scale with a minimum of one to maximum of five, giving the total GRS score a range of five to 25. At our institution we have defined a GRS score of three in each parameter (minimum total GRS of 15) as a minimum passing standard.</description>
