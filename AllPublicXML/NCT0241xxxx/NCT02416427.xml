  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pre-surgical, window-of-opportunity study is designed to investigate whether
      atorvastatin reduces the proliferation marker Ki-67 via modulation of the Hippo transducer
      TAZ.

    <measure>• Decreased TAZ expression</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reduced TAZ expression evaluated by IHC when comparing pre- and post-treatment samples. Staining intensity will be graded on a four-grade scale (0: negative, 1: weak, 2: moderate, 3: strong). The final score will be obtained by considering staining intensity, percentage of expressing cells, and localization (nuclear versus cytoplasmic)</description>

    <description>Decreased expression of TAZ targets (AXL and CTGF) and Atorvastatin target (HMGCoAR) evaluated by IHC when comparing pre- and post-treatment samples. Staining intensity for all the molecular endpoints analyzed will be graded on a four-grade scale (0: negative, 1: weak, 2: moderate, 3: strong).</description>
