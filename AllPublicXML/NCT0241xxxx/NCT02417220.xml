    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the weight
      losses produced by the Weight Watchers Online program revised for 2015 (WWO2015) and WWO2015
      plus the provision of an electronic scale and weekly email feedback on weight loss (WWO2015
      Enhanced), over a 6-month period.
