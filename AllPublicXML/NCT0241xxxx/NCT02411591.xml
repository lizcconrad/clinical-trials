        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC Stage IV:

               -  Part A: NSCLC Stage IV (any type).

               -  Part B: NSCLC Stage IV (squamous and nonsquamous).

          -  Measurable disease at the time of study entry as defined by Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

          -  The participant must have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy AND have
             received a maximum of 1 other prior chemotherapy for advanced and/or metastatic
             disease OR must be judged by the physician as ineligible for further standard
             second-line chemotherapy. Prior treatment with epidermal growth factor
             receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
             inhibitors is mandatory in participants whose tumor has EGFR-activating mutations or
             ALK translocations. Prior targeting agents and neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies are
             permitted with the exception of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6-targeting agents or
             necitumumab.

          -  The participant has tumor tissue available for biomarker analyses.

          -  The participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of
             0-1.

          -  Have adequate organ functions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant is currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an investigational
             product or non-approved use of a drug or device. Prior treatment with CDK4/6-targeting
             agents or necitumumab is not permitted.

          -  Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder or significant cardiac disease.

          -  The participant has undergone major surgery or received any investigational therapy in
             the 30-days prior to study enrollment.

          -  The participant has undergone chest irradiation within 4 weeks prior to receiving
             study treatment.

          -  The participant has brain metastases that are symptomatic.

          -  History of arterial or venous thromboembolism within 3 months prior to study
             enrollment. Participants with a history of venous thromboembolism beyond 3 months
             prior to study enrollment can be enrolled if they are appropriately treated with low
             molecular weight heparin.

          -  The participant has active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  The participant has a known allergy / history of hypersensitivity reaction to any of
             the treatment components, including any ingredient used in the formulation of
             necitumumab or abemaciclib, or any other contraindication to one of the administered
             treatments.

          -  The participant is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  The participant has a concurrent active malignancy. Previous history of malignancy is
             permitted, provided that the participant has been free of disease for â‰¥3 years, with
             the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
             preinvasive carcinoma of the cervix, or any cancers that in the judgment of the
             investigator and sponsor may not affect the interpretation of results (for example,
             prostate, bladder).

          -  History of interstitial lung disease or an active non-infectious pneumonitis.
