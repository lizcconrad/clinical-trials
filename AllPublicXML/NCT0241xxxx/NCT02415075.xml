  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      level will help rehabilitation patients on returning to or continuing to work as well as to
      stay employable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For most people work is an integral part of their life which not only secures their life
      standards, but also forms the basis for social participation and personal growth. If
      someone's workability is limited as a result of health problems, medical rehabilitation can
      often help to regain strength and capabilities, and to continue to work in a productive way
      and remain healthy. In cooperation with the Deutsche Rentenversicherung Oldenburg-Bremen
      health psychologists at Jacobs University Bremen are investigating what contributes to the
      success of such medical rehabilitation treatments.

      The focus is to understand which measures are helping people during and subsequently to their
      treatment in the clinic.Therefore voluntary participants will be asked to fill out a
      questionnaire when arriving at the rehabilitation facility and will subsequently invited to
      participate in two motivational telephone interviews after six and 12 months. Personal,
      social and contextual factors, measures and offers, as well as goals, plans and behaviors,
      will be taken into consideration to evaluate the effectiveness of medical rehabilitation on
      returning to or continuing to work.
