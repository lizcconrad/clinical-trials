      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide in treating younger
      patients with tumors of the brain or spine (central nervous system) that have come back or
      are continuing to grow. Pomalidomide may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread and may also stimulate the immune system to kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      pomalidomide, in children from &gt;= 3 years to &lt; 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or
      refractory central nervous system (CNS) tumors when given once daily for 21 consecutive days
      of a 28-day course.

      II. To describe the toxicity profile and dose-limiting toxicities of pomalidomide in children
      from &gt;= 3 years to &lt; 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or refractory CNS tumors.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide when administered orally in
      children from &gt;= 3 years old to &lt; 21 years of age with recurrent, progressive or refractory
      CNS tumors and study the association of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters with age and steroid
      use.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the preliminary efficacy of pomalidomide in this patient population as defined
      by radiographic response rate, duration of response, and event-free survival (EFS) within the
      confines of a Phase 1 study. *For the purposes of this study, long-term stable disease will
      be considered a response (defined as stable disease for &gt;= 6 courses).

      II. To investigate a relationship between pomalidomide dose and exposure with radiographic
      response and changes in immune function (for example, T-cell subsets, natural killer [NK]
      cell activity, granzyme B and circulating levels of IL-12, IL-2, IL-15, GM-CSF).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.

             form(s) of birth control as stated within the pomalidomide Pregnancy Risk Minimization
             Plan, which includes abstinence, while being treated on this study; true abstinence is
             acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient;
             periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods)
             and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential agree to and will have had effective
             contraception without interruption for 28 days before starting pomalidomide

          -  The patient or parent/guardian is able to understand the consent and is willing to
             sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines

             infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction),
             that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to
             tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere
             with the study procedures or results

          -  Patients with a history of any other malignancy will not be eligible

          -  Patients with radiation-associated gliomas will not be eligible

          -  Patients with a history of non-central line related thrombosis, more than one prior
             central-line related thrombosis, or known coagulopathy will not be eligible; patients
             with a first degree family member with a known coagulopathy will be excluded, and
             therefore, obtaining a family history is essential when possible; patients actively on
             anticoagulation therapy are not eligible

             thalidomide or lenalidomide

             excluded

          -  Patients taking a known moderate to potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 are excluded;
             pomalidomide is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A; pomalidomide is also a
             substrate for permeability (P)-glycoprotein (P-gp)

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for
             required follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to
             therapy or to adhere to drug administration plan, other study procedures, and study
             restrictions

          -  Patients who have received pomalidomide in the past are not eligible; patients who
             have prior treatment with other immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) (thalidomide,
             lenalidomide) ARE eligible if they meet all other eligibility criteria and did not
             have &quot;significant toxicity&quot; associated with lenalidomide or thalidomide use; a
             &quot;significant&quot; toxicity will be defined as one that required a dose reduction or
             discontinuation due to toxicity; please discuss any questions with the PI
