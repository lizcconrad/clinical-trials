    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of a single oral
      dose of eleclazine in participants with normal and impaired hepatic function. Participants in
      the healthy control group will be matched to participants with impaired hepatic function by
      age (± 5 years), gender, and body mass index (± 10%).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants:

          -  Be a nonsmoker or consume &lt; 20 cigarettes per day

          -  Have a calculated body mass index (BMI) from 18 to 36 kg/m^2, inclusive, at study
             screening

          -  Have a creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault method)
             based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at screening

          -  Have either a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or one with abnormalities that
             are considered clinically insignificant by the investigator

          -  Screening labs within defined thresholds

        Participants with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment must also meet the following
        additional inclusion criteria:

          -  Must have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), stable hepatic impairment with no
             clinically significant changes within 3 months (90 days) prior to study drug
             administration (Day 1)

          -  Individuals with severe hepatic impairment must have a score on the
             Child-Pugh-Turcotte scale of 10-15 at screening. If an individual's score changes
             during the course of the study, the score at screening will be used for
             classification.

          -  Individuals with moderate hepatic impairment must have a score on the
             Child-Pugh-Turcotte scale of 7-9 at screening. If an individual's score changes during
             the course of the study, the score at Screening will be used for classification.

          -  Individuals with mild hepatic impairment must have a score on the Child-Pugh-Turcotte
             scale of 5-6 at screening. If an individual's score changes during the course of the
             study, the score at screening will be used for classification.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  History of meningitis or encephalitis, epilepsy, seizures, migraines, tremors,
             myoclonic jerks, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, syncope, head injuries
             or a family history of seizures

          -  Presence or history of cardiovascular disease (including history of myocardial
             infarction based on ECG and/or clinical history, any history of ventricular
             tachycardia, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt; 40%), cardiac conduction abnormalities, a family history of Long QT
             Syndrome, or unexplained death in an otherwise healthy individual between the ages of
             1 and 30 years

          -  Syncope, palpitations, or unexplained dizziness

          -  Implanted defibrillator or pacemaker

          -  Are unable to comply with study requirements or are otherwise believed, by the study
             investigator, to be inappropriate for study participation for any reason

          -  Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Individuals who have HBsAg are ineligible

          -  Requires paracentesis &gt; 1 time per month

          -  Severe (grade 3 or 4) encephalopathy as judged by the investigator

          -  History of gastric or esophageal variceal bleeding within the past 6 months and for
             which varices have not been adequately treated with medication and/or surgical
             procedures
