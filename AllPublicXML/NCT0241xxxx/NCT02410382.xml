  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how dexamethasone and placebo influence radiation fatigue, quality of
      life and number of treatment days missed during radiation therapy or radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy for cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will randomly receive either dexamethasone or placebo and begin the study medication
      during the midpoint of their radiation treatment. Study medication will be taken for 14
      straight days then stopped. Fatigue and quality of life will be measured weekly with short
      patient completed surveys. The number of breaks taken during radiation treatment will also be
      tracked. For safety, blood sugar levels will be checked with finger stick blood draws because
      dexamethasone is known to cause these levels to increase. Study participation will be
      approximately 3 months.
