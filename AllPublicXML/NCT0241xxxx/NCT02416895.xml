      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between Vitamin D status and
      immunity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is mainly obtained from the sun and follows a seasonal pattern, with Vitamin D
      levels peaking in summer and reaching a trough during winter. Vitamin D deficiency is
      associated with impaired immunity. However, knowledge of Vitamin D deficiency with in vivo
      immunity is limited. This observational study aims to investigate the relationship between
      Vitamin D status and the in vivo immunity.
