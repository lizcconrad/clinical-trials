  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the common end-stage of different medical conditions. It is the only
      growing cardiovascular disease and its prognosis remains worse than that of many
      malignancies. The lack of evidence-based treatment for patients with diastolic HF (HFpEF)
      exemplifies that the current &quot;one for all&quot; therapy has to be advanced by an individualized
      approach. Inherited cardiomyopathies can serve as paradigmatic examples of different HF
      pathogenesis. Both gain- and loss-of-function mutations of the same gene cause disease,
      calling for disease-specific agonism or antagonism of this gene´s function. However,
      mutations alone do not predict the severity of cardiomyopathies nor therapy, because their
      impact on cardiac myocyte function is modified by numerous factors, including the genetic
      context. Today, patient-specific cardiac myocytes can be evaluated by the induced pluripotent
      stem cell (hiPSC) technology. Yet, unfolding the true potential of this technology requires
      robust, quantitative, high content assays. The researchers' recently developed method to
      generate 3D-engineered heart tissue (EHT) from hiPSC provides an automated, high content
      analysis of heart muscle function and the response to stressors in the dish. The aim of this
      project is to make the technology a clinically applicable test. Major steps are (i) in depths
      clinical phenotyping and genotyping of patients with cardiomyopathies or HFpEF, (ii)
      follow-up of the clinical course, (iii) generation of hiPSC lines (40 patients, 40 healthy
      controls), and (iv) quantitative assessment of hiPSC-EHT function under basal conditions and
      in response to pro-arrhythmic or cardio-active drugs and chronic afterload enhancement. The
      product of this study is an SOP-based assay with standard values for hiPSC-EHT
      function/stress responses from healthy volunteers and patients with different heart diseases.
      The project could change clinical practice and be a step towards individualized risk
      prediction and therapy of HF.

      At present, heart function in patients can only be analysed by imaging methods or hemodynamic
      measurements. This has dramatically changed by the discovery that hiPSC can be generated from
      somatic cells (e.g. fibroblasts) by transduction of pluripotency genes. The investigators and
      others have shown that pluripotent stem cells can be efficiently differentiated into beating
      cardiac myocytes. This allows for the first time to study the function of cardiac myocytes
      from an individual patient. However, at present, only alterations were reproduced in hiPSC
      cells that were known previously and important limitations have to be resolved:

        -  Immaturity of hiPSC-derived cardiac myocytes

        -  Variability of hiPSC-generation, cardiac myocyte differentiation and experimental
           analyses

        -  No readout of contractile force, the parameter mostly affected in heart failure

        -  No modeling of hemodynamic stress in vitro

        -  No statistically valid correlation of hiPSC-cardiac myocyte function with
           clinical/genetic data

        -  Uncertainty as to standard values and adequate controls

        -  Unclear predictive value

      The research challenge for the coming years is to resolve these shortcomings. IndivuHeart
      formulates a number of hypotheses and goals that are based on the researchers' longstanding
      expertise in tissue engineering and recent, still unpublished data on the pathophysiology of
      HCM and its modeling in EHT. The study will

        -  reveal standard values for hiPSC-EHT function in a statistically valid manner, both
           under basal and stress conditions,

        -  define a &quot;cardiomyopathy phenotype&quot; in vitro,

        -  allow new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of human HCM and DCM,

        -  uncover HCM-like abnormalities in HFpEF,

        -  allow individualized drug testing (acute and chronic).

    <description>All 40 patients will be subjected to (i) high-end echocardiography including tissue Doppler and speckle tracking technology, (ii) MRI, (iii) spiroergometry and (iv) 24 h-holter ECG monitoring. Key parameters are guideline-recommended indices of systolic (e.g. fractional shortening, ejection fraction) and diastolic heart function (e.g. left atrial size, E/A, E'/A' and E/E´ratios), outflow tract gradient and cardiac remodeling (gadolinium late enhancement). The latter will be only done in HCM/DCM for ethical reasons. Technical analyses will be made at study entry and after 4 years, clinical examinations once a year (Cardiomyopathy Outpatient Clinic). Patients and their treating physicians will be prompted to report any clinical event during the course of the study.</description>

    <description>The genetic part of this project does not focus on the detection of new HCM/DCM disease genes, but on comprehensively determining the molecular basis of cardiomyopathy in the included patients. DNA samples will first be subjected to sequencing of a panel of about 120 cardiomyopathy-related candidate genes, which detects approximately 75% of all disease-causing mutations. The rest will be analysed by whole genome sequencing.
The resulting sequence data will be processed using CASAVA, followed by subsequent analyses using the GATK software package provided through the Broad Institute (Boston, USA) and the commercial software CLC-BIO.</description>
