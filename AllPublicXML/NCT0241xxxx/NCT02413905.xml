  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators performed two case-control studies in Niger and Senegal analysing fecal
      microbiota to characterize the specificity of the gut microbiota alteration associated with
      severe acute malnutrition (SAM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal samples of cases (severe acute malnutrition (SAM) ascertained according to the WHO
      definition) and controls (asymptomatic healthy children ascertained by clinical and
      anthropometric criteria) were analysed by v3v4 16S rRNA sequencing, redox and pH measurement
      and using specific polymerase chain reaction targeting Methanobrevibacter smithii and
      Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Based on the literature and oxydative stress reported in SAM,
      the investigators tested if the proportion of aerotolerant prokaryotes is increased among gut
      prokaryotes enriched in SAM in comparison to prokaryotes enriched in controls. The
      investigators further linked this to fecal redox potential and assessed the total number of
      bacteria in feces by flux cytometry.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Children aged 0-59 months of varying nutritional status from Niamey (Niger) and Dakar
             (Senegal).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absence of parent or patient consent, antibiotic administration &lt;2 months before stool
             collection and insufficient fecal amount. Exclusion criteria for controls included any
             form of malnutrition, presence of fever, acute respiratory infection (cough), acute or
             chronic diarrhea in the previous 4 weeks. Symptoms and complications of malnutrition
             (cough, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting) nor other form of malnutrition (moderate to severe
             stunting and underweight) were not a reason of exclusion for cases since they are
             considered as direct consequence and part of severe acute malnutrition.
