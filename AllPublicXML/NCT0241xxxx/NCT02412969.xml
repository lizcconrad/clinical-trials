  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to examine the onset of pain relief with two different methods of labor
      epidural. The traditional labor epidural involves the placement of numbing and anti-pain
      medicine in the epidural space which surrounds the spinal cord. In order to take effect, the
      medication has to cross a layer of tissue called the dura. In the current study, the same
      medications are placed in the epidural space after the dura is punctured with a fine needle.
      This research, will help evaluate whether this technique will result in earlier onset of pain
      relief.
