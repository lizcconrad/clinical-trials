  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study examines the impact of an enhanced care transition process vs. usual care
      for persons with dementia admitted to a transitional unit (hospital or LTC) for management of
      behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) with a planned discharge to long
      term care (LTC) facilities or other hospital units. Deficiencies in discharge processes can
      contribute to poor outcomes (e.g., readmissions), and there is a dearth of research on how to
      improve care transitions for persons with BPSD. The investigators aim to improve the care
      transition process for persons with dementia and BPSD utilizing an enhanced care transition
      process that will contain up to 6 elements: integrated behavioural care plans, videos,
      patient specific briefcase containing activities to reduce BPSD, in-person care transition
      meeting, in-person care demonstration (when possible), and follow up visits with a transition
      team. The ability to determine the effect of enhanced care transitions on the clinical course
      of patients with planned discharge to LTC or hospital may allow for improved outcomes and an
      overall increased efficiency of post discharge care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have formulated an enhanced care transition process based on factors that
      have been documented to support care transitions in other clinical populations (e.g.,
      Coleman, 2003 on persons with continuous complex needs; Viggiano, et al., 2012 on persons
      with mental health issues), along with novel package elements based on the investigators'
      experience working with persons with dementia and BPSD. The investigators propose to conduct
      a preliminary analysis of patient and staff outcomes comparing an enhanced care transition
      process with a control group receiving usual care. The investigators' proposed enhanced care
      transition process will contain 5 elements: 1. Unified transfer care document adapted to the
      post-care transition location 2. Videos of BPSD management to better communicate care
      provision, 3. Provision to -the post-care transition location a patient specific briefcase
      containing activities that help to reduce BPSD, 4. In-person care transition meeting between
      sites, including the family, to transfer knowledge, 5. In person care demonstration (when
      possible), and 6. Follow-up visits post transition with a transition team (a service already
      in existence but not consistently used). The investigators hope that with improved
      communication, discharge locations will be better equipped to manage BPSD, and reduce the
      likelihood of adverse events for both patients and staff.
