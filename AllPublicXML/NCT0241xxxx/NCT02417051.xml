      The goal of this project is to adapt and test the efficacy of the National Institute of
      Environmental Health and Safety (NIEHS) Disaster Worker Resilience Training (DWRT) Program
      for Superstorm Sandy responders. The DWRT is a brief, 4-5 hour training program designed to
      improve resilience for stress reactions in active emergency responders. A total of 120
      participants will be recruited. 60 will receive the DWRT, and 60 will be assigned to a
      waitlist control condition. A three-month assessment period will be utilized to enable us to
      evaluate the effects of the intervention. Participants assigned to the waitlist condition
      will be offered the option to participant in the course following completion of the 3 month
      wait period. It is hypothesized that, participants attending the DWRT program, as compared to
      those in the waitlist condition, will show increased resilience at three months
      post-intervention as indicated by lower perceived stress, greater posttraumatic growth, more
      positive health behaviors (e.g., sleep, nutrition, exercise), and fewer new PTSD and
      depression symptoms. It is predicted that participants attending the DWRT program, as
      compared to those in the waitlist condition, will demonstrate greater awareness of the mental
      health effects of disasters, including the symptoms of PTSD and depression. It is predicted
      that, participants attending the DWRT program, as compared to those in the waitlist
      condition, will endorse more positive attitudes towards mental health care, including
      willingness to seek treatment if needed.

      This project is a scientific collaboration between the World Trade Center (WTC) Health
      Program at Stony Brook University (SBU), the Epidemiology Program at North Shore-LIJ Health
      System (NSLIJ), and Rutgers University. The goal is to adapt and test the efficacy of the
      National Institute of Environmental Health and Safety (NIEHS) Disaster Worker Resilience
      Training (DWRT) Program for Sandy responders by leveraging data from the ongoing projects and
      the expertise of collaborators at these sites. The DWRT program was originally designed for
      and piloted with responders to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill. Knowledge from the
      ongoing Sandy projects will be used to tailor this intervention to address Sandy-specific
      risk factors and unique features of the responder communities in the New York Metropolitan
      area. Responders identified from ongoing projects at SBU (N=1500, 50% anticipated eligible)
      and other current local disaster responders will be targeted for enrollment. The objectives
      are to: (1) to adapt the DWRT program for this population; (2) recruit and randomly assign
      responders (N = 120) to the DWRT program or a waitlist control condition; (3) assess the
      efficacy of this intervention to enhance resilience over a three month period; and (4) host
      forums with community stakeholders to share information on this program and its outcomes. The
      expected outcomes are: (1) efficacy data on the DWRT program, and (2) qualitative data on the
      acceptability of this intervention to Sandy responders. The products are: (1) a final report;
      (2) articles for publication; (3) abstracts for national conferences; and (4) a training
      manual, participant workbook, and presenter materials.

    <description>The Disaster Worker Resilience Training (DWRT) Program is a 4 hour program which consists of a participant training manual, an instructor-training manual, and a digital presentation. It uses adult training techniques that emphasize active participation in individual and group experiential learning activities. The curriculum is organized into a preface and four chapters, each with action oriented learning objectives. Overall program objectives include a demonstrate an ability to: 1) Recognize signs and symptoms of disaster work-related stress, 2) Obtain support through employer and community resources, and 3) Build resilience by using stress reduction and coping strategies.</description>
