  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to test the safety of different doses of specially
      prepared immune cells (called &quot;T cells&quot;) collected from blood. The Investigators want to find
      a safe dose of these modified T cells for patients who have malignant pleural disease. They
      want to find out what effects these T cells have on the patient and the cancer (MPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating, non randomized, single-center, phase I study of
      mesothelin-targeted T cells administered intrapleurally as a single infusion in patients with
      a diagnosis (histologically or cytologically documented) of MPD from mesothelioma, lung
      cancer, or breast cancer. The total number of patients studied will depend on the number of
      dose levels tested, up to a maximum dose of 3×10^6 mesothelin-targeted T cells/kg or until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached.

    <description>Following enrollment, leukapheresis product will be obtained in the blood donor facility at MSKCC and cryopreserved in the Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Facility (CTCEF). Before protocol treatment, the leukapheresis product will be thawed, and T cell isolation, transduction, and expansion of iCasp928z T cells will be performed in the MSKCC CTCEF Facility. It is estimated that it will take approximately 3 to 6 weeks to generate T cells for treatment.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (at 1.5 g/m^2) , 2 - 7 (Day (-7) -(-2) days before T cell infusion. On Day 1 , patients will be admitted to the MSKCC Thoracic Surgery Inpatient Service (if not already inpatients) for intravenous hydration, clinical monitoring, and blood work for immune monitoring. Standard MSKCC antiemetic therapy will be administered prior to chemotherapy to prevent nausea/vomiting. Administration of corticosteroids will be avoided as steroids may impede the efficacy of CAR T cells.</description>

    <description>Administration through the pleural catheter- On day 0 patients will be treated with genetically modified T cells. Thirty to 60 minutes before T cell infusion, patients will be given 650 mg of acetaminophen orally and 25- 50 mg of diphenhydramine orally or intravenously, to prevent infusion-related reactions. The genetically modified T cells will be infused for at least 15 minutes and no more than 2 hours through the indwelling pleural catheter depending on the volume of the T cells. A physician will be available during the infusion. Please note, during formulation of iCasp9M28z T cells, under or over estimation of CAR modified T Cells may occur. Patient may receive an altered fractionation of the total dose or up to 35% over or under total cell dose with approval of the PI.</description>
