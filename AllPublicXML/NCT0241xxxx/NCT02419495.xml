      This is an open label, single center Phase IB combination therapy study in metastatic or
      locally advanced cancers. The addition of Selinexor to multiple standard chemotherapy
      regimens will be tested in parallel. Two types of patients may be enrolled in this study: (1)
      advanced staged cancer patients either unresponsive or relapsed following prior standard
      therapy or for whom there is no known effective therapy; OR (2) advanced stage cancer
      patients for whom the standard chemotherapy treatment to which Selinexor is added is
      considered an appropriate and acceptable therapy. Patients who meet these criteria may in
      some cases have received no prior chemotherapy.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, their doctor will decide
      which part of the study they will be in based on the type of tumor they have. The study
      doctor will discuss this with participant.

        -  If participant is in Group A, they will receive selinexor and carboplatin.

        -  If participant is in Group B, they will receive selinexor and paclitaxel.

        -  If participant is in Group C, they will receive selinexor and eribulin.

        -  If participant is in Group D, they will receive selinexor, doxorubicin, and
           cyclophosphamide.

        -  If participant is in Group E, they will receive selinexor, carboplatin, and paclitaxel.

        -  If participant is in Group F, they will receive selinexor, carboplatin, and pemetrexed.

        -  If participant is in Group G, they will receive selinexor and topotecan.

        -  If participant is in Group H, they will receive selinexor in combination with FOLFIRI.

        -  If participant is in Group I, they will receive selinexor in combination with
           irinotecan.

        -  If participant is in Group J, they will receive selinexor in combination with XELOX.
