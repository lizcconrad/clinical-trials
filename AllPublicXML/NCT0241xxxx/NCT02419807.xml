      This clinical trial will enroll up to 130 adult women with a confirmed diagnosis of clinical
      stage 1 or 2 breast cancer who are undergoing breast cancer surgery with lumpectomy or
      mastectomy and planned axillary sentinel node biopsy procedure. Patients will undergo
      lymphatic mapping with technetium Tc-99m (99mTc) sulfur colloid in accordance with routine
      clinical practice. Injections of 99mTc sulfur colloid will take place the afternoon prior to
      planned next morning surgery or on the morning of surgery. Patients will undergo
      lymphoscintigraphy in accordance with standard clinical practice.

      Immediately prior to operation, after the induction of anesthesia in the operating room, up
      to 1cc of 0.5% indocyanine green (ICG) solution will be injected subdermally close to the
      tumor or into the subareolar region after disinfection of the breast skin. ICG movement will
      be facilitated by manual massage and monitored with fluorescence imaging. ICG fluorescence
      will be elicited and detected by Photodynamic Eye (PDE) camera. The lymphatic drainage, made
      evident by the fluorescent dye, will be monitored in real time on a monitor. The fluorescence
      will be followed towards the armpit region (axilla) and time for the fluorescence to reach
      the axilla will be recorded. Following standard practice, an incision will be made in the
      armpit region. Fluorescent lymph nodes (ICG positive) will be localized and removed and
      analyzed by a pathologist. Node removal will continue until no residual fluorescence is
      visible in the axilla. Removed nodes will be tested for radioactivity using a standard
      gamma-detecting probe and the counts per minute will be recorded. Finally, the armpit region
      will be inspected with the gamma probe to determine if there are any residual radioactive
      nodes. Residual sentinel nodes (the first node to receive lymph from a tumor) will be
      removed. For the purposes of this study, the sentinel status of a node will be defined as
      being flagged as sentinel by either one or both of the ICG or 99mTc methods. The goal of the
      project is to confirm that axillary lymphatic mapping with ICG leads to similar nodes being
      labeled as sentinel as lymphatic mapping with 99mTc-labeled radiotracer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To confirm that axillary lymphatic mapping with indocyanine green solution (ICG) solution
      leads to a similar number of nodes being labeled as sentinel as lymphatic mapping with
      99mTc-labeled (technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid) radiotracer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid injection and undergo lymphoscintigraphy
      according to clinical practice. Prior to surgery, patients also receive indocyanine green
      solution subdermally close to the tumor or into subareolar region of the breast skin.
      Patients then undergo axillary sentinel node biopsy and surgery.

    <description>Let A be the number of Tc-positive and ICG-positive sentinel nodes (SNs) detected, B be the number of Tc-positive and ICG-negative SNs detected, and C be the number of Tc-negative and ICG-positive SNs detected. The total number (N) of SNs detected is therefore N = (A + B + C); the proportion of SNs (PTc) detected by the Tc method is (A + B)/N; and the proportion of SNs (PICG) detected by the ICG method is (A + C)/N. Differences in the proportions of SLNs flagged will be compared using a two-sided 90% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>This is a method used to check the lymph system for disease. A radioactive substance that flows through the lymph ducts and can be taken up by lymph nodes is injected into the body. A scanner or probe is used to follow the movement of this substance on a computer screen. Lymphoscintigraphy is used to find the sentinel lymph node (the first node to receive lymph from a tumor), which may be removed and checked for tumor cells. Lymphoscintigraphy is also used to diagnose certain diseases or conditions, such as lymphoma or lymphedema.</description>
