  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      rFSH and HMG are both used to controlled ovarian stimulation for patients submitted to IVF.
      However, there is a debate in the literature which one is better to induce ovulation in
      patients receiving GnRH antagonist to block premature Luteinizing Hormone (LH) secretion.

      The investigators propose a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) to investigate the differences
      among recombinant FSH and HMG in patients submitted to IVF using GnRH antagonists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare embryonic quality and other clinical outcomes when using human menopause
      gonadotropin (hMG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) to the ovarian
      stimulation in IVF cycles with the GnRH antagonist protocol.

      Design: open randomized single center study with infertile patients submitted to IVF
      comparing IVF outcomes between hMG and rFSH when controlled with GnRH antagonist.

      Setting: A single private center of reproductive medicine in association with Universidade
      Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

      Patients: Infertile women with normal ovarian reserve with IVF indication. Intervention: The
      patients were randomized in two groups, 85 received rFSH and 83 received hMG to ovulation
      induction, both groups used GnRH antagonist to prevent ovulation.

      Main Outcome Measure: Total embryonic score and best embryonic score. Secondary outcomes:
      Total dose of gonadotropins, number and size of follicles in the end of the stimulation,
      number of mature oocytes, number of embryos, pregnancy rates.

    <description>The embryo evaluation will be performed on day three after fertilization based on the Graduated Embryo Score (GES). It will be performed three evaluations occurring at 16 - 18 hours, 25 - 27 hours and 64 - 67 hours post insemination, by the same embryologist (DS) The score is composed by the following criteria: nucleolar alignment along pronuclear axis, regular cleavage and degree of fragmentation at the first cell division, and cell number and morphology on day 3 after fertilization. The score ranges from 20 to 100 per embryo.</description>

This dose will be maintained until day 6 of stimulation, when a second ultrasound will be performed and the GnRH antagonist will be initiated and continued until the end of the cycle.
