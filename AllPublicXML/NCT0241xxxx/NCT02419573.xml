      The primary objective of the trial is to determine if 72-hour survival after out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) is improved with initial endotracheal intubation (ETI) over initial
      laryngeal tube (LT) airway management strategies.

      The primary objective of the trial is to determine if 72-hour survival after out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) is improved with initial endotracheal intubation (ETI) over initial
      laryngeal tube (LT) airway management strategies.

      The null hypothesis is that 72-hour survival is similar between primary Laryngeal Tube (LT)
      SGA and primary ETI airway management strategies.

      Evaluated secondary outcomes will include return of spontaneous circulation, survival to
      hospital discharge, neurologically intact survival at hospital discharge, airway management
      performance, and clinical adverse events.
