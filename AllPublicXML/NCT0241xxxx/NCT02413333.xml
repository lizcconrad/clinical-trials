             months);

          -  Willing to wear study lenses daily wear only on a daily basis (7 days per week and at
             least 4 hours per day) and attend all study visits;

          -  Symptoms of contact lens related dryness as defined by the Symptomatic Pre-Screening
             Questionnaire;

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             enrollment;

          -  Ocular anterior segment infection, inflammation, abnormality, or active disease that
             would contraindicate contact lens wear;

          -  Any systemic diseases that may affect the eye or be exacerbated by use of contact
             lenses or contact lens solutions or which could prevent wearing lenses at least 4
             hours per day;

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated;

          -  Monocular (only 1 eye with functional vision) or fit with only 1 lens;

          -  History of herpetic keratitis, ocular surgery, or irregular cornea;

        <title>Mean Residual Peroxide at Day 30</title>
        <description>The used lens case was collected after approximately 30 days of use. Remaining liquid was removed and dry cases were shipped to a lab for analysis. 10 mL of the appropriate solution was added to each collected case. Residual peroxide was measured at the manufacturers minimum recommended storage time (6 hours for Clear Care Plus and 4 hours for PeroxiClear).</description>
