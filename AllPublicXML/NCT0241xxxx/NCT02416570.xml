  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify if clarithromycin (CLM) has potential as a widely available and
      inexpensive treatment for cachexia (the loss of muscle mass) in people with non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Half the participants will receive clarithromycin and half will receive
      a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clarithromycin has been reported to significantly improve markers of inflammation, body
      weight, need for hospital admission and survival in 42 patients with NSCLC. Compared to
      patients receiving best supportive care only, those receiving Clarithromycin had an improved
      median survival of ~8 months (535 vs. 277 days), stayed at home longer (439 vs. 139 days) and
      reported no adverse effects.

      In another study, 33 patients with NSCLC were given Clarithromycin for 3 months and compared
      to a matched control group there was a reduction in IL-6 levels which correlated with an
      improvement in body weight (gain 4 vs. 1kg) and survival. Thus, by reducing inflammation,
      Clarithromycin may be impeding the cachectic process, preserving body weight, physical
      function and independence and increasing survival.

      These studies of Clarithromycin in NSCLC have limitations, e.g. lack of placebo-control, no
      direct assessment of lean body mass.

      This feasibility study will obtain data to inform the viability and design of a larger
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study.
