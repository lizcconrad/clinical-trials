      The study purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cultivated oral mucosal
      epithelial sheet transplantation as a novel therapy for limbal stem cell deficiency, for
      which no effective approaches has thus far been available, for the purpose of establishing
      this therapy as an effective strategy for this disease with an aim of improving visual acuity
      and corneal transparency.

      The efficacy and safety of cultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheet transplantation as a
      novel therapy for limbal stem-cell deficiency, for which no effective approaches have thus
      far been available, will be evaluated for the purpose of establishing this therapy as an
      effective strategy for this disease with an aim of improving visual acuity and corneal
      transparency. The primary endpoint will be an area of no conjunctivalization and no corneal
      epithelial defect at one year, which will be evaluated according to a 6-grade rating scale.
      The secondary endpoints will be corrected visual acuity, severity of corneal opacification,
      extent of corneal neovascularization, expected ocular complications, and all adverse events
      including abnormal laboratory findings. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the
      efficacy of the investigational therapy so as to provide rationales for making this strategy
      approved as an advanced medical care in the future.

    <time_frame>1 year after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>One year after the transplantation, an area of no conjunctivalization and no corneal epithelial defect will be rated according to the Grading scale described in Table 2, on the basis of which the efficacy of the investigational therapy will be assessed. Generally, the preoperative condition of ocular surface is rated as &quot;Bad (Grading 0).&quot; In subjects showing improvement to Grading 2 or greater, the investigational therapy will be assessed as effective.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corrected visual acuity (efficacy)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Corrected visual acuity will be evaluated by the decimal acuity method and converted to Log MAR values, which will be used to assess the extent of postoperative change in visual acuity. Note that 0.005 will be given to &quot;counting fingers,&quot; 0.002, to &quot;hand motion,&quot; and 0.001, to &quot;light perception&quot; 14). Visual acuity will be measured before transplantation, and 1, 3, and 6 months as well as one year after transplantation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Among patients with bilateral limbal stem-cell deficiency, those who meet all the
             criteria listed below when they give their informed consent to participate in this
             research will be included.

               1. Patients in whom the eye(s) (subject to the interventional therapy) show(s) loss
                  or dysfunction of corneal epithelial stem cells throughout the total*
                  circumference of the cornea

               2. Patients in whom the corneal surface of the eye(s) (subject to the
                  investigational therapy) is(are) entirely enveloped by conjunctival tissue

               3. Patients of both genders aged â‰¥20 years when they give their informed consent

               4. Patients who have given their own written consent to participate in this clinical
                  research (The target disease is bilateral limbal stem-cell deficiency, although
                  it is not always necessary that the both eyes of the patient meet the inclusion
                  criteria.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are or may be pregnant, and patients who are breast feeding

          2. Patients with infections (HBV, HCV, HIV, HTLV-1)

          3. Patients with extreme hypolacrimation resistant to therapy

          4. Patients from whom oral mucosal specimens cannot be collected because clear scar
             formation or inflammatory findings are noted in a cell-collection site of the mucosal
             membrane

          5. Patients whose score of Performance Status (PS*) is 3 or more

          6. Any others who are judged by the chief subinvestigator to be ineligible for this
             clinical research, due to the presence of complications, etc.
