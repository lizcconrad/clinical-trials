  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 80 patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and minimal hepatic encephalopathy will
      be recruited. They will be randomized to receive high protein diet ( n = 40) and a normal
      protein diet ( n = 40 ) during one month. Randomization will be conducted by an external
      monitor and will keep the secret codes until the end of the study. All patients will be
      provided with structured menus and two snacks a day as an amaranth protein supplement. The
      supplement will content the same amount of fiber but the protein content will vary depending
      on the group to which the patient is assigned.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protein in the diet is a major source of ammonia in blood, which is considered one of the
      factors involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. However ; it is also known
      than the restriction on the consumption of protein predisposes to depletion of muscle mass,
      and increase the risk to develop overt hepatic encephalopathy, due to the muscle role in the
      detoxification of ammonia in presence of liver failure. Currently, the type and amount of
      protein in the diet to treat minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is unknown. In this study,
      the investigators will administrated two types of protein content in patients with MHE: a
      high protein diet (1.5 g/kg/day) vs a normal protein diet (0.8 g/kg/day) during 1 month.

    <description>It has been suggested that administrating a high protein diet in patients with liver cirrhosis and with minimal hepatic encephalopathy could prevent the development of malnutrition, increase the detoxification of ammonia by the muscle to consequently delay the onset overt hepatic encephalopathy and prolong patient survival. However, information is scarce and inconclusive regarding the potential role of dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of minimal hepatic encephalopathy.</description>
