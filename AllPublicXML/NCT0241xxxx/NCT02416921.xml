  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of a Facebook-delivered
      weight-gain prevention program versus a Facebook-delivered program with general women's
      health information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight gain is an important health concern, and disparities in the prevalence of obesity
      between African American and White women increase throughout the reproductive period. This
      study is a randomized, controlled trial testing the feasibility and acceptability of a
      peer-coach-administered, Facebook-delivered intervention to prevent weight gain in overweight
      and obese African American women. Study visits lasting approximately 1 hour will occur at
      baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up, to assess effectiveness and
      acceptability. The core intervention will occur over a 4-week period. Educational content in
      both the weight-gain prevention program and women's health program will be delivered via
      Facebook, with new content posted each weekday related to that week's topics. The peer
      coaches may contact participants via private messaging, when needed, to provide support and
      encourage engagement. If successful, this intervention could be easily disseminated to
      populations in under-served and community settings.
