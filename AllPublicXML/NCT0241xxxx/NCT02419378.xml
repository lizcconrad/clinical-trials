  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alemtuzumab is the active agent of a drug called Lemtrada®. In the European Union, Lemtrada®
      is approved for the treatment of a particular form of multiple sclerosis (the so called
      relapsing remitting form). The excellent efficacy of the drug justifies its administration
      albeit a high risk of considerable side effects. In this context, so called secondary
      (occurring after the administration of Lemtrada®) autoimmune diseases are of particular
      importance. In these diseases the immune system acts against structures of the body itself;
      the reasons are still unknown. Autoimmune diseases may even occur several years after
      treatment with Lemtrada®. Therefore, patients who once received the drug need to undergo
      intensive long term health monitoring.

      This study aims to elucidate which mechanisms cause to the positive and negative effects of
      Lemtrada®.

      The study includes patients only, who suffer from multiple sclerosis and are indicated to be
      treated with Lemtrada®. All patients receive the drug according to the official
      recommendations.
