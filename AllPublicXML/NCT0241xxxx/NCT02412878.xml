      The purpose of the study is to compare once-weekly carfilzomib dosing in combination with
      dexamethasone to twice-weekly carfilzomib dosing in combination with dexamethasone in
      subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, previously treated with bortezomib
      and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD).
