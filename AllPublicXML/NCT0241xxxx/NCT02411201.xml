  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DOTAREM® in the body of
      children aged less than 2 years thanks to several blood samples (3 ml in total) taken
      following the administration of DOTAREM®.

      DOTAREM® is a contrast agent commonly used for enhancement of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) to potentially improve the quality of the images and help the diagnosis. Children aged
      less than 2 years scheduled to undergo routine gadolinium-enhanced MRI of any body region may
      take part in the study. In this case they will receive DOTAREM®, a solution injected at the
      standard dose of 0.2mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) of body weight.

    <measure>MRI Lesion Visualization at Subject Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-injection and post-injection (estimated between 5 and 20 minutes after injection)</time_frame>
    <description>Lesion visualization was assessed on up to five most representative lesions per subject based on scoring of 3 co-endpoints:
border delineation (based on a 3-point scale where 1=none; 2=moderate and 3=clear and complete)
internal morphology (based on a 3-point scale where 1=poorly visible; 2=moderately visible and 3=sufficiently visible)
contrast enhancement (based on a 3-point scale where 1=none; 2=weak and 3=clear and bright)
For each co-endpoint, a sum of scores was calculated at subject level as follows: sum of scores = score of the lesion 1 (+ score of the lesion 2 + score of the lesion 3 + score of the lesion 4 + score of the lesion 5, when applicable)</description>
