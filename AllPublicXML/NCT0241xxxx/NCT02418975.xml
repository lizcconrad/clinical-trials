  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-operative weight loss can reduce the risk intra- and post-operative complications but no
      optimal pre-operative weight loss strategy has been investigated. Very-low-calorie diets
      (VLCDs) were proven to results in higher metabolic improvements in the short-term than
      balanced, hypocaloric diets. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate whether a VLCD
      results in lower intra-and post-operative complications compared to a hypocaloric diet.
      However, to achieve a optimal compliance in patients having experienced multiple dietary
      intervention failures, administration of the intervention will be performed by the enteral
      route using a naso-gastric feeding tube.

      Bariatric surgery is an important treatment strategy for obese patients having failed
      multiple diet-induced weight loss attempts. On the other hand, severly obese patients have
      also a high risk of both intra- and post-operative complications. Pre-operative weight loss
      can reduce these risks but no optimal pre-operative weight loss strategy has been
      investigated. Very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) were proven to results in higher metabolic
      improvements in the short-term than balanced, hypocaloric diets. Therefore, the aim of the
      study is to investigate whether a VLCD results in lower intra-and post-operative
      complications compared to a hypocaloric diet. However, to achieve a optimal compliance in
      patients having experienced multiple dietary intervention failures, administration of the
      intervention will be performed by the enteral route using a naso-gastric feeding tube.
