      SUMMARY

      Rationale:

      People with Dravet Syndrome (DS), a rare epilepsy syndrome, have a high risk of Sudden
      Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Mouse models indicated that the responsible sodium
      channel mutation (SCN1A) not only alters cortical excitability but also increases the
      propensity to arrhythmias. Little is known yet about the prevalence of seizure-induced
      arrhythmias in human DS subjects.

      Objective:

      To assess the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias in DS and to compare the prevalence of
      cardiac arrhythmias between DS subjects and subjects with other types of epilepsy.

      Study design:

      Observational study.

      Study population:

      Subjects with Dravet syndrome and a known pathogenic SCN1A mutation, seizure frequency ≥
      1/week (all seizure types except for absences or myoclonias), age ≥ 6 years and no signs of
      self-harm. Each case will be matched to two historical controls (age +/- 5 years) from the
      EEG databases of the participating centres. Only those controls with two or more recorded
      seizures will be matched to the cases.

      Intervention:

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Ictal asystole Ictal bradycardia Ictal QT-shortening/lengthening

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      Participation does not carry risks. The sensor is wearable and miniaturised, thus minimising
      discomfort. If this nevertheless may occur, the study can be terminated. This study provides
      specific tools to investigate the seizure-related heart rate response. Subjects may thus
      benefit from participation by identification of otherwise unknown arrhythmias. The rationale
      of the study (the high SUDEP risk and the evidence in animal studies for arrhythmic cause of
      sudden death) specifically applies to DS, a rare epileptic syndrome including minors and
      incapacitated persons. The investigators believe that the lack of risks, the potential
      diagnostic benefit, the minimal intervention with novel and wearable sensors and the
      possibility to terminate the study in case of discomfort, justifies the study in this patient
      group.

        the Netherlands (coordinating centre: SEIN). Procedure: The UMCU Medical Genetics
        department is the key referral centre in the Netherlands for DS (Brilstra, UMCU). Cases
        will be recruited from the UMCU database. Prior to inclusion, a panel (Gunning, Brilstra,
        Thijs) will review clinical data to ensure diagnostic consistency.

        Additional DS subjects will be recruited from the local DS databases at Universität Bonn
        (25 subjects; 4 adults; local coordinator R Surges) and UCL (100 subjects; 15 adults; local
        coordinator S Sisodiya).

        We will select historical controls (subjects with epilepsy without DS) from the video-EEG
        databases of the participating centres.

        Criteria:

        Cases must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. DS with a known pathogenic SCN1A mutation

          2. seizure frequency ≥ 1/week (all seizure types expect for absences or myoclonias)

          3. no self-harm

          4. age ≥ 6 years

        Each case will be matched to two historical controls (age +/- 5 years). Controls will meet
        the following criteria:

          1. definite diagnosis of epilepsy

          2. no clinical suspicion of DS

          3. at least two seizures recorded (all seizure types expect for absences or myoclonias)
             during video-EEG registration.

          4. age ≥ 6 years
