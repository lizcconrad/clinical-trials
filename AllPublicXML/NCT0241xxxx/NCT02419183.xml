      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of a Self-administered
      Memory Screening Test with Automated Reporting (SAMSTAR) adapted from the Rey Auditory Verbal
      Learning Test (RAVLT) in normal control (NC) participants and participants with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) against a standard version of the RAVLT test, administered by an
      examiner under the same conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center (when only one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by a chance), crossover
      (participants may receive different treatments sequentially during the trial) study. The
      study consists of a Screening Phase (Day -3 up to and including Day 1), Test Phase (Test Day
      1 and Test Day 2 [within 7 to 14 days following Test Day 1]) and an optional follow-up visit
      within 7 days after the last study-related activity for participants who experienced an
      adverse event that had not resolved by the end of the last test visit.The NC and MCI
      participants will initially either undergo a standard version of the RAVLT test or the
      SAMSTAR version of the RAVLT test on Test Day 1 or on the same day as screening, with
      follow-up testing using the other test using a crossover design to be conducted within 1 to 2
      weeks at the same venue (Test Day 2). There will be a 7-to 14-day memory washout period
      between the test periods. No investigational medicinal product will be administered. The
      maximum study duration for a participant will not exceed 3 weeks.

        Male and female adult normal control (NC) participants and participants with Mild Cognitive
        Impairment (MCI), aged 55 to 84 years receiving healthcare in primary care and/or neurology

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have normal visual and hearing acuity (corrected or uncorrected) as
             assessed in the Screening cognitive test (MoCA)

          -  Screening Criteria:

               1. NC participants: meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, Dementia Screening Interview
                  (8- item) (AD8) score 0-1, MoCA score 28 or higher (education-adjusted)

               2. MCI participants: meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, AD8 score 2 or higher, MoCA
                  score 24 to 27 (education-adjusted)

          -  Participant must be English-speaking and able to understand and follow the

          -  Each participant must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she
             understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has an acute or chronic medical condition (eg, Alzheimer's disease [AD] or
             depression) that would interfere with the participant's ability to complete either
             memory test assessment or comply with other study requirements

          -  Participant has an acute or chronic psychiatric condition that would interfere with
             the participant's ability to complete either memory test assessment or comply with
             other study requirements

          -  Participant has any acute or chronic neurological conditions (eg, stroke, epilepsy,
             Parkinson's disease)

          -  Participant has any sensory, motor or speech impairment that would interfere with the
             participants' ability to complete memory testing that relies on speech recognition

          -  Participant has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (eg, compromise the
