  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dabigatran is associated with higher risk
      of bleeding in Asia area especially in China clinical practice and whether it need to set up
      a monitor system.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dabigatran is administered in a fixed does without laboratory monitoring and is being
      compared with warfarin (international normalized ratio, but only hundreds of evidence from
      Asia events in several multicenter, prospective, randomized trails. It remains unclear that
      whether Dabigatran is safety in China clinical practice and no need of monitor test. We
      identified participants as those diagnosed as having nonvalved atrial fibrillation, and who
      initiated dabigatran after diagnosis.We followed up each individual from the first
      prescription of dabigatran until discontinued use or switch of anticoagulants, death, or
      other outcomes or until one year later. We categorized bleeding events as major and minor
      events according to anatomical position. We defined time to bleeding as days between the
      first dabigatran prescription and the date of the bleeding event. We analyzed the time to the
      first bleeding event, as well as the time to the first major hemorrhage, intracranial
      hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, vaginal bleeding, hemarthrosis, hemoptysis,
      and epistaxis.

        We identified participants as those diagnosed as having artrial fibrillation, and who
        initiated dabigatran after diagnosis. The diagnosis of AF was defined as having inpatient
        or outpatient claims with primary or secondary International Classification of Diseases,
        Ninth Revision(ICD-9), code427.31.12. The CHADS2-VAS score is calculated as the sum of all
        points for a given patient and need &gt;=1. A history of previous stroke or transient ischemic
        attack is assigned 2 points; congestive heart failure, hypertension, age of 75 years or
        older, and diabetes are each assigned 1 point.

          3. In addition to documented AF, patients must have ≥1 CHADS2-VAS scores
