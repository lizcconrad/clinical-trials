  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, is a
      frequently occurring health-care associated infection, which causes considerable morbidity,
      mortality and health care costs. Important pathogens causing ICU pneumonia are Staphylococcus
      aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The epidemiology of ICU pneumonia and patient-related and
      contextual factors is not fully described, but is urgently needed to support the development
      of effective interventions.

      -  Microbiological samples:

             -  Peri-anal swabs - at day of ICF, day 4, day 7, then twice weekly until day 30.

             -  Lower respiratory tract (LRT) sample - at day of ICF, day 4, day 7, then twice
                weekly until day 30, day of ICU pneumonia, day 7 after ICU pneumonia. The LRT
                sample can be defined as the collection of an endotracheal aspirate (ETA). If an
                ETA cannot be collected, a sputum sample may be taken.

             -  Broncho alveolar lavage - If available through clinical procedures, BAL specimens
                will be collected for study purposes.

        -  Blood samples * Blood samples will be taken at day of ICF, day 7 and day 30 or day of
           ICU discharge (whichever occurs first), day of ICU pneumonia, day 7 after ICU pneumonia
           and day 30 after ICU pneumonia.

        ICU patients in approximately 30 sites in 6-12 European countries will be selected based on
        eligibility criteria that are described below.

        Inclusion will be based on S. aureus (SA) colonization status at ICU admission (ratio 1:1).
        These subjects will be followed through their ICU stay for assessment of the primary
        outcomes.

             within 24 hours thereafter, based on investigator's judgment.

          3. Expected stay in ICU is 48 hours or longer based on investigator's judgment.

          4. SA colonization status is known within 72 hours after start of first episode of
             mechanical ventilation and according to the result, the patient qualifies for
             enrollment.

          5. Written informed consent from subject / legally accepted representative within 72
             hours after start of first episode of mechanical ventilation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous participation as a subject in the study cohort of this study.

          2. Simultaneous participation of the subject in any preventive experimental study into
             anti-staphylococcus or anti-pseudomonas aeruginosa interventions.

          3. Expected death (moribund status) within 48h, or ICU discharge of the participant
             within 24h, at the moment of informed consent.
