      Study objectives: First, to determine whether intravenous injection of 1 mcg
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) through short cannula, in healthy participants, provides
      reliable results of cortisol response, and whether this method would replace the conventional
      technique of injecting ACTH by a needle directly into a peripheral vein. Secondly, to
      determine salivary free cortisol concentration during the test in healthy controls.

      Rationale of study: Intravenous injection of synthetic ACTH1-24 concentration through venous
      short cannula appears to be feasible and simple method. On the other hand, injection of
      ACTH1-24 by a needle directly into peripheral vein, is not infrequently complicated by
      technical problems in subjects with challenging veins. The investigators suppose that, both
      methods would have the same yield in predicting cortisol response.

      Salivary free cortisol test has an evolving importance in assessing the adrenal function.
      This test would be reliable for use in low dose ACTH stimulation (1 mcg) test. The
      investigators will examine the concentration of salivary free cortisol during ACTH
      stimulation test, in order to determine level range in normal controls.

      The study will include 20 healthy participants of both sexes, aged 18-70 years, that have no
      clinical suspicion of hypoadrenalism, or any active medical condition or treatment that might
      alter blood cortisol levels. Pregnant women and patients whose medical or mental condition
      precludes obtaining informed consent will be excluded.

      In the morning of the first visit, 1 mcg of ACTH1-24 will be injected directly into a
      peripheral vein. Blood and salivary samples will be drawn before injection, and 30 minutes
      after. Salivary cortisol will be drawn also 60 minutes after injection. At least two days
      later, in the morning of the second visit, 1 mcg of ACTH1-24 will be injected through short
      cannula in a peripheral vein, followed by injection of 5 ml of normal saline. Blood and
      salivary samples will be drawn before injection, and 30 minutes after. Salivary cortisol will
      be drawn also 60 minutes after injection. Blood cortisol results and salivary free cortisol
      results will be compared between tests.
