      To evaluate antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of Nifedipine GITS 60mg treated for 8
      weeks in Chinese hypertensive subjects who failed to achieve BP control with the

      Study design: it's a A prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study. After a one-
      to two-week screening period, subjects receive Nifedipine GITS 60mg for 8 weeks.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy of 8-week Nifedipine GITS
      60mg treatment in Chinese hypertensive subjects who failed to achieve BP control with the
      starting-dose antihypertensive mono-therapy.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the tolerability of Nifedipine GITS 60mg.
