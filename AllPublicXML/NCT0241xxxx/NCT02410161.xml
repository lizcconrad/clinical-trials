  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: As the main alternative fuel to glucose for the brain, increased plasma ketones
      could potentially help compensate for brain glucose hypometabolism occurring during aging.
      The precursor long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), α-linolenic acid (ALA), is
      normally mostly β-oxidized and so could potentially be used to stimulate ketogenesis in
      humans.

      Objective: To compare the impact of an ALA-rich supplement on the ketogenic response in young
      and older healthy adults.

      Design: Ten young and ten older adults will consume a flaxseed oil supplement providing 2 g/d
      of ALA for 4 weeks. Plasma ketones, free fatty acids, triglycerides, glucose and insulin will
      be measured over 6 h during two metabolic study days, one before and one at the end of the
      supplementation.

      Hypothesis: ALA-rich supplement for 4 weeks will increase ketone production in both groups.

    <description>each participant consumed one 1000 mg capsule of flaxseed oil four times per day for 4 weeks, providing a total of 2 g/d of ALA. The capsules used were a commercially available flaxseed oil supplement containing ALA at 56% of total fatty acids (Jamieson, Toronto, ON, Canada). The other main fatty acids present in flaxseed oil include linoleic acid (18%), oleic acid (16%), palmitic and stearic acid (10% combined).</description>
