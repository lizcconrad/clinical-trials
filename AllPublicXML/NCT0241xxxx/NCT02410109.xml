  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression is a significant concern, particularly for low-income women. Many cases
      of perinatal depression are complicated by comorbidities such as post-traumatic stress
      disorder symptoms, anxiety, and intimate partner violence. Providing perinatal mental health
      services to women in home visiting programs could have considerable public health
      significance. This study will develop and test an integrated model of mental health services
      embedded within home visitation (HV) programs. This model will (1) incorporate a protocol for
      systematic screening and referral; (2) strengthen formal linkages between HV programs and
      other components of service systems; (3) promote the capacity of service systems to provide
      evidence-based early intervention and treatment for depression; and (4) facilitate the
      receipt of early intervention and treatment services for perinatal depression and comorbid
      conditions. This will be the first model to our knowledge that systematically integrates
      screening, referral, and early intervention and treatment for perinatal depression and
      associated comorbidities within HV programs.

      The specific aims are:

        1. To develop an integrated model of perinatal depression care within HV programs. This
           integrated model (&quot;SCRIPT&quot;) will incorporate screening, referral, and individualized
           prevention and treatment services.

        2. To assess the feasibility of implementing the SCRIPT model with high fidelity in two HV
           programs. One HV program—DRUM Healthy Families—will use paraprofessionals as
           interventionists while the other program—M&amp;I Nursing—will use nurses and social workers
           as interventionists.

        3. To determine the impact of the SCRIPT model on depressive symptoms and major depressive
           episodes.

    <description>Perinatal women will be screened for psychosocial risks at time of home visiting enrollment. Women exhibiting elevated depressive symptoms and/or have a history of clinical depression who are not currently clinically depressed will be referred for depression prevention services. Women experiencing a depressive episode will be referred for group CBT. Women who screen positive for elevated anxiety symptoms, PTSD symptoms, intimate partner violence, or substance abuse will be referred to a mental health or social service agencies. If a client is referred for services, the assessment worker will provide written educational materials about the risk factor that is being addressed through the referral. At the first home visit, the home visitor will discuss these educational materials.</description>
