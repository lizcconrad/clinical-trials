  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression has emotional consequences, social and important business. Reaching at least 7.5%
      of French aged 15 to 85 years. General Practitioners are the first professional consulted in
      terms of frequency of consultations. Indeed, in primary care, 10 to 25% of patients with
      depression that General Practitioners are often alone to support and follow. But General
      Practitioners are faced with diagnostic difficulties facing the diagnosis of depression,
      because if the patient does not engage itself, no tool is validated in France to help them in
      their diagnosis. However, standardized questionary exist that allow to overcome this
      difficulty. Questionary used in other european countries. Among them, the HSCL25 scale was
      selected by a systematic review of literature and a RAND UCLA type of consensus procedure.
      This HSCL25 scale is the most efficient for the diagnosis of depression in terms of
      efficiency tool, reproducibility and ergonomics. However, it remains necessary to confirm its
      validity in terms of the French translation and in terms of efficiency.
