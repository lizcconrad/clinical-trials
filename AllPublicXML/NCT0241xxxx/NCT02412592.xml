    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide, and the leading cause of
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBeAg seroconversion is considered to be the
      satisfied endpoint of antiviral therapy in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients.
      However, HBV reaction, even reverse back to HBeAg positive and clinical relapse could occur
      in some patients who achieved HBeAg seronconversion by interferon treatment. In this study,
      the long-term efficacy of interferon therapy in HBeAg positive patients achieved HBeAg
      seronconversion after interferon treatment and the factors associated with viral and clinical
      relapse will be observed.

      HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B patients achieved HBeAg seronconversion by interferon
      treatment will be enrolled and observed for 156 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg,
      and anti-HBe will be measured every 3 months during the observation period, liver function
      tests were performed every 3 months also. The liver ultrasonic examination would be taken
      every 3-6 months. The primary endpoint is sustained viral response, and secondary endpoints
      is HBV DNA reaction and clinical relapse defined as virla relapse with abnormal ALT during
      observation period.

        The study population in this study were composed of HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B
        patients achieved HBeAg seroconversion by interferon treatment, and serum HBsAg, anti-HBs,
        HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA would be tested every 3 months for 156 weeks after finished
        treatment. The sustained viral response defined HBV DNA mantaining undetectable would be
        evalued during the observation period.
