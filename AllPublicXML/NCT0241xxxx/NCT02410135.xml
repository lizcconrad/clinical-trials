             correctly.

          3. Symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) (urinary frequency and urgency with or without
             urgency incontinence) for at least 3 months, with an IPSS ≥ 12.

          4. Moderate sleep disturbance with a mean score on the Jenkins Scale &gt; 7.

          5. Micturitions/24 hrs ≥ 8; total excretory volume of &lt;3L.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is using prohibited medications which cannot be stopped safely at the

             such as interstitial cystitis, bladder stones, previous pelvic radiation therapy or
             previous or current malignant disease of the pelvic organs.

         10. Two documented independent urinary tract infections of any type in the past year.

         12. Subject has moderate to severe hepatic impairment [ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT) or GGT value
             greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal in the clinical center lab; confirmed
             on a second measurement].

         13. Subject has severe renal impairment or End Stage Renal disease (i.e., creatinine
             greater than 2.0 mg/dl).

         14. PSA (prostate specific antigen) level greater than 10 ng/ml at the first screening
             visit (if male).

         15. Subject has severe uncontrolled hypertensionas defined by a systolic pressure ≥180
             mmHg and/or diastolic pressure ≥120 mmHg.

         16. Subject has a clinically significant abnormal ECG or has a known history of QT
