    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a small dose of glucagon (mini-dose glucagon) is
      effective for the treatment of non-severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

      There are three phases included in this study: (1) Pre-crossover Trial Run-in Phase, (2)
      Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) Crossover Trial Phase, and (3) Post-Crossover Trial Extension
      Phase.

        1. Run-in Phase:

           Prior to commencing the crossover trial, study enrollment will begin with a 2 week
           run-in phase to assess hypoglycemia eligibility and compliance.

        2. Crossover Trial Phase:

           The Crossover Trial Phase will consist of two (3-week) periods.

           The Crossover Trial Phase will include up to 24 participants who complete these study
           periods. Participants who do not complete both periods or who do not have at least one
           event during both periods may be replaced.

           During the Crossover Trial Phase participants will be randomized into two groups: (1)
           Group A will use mini-dose glucagon in period 1 and oral glucose tablets in period 2 and
           (2) Group B will use oral glucose tablets in period 1 and mini-dose glucagon in period
           2. Each group with follow the applicable treatment arm according to their randomized
           group.

        3. Extension Phase:

      The Post-Crossover Trial phase will commence upon completion of the second 3-week period of
      the Crossover Trial Phase. Participants will have a 3 week phase during which time they will
      decide whether to use mini-dose glucagon or glucose tablets to treat each non-severe
      hypoglycemic event or to prevent hypoglycemia.

          <description>For G-Pen Mini Period:
Participants are to check blood glucose (BG) with study meter if continuous glucose monitor (CGM) reads &lt;70 mg/dl or they experience symptoms. Participants instructed to treat using mini-dose glucagon for certain phases/periods when BG is 40 to 69 mg/dl (considered a non-severe hypoglycemic event).
G-Pen Mini™ (glucagon injection): 1st BG check, 1st treatment
BG is 50-69 mg/dl, treatment is 150 µg of glucagon
BG is 40-49 mg/dl, treatment is 300 µg of glucagon
15 min later, 2nd BG check, 2nd treatment
BG is 60-69 mg/dl, no treatment
BG is 50-59 mg/dl, treatment is 150 µg of glucagon
BG is &lt;50 mg/dl, treatment is participant's preferred oral carbohydrate and not mini-dose glucagon
30 minutes later, 3rd BG check, 3rd treatment
BG is &gt;=70, no treatment
BG is &lt;70 mg/dl, treatment is participant's preferred oral carbohydrate and not mini-dose glucagon</description>

        <title>Clinical Grading - Limited to Events in Primary Analysis</title>
        <description>2 graders, blinded to treatment arm, independently graded each hypoglycemic event as a clinical failure or success based on all available BG concentrations within 1 hour of initial treatment. All BG values, along with corresponding time elapsed since treatment, were reviewed to determine whether the response would be considered a treatment success, in a clinical setting. There were no specific cut points; rather than basing the success criteria on whether the BG was above specific cutpoints by specific times, the grader decided whether the event would be considered a success in a clinical setting (i.e. if the BG increased after treatment and reached and maintained a satisfactory level after the treatment). The graders to achieve a consensus grading adjudicated discordant gradings (6% of events). The number of events graded as a treatment success were reported out of the total number of hypoglycemic events, for each treatment arm.</description>
