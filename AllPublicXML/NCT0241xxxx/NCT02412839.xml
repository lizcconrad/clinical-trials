      This study will enroll 150 healthy volunteers, and the grouping is as follows: group 20-39
      (30 males and 30 females); group 40-59 (30 males and 30 females); and group 60-79 (15 males
      and 15 females). The sublingual microcirculation will be examined with the incident dark
      field video microscope (Cytocam，Braedius Battery Powered Transilluminator). The study aims to
      compare the differences of microcirculation among the three groups and between genders.
