    <description>A total of 55 cases of locally advanced colon cancer will be enrolled in this arm. After radiological staging, patients were treated first with 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of oxaliplatin, 130 mg/m² on day 1, with capecitabine, 1000 mg/m² twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks (the XELOX regimen), followed by tumor resection, and then with another 5 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the XELOX regimen. Radiological response was evaluated after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy . A total of 3 cycles neoadjuvant chemotherapy was completed unless there was unacceptable toxicity, emergency operation condition or tumor progression during the period. Tumor responses, toxicities, and surgical complications were recorded. The pathological tumor response in the primary tumor was evaluated according to tumor regression grade (TRG) score.</description>
