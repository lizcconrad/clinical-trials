      Background: KBMSI-2, which is the herbal formular consisted of Ginseng Radix Rubra, Dioscorea
      tenuipes, Cornus officinalis Sieb. Et Zucc, Lycium Chinese Mill, Curcuma logna Linn, Honey,
      improved the erectile function by preserving the smooth muscle content and inhibiting the
      fibrosis of the corpus cavernosum in STZ-induced diabetic rat model. In this study, the
      researchers investigated the efficacy and safety of the herbal formula (KBMSI-2) in the
      treatment of ED.

      Material and Methods: Patients were instructed to take investigational products (KBMSI-2 6g
      or placebo) twice a day for 8 weeks at least 1 hour after food intake. The primary efficacy
      variable was the change in the EF domain scores of the IIEF questionnaire from baseline.
      Secondary efficacy measures included change in all domain scores of the IIEF from baseline,
      change in question 2 and 3 of the SEP2,3, from baseline.

    <description>The KBMSI-2 capsules (6gm/capsule) and placebo were provided by Korean Bio Medical Science Institute (Seoul, Korea). KBMSI-2 was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. KBMSI-2 contained major ginsenoside-Rb1: 260.53ug/g, -Rb2: 543.91ug/g, -Rc: 424.92ug/g, -Re: 377.32ug/g, -Rf: 1160.55ug/g, -Rg1: 703.97ug/g, Curcumin 60.73ug/g, Allantoin 98.66ug.g, and Loganin 744.13ug/g. During the study period, two capsules were taken daily for 8 weeks. The placebo capsules were identical in shape, color, and taste.</description>
