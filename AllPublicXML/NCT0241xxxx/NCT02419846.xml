  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies an informed decision making intervention of screening for
      prostate cancer in predominantly African American participants. It also evaluates
      participants' knowledge about prostate cancer screening and to improve understanding. Using
      decision aids such as culturally sensitive written material, verbal information, and videos
      to educate patients about screening may increase patient participation and knowledge. This
      may increase confidence in participants' decisions. Raising awareness about prostate cancer
      in the communities may increase the participants' willingness to be screened for prostate
      cancer once they have learned about it.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      (A) To assess the effectiveness of a proposed educational model for informed decision about
      Prostate Cancer in high risk men over age 40 which compares informed decision making and
      shared decision making (B) to improve knowledge about prostate cancer in men over age 18

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete an educational intervention comprising a 10-20 minute PowerPoint
      presentation given by an experienced healthcare professional that discusses prostate cancer
      facts, screening guidelines, risks, benefits, and consequences. Some participants then
      undergo a screening exam comprising a prostate specific antigen level and digital rectal
      exam.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up periodically.
