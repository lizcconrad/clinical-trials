  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies point at a potential relationship between vitamin D deficiency and worse
      outcome in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit. It is linked with the
      lack of vitamin D pleiotropic effects in the state of hypovitaminosis D. The pleiotropism of
      vitamin D is dependent on a specific feature of vitamin D receptor (VDR) namely polymorphism
      and its universal existence in the human body. Vitamin D pleiotropism is linked with cancer
      cells inhibition, a modulation of the immune system, an influence on cardiovascular system
      and neuroprotection.

      In 35-65% critically ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit the acute kidney
      injury (AKI) is diagnosed. Acute kidney injury increases significantly the probability of
      death. The standard therapy of a severe AKI in many intensive care units is the regional
      citrate anticoagulation continuous renal replacement therapy by means of continuous
      veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). The specificity of the regional citrate
      anticoagulation by means of precise ionized calcium and citrate dosing evokes questions
      regarding its influence on vitamin D and entire calcium-phosphate metabolism in the state of
      a severe AKI treated with regional citrate anticoagulation continuous renal replacement
      therapy.

      The intention of that trial is to measure vitamin D plasma levels and other parameters
      (parathormone, ionized and total calcium, magnesium, phosphate, albumin, globulin) linked
      with calcium-phosphate metabolism in the human body. We would like to assess potential
      relationships between the regional citrate anticoagulation continuous renal replacement
      therapy and these parameters.
