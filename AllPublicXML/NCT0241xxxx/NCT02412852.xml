  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, subjects with diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) will be treated for 12 weeks
      with either placebo, 40 or 80 mg sustained release sodium nitrite (TV1001sr) twice daily.
      Primary endpoints will be safety and pharmacokinetics. Assessment of the study medications
      affects on pain following treatment will also be recorded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of
      multiple doses of an oral, sustained release formulation of sodium nitrite (TV1001sr) in
      subjects with DNP. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple
      doses of twice daily 40 mg and 80 mg TV1001sr compared with placebo over a 12 week treatment
      period and the pharmacokinetics of the sustained release formulation of sodium nitrite.
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and markers of functional
      improvement including pain questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing and changes in
      markers of diabetes.

    <description>The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of twice daily 40mg and 80mg sustained release sodium nitrite compared with placebo over a 12 week treatment period. The following safety parameters will also be assessed: concomitant medication usage, physical examination, vital signs, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, and complete blood count. Assessment of acute adverse events (i.e., drop in blood pressure, dizziness) after administration of each dose level.</description>
