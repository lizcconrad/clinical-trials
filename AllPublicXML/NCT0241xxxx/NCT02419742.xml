    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Phase IV, multi-center, single arm, open-label, interventional study
      to evaluate the safety of trastuzumab for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 protein (HER2)-positive node positive or high risk node negative breast cancer
      participants with regimen consisting of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by either
      paclitaxel or docetaxel (AC-TH Regimen) or a regimen consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin
      (TCH Regimen) in Indian population.

    <description>Participants will receive trastuzumab as a part of either AC-TH or TCH treatment regimen. The choice of the regimen will be based on investigator's discretion referring the local prescribing document of trastuzumab. AC-TH consists of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by either paclitaxel or docetaxel. TCH consists of docetaxel and carboplatin. Trastuzumab will be common in both treatment regimens and could be administered weekly or every 3 weeks, as per investigator discretion. Each cycle will be of 3 weeks.</description>
