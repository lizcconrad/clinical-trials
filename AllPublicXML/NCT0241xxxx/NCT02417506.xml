  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The repetitive motions associated with active life and many sports can increase the wear and
      tear to the joints that leads to decrease in flexibility and joint pain finally heading its
      way to osteoarthritis. Activities such as jumping, running can wear away the cartilage that
      supports and cushions the joints of hands and knees, causing bones to rub against each other.
      Injuries stemming from repetitive motions can also cause and worsen the joint pain.

      Joint pain is discomfort that arises from any joint . Irrespective of the underlying
      mechanisms, joint pain usually originates in activation of nociceptors, or free nerve
      endings. Complex neuronal activation occurs, which involves not only local sensitization of
      joint nociceptors but also modifications in central pain pathways.

      Even though, the numerous pharmacological interventions are available for joint pain, there
      is much debate amongst clinicians about the best approach to the treatment of joint pain.
      NSAIDs which is frequently used for treatment in such cases, carries concerns related to
      gastro-intestinal system, cardiovascular system as well as central nervous system .

      Hence there is a need of a safer alternative treatment option for relieving acute joint pain
      which is comparable to the modern medicines, without posing concerns to the subject's general
      well being.

      Herbs are known to be used since ages in traditional literature and do not pose any potential
      health concern. Inspite of such positive attributes herbs are not employed in treatment of
      acute pains as there is lack of evidence proving the same.

      In order to address the need of the hour Enovate Biolife has invented a novel poly herbal
      formulation E-OA-07 (Lanconone). Lanconone has been studied previously in patients with
      osteoarthritis has been proven efficacious . It has a good history of marketing and is sold
      in the United States, with no reported adverse event related to the product. However there is
      no concrete evidence proving the product's acute pain relieving dynamics, hence the current
      study has been employed to comprehend the effect of lanconone in joint acute pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ambulatory adults of either sex aged 40 to 60 years.

          -  Subjects with moderate OA of the knee, which can be clinically, categorized as ARA
             functional Class II and III with radiological confirmation of Kellgren Lawrence Grade
             II and III. (incase of bilateral OA, the knee with the more severe symptoms will be
             defined as index joint)

          -  Subjects with OA in a flare state at the baseline defined by one of following category
             of flare:

        In subjects who have been receiving non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
        analgesic therapy for their OA, flare will be defined as having at least two of the
        following three criteria while comparing screening to baseline:

          1. Subject's assessment of arthritis pain VAS walking on a flat surface at baseline of ≥
             40 mm;

          2. Increase of ≥ 1 grade in the patients global assessment of arthritis;

          3. Increase of ≥ 1 grade in the physician's global assessment of arthritis;

        In subjects who are not receiving NSAID or analgesic therapy , an OA flare state will be
        defined as having at least two of the following three criteria

          1. Subject's assessment of arthritis pain VAS walking on a flat surface at baseline of ≥
             40 mm
