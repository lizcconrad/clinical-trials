  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited due to patients'
      poor condition, advanced tumor, concomitant intra- and extra-liver diseases, and resistance
      to both chemo- and radio-therapy. Trans-catheter embolization (TAE) or Trans-catheter
      chemo-embolization (TACE) is the most widely used locoregional treatment for advanced HCC.
      But no solid evidences support the beneficial effect of the chemotherapy in TACE. Many
      advanced HCC patients also can't tolerate the locoregional chemotherapy. The p53 gene has
      multiple anticancer functions and does not have any of the immune-inhibitory effects of
      chemo- or radio-therapy. The objectives of this study are to investigate the efficacy and
      safety usingTAE plus recombinant adenoviral human p53 gene (rAd-p53) in treatment of advanced
      HCC.

      Study design: multicenter, open-labeled, active-controlled phase II study

      Study treatments: TACE combined with rAd-p53 injection vs.TACE. The treatments are given once
      per 21 days until the disease progression. For the experiment group, 2 X 1000,000,000,000
      viral particles of rAd-p53 will be injected into the embolization artery.

      Study objectives: efficacy and safety of the study treatments

      Study endpoints: safety (adverse events, vital signs, lab tests, ECG and physical
      examination) and efficacy (progression-free survival, overall survival, and ECOG PS)
