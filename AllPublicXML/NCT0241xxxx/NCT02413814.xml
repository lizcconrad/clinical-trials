    <textblock>
      Problematic anger is a strong predictor of failed attempts at smoking cessation. The
      investigators proposed study seeks to evaluate whether a novel 8-session computerized
      anger-reduction treatment improves quit rates among smokers. Smokers with elevated trait
      anger will be administered transdermal nicotine patch therapy and either anger-reduction
      treatment or a control intervention. They will be assessed throughout treatment and up until
      three months after a scheduled mid- treatment quit date. The investigators propose to test
      whether, compared to the control condition, the anger-reduction treatment will lead to: 1)
      greater reductions in anger and 2) greater abstinence rates at post-cessation and at
      follow-up assessments. The investigators will also test whether changes in anger-related
      symptoms account for group differences in abstinence rates.

      The current proposal seeks to evaluate an eight-session, computerized, anger-focused
      intervention for smokers (Anger Reduction Treatment or ART). The investigators will
      administer this intervention to smokers (N = 114) who are interested in quitting and have
      elevated levels of trait anger. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either: (1)
      computerized ART, consisting of interpretation bias modification, or (2) a computerized
      control condition, which consists of health education and relaxing video clips. The
      computerized sessions (eight total) will take place twice a week for four weeks. All
      participants will have a scheduled quit date for the beginning of the third week of treatment
      (i.e., at mid-treatment). All participants will also receive nicotine patch therapy to use at
      their scheduled quit date. Anger symptoms, smoking cravings, and smoking frequency will be
      assessed throughout treatment. Smoking status, anger, and other measures of negative affect
      will also be assessed at baseline and regularly for 12-weeks following the scheduled quit
      date.

      The investigators will test whether, compared to the control condition, the anger-reduction
      treatment will lead to: 1) greater reductions in anger and 2) greater abstinence rates at
      post-cessation and at follow-up assessments. The investigators will also test whether changes
      in anger-related symptoms account for group differences in abstinence rates.

    <description>The treatment consists of eight 30-minute IBM sessions. Participants will be presented with ambiguous scenarios and asked imagine themselves in these situations. In the first task, the scenario will be followed by a benign interpretation of the situation. Participants will answer a comprehension question designed to have participants endorse this benign interpretation. In the second task, participants will be presented with a word denoting an interpretation with either a negative/hostile or positive/benign connotation. Following this word, an ambiguous scenario will appear. Participants will indicate whether the word and the scenario were related. They will receive feedback training them to endorse positive interpretations and reject negative interpretations.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the control condition will complete eight computerized sessions consisting of psychoeducation on healthy behaviors (i.e., topics of exercise, diet, hygiene, social support, healthy activities, and sleep, taken from protocols developed from our ongoing research). These participants will also view relaxing videos consisting of brief guided meditation instructions, pictures of nature scenes, and soft music. These sessions (psychoeducation and relaxing videos) will be matched for time with the active treatment condition, lasting 30 minutes each.</description>
