      The purpose of the RIO 2 International study is to provide clinical and economic evidence to
      support moving the LINQ™ insertion procedure outside these traditional locations within the
      hospital, referred to as &quot;out-of-cathlab&quot;.

      The traditional location of the LINQ™ insertion procedure is the catheterization laboratory,
      electrophysiology laboratory, or operating room. The purpose of the RIO 2 International study
      is to provide clinical and economic evidence to support moving the LINQ™ insertion procedure
      outside these traditional locations within the hospital, referred to as &quot;out-of-cathlab&quot;.

    <description>An untoward event is a composite endpoint defined as a LINQTM or LINQTM insertion procedure related complication OR an unsuccessful LINQTM insertion procedure, where a LINQTM or LINQTM insertion procedure related complication is defined as an adverse event related to the LINQTM or a LINQTM insertion procedure resulting in:
Death
Termination of significant device function
Invasive intervention (e.g. includes LINQTM revision/explant for reasons other than diagnosis of underlying condition, intravenous drug administration)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is indicated for continuous arrhythmia monitoring with a Reveal LINQ™
             Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM)

          -  Patient is at least 18 years of age or older if required by local regulations

          -  Patient is willing to undergo ICM insertion procedure outside of the cathlab,
             operating room, or EP lab setting with only local anesthetic

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide consent and authorize the use and disclosure of
             health information

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the elements of the clinical investigation
             plan including the required follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has unusual thoracic anatomy or scarring at the insertion site which may
             adversely affect the success of the insertion procedure

          -  Patient has reduced immune function or is otherwise at high risk for infection per
             physician discretion

          -  Current therapy with immunosuppressive agents or chronic steroid use e.g. Prednisone
             greater than 20mg per day

          -  Patient has had major surgery (in the past 6 months) Patient has undergone a procedure
             which required central venous or intra-arterial access (e.g. AF/VT ablation, EP study,
             coronary angiography) within the last 3 months or is scheduled for such a procedure
             while enrolled in the study

          -  Prior history of surgical infection, prosthetic device infection, or endovascular
             infection, including endocarditis, in the past 12 months

          -  Patient requires conscious or moderate sedation to receive LINQ™

          -  Patient already has an inserted or implanted loop recorder

          -  Patient is implanted or indicated for implant with a pacemaker, ICD, CRT device

          -  Patient is enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study,
