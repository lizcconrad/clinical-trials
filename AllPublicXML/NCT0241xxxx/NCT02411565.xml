    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this Pilot Study is to test the safety, tolerability and quality of life
      in women who take Fermented Wheat Germ Extract (FWGE), to determine if an active form of FWGE
      can be detected in the blood, and determine whether short-term therapy with FWGE has any
      effect on the tumor marker, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125).

    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events reported per treatment arm. An adverse event is the development of an untoward medical occurrence, undesirable medical condition, or recurrence or deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition subsequent to exposure to FWGE. This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) for toxicity and adverse event reporting.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurence of CA-125 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarker-based response involves assessing the participant's longitudinal CA-125 values. The definition of CA-125 response is based on the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG 2005) criteria. CA-125 response will be determined and compared between FWGE and placebo treated groups.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo their planned surgery during the 2nd to 4th week after entry into the study. However, if there are delays, patients can continue to take drug/placebo for a time period no greater than 2 months. If surgery has not occurred after this 2-month period, the patient will be removed from the study. Participants will take the study drug up until the day prior to surgery. The minimum amount of time on study drug is 2 weeks. A separate consent form will be obtained for the surgical procedure.</description>

             cancer. Signs of ovarian cancer include, but are not limited to: an elevated cancer
             antigen 125 (CA-125), a complex pelvic mass, ascites, and carcinomatosis. These signs
             are not necessary for suspicion or enrollment in this protocol.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years and competent to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of FWGE

          -  An upper gastrointestinal or other condition that would impair swallowing or
             absorption of oral medication.

          -  Any serious illness or medical condition that would not permit the patient to be
             managed according to the protocol, including, but not to limited, any the following:
             History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder (e.g., uncontrolled
             psychiatric disorders) that would impair the ability to obtain consent or limit
             compliance with study requirement; Active uncontrolled or serious infection; Active
             peptic ulcer disease.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater
             than 100.
