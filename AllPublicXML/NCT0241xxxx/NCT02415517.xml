  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The daily routine in clinical settings often showed cognitive impairments in patients with
      congestive heart failure, particularly in terms of executive functions, episodic memory,
      perceptual speed and attention. It is assumed that cognitive impairments in patients with
      congestive heart failure may lead to deficits in medication-adherence and self-care
      abilities, resulting in increased healthcare costs. Recent studies reported performance
      improvements after cognitive training that transferred to new, untrained tasks and abilities
      in healthy subjects across a wide range of ages. This study investigates the effects of
      cognitive training in patients with congestive heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive functions of patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA II-III) before (pretest)
      and after (posttest) cognitive-training intervention are investigated. Changes in cognitive
      functions are compared to changes in two control groups: 1) age and gender matched active
      control group 2) age and gender matched passive waiting list control group.

      The neuropsychological test battery applied at pretest and posttest includes measures of
      episodic memory, working memory, short-term memory, executive functions, perceptual speed and
      intelligence. In addition, the investigators apply standardized questionnaires of
      self-assessed quality of life, cognitive functioning in daily life, selfcare, and
      psychological well-being (depression, anxiety and personality). Relevant physiological data
      such as ejection fraction, heartrate, N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP)
      as well as drug blood level are recorded.
