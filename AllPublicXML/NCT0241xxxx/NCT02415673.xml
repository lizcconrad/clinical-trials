    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of two alignment sequences with
      thermal activated archwires with different Af temperatures applied for the correction of
      mandibular anterior crowding

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A parallel randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 42 patients ages 15 to 25 years
      (mean: 19.5 years) who required orthodontic treatment including the correction of mandibular
      anterior crowding. Eligibility criteria were no active caries, exemplary hygiene, non-
      extraction in the lower arch and no significant tooth size or shape abnormalities. Outcome:
      The primary outcome was the degree of crowding measured on plaster casts using Little's
      Irregularity Index. The secondary outcome was crowding survival time until the occurrence of
      correction in a six-month period. Randomization: The patients were randomly allocated to the
      different groups using sealed opaque envelopes. Blinding: The patients were blinded to the
      group to which they were allocated. Intervention: Patients were treatment with a pre-adjusted
      appliance (0.022 in- Roth prescription). Two nickel-titanium alignment and leveling sequences
      were employed - NiTi archwire: 0.012 in and 0.019 X 0.025 in; and thermal activated NiTi
      archwires: 0.018 in and 0.016 X 0.022 in with different austenite finish temperatures (37ºC
      and 35ºC), which formed the different study groups.
