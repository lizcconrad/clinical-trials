    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trastuzumab emtansine works in treating older patients
      with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive stage I-III breast cancer. HER2
      is a protein found on the surface of cancer cells that helps them to grow and spread.
      Trastuzumab emtansine may kill cancer cells by binding to HER2-positive on the surface of the
      tumor cells and blocking their ability grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), defined as occurrence of any of the following:
      ipsilateral invasive breast cancer recurrence, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence,
      distant recurrence, death attributable to any cause, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or
      second non-breast invasive cancer. Note: In-situ events are not included.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Recurrence-free survival (RFS). III. Adverse events. IV.
      Cardiac function/adverse events. V. Site of first recurrence.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The associations of adverse events and outcomes with each of the following will be
      examined: geriatric assessment (GA), patient reported outcomes (Patient-Reported Outcomes
      Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event [PRO-CTCAE]), quality of life
      (QOL), and biomarkers of aging.

      II. To determine whether clinician-reported CTCAEs are more accurate when PRO-CTCAE data are
      shared with the patient and clinician.

      III. Utilize a high-throughput mutation profiling system (Oncomap) to query a large panel of
      cancer gene mutations in older patients with HER2-positive breast cancers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6-12 months and then yearly
      for 4 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed HER2-positive disease by local pathology, defined as immunohistochemistry
             (IHC) 3+ or amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (HER2/chromosome
             17 centromere [CEP17] ratio &gt;= 2 or an average of &gt;= 6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus)
             AND confirmed by Central Pathology Review (Mayo Clinic Rochester) prior to patient
             being registered to begin protocol therapy

               -  NOTE: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) components should not be counted in the
                  determination of HER2 status

          -  Stage I-III breast cancer with the following criteria met:

               -  If node-negative or if node status unknown (because it was not assessed), tumor
                  must be &gt; 5 mm (T1b) of any hormone receptor subtype (document estrogen
                  receptor/progesterone receptor [ER/PR] status: if some ER/PR staining is present,
                  ER and PR negative are defined as being positive in &lt; 10% cells [per local
                  pathology read])

               -  If node-positive (N1-N3), T1mi, T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, or T3 tumors are eligible

                    -  Definition of node-negative disease (when node status known): If the patient
                       has had a negative sentinel node biopsy and/or a negative axillary
                       dissection, then the patient is determined to be node-negative; axillary
                       nodes with single cells or tumor clusters =&lt; 0.2 mm by either hematoxylin
                       and eosin (H&amp;E) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be considered
                       node-negative; any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters between 0.02 and
                       0.2 cm is considered a micrometastasis; patients with a micrometastasis are
                       eligible; an axillary dissection is not required to be performed in patients
                       with a positive sentinel node and management of the axilla will be left up
                       to the treating provider; in cases where the specific pathologic size of
                       lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation, the principal
                       investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility; in these
                       special situations, the investigator must document this approval in the
                       patient medical record

          -  ER/PR determination assays performed by IHC methods according to the local institution
             standard protocol

          -  Standard chemotherapy/trastuzumab declined by patient OR patient is deemed by
             physician for any reason to not be a candidate for standard therapy (i.e. patient
             and/or provider choose not to pursue standard trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen
             because of concerns related to toxicity or patient preference)

          -  For patients with bilateral or multifocal/multicentric breast cancers, one of the
             following criteria must be met to enroll: (1) each cancer individually meets criteria
             for enrollment (only ONE tumor has to undergo central confirmation for HER2), OR (2)
             at least one tumor meets eligibility (per tumor size/nodes/subtype outlined above) and
             the other foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are also HER2-positive but
             are too small for enrollment (e.g., a patient is eligible if a cancer is T2N0 and
             HER2-positive in one breast, but the contralateral breast has a T1b HER2+ cancer that
             isn't eligible on its own, OR, (3) at least one tumor meets eligibility and the other
             foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are HER2-negative and do not meet
             criteria for adjuvant chemotherapy per provider discretion (e.g. if a patient has a
             HER2-positive tumor meeting eligibility but also has a second, HER2-negative, small,
             node-negative, ER+, low grade cancer present, she is still eligible for enrollment);
             however, in the specific case that a second breast cancer is stage III and
             HER2-negative, that patient is excluded (because the second cancer is high-risk and
             likely will require non-HER2-directed therapy)

          -  All tumor removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy
             (lumpectomy)

               -  NOTE: management of axillary lymph nodes is up to the treating provider; however,
                  all surgical margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS (i.e., no tumor
                  on ink); the local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the
                  pathology report; if all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep)
                  margin is permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was
                  performed down to the pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed; likewise,
                  if all other margins are clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin)
                  margin is permitted provided the surgeon documents that all tumor has been
                  removed

          -  =&lt; 90 days from the patient's most recent breast surgery for this breast cancer

                  have entered menopause by this time; however patients should not become pregnant
                  while on this study; pre-menopausal women need to use birth control while on this
                  study and women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study; any man treated
                  on this study will also need to use contraception if his partner is a
                  premenopausal female; patients should check with their health care provider about
                  what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them

          -  Negative urine or serum pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to
             registration/randomization, for women of childbearing potential only

               -  NOTE: in the rare case that a woman enrolling on study is of childbearing
                  potential, a pregnancy test is required prior to enrollment on study

          -  Able to provide informed written consent

                  metastatic disease prior to enrollment; any staging scans will be ordered at the
                  treating provider's discretion; if metastatic disease is found on any staging
                  studies done, patients will not be eligible for enrollment
