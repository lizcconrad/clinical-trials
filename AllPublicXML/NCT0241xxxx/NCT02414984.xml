  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe adherence to golimumab in Colombian participants
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experiencing adequate treatment response, in a real-world
      clinical settings.

      This is a multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), non-interventional, prospective cohort study that will enroll participants
      with RA in Colombia, for whom the treating physician has decided to treat with golimumab
      prior to enrolment. All participants will be observed for adherence to golimumab treatment
      for 24 months from study start (Week 0), and recommended follow up assessments will be every
      3 months. Any changes including addition of new medications or dose modifications of existing
      medications will be entirely according to the treating physician's judgment. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Treatment Adherence Measured by Continuous Measures of Medication Gaps (CMG)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence rates to golimumab will be measured by the Continuous Measures of Medication Gaps (CMG). CMG provides an approximate percentage of time in which a participant is without medication available for use. Number of days of delay between consecutive golimumab injections will be observed throughout the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Treatment Suspension</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment suspension is defined as a treatment gap of at least 2 cycles of golimumab, with subsequent restart, as assessed by CMG.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Treatment Termination</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment termination is defined as a treatment gap of at least 2 cycles of golimumab, with no treatment restart as assessed by CMG.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, 12, 18, and 24 or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 is calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and tender joints (TJC) using the 28 joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) or the C-reactive protein (CRP) and patient's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (participant rate arthritis activity using visual analog scale [VAS] ranging from 0 to 100; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, 12, 18, and 24 or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>Work related productivity (absenteeism, presenteeism, and impairment in daily activities) will be assessed using Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Rheumatoid Arthritis (WPAI-RA), which consisted of 6 items: 1) Current employment status; 2) Number of hours missed due to a health problem; 3) Number of hours missed due to other reasons; 4) Hours actually worked; 5) Degree to which health affected productivity while working; 6) Degree to which health affected regular (non-work) activities.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life at Month 12 and 24 or Early Termination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12 and 24 or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). SF-36 is a generic quality of life questionnaire that assesses 8 health concepts: 1) Limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) Limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) Limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) Bodily pain; 5) General mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) Limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) Vitality (energy and fatigue); 8) General health perceptions.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Status at Month 6, 12, 18, and 24 or Early Termination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, 12, 18, and 24 or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>Functional status will be assessed by Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). HAQ-DI is a self-administered questionnaire measuring the participant's functional ability. It consists of 20 items converging to 8 scales measuring daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; hygiene; reach; grip; and common daily activities over past week. The participant rate each activity as 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = some difficulty, 2 = much difficulty and 3 = unable. The final score ranges from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Utilization of Health Care Resources at Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 or Early Termination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 or Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>Utilization of Health Care Resources will be measured by the Consumption of Health Care Resources Questionnaire, which includes 8 questions related to the participant's use of health care resources related to RA: 1) Extra or unscheduled visits to the study doctor office/clinic, 2) Visits to another physician/healthcare professional (like nurse, therapist, physiotherapist), 3) Visits to hospital emergency room/ total duration of stay (hours), 4) Use of an ambulance service, 5) Admitted to a hospital/ total duration of stay (hours), 6) Visit to a specialist, 7) Complementary alternative therapy visits, 8) Out of pocket expenses related to RA (for example over-the-counter medication, payments for health care professionals, medical procedures or laboratory tests, medical devices, health care or extra help at home, transportation costs, differences in cost of prescription medication not covered by insurance).</description>
