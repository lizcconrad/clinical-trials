      Rectal toxicity limits dose escalated intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for prostate
      cancer. The dose volume constraints that predict for rectal toxicity require minimizing
      prostate motion and rectum and bladder filling of IMRT .5-15 . The volumetric changes and
      internal organ motion during prostate IMRT increases risk of PSA failure in patients with
      large rectums at the planning CT scans. Patient preparation for IMRT planning is crucial .The
      literature is limited regarding the effectiveness of educational intervention with behavioral
      reinforcement for patients, and a gap if exists literacy level is considered. Patients often
      cannot comprehend verbal or written instructions and have difficulties following through with
      recommended regimens.23 Using multimedia such as Internet, audio-visual media such as DVD and
      even the telephone can enhance patients' knowledge and understanding about importance of
      preparation for IMRT for prostate ca. Thomas's study showed that in patients undergoing
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the video group had lower anxiety scores compared with the non
      video group. At SOCC patients have been provided with verbal information about bladder and
      rectum preparation for prostate planning CT scan and IMRT. Patients should have a &quot;fullish&quot;
      bladder and empty rectum at the time of CT simulation. If the rectal diameter is &gt; 4cm, the
      patient will be asked to empty his stool/gas and re-scanned. The 3- months review of patients
      preparedness for prostate IMRT showed that only 13/55 patients were adequately prepared but
      42/55 (76%) of patients needed to be re-scanned due to inadequate bladder (21/42, 50%) or
      rectum filling 28/42, 67%) . Also, 2/13 (15%) patients were still not prepared at the second
      resimulation despite that they received a phone call with the instructions. The investigators
      plan to investigate if a multimedia education strategy will decrease costly resimulation rate
      for patients with prostate cancer.

    <textblock>
      An estimated 23,600 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in Canada in 2014. This
      represents 24% of all new cancer cases in men in 2014. The SOCC treats 1000 patients with
      prostate cancer annually. Patients who fail to follow instructions for the initial prostate
      planning CT scan need to return to be rescanned at a later date. Additional CTs can increase
      patients' parking and transportation costs and may increase their anxiety. Rescanning may
      also cause stress to radiation therapists due to unsuccessful planning, increase costs to the
      cancer centre for the additional time of radiation therapists and increase the planning CT
      wait time for other patients. Thus improving patients' preparedness for the prostate planning
      CT scan will reduce costs for patients and the hospital, reduce anxiety and stress for both
      patients and practitioners, reduce CT scan wait times, maximize the accuracy of prostate
      IMRT. In a study of 220 patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, Thomas used video
      education and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and found a significant
      correlation between satisfaction and reduced overall treatment related anxiety in the video
      group22.

      Purpose To determine the effectiveness of the introduction of a video on patient preparedness
      for patients receiving a CT Scan for radiotherapy to the prostate.

      Methods The project will consist of three phases: video production, experiment and data
      collection, and analysis and dissemination.

        1. Video production - The investigators will produce the instructional video, test the
           video, and revise based on initial feedback. Christopher Townsend and Sunnybrook Media
           will produce the video using the script written by Agnes Ryzynski, with input from team
           members. The script will highlight the importance of rectal and bladder preparation
           prior and during the planning CT scans. Images will be presented showing both normal and
           abnormal preparation examples, instructing patients how to prepare for the planning CT
           scan. The video will be tested by patients and radiation oncologists, nurses and
           radiation therapists prior to launch.

        2. Experiment and data collection - The investigators will use a control experimental group
           design. The RA will recruit sixty participants at their pre-planning appointment date or
           via telephone. The RA will present the study rationale; those who agree to participate
           will sign the study consent, and be assigned a study entry number. Participants will be
           randomly assigned to either the control group or the experimental group. The sample size
           was calculated based on the observed proportion of patients needed to be rescanned: 0.76
           (42/55). To have a treatment group with a proportion of 0.38 who needed to be rescanned,
           a 50% decrease, the investigators will need at least 25 patients in each group to have a
           power of 0.8, given a 0.05 significance level. To account for study attrition (no more
           than 20% loss of participants), the investigators will require 30 subjects per group to
           observe a large treatment effect (e.g. 50% decreases in the proportion of rescanning).

        3. Data analysis and dissemination - A statistical analysis will be conducted on the
           patient preparedness data. The investigators will conduct quantitative analysis of the
           evaluations form using a Likert scale. Patients' evaluations will also contain open
           ended questions to capture patients' comments about their experiences during the study.
           The investigators will analyze the details about patients' and radiation therapists'
           satisfaction and patients' knowledge about the video content.

      Confidentiality Patient confidentiality will be assured. All patients will have assigned a
      study number and their names will not be disclosed at any time. All study data will be kept
      in a locked cabinet, that only the investigators have access to.

            <description>Patients will receive the standard are to prepare them for their planning CT scan. They will be presented with the flyer that will be developed based on information about the importance of rectal and bladder preparation that is currently provided to patients and will also watch a youtube video on how to prepare for their CT simulation appointment. A few days before the CT planning appointment, patients in this group will be called by the radiation therapist or RA, reminding them about the rectal preparation for the appointment. Each patient will also be reminded to watch the instructional video on YouTube. Patients will be asked not to share the video link with other patients during the study.

A few days before the CT appointment, patients in this group will also be called and reminded about the required preparations, but will not be told about the video. In addition to the statistics about patient preparedness collected by the radiation therapist conducting the CT scan and stored and secured in an OCC Pinnacle planning system, we will also evaluate: patients’ satisfaction with the preparation instructions, their knowledge (knowledge questionnaire) about the video content and importance of understanding the rectal emptying procedures, and radiation therapists’ satisfaction with patients’ rectal preparation.</description>
