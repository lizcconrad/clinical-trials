  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin-Merz Pharmaceuticals) in the tremor of Parkinson‟s disease. Our
      hypothesis is that injection of Xeomin into the muscles of arm, forearm and hand decreases
      the tremor amplitude and frequency leading to improvement of the patient‟s function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross over
      study which is supported by Merz pharmaceuticals. Patients with Parkinson‟s disease (at Yale
      Neurology and Movement disorders clinics) will be approached by the members of the research
      team (PI and sub-investigators) to see if they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and wish
      to participate in the study.

      If eligible and consented to participate in the study, there will be a series of
      questionaires, examinations and treatment sessions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Tremor Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure in this protocol is significant improvement of tremor (equal or over 2 grade improvement) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 4 weeks after Xeomin injection. The score is 0 to 4 , ) being no tremor and 4 severe tremor. The higher the score, the more severe the tremor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients Whose Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Improved</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's pain has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as:
No change (or condition has gotten worse) (1) Almost the same, hardly any change at all (2) A little better, but no noticeable change (3) Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference (4) Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change (5) Better and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference (6) A great deal better and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference (7)improved
This outcome is number of patients who chose a 6 or above on the PGIC 6 weeks after treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients With Significant Improvement in Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Tremor Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the amplitude of the tremor. For instance tremor of more than 4cm oscillation is grade 4. UPDRS tremor scale is 0-4 , 4 being severe tremor. Significant improvement for this protocol considered two grades of improvement .</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to receive the placebo ( saline) will receive an equivalent volume as the active study drug (1cc). The injections will be into -10 hand and forearm muscles. A series of rating scale and an examination will take place prior to treatment and at 4 and 8 weeks post treatment. The subject will then cross over to an Active Intervention arm to receive incobotulinumtoxinA which will be injected in the same pattern as the saline.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome measure in this protocol is significant improvement of tremor (equal or over 2 grade improvement) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 4 weeks after Xeomin injection. The score is 0 to 4 , ) being no tremor and 4 severe tremor. The higher the score, the more severe the tremor.</description>

        <description>The PGIC is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's pain has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as:
No change (or condition has gotten worse) (1) Almost the same, hardly any change at all (2) A little better, but no noticeable change (3) Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference (4) Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change (5) Better and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference (6) A great deal better and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference (7)improved
This outcome is number of patients who chose a 6 or above on the PGIC 6 weeks after treatment.</description>
