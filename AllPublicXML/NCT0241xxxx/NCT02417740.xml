    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Noncirrhotic Portal Hypertension (NCPH) is caused by liver diseases that increase pressure
      in the blood vessels of the liver. It seems to start slowly and not have many warning signs.
      Many people may not even know that they have a liver disease. There are no specific
      treatments for NCPH.

      Objectives:

      - To learn more about how NCPH develops over time.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 12 and older who have NCPH or are at risk for getting it. In the past year, they
      cannot have had other types of liver disease that typically result in cirrhosis, liver
      cancer, or active substance abuse.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have 2 screening visits.

        -  Visit 1: to see if they have or may develop NCPH.

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Urine and stool studies

        -  Abdominal ultrasound

        -  Fibroscan. Sound waves measure liver stiffness.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Visit 2:

        -  Blood tests

        -  Abdominal MRI

        -  Echocardiogram

        -  Questionnaire

        -  Liver blood vessel pressure (hepatic venous portal gradient (HVPG)) measurement. This is
           done with a small tube inserted in a neck vein.

        -  They may have a liver biopsy.

        -  All participants will visit the clinic every 6 months for a history, physical exam, and
           blood tests. They will also repeat some of the screening tests yearly.

        -  Participants with NCPH will also have:

        -  Upper endoscopy test. A tube inserted in the mouth goes through the esophagus and
           stomach.

        -  At least every 2 years: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

        -  At least every 4 years: testing including HVPG measurements and liver biopsy.

        -  Participants without NCPH will also have:

        -  Liver biopsy and HVPG measurements to see if they have NCPH.

        -  Every 2 years: abdominal MRI and stool studies.

        -  The study will last indefinitely.

      Noncirrhotic Portal Hypertension (NCPH) includes a spectrum of chronic liver diseases
      characterized by increased pressure within the portal circulation in the absence of
      cirrhosis. The complications from NCPH are similar to that of cirrhosis induced portal
      hypertension which includes the development of gastrointestinal varices, portal hypertensive
      gastropathy, splenomegaly, sepsis and ascites. However, unlike cirrhosis related portal
      hypertension, NCPH is characterized by well-preserved hepatic synthetic function. With
      increasing recognition both of patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver diseases,
      and mortality due to NCPH, it is clear that the specific mechanism(s) and the natural
      history(s) of noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver disease have yet to be elucidated and
      described. At the Clinical Center of the NIH, various cohorts of patients have been
      identified to be at increased risk for the development of noncirrhotic portal hypertensive
      liver diseases such as those with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), common variable immunodeficiency
      (CVID), Turner s Syndrome (TS) and congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) to name a few. We
      propose to study individuals with NCPH, and those at risk of developing NCPH within these and
      other cohorts of patients known to be at risk for NCPH for an indefinite period of time.
      Through continued evaluation and scientific discovery, our aim is to provide a greater
      understanding of noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver diseases and the different underlying
      biological processes that lead to the development of NCPH. We also aim to further the scant
      existing knowledge regarding the natural history of this disease and the global phenomenon of
      portal hypertension. From the data obtained from this natural history protocol, future
      studies will be planned to evaluate specific hypothesis in specific disease cohorts. Patients
      with diseases known to cause cirrhosis will be excluded. Patients 12 years of age and older
      thought to be at risk for the development of NCPH will undergo preliminary testing which
      includes; History and physical examination, blood, urine and stool tests, radiologic imaging,
      echocardiogram and fibroscan. Adults and minors who are likely to have NCPH will also undergo
      transjugular or percutaneous liver biopsy with transjugular hepatic venous gradient
      measurements and endoscopy. After these evaluations, those without strong evidence of NCPH
      will be asked to return for biannual clinic visits for updated history and physical
      assessments. Those with evidence of NCPH will be followed every six months with additional
      testing that may include imaging and laboratory evaluations. Over time, those individuals
      that develop NCPH will be converted to the intensive characterization and monitoring schemata
      as described in the protocol. All patients with NCPH will undergo preventative screening
      examinations for complications of NCPH. There is no planned treatment for patients with
      existing or newly diagnosed NCPH, as no such treatment currently exists. Treatment for
      complications of NCPH will be offered according to the standard of care with referrals as
      appropriate.
