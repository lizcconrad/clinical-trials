      The study is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, single-dose, three dose
      levels study in healthy Caucasian and Japanese male volunteers.

      Following a 4-week screening period, eligible male subjects will be stratified by ethnic
      group and will be randomized to one of six groups. On dosing day, designated as Day 1, each
      subject will receive single SC injection of study medication according to group allocation
      and will be followed up for a month for safety monitoring.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male volunteers, 18 to 45 years of age (inclusive).

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) 18 to 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) and weighing at least 55 kg.

          3. Subjects in generally good health in the opinion of the investigator as determined by
             medical history, vital signs and a physical examination.

          4. Blood pressure and heart rate within normal limits.

          5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with no clinically significant abnormalities recorded at
             screening visit (up to 28 days before dosing) and on dosing day (before drug
             administration).

          6. Negative HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology tests at screening

          7. No clinically significant abnormalities in complete blood count (CBC), international
             normalized ratio (INR), chemistry lab tests (liver and renal function) and urinalysis
             at screening.

          8. No history of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year of screening. Negative urine
             drugs-of-abuse (DOA) in screening and on admission. Negative breath alcohol on
             admission.

             the vehicle.

          3. Adherence (for whatever reason) to an abnormal diet (including any dietary

             organic, etc.) during the 4 weeks prior to the study, or subjects with recent
             significant change in body weight.

             herbal or dietary supplements within 14 days prior to dosing. Brief use of OTC
             medications for symptomatic relief of pain until 24 hours prior to and 48 hours after
             the study drug administration may be allowed per the discretion of the medical
             monitor.

          5. Subjects who have received any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to study drug
             administration.

          6. Subjects who donated blood or received blood or plasma derivatives in the one month
             preceding signing of consent form.

          7. Systemic corticosteroids other than in replacement doses within the 3 months before
             study entry (temporary adjustment of glucocorticoids, as appropriate, is acceptable)

          8. Anabolic steroids other than gonadal steroid replacement therapy within 2 months
             before study entry

          9. Participation in another clinical trial with drugs within one month of signing of
             consent form (calculated from the previous study's last dosing date).

         10. Subjects with an inability to communicate well with the investigators and clinic staff
             [i.e., language problem (except Japanese speakers), poor mental development or
             impaired cerebral function].

         11. Subjects with any acute medical situation (e.g. acute infection) within 48 hours of
             study start, which is considered of significance by the Principal Investigator. Use of
             investigational products (within 30 days of screening visit).
