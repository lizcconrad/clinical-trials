    <textblock>
      The investigators will study a noninvasive no risk process by which we can quickly screen and
      assess for fasting and non-fasting states in individuals scheduled for routine endoscopy. In
      non-fasting individuals, the risk of a sedation related complication such as aspiration
      increases and often the procedure must be aborted and repeated on another day following more
      prolonged fasting and medication administration. This adds to increased cost and delay to
      patient care.

    <description>using the Aeonose per standard acquisition protocol which spans 15 minutes of which the individuals breaths normally through a sterile disposable mouthpiece with sterile disposable air filters for 10 minutes during signal acquisition while wearing a nose plug. This will be completed in the office setting prior to their endoscopic procedure.
Following their scheduled standard of care endoscopic procedure the patient will be allowed to consume a standardized refreshment (such as juice or soda) prior to discharge from the post procedure area. These refreshments are already provided as standard care. The participant will return to the office setting and repeat the same breath analysis acquisition process that was done prior to the procedure.</description>
