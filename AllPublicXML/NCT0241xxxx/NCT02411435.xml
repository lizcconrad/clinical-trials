  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAB is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment
      and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. RIF, a rifamycin used for
      treatment of tuberculosis (common co-infection in HIV-infected subjects), is a known inducer
      of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and Cytochrome P450 3A4
      (CYP3A4). CAB is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 and UGT1A9, thus a drug interaction between
      CAB and RIF is possible. This study will be a phase I, single-center, open label,
      fixed-sequence cross-over study to compare the single dose PK of CAB oral 30 milligrams (mg)
      when co-administered with RIF 600 mg once daily at steady-state to those of CAB oral 30 mg
      administered alone. Fifteen subjects are planned to be enrolled to obtain 12 evaluable
      subjects for this study.
