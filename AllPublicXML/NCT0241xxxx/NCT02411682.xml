  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) is a major target in the treatment of type 2
      diabetes (T2D). Skipping breakfast has been consistently associated with higher HbA1c and
      overall PPHG in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to explore the effect of
      skipping vs eating breakfast on PPHG after subsequent isocaloric (700kcal) lunch and dinner

    <textblock>
      In type 2 diabetic individuals the omission of breakfast is associated with significant
      increase in HbA1C and all-day postprandial hyperglycemia even without overeating in the
      evening. In contrast, high-energy breakfast and low-energy dinner result in a significant
      reduction of all-day postprandial glycaemia Similarly, 3 months of high-energy breakfast led
      to a 5% reduction in HbA1C levels in type 2 diabetes participants Despite the growing
      evidence showing the beneficial effects of breakfast consumption on overall postprandial
      hyperglycemia and HbA1C levels, very little is known regarding the relationship between
      breakfast skipping and all-day glycemic excursions in type 2 diabetes patients. Therefore, to
      test whether breakfast skipping influences metabolic responses to the following meals in type
      2 diabetes patients during the same day, we explored the postprandial glycemic response to
      identical lunch and dinner meal tests with or without breakfast.
