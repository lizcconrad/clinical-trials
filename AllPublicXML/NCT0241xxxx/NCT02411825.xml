      Primary Objective:

      To assess in healthy adult male subjects:

        -  The tolerability and safety of 21-day repeated subcutaneous (SC) doses of SAR425899
           including two up titration steps.

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of SAR425899 after ascending repeated SC doses in
           plasma.

        -  Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin,
           biomarkers of lipid metabolism and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21).

      To assess in overweight to obese T2DM mellitus patients:

        -  The tolerability and safety after 28-day repeated SC doses of SAR425899 including 2 up
           titration steps.

        -  PK parameters of SAR425899 after ascending repeated SC doses in plasma and urine.

        -  PD effects on fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, incretin
           panel (total and active ghrelin, total peptide YY [PYY], total and active glucagon-like
           peptide -1 [GLP-1], glucagon and total gastric inhibitory polypeptide-1 [GIP]), body
           weight, FGF21, biomarkers of lipid metabolism and HbA1c.
