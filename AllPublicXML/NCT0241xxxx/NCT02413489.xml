  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess overall response rate [ORR, including complete
      response (CR) and partial response (PR)], of daratumumab in participants with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma [a cancer of the lymph nodes (or tissues)-NHL] and to evaluate association between
      ORR and CD38 expression level in order to determine a threshold for CD38 expression level in
      each NHL subtype, above which daratumumab activity is enhanced in participants with relapsed
      or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma.

      This is an open label (everyone knows the study intervention), Phase 2 study to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of daratumumab in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma. The study will have three phases. Screening
      phase, treatment phase, follow-up phase. Participants will receive daratumumab (16 milligram
      per kilogram [mg/kg]) as intravenous infusion approximately 3.5 years. Participants will
      primarily be assessed for overall response rate. Safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    DLBCL and FL cohorts met the pre-specified futility criteria and will not proceed. The MCL
    cohort was terminated due to slow recruitment and aggressive disease.

             defined below: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL): pathologically verified diagnosis of MCL
             based on local pathology report, relapsed or refractory disease after at least 2 prior
             lines of therapy, including at least 1 cycle of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)
             inhibitor therapy and documented progressive disease (PD) during or after BTK
             inhibitor treatment or participants who could not tolerate BTK inhibitor [ie,

             lymphoma (DLBCL): pathologically confirmed diagnosis of non-transformed DLBCL, and
             relapsed or refractory disease; for those participants who have not received HDT/ASCT
             are not eligible for HDT/ASCT due to comorbidities, c) Follicular lymphoma (FL):
             pathologically confirmed diagnosis of FL of Grade 1, 2, or 3a according to World
             Health Organization (WHO) criteria without pathological evidence of transformation,

          -  Participants must have available archival or fresh tumor tissue or both to submit to a
             central laboratory for CD38 assay. Expression of CD38 is measured by
             immunohistochemistry on fresh or archived tumor sample by central assessment using a
             CD38 investigational IHC assay under development: a) Stage 1: participants whose
             tumors are more than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) positive for CD38, b) Stage 2:
             participant has less than (&lt;) 50% CD38+ or greater than (&gt;) 50% CD38+ depending on the
             distribution of CD 38 expression of enrolled participants during Stage 2. The sponsor
             will advise on which eligibility criterion is permitted during the enrollment period

          -  Participant must have an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be practicing a highly effective method of birth
             control consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods
             for participants participating in clinical studies: example, established use of oral,
             injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); barrier methods: condom with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)
             with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository; male partner sterilization (the
             vasectomized partner should be the sole partner for that participant); true abstinence
             (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant)
             during and after the study (3 months after the last dose of any component of the
             treatment regimen)

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 14 days before commencing treatment. Females of reproductive potential must
             commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2
             methods of reliable birth control simultaneously

          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control example, either condom
             with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository,
             and all men must also not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after
             receiving the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen. The exception to
             this restriction is that if the participant's female partner is surgically sterile, a
             second method of birth control is not required

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known central nervous system lymphoma

             that in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor's medical
             monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 2 years)

          -  Participant has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a Forced
             Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than (&lt;) 50% predicted normal. Note that
             FEV1 testing is required for participants suspected of having COPD and participants
             must be excluded if FEV1 &lt;50% b) Participant has known moderate or severe persistent
             asthma within 2 years (see Attachment 4: NHLBI table of asthma severity), or currently
