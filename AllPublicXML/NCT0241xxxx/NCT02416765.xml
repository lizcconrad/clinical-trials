  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial meal glucose control with closed-loop systems (CLS) still needs some
      improvements. In the postprandial period, sensor delay in detecting blood glucose rise after
      a meal together with delays in insulin absorption expose patients to early risk of
      hyperglycemia and then to late-postprandial hypoglycemia. Glucagon infusion in dual-hormone
      CLS has the potential to improve post-meal control as compared to single-hormone CLS allowing
      a better glucose excursion related to a more aggressive insulin infusion while minimizing
      hypoglycemic risk. Several approaches have been tested for the determination of prandial
      boluses during closed-loop operation.

      The objective of this study is to test in outpatient unrestricted settings whether, in the
      context of closed-loop strategy, conventional meal carbohydrate counting could be reduced to
      a simplified qualitative meal size estimation without a significant degradation in overall
      glycemic control in adult patients with type 1 diabetes.

      The investigators hypothesize that in outpatient free-living conditions: 1) Dual-hormone CLS
      with partial boluses is equivalent to dual-hormone CLS with full boluses in terms of mean
      glucose; 2) Single-hormone CLS with partial boluses is equivalent to single-hormone CLS with
      full boluses in terms of mean glucose. Secondary hypothesis are: 3) Dual-hormone CLS with
      partial boluses will decrease time in hypoglycemia compared to single-hormone CLS with
      partial boluses; 4) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses is better than sensor-augmented
      pump therapy in terms of mean glucose; 5) Single-hormone CLS with partial boluses is better
      than sensor-augmented pump therapy in terms of mean glucose.

             inhibitors) if not at a stable dose for 3 months. Otherwise, these medications are
             acceptable and will be kept stable during the entire protocol.

          6. Oral steroids unless patients present a low stable dose (e.g. 10 mg or less of
             prednisone per day or physiological doses, less than 35 mg/day, of hydrocortisone
             Cortef®). Inhale steroids at stable dose in the last month are acceptable.

          7. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator (e.g. unstable
             psychiatric condition).

          8. Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to change pump
             parameters, follow algorithm's suggestions, etc).

          9. Living or planned travel outside Montreal (&gt; 1h of driving) area during closed-loop
