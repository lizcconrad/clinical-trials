  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate PEEP selection in ARDS is still a matter of research. The main objectives of using
      PEEP in ARDS are improvement in oxygenation, lung recruitment at the end of expiration,
      prevention of opening and closing of terminal respiratory units at minimal hemodynamic
      compromise. The challenge is to carry out these objectives in a patient-centered approach
      based on individual characteristic of lung pathophysiology. Recently, it has been proposed to
      set PEEP from the trans-pulmonary end-expiratory pressure. Trans-pulmonary pressure (Ptp) is
      obtained from the difference between airway pressure and measured esophageal pressure (Pes).
      Measured Pes values have been found positive in the supine position in ARDS patients, leading
      to negative values of Ptp. The strategy proposed by Talmor and coworkers is to adjust PEEP up
      to get Ptp between 0 and 10 cm H2O. Whether this strategy improves survival is under
      investigation. Prone position ventilation significantly improves survival in severe ARDS as
      demonstrated by meta-analyses and a recent multicenter randomized controlled trial.

      The purpose of present project is to investigate Ptp at end-expiration in the prone position
      in severe ARDS. The project is centered on the question about what are the values of measured
      Pes in prone position. The hypothesis is that they are lower than in the supine position due
      to the relief of the weight of heart, mediastinum and lung and also to recruitment of dorsal
      lung regions. To investigate this hypothesis, measured Pes, Ptp, end-expiratory lung volume,
      overall lung recruitment (pressure-volume curve), and regional recruitment by using
      electrical impedance tomography. will be assessed in supine then in the prone position across
      two different strategies of PEEP selection, PEEP/FIO2 table and Talmor proposal.

    <measure>Value of the esophageal pressure measured at the end of expiration</measure>
    <time_frame>6.5 hours after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Oesophageal pressure is measured from a balloon inserted into the mid oesophagus at the end of expiration. Its value is subtracted to the airway pressure at the end of expiration leading to trans-pulmonary pressure at the end of expiration (Ptp,ee). The measurements are done first in the supine position. In the standardized condition PEEP is set from a PEEP/FIO2 table and Ptp,ee is measured. In the Talmor approach PEEP is set to obtain Ptp,ee between 0 and 10 cm H2O. The patient is then turned to the prone position. The measurements are repeated in the same way. Then for the rest of the proning session the patient receive either level of PEEP from each strategy. Measurements are repeated at the end of the session.</description>
