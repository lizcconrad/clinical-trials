  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression adversely affects quality of life in COPD patients, associated with higher rate of
      exacerbations, admissions and mortality. However, local prevalence rate of depression in
      geriatric COPD patients remains unknown.

      Though BODE index is superior to FEV1 in prediction of depression in COPD, it is unclear
      which domain of BODE correlates best with depression. Furthermore, with multiple confounding
      factors, it's ambiguous that whether frequent exacerbation is an 'independent' predictor for
      depression among COPD patients.

      The objective of this study is i.) to study the local prevalence rate of depression in
      geriatric COPD patients, ii.) to identify risk factors for depression especially looking at
      the any independent relationship between frequent exacerbations, various domains of BODE
      index and depression.

      This study is a multi-centers, cross-sectional study, conducted in Kwong Wah Hospital and
      Wong Tai Sin Hospital, Hong Kong SAR. Age and comorbidity-matched COPD and control subjects
      were recruited from clinics. Depressive symptoms were measured by a validated Chinese version
      of Geriatric Depression Scale short form (GDS - 15 items) with 2 cut-off points. A score of 8
      or above was considered significant depressive symptoms while the cut off score of 5 or above
      was for patients with mild depressive symptoms. Prevalence rates of depressive symptoms were
      measured in both COPD and control groups. Predictors for depression (GDS = or&gt; 8) were
      determined using univariate and multivariate analysis.
