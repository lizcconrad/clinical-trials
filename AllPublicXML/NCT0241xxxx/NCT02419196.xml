    <textblock>
      Perioperative changes in regional ventilation by pulmonary electrical impedance tomography
      and spirometry will be investigated in patients at risk for postoperative pulmonary
      complications. Those patients undergo abdominal and limb operations. In a pilot study arm
      electrical impedance tomography is tested in patients receiving osteosynthesis of serial rib
      fractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications (Defined as pulmonary infection, pleural effusion,
      atelectasis, pneumothorax, bronchospasm, aspiration pneumonitis or respiratory insufficiency
      subsequent to surgery) increase the morbidity and mortality of surgical patients. Several
      independent factors determined by the patients' characteristics and the operative procedure
      increase the risk for those complications. The postoperative decrease of values measured by
      spirometry, such as the forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one
      second (FEV1), were found in patients after major surgical procedures for several days. The
      postoperative reduction of those measurement can be the result of general functional
      limitations in those patients (e.g. by postoperative pain) or the result of a regional
      postoperative pulmonary complication (e.g. atelectasis, pleural effusion). The method of the
      electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables to visualize the regional ventilation within a
      transversal section of the lung in real time. Studies examining the change of pulmonary EIT
      for several days postoperatively in spontaneously breathing patients are lacking. The aim of
      the present study is to examine perioperative changes in regional ventilation in
      spontaneously breathing patients during their recovery after abdominal and limb surgery.
      Moreover, the association of those changes with expected changes in spirometry is tested.
      Finally, in patients with evident postoperative pulmonary complications the value of
      pulmonary EIT to detect those changes is investigated. The study should improve the knowledge
      about the development of postoperative pulmonary complications and test the scientific and
      clinical value of pulmonary EIT in those spontaneously breathing patients.

      In a group of patients undergoing osteosynthesis of a flail chest, it is tested how regional
      ventilation changes by these operations and whether pulmonary EIT is actually usable in these
      patients.
