      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the additive intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering
      effect of brinzolamide 1%/brimonidine 0.2% (dosed twice per day (BID)) when added to a PGA in
      patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

      This study consists of 2 sequential phases: Screening/Eligibility Phase, which includes a
      Run-in/Washout (Phase I), and Masked Treatment Phase (Phase II). At the Screening Visit,
      subjects will be assigned into one of 3 PGA therapy groups for the duration of the study.
      Subjects previously prescribed TRAVATAN®, XALATAN®, or LUMIGAN® monotherapy with uncontrolled
      IOP will not need a run-in period with PGA.
