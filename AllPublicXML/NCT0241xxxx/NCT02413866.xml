  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether chronic moderate sleep restriction effects
      the amount of body fat and lean mass loss, and calorie expenditure, in individuals who are
      participating in a dietary weight loss program.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to an 8-week program of either restricted diet alone,
      or restricted diet with restricted sleep for 5 days a week. The total expected duration of
      participation is approximately 3 months.

    <description>Participants in this group will be decreasing their caloric intake to approximately 95% of their resting metabolic rate. We will provide one meal for 4 days of the week, and participants will be required to keep an accurate dietary record of all food and drink. Participants assigned to this group will be instructed to keep a fixed sleep schedule based on their own sleep/napping habits.</description>
