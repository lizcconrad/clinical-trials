    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of stereotactic
      body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of the primary tumor in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
      in medically inoperable patients and/or patients who refuse surgery. Standard treatment of
      RCC is surgery. A number of non-surgical treatments of RCC are also available, but are highly
      invasive and are associated with significant side effects. SBRT is a non-invasive,
      non-surgical treatment that requires tumor immobilization and image guidance in order to
      deliver a very precise, high-dose treatment. This trial will assess the use of SBRT to treat
      primary renal tumors by determining the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity. Subjects
      enrolled in this study will then be followed and evaluated for toxicity, serum chemistry,
      complete blood count, and urinalysis. In addition, they will undergo renal scans to assess
      the functionality of their renal tissue.

      There is a need for a non-invasive treatment modality in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients
      who are medically or technically inoperable or refuse surgery. The primary tumor in patients
      with RCC is generally managed surgically or with a non-surgical ablative modality, but there
      is significant toxicity and invasiveness associated with current surgical and percutaneous
      treatment modalities. Stereotactic radiotherapy was first developed to treat brain metastases
      and other intracranial tumors by giving a single high-dose treatment delivered with a
      precision of less than 1 mm. This treatment requires immobilization of the tumor and precise
      imaging to guide the treatment. The brain is particularly amenable to this approach since
      there is no internal brain motion, the skull is easily fixed in position, and excellent
      imaging is available. Recent developments in immobilization and image guidance now permit
      precise tumor targeting of extracranial sites, such as the liver and lung. Stereotactic
      radiotherapy used at extracranial sites is called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).
      Because of the great precision of SBRT, a high dose per treatment is possible. Early work
      evaluating SBRT in primary and metastatic liver and lung tumors has shown excellent results
      in tumor control and toxicity. Based on this, we propose expanding the use of this technique
      to RCC.

      In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for the
      treatment of the primary tumor in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). One goal of this study is to
      establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of renal SBRT by determining the dose-volume
      relationship and toxicity for the kidney when high dose per fraction SBRT is used. In order
      to ensure proper immobilization and tumor localization, the investigators will use abdominal
      compression, 4D CT scanning at the time of simulation, and cone beam CT scanning at the time
      of treatment. The investigators propose to perform Tc-99m glucoheptonate renal scans before
      and after SBRT to assess renal tissue at the periphery of the lesion, as well as baseline and
      follow-up serum chemistry evaluation, creatinine, complete blood count, urinalysis, and
      creatinine clearance.

    <description>A ≥20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the tumor with a minimum increase in the sum of 5 mm (RECIST criteria) or any areas of enhancement on follow up imaging studies is categorized as progression. Time to failure will be from the last date of SBRT to date of local failure or last follow-up.
Local failure will be classified as in field if it occurs within the treated volume or marginal if it occurs at the edge of the treated volume.
Development of a new renal tumor elsewhere in the kidney. This will not be considered a local failure. Time to development of a new tumor elsewhere in the kidney will be from the last date of SBRT to date of the event or last follow-up.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with a primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumor who is inoperable for
             technical (i.e surgical) or medical reasons
