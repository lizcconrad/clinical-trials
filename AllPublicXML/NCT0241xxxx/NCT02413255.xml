  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      of ascending single- and multiple-doses of TAK-020 in healthy participants.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-020. TAK-020 is being tested to find a safe
      and well-tolerated dose. This study will look at the PK characteristics (how the drug acts
      throughout the body) of the drug and safety and tolerability (lab results, vital signs, ECG,
      and side effects) in healthy participants who take TAK-020.

      The study will enroll a total of approximately 128 participants. This study is designed to
      consist of 2 sequential parts: Part 1-a SRD, and Part 2-a MRD. The study population for Part
      1 will consist of 72 participants enrolled into 9 cohorts. Each cohort will have 8 randomized
      participants with 6 receiving a single dose of TAK-020, and 2 receiving matching placebo
      under fasted conditions. In Cohorts 1-9 doses of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 4.4, 8.8, 17.5, 35, 70 and
      105 mg have been evaluated.

      The study population for Part 2 will consist of 56 participants enrolled into 7 cohorts. Each
      cohort will have 8 randomized participants, with 6 participants receiving one dose of TAK-020
      on Day 1 and daily dosing on Days 3-9 of TAK-020, depending on whether washout is required,
      and 2 receiving matching placebo under fasted conditions. In Cohorts 1-4 doses of 3.75, 5.75,
      13 and 25 mg have been evaluated. For Cohorts 5-7, the subsequent dose level is to be
      determined based on data from Part 1 and review of safety, tolerability and PK data from Part
      2 Cohorts 1-4.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 45 days. Participants in Part 1 will make multiple visits
      to the clinic including a period of confinement to the clinic and will be contacted by
      telephone 14 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants
      in Part 2 will make multiple visits to the clinic including a period of confinement to the
      clinic and will be observed at the clinic 17 days after the last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.

          4. The participant has a positive urine drug result for drugs of abuse at Screening or

         15. Vaccination with any live vaccine within 4 weeks of study drug administration.

         16. Participant has a Screening or Check-in (Day -1) abnormal (clinically significant)
             ECG. Entry of any participant with an abnormal (not clinically significant) ECG must

             qualified sub investigator.

         17. Participant has QT interval with Fridericia correction method (QTcF) greater than (&gt;)
             450 millisecond (msec) for men and women or PR outside the range of 120 to 220 msec
             confirmed upon repeat testing within a maximum of 30 minutes, at the Screening Visit
             or Check-in (Day -1).

         18. Participant has abnormal Screening or Day -1 laboratory values that suggest a
             clinically significant underlying disease or participant with the following lab
             abnormalities:

               1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;1.2* the
                  upper limit of normal (ULN).

               2. Positive screen test for drugs of abuse.

               3. Positive blood screen for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
