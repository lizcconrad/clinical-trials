  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares outcomes with regard to the timing of resective surgery after neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in cancer of the esophagus or gastric cardia. Patients are randomised
      to surgery either conventional 4-6 or 10-12 weeks after termination of CRT. The study
      hypothesis is that a longer delay improves histological response and decreases the risk of
      postoperative morbidity and mortality.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically verified adenocarcinoma or SCC of the esophagus or GEJ Siewert type I
             and II.

          -  Tumors should be resectable and without distant metastasis, as assessed after
             completed CRT.

          -  Patients with performance status 0-1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) scale at the pre CRT evaluation and judges to be fit for surgery at the
             pre and post CRT evaluations.

          -  Pre CRT tumor stage: T1N1-3M0, T2N0-3M0, T3N0-3,M0, T4aN0-3,M0

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Completed at least 80% of the planned chemotherapy and at least 90% of the prescribed
             radiotherapy dose within the neoadjuvant CRT schedule according to protocol within a
             period of &lt;36 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant malignant diagnosis (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) &lt;5 years since
             current cancer diagnosis.

          -  Ongoing antitumoral treatment irrespective of time since diagnosis of earlier
             malignancy.

          -  Patients being unable to comply with the protocol for reasons of language or cognitive
             function.

          -  Tumor stage T1N0, T4bNX or TXNXM1.

          -  Carcinoma of the upper third of the esophagus (i.e. cervical and uppermost thoracic)
             for simplicity here defined as upper border of tumor above 22 cm from incisors at
             endoscopy.

          -  Clear radiological signs of tumor progression during CRT on CT-scan after completion
             of CRT. PET is not used in this decision as FDG-activity often increase due to
             radiotherapy induced inflammation.
