      To determine the efficacy of a CBT-I intervention in improving sleep and other quality of
      life outcomes during cancer treatment. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a CBT-I
      intervention among newly diagnosed cancer patients.

      The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial design. Participants will be
      randomized to either a CBTI treatment or a wait list control condition. The intervention is
      SHUTi, a validated web based version of CBTI, which will take place over seven weeks and will
      include a combination of face to face and telephone sessions, and email updates. All
      participants will have a face to face meeting with the doctoral student at enrollment. During
      the intervention period, all participants will be contacted by telephone at week 1, 3, and 6
      to check in and to encourage participant engagement. However, during phone calls with control
      participants, no advice regarding sleep will be given and if participants ask, they will be
      informed that such advice can be provided in a few weeks if they choose to crossover to the
      treatment condition at the end of the study. Participants in SHUTi will additionally be
      provided the the doctoral student's phone number and will be encouraged to contact her if
      they have any questions during the intervention. They will also have the option of setting up
      appointments for face to face meetings during a clinic appointment if they desire additional
      therapist guidance. Pretreatment, all participants will complete a two week sleep diary and
      multiple self report measures. At the end of the intervention, all participants will complete
      a two week sleep diary and multiple self report measures again.

    <description>SHUTi program is made up of six, weekly treatment Cores modeled after weekly facetoface(CBTI). Each Core begins by providing a rationale for learning the material, explains main content, homework page with suggestions for improving sleep, and a summarized review of main points. The main content each Core addresses myths about sleep, indepth information about topics, vignettes, and quizzes to evaluate users learning in an interactive. As well as being interactive, SHUTi allows for personalization.Modifications are made to sleep recommendations based in sleep diary data and individually set treatment goals. The cores include Overview, Sleep Behavior Core, Sleep Behavior Core 2, Sleep Education Core, Sleep Thoughts Core, and Problem Prevention Core. Each Core takes approximately 45 to 60 minutes to complete. Cores are presented one at a time; next Core becomes available to users a week after they complete one Core.</description>
