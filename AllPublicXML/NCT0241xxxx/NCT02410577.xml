  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new imaging agent called 89Zr-J591 (stands for
      humanized antibody called J591, that is attached to a radioactive material called
      Zirconium-89) in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

    <description>Patients will not be required to fast prior to imaging with 89Zr-J591 injection or imaging. The total dose of humanized mAb J591 will be 20mg. Patients will first receive an injection of 18-19mg of unchelated J591 to reach the total administered dose of antibody (IND11407) followed by 5 mCi (+/- 10%) of 89Zr-J591 (1 to 2 mg). Administration of the cold antibody will be followed by the labeled compound.</description>

    <description>The intervention is the administration of an injection of 18-19mg of unchelated J591 to reach the total administered dose of antibody followed by 5 mCi (+/- 10%) of 89Zr-J591 (1 to 2 mg) . After administration of the experimental tracer, the patient will undergo a Brain PET/CT scan 24 hours, 48 hours post injection and 3-8 days. The 48 hour scan is strongly suggested, but optional.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient age &gt; 25 years old and &lt; 80 years old

          -  Patients with reoccurrence of brain tumor

          -  The principal investigator or co-PI must review MRI and CT findings based on the
             radiologic assessment provided they meet the following imaging criteria (as
             established in the clinical trial 09-177):

        OR

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed GBM and one of the following options:

          -  Eligible for surgery after the last research scan.

          -  Significant residual disease after initial surgery

          -  The principal investigator or co-PI must review MRI and CT findings and agree with the
             presence of significant residual disease

          -  Treatment (non-surgical) naïve

          -  Karnofsky Performance Score ≥ 70

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Laboratory values:

               -  Serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL.

               -  AST (SGOT) &gt;2.5x ULN.

               -  Bilirubin (total) &gt;1.5x ULN.

               -  Serum calcium &gt;11 mg/dL.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding (if a female is of childbearing potential, and unsure of
             pregnancy status, a standard pregnancy test should be done).

          -  If an initial biopsy demonstrates neoplasm other than GBM

          -  Presence of any other co-existing condition which, in the judgment of the
             investigator, might increase the risk to the subject.

          -  Presence of serious systemic illness, including: uncontrolled inter-current infection,
             uncontrolled malignancy, significant renal disease, or psychiatric/social situations,
             which might limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Prior treatment.

          -  Other serious illness (es), which might preclude completion of this, study or
             interfere with determination of causality of any adverse effects experienced in this
             study.
