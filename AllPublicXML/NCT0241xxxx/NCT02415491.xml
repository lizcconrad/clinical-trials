      Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the heart at rest and stress conditions relative to the
      cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in young adults after neonatal surgery for transposition of
      the great arteries.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After ASO obstruction of the transposed coronary arteries with resulting reduced perfusion of
      the heart at stress or abnormities of the right ventricular blood flow resulting in
      increasing heart rate as well as abnormities in pulmonary flow can appear. In this single
      centre trial a large homogeneous group of young adults after surgery for transposition of the
      great arteries (TGA), the so called artery switch operation (ASO), will undergo magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart at rest and under drug- induced stress to receive data
      of the functional status of the heart and its perfusion as well as data of the pulmonary
      arterial perfusion.

      Also obstruction of the pulmonary arteries will lead to reduced perfusion and cardiopulmonary
      exercise capacity.

      Therefore the MRI data will be compared to cardiopulmonary exercise capacity data determined
      by cardio pulmonary stress test (CPX) concerning the feasibility of a correlation of the data
      and possible generalisation of the results leading to long term assessment of coronary
      perfusion and myocardial status after ASO for recommendations of physical activity of the
      young adults.
