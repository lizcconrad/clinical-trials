    <textblock>
      Open-label combined two-part multi-center clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety,
      and tolerabillity of blinatumomab in adult and pediatric Japanese subjects with R/R
      B-precursor ALL.

      The Phase 1b part will investigate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of blinatumomab in adult
      Japanse subects with R/R B-precursor ALL to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) in
      both adult and pediatric subjects. Once a dose has been selected in the Phase 1b part, the
      Phase 2 part will assess the safety and efficacy of the recommeded dose level of blinatumomab
      identified in the Phase 1b portion of the study in the adult study population.

      The protocol was amended to extend the study. Adult and pediatric subjects in the expansion
      cohort may receive up to 5 cycles of investigational blinatomumab and may receive commercial
      blinatomumab after a minimum of 2 cycles of the investigational drug. The secondary endpoint
      of complete remission/partial hematological remission (CR/CRh*) versus CR was specified, for
      clarity, throughout the protocol, and the comparable endpoint in pediatric subjects, M1
      remission, was specified to align with the Statistical Analysis Plan.

    <description>Blinatumomab is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI). A cycle = 6 weeks (4 weeks of blinatumomab treatment, 2-week treatment-free) . Each cohort in the study will receive a combination of 2 dose levels. In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab will be the lower assigned dose level (Days 1-7), then escalated (dose step) to the higher assigned dose (Days 8-29). For all subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle and continuing through consolidation and maintenance, for applicable subjects) the higher assigned dose level will be the dose for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment.</description>
