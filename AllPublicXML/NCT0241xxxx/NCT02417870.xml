             procedure, it would be performed as part of the patient's SOC)

          -  Ability to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven acute cellular rejection; greater than grade 1A

          -  Patients who are unable to give consent

          -  Prior intolerance of/allergy to IL2

          -  Inability to comply with treatment

          -  History of thrombotic angiopathy including hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic
             thrombocytopenic purpura

          -  Symptomatic congestive cardiac failure or uncontrolled cardiac angina

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to
             the start of study drug.

          -  WOCBP and male subjects with reproductive potential must agree to use a highly
             effective method of birth control [defined in protocol &amp; ICF] during study treatment,
             and for 6 months after completion of treatment.
