  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies ibrutinib to see how well it works in treating patients with
      systemic (affecting the entire body) mastocytosis that has spread to other parts of the body
      and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Systemic mastocytosis is
      a disease in which too many mast cells (a type of immune system cell) are found throughout
      the body. Mast cells give off chemicals such as histamine that can cause flushing (a hot, red
      face), itching, abdominal cramps, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood
      pressure, and shock. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of mast cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate to ibrutinib in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis
      (SM) (aggressive systemic mastocytosis [ASM] or mast cell leukemia [MCL], or SM-associated
      hematologic non-mast cell disorder [AHNMD]) by the end of 6 cycles (6 months).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with advanced SM.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ibrutinib in a subset of patients with
      advanced SM.

      III. To evaluate changes in histopathology (blood and bone marrow) of patients with advanced
      SM in response to ibrutinib therapy.

      IV. To evaluate changes in mastocytosis related symptom scores and quality-of-life (QOL)
      using a modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPNSAF).

      V. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) and time to response (TTR). VI. To evaluate
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving an unconfirmed or confirmed clinical improvement (CI), partial response
      (PR), or complete response (CR) by the end of course 6 will be permitted to continue
      maintenance courses of ibrutinib on an ongoing basis until loss of response/progressive
      disease, or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
