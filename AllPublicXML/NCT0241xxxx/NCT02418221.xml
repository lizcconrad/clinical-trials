  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to define a provocation test for histamine intolerance (aka. biogenic amine
      intolerance syndrome) and test the capability of an oral enzyme supplementation to ameliorate
      this condition.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical picture of the so-called histamine intolerance has been described by various
      authors since the 1990ies. However, the existence of this multifactorial condition is also
      being contested due to the lack of both a positive definition and unambiguous diagnostics.
      Various provocation studies using pure histamine or histamine-containing foods support the
      existence of the disease pattern, however many questions still remain open.

      A lack of diamine oxidase (DAO) is considered the etiological cause of the condition. DAO is
      an enzyme known to degrade a wide array of biogenic amines. The aim of this study is to
      provoke a response in patients by oral administration of a defined mixture of biogenic
      amines. By administration of DAO before provocation an attenuation of the symptoms is to be
      expected.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction of biogenic amine symptoms (determined via symptom score)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hrs after start of provocation</time_frame>
    <description>The primary parameter is the reduction of clinical symptoms caused by the ingestion of biogenic amines by the preventive oral administration of DAOSiN®. A symptom score quantifying the subjective single symptoms is used as measuring parameter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serological parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 min after provocation</time_frame>
    <description>These parameters are ascertained: DAO activity and concentration of histamine in serum; blood pressure &amp; pulse measurement before and 30/60/90 min post provocation</description>

    <description>A sample of blood is drawn from Patient, blood pressure &amp; pulse are recorded. Patient will ingest 2 capsules of either DAOSiN® or Placebo, followed by 2 tablets of ProvokAmin 20 minutes later. After an additional 40 minutes blood pressure and pulse are recorded and another sample of blood is drawn. Patient is handed a questionaire for self-evaluation to record any symptoms for the following After between 7 and 15 days the whole cycle is repeated switching between active treatment and Placebo.</description>
