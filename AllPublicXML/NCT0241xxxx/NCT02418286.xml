    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this trial is to define the characteristics of the in/outpatients with low
      back pain in traditional Korean medicine rehabilitation clinic. This information will create
      a registry that will help us to compare similarities and differences in patients and their
      symptoms. The more patients the investigators are able to enter into the registry, the more
      the investigators will be able to understand the low back pain and learn better ways of
      caring for patients.

      KLOS, prospective, multi-center, patient registry pilot study will collaborate with 7 Korean
      medicine hospitals and plan to recruit low back pain patients into the registry. 150 eligible
      patients with new episode of LBP who visit Korean medicine hospital without any other
      treatment history will enroll to the registry. After enrollment, study collect the individual
      characteristics of patient's status such as pain intensity, LBP related daily disability,
      anthropometrics, HRQoL at baseline, 30 and 90 days. We also access to the patient's clinical
      and administrative electronic records to analyze the pattern of patients' resource
      utilization. Overall, the aims of KLOS are to: 1) explore the general characteristics of new
      episode of LBP patients and; 2) evaluate the efficacy and safety of various Korean medicine
      treatments on low back pain based on nationwide registry outcome collecting process.
