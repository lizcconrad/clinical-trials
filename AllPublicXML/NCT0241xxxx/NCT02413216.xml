    <textblock>
      Tic Disorders (including Tourette Disorder) are relatively common in school-age children and
      for some children can lead to significant psychosocial and physical impairment and diminished
      quality of life. Non-pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective for reducing
      tics in some children. These treatment options are desired by parents, but are not widely
      available. The investigators recently developed an online, computerized, self-administered
      version of CBIT called TicHelper.com. The current study will test the efficacy of
      TicHelper.com in a randomized clinical trial.

      Effective non-pharmacological treatment options such as comprehensive behavioral intervention
      for tics (CBIT) have been shown to be effective for reducing tics in some children with
      chronic tic disorders, including Tourette's disorder. Although effective, many parents and
      children do not have access to a provider trained in these therapies and practical barriers
      such as travel and high costs for ongoing therapy limit treatment dissemination and
      utilization.The investigators recently developed an online, computerized, self-administered
      version of CBIT called TicHelper.com. This program is an 8-week online program designed to
      teach children and families empirically-supported tic management skills. The current study
      will test the efficacy of TicHelper.com in a randomized clinical trial in which 64 children
      with Tourette's Disorder or a persistent (chronic) tic disorder will be randomly assigned to
      8-weeks of TicHelper.com (N=32) or an 8-week internet resource control condition (N=32). Tic
      symptoms will be assessed by a condition-blind independent evaluator at baseline,
      post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. Information regarding patient acceptability of the
      program will also be collected. This project will test whether TicHelper.com is an
      efficacious and acceptable way to teach tic-management skills for children with tics.

    <description>In this condition, participants will be provided with a secure username and login information for TicHelper.com. Participants will be asked to log in and use TicHelper.com for 8 weeks as instructed by the program (TicHelper recommends 30-60 minutes of website and therapeutic activity per day). TicHelper.com consists of 3 modules: Education, Assessment, and Intervention. The education module provides information about tic disorders and treatment. The assessment module tracks progress through the program. The intervention module uses interactive activities to teach tic management skills including habit reversal training (HRT). During HRT, patients learn to become more aware of tics and pre-tic sensations and to subsequently interrupt tics. Participants will also learn ways to interact with each other regarding tics, to identify and alter tic-worsening factors, and relaxation strategies to reduce stress.</description>

    <description>Participants who are assigned to the Internet-Based Resources (IBR) condition will receive a collection of materials with inks to the best available online resources about tic disorders and their treatment. The sites that are provided use a variety of online print, video, and animation materials to teach patients about various aspects of chronic tic disorders and their management. Participants will will be asked to explore and use the website information over the course of 8 weeks in any manner they find helpful. Participants will be asked to spend 30-60 minutes per day reviewing and discussing the information provided.</description>

    <description>TicHelper.com is an 8-week online program designed to teach tic management skills. Content and activities included in TicHelper.com are based on existing empirically-supported treatments including Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT). TicHelper.com is designed to teach tic management skills including psychoeducation, relaxation training, awareness training, competing response training, and social support. It is also designed to teach patients/parents to recognize and reduce tic-exacerbating reactions and activities.</description>
