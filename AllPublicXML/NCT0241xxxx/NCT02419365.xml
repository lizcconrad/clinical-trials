    <textblock>
      The purpose of the international prospective PCD Patient Registry is to systematically
      measure, survey and compare different aspects of PCD manifestation, course and treatment, to
      provide data for epidemiological research and to identify special patient groups suitable for
      multi-center trials.

      Main objective is to establish an international prospective registry for Primary Ciliary
      Dyskinesia (PCD) for systematic data collection on incidence, clinical presentation,
      treatment and course of the disease.This will allow to monitor trends in diagnosis,
      management and outcomes and will show how efforts to improve diagnosis and treatments will
      change clinical practice and long-term outcomes.

    <description>Descriptive statistical methods, i.e. frequency tables, location and scale statistics and graphical presentations will be applied to analyse: age at diagnosis, family history (consanguinity), associated malformations/diseases, laterality defects, clinical manifestations (otitis media, rhinosinusitis, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome), microbiological results, diagnostic findings (video microscopy, electron microscopy, nasal NO, immunofluorescence analysis), lung function, radiological findings and therapeutic measures (inhalation therapy, antibiotics, oxygen, ventilation, upper airways surgery, lung surgery). Furthermore, quality of life will be assessed using QOL-PCD, a disease specific questionnaire.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients of any age who fulfil the diagnostic criteria below are eligible:

        Clinical presentation consistent with PCD and consistent findings specific for PCD in at
        least two of the following methods:

        high frequency video microscopic finding transmission electron microscopy finding
        immunofluorescence finding low nasal NO concentration/production demonstration of biallelic
        disease-causing mutations by genotyping

        Given the complexity of diagnosing PCD, it is anticipated that not all patients will meet
        these definite diagnostic criteria. Therefore, individuals with typical clinical symptoms
        and only one abnormal diagnostic test are also eligible to enter the registry. These cases
        usually are considered to have a possible PCD diagnosis with exceptions made on an
        individual basis.

        Exclusion Criteria Failure or unwillingness to give written informed consent. Missing
        qualification to perform legal acts or insufficient cognitive ability to give informed
        consent. A second disease is no exclusion criteria for including data in the PCD-Registry,
        especially since it is one of the fundamental goals, to learn about co-morbidities.
