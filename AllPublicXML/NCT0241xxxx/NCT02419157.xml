      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of non-carious cervical
      lesions (NCCLs) restored with two self-etching adhesive systems: Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray
      Noritake, Japan) and Xeno V + (Dentsply De Trey, Germany) applied with or without 36%
      phosphoric acid enamel etching. Assessments were at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of
      clinical service.

    <description>CSE-E (n=28): After shade selection, teeth were restored under relative isolation. Lesions were cleaned with pumice and water in a rubber cup followed by rinsing and drying. An enamel bevel of 1-2 mm was prepared with a diamond bur operated in a high-speed handpiece under air-water spray. Enamel margins were selectively etched with 36% phosphoric acid for 15s and subsequently thoroughly rinsed and air-dried. Adhesive system was applied according to manufacturers' instructions and light-cured with an LED for 10s. NCCLs were restored incrementally with a microhybrid composite resin. Increments were light cured for 20s. Afterwards, retraction cord was removed and finishing and polishing were performed with rubber points.
