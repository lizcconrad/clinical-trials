  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate colorimetric changes and tooth sensitivity in
      young patients submitted to tooth bleaching with 20% and 35% hydrogen peroxide.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted with 53 patients aged 11 to 24 years
      who were allocated to groups based on the use of the following commercial products: Whiteness
      HP - FGM® (35% hydrogen peroxide); Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM® (35% hydrogen peroxide);
      and Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM® (20% hydrogen peroxide).

      After the bleaching procedure, the visual analog scale was used to measure tooth sensitivity
      and the classic Vita® scale was used to determine changes in tooth color.

      Statistical analysis involved the Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis and Student-Newman-Keuls tests,
      with p-value ≤ 0.05 or ≤ 0.0001 considered indicative of statistical significance.

    <description>the initial tooth color was determined with the aid of the classic Vita® scale. Tooth color was recorded 48 hours after each session to determine the difference in tone before and after the procedures.
It will be carried out in all groups at the following times: pre-treatment period, 48 hours following each session, after six months, after 12 months, after 18 months.</description>

    <description>Prophylaxis was performed with a jet of sodium bicarbonate to remove extrinsic pigments and plaque.
Each patient underwent two bleaching sessions. A lip retractor (Arc Flex, FGM®) was placed. Cotton roles or gauze compresses were used to achieve relative isolation. A dental dam (Top Dam, FGM®) was placed over the free marginal gingival tissue and the inter-tooth papillae of teeth 14 to 24 in each session. The Whiteness HP 35% gel was applied to the vestibular faces of these teeth.
In the present study, the Whiteness HP 35% gel was applied without an external auxiliary source. As this is not a self-catalyzed system, the gel was removed after each 15-minute application and reapplied two more times, totaling 45 minutes of contact with the teeth.</description>
