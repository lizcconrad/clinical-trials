  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer (EC) is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer
      deaths worldwide. Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is regarded as a safe and effective
      management for resectable EC. Gastric tube is considered to be an ideal substitute for the
      resected esophagus, and used for cervical esophagogastric anastomoses for digestive tract
      reconstruction in MIE. However, the tension at the anastomosed area can not be ignored and
      may cause cervical anastomotic leakage (CAL) in some cases. Continuous neck flexion is a
      standard post-operative posture after tracheal resection and reconstruction, and aimed to
      relieve the anastomotic tension. In this study, the investigators attempt to adopt the
      maneuver in MIE, and observe its effect on relieving the anastomotic tension and decreasing
      the incidence of CAL.

      After the cervical esophagogastric anastomoses is completed and the skin incision is closed,
      the patient's occiput will be lifted, and then the neck will be maintained in flexing
      position by an assistant. The underside of the chin will be fixed to the anterior chest wall
      with two stout nylon sutures by the surgeon. The neck will be fixed in the neutral flexing
      position for 7 to 10 days after surgery.
