    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness (Phase II) of a text-based program
      to be called Quit4Baby to support smoking cessation efforts of pregnant women who smoke.

      In Phase II, Dr. Abroms will conduct a randomized clinical trial among 500 pregnant smokers
      who have been recruited from users of text4baby - the first large scale mobile health
      application in the United States. Developed and operated by Voxiva and Healthy Mothers,
      Healthy Babies (HMHB)â€”collaborators in this program -text4baby is a free national service
      that has enrolled more than 800,000 pregnant women and mothers of infants 0-1 nationwide and
      delivered more than 150 million health messages to them including messages encouraging them
      not to smoke during pregnancy and referring them to quit lines.

      Hypothesis 1: Pregnant smokers who receive quit4Baby + text4Baby will demonstrate higher
      levels of knowledge about the dangers of second hand smoke and the benefits of smoking
      cessation for mothers and their infants than text4baby only users.

      Hypothesis 2: Pregnant smokers who receive quit4baby + text4baby will report significantly
      higher rates of calling a quit line, discussions with their health provider and/or use of
      cessation counseling than those who receive Text4baby alone.

      Hypothesis 3: Pregnant smokers who receive quit4baby + text4baby will have significantly more
      favorable quitting outcomes compared with text4baby alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subscribe to the text4baby test messaging program

          2. Pregnant

          3. Smoke or recently quit (within last 2 weeks)- Smoking will be defined as self-report
             of smoking at least one cigarette in the past 7 days. Given that these individuals are
             recruited from text4baby users, we are confident that they will have cell phones and
             text messaging capacity.

          4. Speak English

          5. Willing to enroll in our study
