    <textblock>
      A common source of morbidity after IHR is chronic groin pain(CGP), usually defined as pain
      lasting longer than 3 months. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that is also of benefit in the
      treatment of neuropathic pain. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      study of the effect of gabapentin on CGP after IHR. Their pain will be assessed with a visual
      analogue scale. For those reporting pain, the need for pain medication, or other treatment,
      and the effect of pain on their quality of life will be recorded.

    <textblock>
      Over 500,000 inguinal hernia repairs(IHR) are performed in the United States annually. This
      is also one of the most common operations performed on the primarily young, male Active Duty
      population. A common source of morbidity after IHR is chronic groin pain(CGP), usually
      defined as pain lasting longer than 3 months. The incidence of CGP varies widely in published
      reports, but in the majority it is 25 to 30%. A major etiology of CGP is thought to be injury
      to inguinal nerves during surgery. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that is also of benefit in
      the treatment of neuropathic pain. Numerous studies have shown that gabapentin can decrease
      perioperative pain in patients undergoing surgeries such as hysterectomy, cholecystectomy and
      spine surgery. Doses and medication regimens varied in these studies, One study in patients
      undergoing IHR who received a single dose of gabapentin preoperatively, showed a decrease in
      postoperative pain and in reported pain scores in the first 6 months. We propose a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of the effect of gabapentin on CGP after
      IHR. Patients will be given placebo or gabapentin. Those given gabapentin, will be given 300
      mg orally three times daily for a total of six doses with the first dose given on the morning
      of surgery. Patients will be evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after
      surgery. Their pain will be assessed with a visual analogue scale. For those reporting pain,
      the need for pain medication, or other treatment, and the effect of pain on their quality of
      life will be recorded.

    <description>Gabapentin is a structural analogue of GABA that decreases activation of voltage-activated calcium channels which may decrease release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Its analgesic mechanisms have been utilized effectively for the treatment of chronic pain in several disorders such as cancer, fibromyalgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</description>
