      Evaluation of &quot;UroShield&quot; device impact upon side effects and complications of urinary
      catheter usage.

      The use of urinary catheters is a common medical practice in the perioperative setting.

      As such, it exposes the patient to certain comorbidities, including urinary tract infections.

      The infectious process is known to begin with a development of a biofilm on the catheter's
      surface. This fact makes it an attractive target for UTI prevention technology.

      Ultrasound waves were shown to reduce biofilm buildup in-vitro. We plan to determine the
      efficacy of this method in vivo.
