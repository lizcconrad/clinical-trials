  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, active comparator
      trial to evaluate BI 695500 versus rituximab as a first-line immunotherapy treatment in
      patients with LTBFL. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 375 mg/m2
      of BI 695500 or rituximab via intravenous (IV) infusion once a week for 4 weeks (total of 4
      dosages administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Disease assessments will be performed at the
      End of Study (EOS) Visit at Week 30.

    <description>The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate statistical equivalence of efficacy as assessed by Overall Response (measured as Overall Response Rate (ORR)) at Week 30 for treatment with BI 695500 versus rituximab (Rituxan®) in patients with untreated low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL).
The overall response measured as Overall Response Rate (ORR), which is the completed response (CR) and the partial response (PR) at Week 30, approximately 26 weeks after the completion of study treatment, as defined by International Working Group (IWG) criteria 2007 via an independent radiology assessment.
Two patient were randomized and treated with BI 695500, whereas no patient was treated with rituximab in this trial.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

Two patients were randomised to BI 695500, thus no patient was treated with rituximab in this trial.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Subjects attended specialist sites which would then ensure that the subject met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        <description>The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate statistical equivalence of efficacy as assessed by Overall Response (measured as Overall Response Rate (ORR)) at Week 30 for treatment with BI 695500 versus rituximab (Rituxan®) in patients with untreated low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL).
The overall response measured as Overall Response Rate (ORR), which is the completed response (CR) and the partial response (PR) at Week 30, approximately 26 weeks after the completion of study treatment, as defined by International Working Group (IWG) criteria 2007 via an independent radiology assessment.
