      The primary objective of this study is to assess the blood levels of Coenzyme Q10 in healthy
      subjects when administered Omega Q Plus® Resveratrol for 28 days.The secondary objective of
      the study is to determine if statin use has an impact on the blood levels of Coenzyme Q10
      when administered Omega Q Plus® Resveratrol for 28 days. The safety objectives will include
      assessment of safety evaluations as determined by:

        -  laboratory tests - CBC, electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), glucose, creatinine, AST, ALT, GGT,
           and bilirubin

        -  vital signs - heart rate and blood pressure

        -  adverse events
