    <textblock>
      This is a phase II feasibility, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy study of an
      e-Health application versus in-person nutritional counseling to maintain or increase weight
      in patients with neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Primary Objectives include the
      feasibility, safety, tolerability and efficacy of an e-Health application to maintain or
      increase body weight compared to in-person nutritional counseling. Secondary Objectives are
      to measure the number of calories required to maintain or increase body weight in
      neurodegenerative diseases at all stages of the disease. Tertiary Objectives are to test the
      effects of an e-Health application compared to in-person nutritional counseling on disease
      progression using the ALSFRS-R, UHDRS or UDysRS, on survival, and on quality of life using
      the PROMIS SF v1.1 scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open-label, placebo controlled, parallel group study.
      The study treatment period is approximately 6 months and observation period is approximately
      7 months. There are three parallel treatment groups: in-person nutritional counseling,
      nutritional counseling using an e-Health App, and standard care. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization scheme. Subjects in the
      two intervention arms will be given caloric recommendations designed to cause weight
      stability or modest weight gain, depending on their current BMI and weight loss history. All
      participants in the intervention arms will receive counseling either in-person or remotely
      through the App by registered dietitians (RD) working in the Bionutrition department of the
      Clinical Research Center at MGH. At MGH, approximately 150 ALS subjects (50 per treatment
      group) will be enrolled. Approximately 75-150 PD and HD subjects will enroll.
