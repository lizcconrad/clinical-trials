  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I and II clinical study for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (a
      type of cancer affecting the lining of the lung). Patients will receive an infusion (given by
      vein) of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). TILs are a type of white blood
      cells that recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down.

      Prior to the cell infusion, patients will receive a two drugs cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine to prepare the body to receive the TILs. After cell infusion, patients will
      receive low-dose interleukin-2 therapy. This study will see how safe and useful this regimen
      is in treating malignant pleural mesothelioma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to sign and date the informed consent form.

          -  Must have measurable stage I-IV malignant pleural mesothelioma at the time of
             investigational treatment.

          -  May have 3 or fewer asymptomatic brain metastases.

          -  Patient age: â‰¥ 18 years.

          -  Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months from the date of consent.

          -  Laboratory analyses of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from the patient must
             demonstrate that the TILs are suitable for use in protocol treatment

          -  More than 30 days has elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time of the cell
             infusion, or more than six weeks since prior nitrosurea therapy. All toxicities must
             have recovered to a grade 1 or less. Patients may have undergone minor surgical
             procedures with the past 3 weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1
             or less

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. Patients of both
             genders must be willing to practice birth control during treatment and for 6 months
             post completion of IL-2 treatment.

          -  Patients must have adequate respiratory function in the opinion of the treating
             thoracic physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing or prior use systemic steroid therapy within 4 weeks before the TILs infusion
             will be excluded.

          -  Known HIV positive patients will be excluded.

          -  Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C, syphilis, or HTLV will be excluded.

          -  Must not have any active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active
             major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system,
             uncontrolled psychiatric disorders, or other conditions that may affect compliance
             with the trial.

          -  Must have no active underlying cardiac illnesses defined by positive stress test, LVEF
             &lt;40% or ongoing life threatening arrhythmias.
