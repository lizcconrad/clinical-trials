    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to record the use of the medical device EEVA™ (Early Embryo
      Viability Assessment) by comparing the rate of implantation of transferred embryos selected
      using the scores from the device EEVA™ plus morphology grading versus transferred embryos
      selected using the morphology grading only.
