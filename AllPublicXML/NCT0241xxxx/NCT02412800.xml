  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative acute lung injury (ALI) during the first 72 hours after liver transplantation
      is not uncommon. Injury may occur because liver transplantation is often associated with
      prolonged operative time, large volumes of fluid administration and transfusion, as well as
      inflammatory responses related to ischemia-reperfusion injury. For more precise perioperative
      fluid and hemodynamic management, modern monitoring systems, such as the pulse contour
      cardiac output (PiCCO) system, have been devised and reported in recent years. The PiCCO
      system uses the thermodilution technique to determine the cardiac index (CI) and thoracic
      fluid indices such as the intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI), extravascular lung water
      index (EVLWI), and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI), all of which may reflect
      pulmonary fluid and injury status. However, perioperative changes in thoracic fluid indices
      in liver transplantation and their associations with postoperative ALI are not yet clear. In
      this study, the investigators aimed to determine patterns of change in perioperative thoracic
      fluid indices and compare these changes in recipients who did or did not develop
      postoperative ALI. Furthermore, the investigators will also try to determine the potential
      risk factors following liver transplantation.
