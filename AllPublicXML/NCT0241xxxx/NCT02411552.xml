      This initiative is a prospective study evaluating the effects of implementing physical
      activity strategies in Wisconsin schools with low socioeconomic status on childhood fitness.
      Forty-nine schools participated in the study providing de-identified fitness data for
      students for 3 consecutive years. Twenty-five schools initiated physical activity
      interventions in year one and 24 schools initiating physical activity interventions in year
      two.
