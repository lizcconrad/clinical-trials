  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to complete the development of a patient-centered software system
      and mobile app to assist in managing bipolar disorder. In Phase I, the investigators
      developed a novel computational tool known as KIOS. Based on concepts from nonlinear systems
      (chaos) theory, KIOS tracks multiple interacting symptoms to determine the precise state of a
      BD patient. Once the patient's state is identified and the trajectory of the patient is
      established, KIOS produces advice specific to the patient's condition to help manage the
      course of the disease. To demonstrate the usability of the software, KIOS was converted to an
      online tool with mobile access. Twenty bipolar patients evaluated KIOS in a twelve week field
      trial. No technical problems with the software were observed and results showed that patients
      had significantly more reductions in symptom severity than increases. The development of this
      innovative tool to help patients self- manage BD has the potential to have a profound impact
      on public health and achieve significant commercial success.

    <textblock>
      This Phase II study has the specific aim of evaluation of KIOS-Bipolar in a randomized, open
      52 week effectiveness study of 120 bipolar subjects in current treatment at three
      socioeconomically diverse academic health science centers. Concurrent with this clinical
      effectiveness study, the research team, funded by the same NIH grant,will refine prototype
      software and integrate data security and establish quality standards into the KIOS-Bipolar
      system.

      The clinical trial will:

        1. Assess aggregate time spent in seven primary clinical states of BD (remitted;
           subsyndromal depression, mania or mixed state; and syndromal depression, mania or mixed
           state).

        2. Assess the weekly completion of KIOS-Bipolar and eMoods.

        3. Determine indices of patient satisfaction with the format, ease of use, time required
           and patient motivation for continuing use of the patient tools both during the trial and
           following completion.

        4. Determine patient satisfaction with the clinical information on BD illness trajectory
           and recommendations to facilitate good health and effective interventions. Note that
           eMoods does not provide this element of information, therefore no comparative data will
           be feasible for this one objective.

        5. Assess patient scored life function indices (Life Function Questionnaire (LFQ) over the
           52 week period of the study.

        6. Assess the relationship between the 8 symptom items in K-B with relevant items rated
           both by clinicians and as self-assessments by patients at four time points (week 0, 8,
           16 and 52) in the study. These are times at which clinical care visits will routinely
           occur, and therefore will not add either to extra burden on the participants, or extra
           contact time with staff. Subjects randomized to eMoods will be similarly scheduled, with
           the correlations limited to those feasible with the eMoods product. Self-assessments
           with the 29 item BISS-Self are routinely obtained as part of regular treatment visits.
           For subjects in this study the trained BISS rater will be blind to the tool assigned.

           The clinician administered scale will be the 42 item Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale
           (BISS), however comparisons will be limited to the symptom areas represented in both K-B
           and eMoods, e.g., depression and mania subscales; depression, mania, irritability and
           anxiety domains. The BISS Self (BISS-S) is a 29 item scale covering similar symptoms to
           the BISS, but answered as yes/no, rather than the 0-4 range of the BISS. The MINI is a
           structured diagnostic interview providing current and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses,
           requiring approximately 20 minutes.

        7. Estimate the utility of ancillary features of Kios-Bipolar or eMoods. These features
           include capability to submit to the investigative staff displays of symptom trajectories
           for the patient's medical record and visual displays of selected aspects of the
           patient's illness/wellness. No transmission of data to treating clinical staff will
           occur as component of this study.

        8. Assess sensitivity of K-B assessed improvement or worsening by comparison with
           assessment by BISS-Self and BISS-42.
