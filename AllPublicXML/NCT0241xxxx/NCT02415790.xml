  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study, designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of single oral ascending doses of E2027, will be administered to healthy adult
      participants to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Thereafter, the pharmacodynamic
      (PD) effects of single doses of E2027 on elevation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cyclic
      guanidine monophosphate (cGMP) in healthy adult participants will be evaluated across a broad
      dose range, to establish the PK/PD relationship.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 4 parts, Parts A, B, C, and D. Part A is a single ascending dose
      (SAD) clinical pharmacology for evaluation of safety, tolerability, and PK characteristics up
      to the MTD in healthy adult (greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 50
      years old). In Part B, the PK and PD effects of E2027 on CSF cGMP are evaluated in healthy
      adult (greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 50 years old).
      Participants in 2nd cohort of Part B will participate in the evaluation of food effect in
      Treatment Period 2. In Part C, the design is similar to Part A. This healthy elderly cohort
      (greater than or equal to 65 years and less than or equal to 85 years old) will provide
      bridging PK, safety, and tolerability data on E2027 compared to younger healthy participants
      in Part A and Part B. Part D will be conducted in healthy Japanese adult participants
      (greater than or equal to 20 years and less than or equal to 50 years old) and is designed to
      bridge the PK, safety, and tolerability data of E2027 between Japanese and non-Japanese
      participants. All parts of the study will have 2 phases: the Prerandomization Phase and the
      Randomization Phase. The Prerandomization Phase will consist of a Screening Period and a
      Baseline Period during which each participant's study eligibility will be determined and
      baseline assessments will be conducted. The Randomization Phase will consist of the Treatment
      Period and a Follow-Up Period. During the Treatment Period, participants will be randomized
      to receive a single oral dose of either E2027 or placebo matching E2027.
