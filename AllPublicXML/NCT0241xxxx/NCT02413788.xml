  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory markers have been analyzed in several diseases of unknown etiology, in the
      expectation of increasing therapeutic perspectives. This possibility arises from the
      different levels of tissue injury with low-grade chronic inflammation that have been observed
      in studies in which the markers were not evaluated traditionally, and today have influenced
      clinical management.

      The investigators aimed, therefore, to evaluate the inflammatory markers in patients with AIS
      before and after aerobic and combined exercise training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory markers have not been evaluated in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), but
      this deformity potentially involves various musculoskeletal structures permanently, which
      justifies the analysis. A low-grade chronic inflammation may be related to the lower capacity
      in exercise performance observed in this population, which must be stimulated to perform
      standardized physical activity.
