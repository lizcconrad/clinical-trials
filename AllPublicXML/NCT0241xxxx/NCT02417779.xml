  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In plastic and reconstructive surgery, treatment strategies of second-degree burns,
      superficial wounds, hypertrophic burn scars, flaps and chronic wounds aim at reducing
      infection and improving microcirculation. Although previous studies indicate that
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) can accelerate wound healing, only a few studies
      focused on the elucidation of its mechanisms of action. Therefore, the aim of this study is
      to evaluate the microcirculatory effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on
      second-degree burns, superficial wounds, hypertrophic burn scars, flaps and chronic wounds in
      a human in-vivo setting for the first time.
