    <textblock>
      Retrospective analysis of HIV-1 positive patients treated with antiretroviral therapy in
      Essen (Germany) from 2004 on. Stored samples from selected patients (n=50) obtained for
      routine diagnostics will be used to analyze the gag gene, the V3-region of the env gene and
      immune cells.

      The underlying study is a retrospective analysis of HIV-1 positive patients treated with
      antiretroviral therapy from Essen since 2004. Stored samples obtained for routine diagnostics
      will be used to analyze the gag gene, the V3-region and immune cells from selected patients.
      By comparing different groups of patients this study aims to identify clinical implications
      of low-level viremia (LLV) and persistent viremia (PV) at times of highly active
      antiretroviral treatment regimens (cART). The objectives of this study is to (1) determine
      how often LLV and PV occured during cART in Essen in the last 10 years and whether specific
      patterns can be correlated, (2) whether the evolution of PI drug resistance can be detected
      earlier in the gag than in the protease gene, (3) what kind of cellular tropism do HIV-1
      isolates (RNA and proviral DNA) have at times of LLV, and (4) what kind of immune cells
      circulate in the blood during LLV and PV and what kind of functional properties do they have.
      The groups include patients starting cART as well as patients with cART. Furthermore,
      clinical data of patients are routinely documented and will be combined with results
      specifically obtained in this study in an anonymized data set. Since this is a retrospective
      study, there are no specific endpoints.

        A database comprising clinical parameters (viral Ioad, antiretroviral treatment,
        immunological parameters, HBV/HCV-coinfections and HIV-1 genotypes) of patients treated in
        Essen in the last 10 years will be set up. These data will be used to compare different
        groups of patients and will be screened for parameters associated with LLV (defined as two
        consecutive viral loads between 40 and 1000 copies/ml) or PV (viral loads between above 50
        copies/ml 26 weeks after start of ART). Different clinical settings will be distinguished:
        First patients after the start of first line treatment regimens in the initial phase and
        second patients after at least 18 months of cART.
