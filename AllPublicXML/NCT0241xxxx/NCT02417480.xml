      This study will pilot test the use of two mHealth devices. One is called the Bite Counter and
      one is called a MisFit. The study will be among a sample of participants (n = 50) to monitor
      their eating and sleeping habits. The Bite Counter is a wearable watch-like device that
      detects and records when an individual has taken a bite of food. The benefit of using the
      Bite Counter is that it places a low-burden on participants to self-monitor their dietary
      intake. The MisFit is a commercial device that tracks an individual's sleeping and activity.

      The purpose of this study is to (1) find out how the Bite Counter calculates daily bites
      taken on a vegan diet compared to an omnivorous diet, (2) examine differences in sleep and
      activity between individuals following a vegan diet compared to an omnivorous diet and (3)
      get feedback from users before the device is tested in larger studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In several randomized controlled trials comparing vegan or vegetarian diets to omnivorous
      dietary approaches, significant weight loss has occurred in the absence of significantly
      different changes in reported energy intake between groups. This is different than what is
      seen in studies using traditional weight loss diets (reduced energy omnivorous diets), which
      demonstrate a greater reduction in energy intake corresponding to greater weight loss. In
      observational cohort studies, among Adventist Health Study-2 participants following five
      different diets, BMI was found to be lowest among vegans and highest among omnivores; yet
      energy intake did not significantly differ among the five groups, averaging 2,000 kcals/day,
      with the exception of lower energy intake among semi-vegetarians.

      This difference in body weight without observed differences in energy intake could possibly
      be explained by higher levels of physical activity among vegan and vegetarian participants,
      which have been observed in some of the cohort studies. Physical activity, however, was
      controlled for in the randomized trials either giving participants identical exercise
      recommendations, or holding exercise levels constant across experimental groups.

      This present study will utilize the Bite Counter to estimate the differences between calories
      consumed between a vegan diet and an omnivore diet. The significance of using the Bite
      Counter is that it is a simple way to estimate energy intake. While there are many devices
      that measure energy expenditure (e.g. various exercise scales and equipment), there are few
      devices that account for energy intake. Traditional methods of estimating energy intake tend
      to utilize dietary recalls, but these procedures require much more effort and do not provide
      real time feedback like the Bite Counter does. Therefore, this study will contribute to
      current research by capturing data on dietary differences between vegans and omnivores, as
      well as assessing the usability of this device for dietary self-monitoring. The study will
      also use an objective physical activity and sleep tracker (the MisFit) to examine differences
      in exercise and sleeping between omnivorous and vegan participants.

    <description>A vegan diet is one that does not contain any animal products (no meat, fish, poultry, eggs, or dairy) but emphasizes plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes/beans. Researchers will ask participants on a vegan diet to follow their usual diet and exercise habits consistent for the two week study period.</description>
