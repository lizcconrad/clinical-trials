  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a scientifically validated treatment for
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) called Prolonged Exposure (PE) can be delivered
      effectively to Veterans with Military Sexual Trauma (MST) related PTSD using
      videoconferencing technology, which allows a therapist and patient who are not in the same
      room as one another to communicate. The investigators are interested in learning if this form
      of mental health service delivery is an acceptable alternative to traditional face-to-face
      therapy delivered with the therapist in the same room as the patient. This study is being
      conducted at the Charleston VA Medical Center and surrounding Community-Based Outpatient
      Clinics (CBOCs), and will involve approximately 100 female participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test, using mixed qualitative and quantitative assessment
      strategies, the efficacy of PE delivered via home-based telehealth (PE-HBT) versus PE
      delivered via standard service delivery (PE-SD) using a randomized, between groups, repeated
      measures design.

      Objective 1: To compare, at post, 3 and 6-month follow-up, whether PE-HBT is superior to
      PE-SD across critical clinical and quality of life outcomes (i.e., PTSD, depression, quality
      of life) due to increased PE 'dosing' that results from improved session attendance and
      reduced attrition.

      Hypothesis 1: In intent-to-treat analyses, PE-HBT will be more effective than PE-SD at
      improving clinical and quality of life outcomes at post, 3, and 6-month follow-up;
      improvement will correlate with session attendance, which will be higher in PE-HBT.

      Objective 2: To compare at post-intervention whether PE-HBT is superior to PE-SD across
      critical process outcomes (e.g., session attendance, satisfaction, and treatment adherence).

      Hypothesis 2: PE-HBT will yield better process outcomes than PE-SD post-intervention.

      Exploratory Aims: (1) To determine if treatment adherence and other process variables mediate
      the relationship between treatment condition and clinical and quality of life outcomes as
      noted in Objective 1; and (2) To use qualitative interviewing methods to obtain data on
      Veterans' reactions, preferences, difficulties, and suggestions for MST services.
