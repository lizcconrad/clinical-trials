  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compared the acute effects of the supplementation of a standardized meal with
      either lupin or whey protein or no protein on the whole-body glucose and insuline metabolism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The nutritional pre-study had the following key objectives:

      Primary objective:

      - Lupin protein lowers the postprandial blood glucose level equivalent to or to a greater
      extent than whey protein.

      Secondary objective:

      - Lupin protein has an equivalent or a stronger insulinotropic effect than whey protein.
