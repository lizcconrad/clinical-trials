  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international
      (Spain and Sweden) and multicentre study.

      In the setting of postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer, treatment with
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is the most effective and well-studied therapy. Vaginal dryness is
      one of the most frequently reported symptom caused by this adjuvant therapy which may lead to
      a reduced adherence in breast cancer women.

      This study will explore the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in this oncological context,
      to demonstrate that this medicinal product is a safe option to treat the vaginal atrophy
      caused by AIs, without a clinically relevant influence in gonadotropins or systemic estrogen
      levels.

      The main objective is to evaluate the levels of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) after
      treatment with 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women
      with early stage breast cancer in treatment with Non-Steroidal Aromatase Inhibitors (NSAIs)
      in the adjuvant setting and symptoms of vaginal atrophy.
