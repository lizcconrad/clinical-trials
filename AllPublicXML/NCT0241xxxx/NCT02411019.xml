  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to follow up on the change of immune response by measuring HPV type 16/18 E6
      and E7 specific T cell response and lesion condition in subjects who have administered in
      DNA-based therapeutic vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study to investigate the change of immunogenicity and lesion condition in
      subjects with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 who have enrolled and participated
      GX-188E phase II trial(GX-188E_CIN3_P2).

      Subjects will make visits 7 times for about three years from the last visit of GX-188E phase
      2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2).

      The endpoints are to evaluate the change of immune response, involved lesion and infection
      status compared to that of the final visit in phase 2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2).
