  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of running a full-scale trial
      that compares two formats of a shortened systematic review to a full-length systematic review
      to be used in clinical decision-making.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two shortened systematic review formats were developed to enhance their use in clinical
      decision making. An online randomized controlled trial is planned to make comparisons of the
      shortened formats to a full-length systematic review. To prepare for the full-scale trial, a
      pilot study will be conducted to test methods and procedures in order to refine the
      processes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Physicians who were in practice full- or part-time at study enrollment were recruited
             for participation

          -  Participants had to have access to the Internet as the study was conducted online.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The systematic reviews in all formats were only available in English, thus any
             participants who were not able to read and understand English were not eligible to
             participate.

          -  Anyone who had taken part in any phase of the development of the shortened versions of
             the systematic reviews (cased-based or evidence-expertise formats) were not eligible
             for recruitment.
