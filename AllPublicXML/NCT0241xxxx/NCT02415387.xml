  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial uses an inactive typhoid vaccine to briefly stimulate an
      immune response in patients with stage I-IIIA breast cancer who received primary cancer
      treatment and studies whether patients' fitness levels affect how their bodies handle a
      challenge to their immune system. A vaccine is a substance or group of substances meant to
      cause the immune system to respond to a tumor or to microorganisms such as bacteria or
      viruses. Immune responses may cause excess inflammation in the body and behavioral changes,
      such as depression, fatigue, pain, and problems with thinking and reasoning. Studying immune
      responses in patients with breast cancer who have undergone primary cancer treatment may help
      doctors learn whether physical fitness can protect the body from effects of immune system
      stress and whether it may be able to reduce health problems in patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness and inflammatory and
      behavioral responses (negative mood, fatigue, pain, and cognitive problems) to typhoid
      vaccine in breast cancer survivors.

      II. To determine the effects of age and depressive symptoms on inflammatory and behavioral
      responses to typhoid vaccine and placebo.

      III. To assess the ability of cardiorespiratory fitness to moderate age- and
      depression-related responses to typhoid vaccine.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive inactive typhoid vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at visit 1 followed by
      placebo IM 30 days later at visit 2.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM at visit 1 followed by inactive typhoid vaccine IM 30
      days later at visit 2.

      There is an initial screening visit where patients in both arms complete an audio-recorded
      interview that includes questions about changes in mood and emotion throughout their lives,
      body measurements, a finger stick to assess for anemia and diabetes markers, and a fitness
      test on a stationary bike. During visit 1 and 2, patients in both arms will have blood drawn
      periodically and complete sets of questionnaires that assess feelings, health behaviors, and
      personality. Patients also complete cognitive tasks and a temperature sensitivity task at
      3-4.5 hours post-injection.
