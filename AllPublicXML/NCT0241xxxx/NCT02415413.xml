      Patients included in the study will receive induction treatment during 6 months, followed by
      receive high-dose therapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

      Approximately 3 months after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation patients will receive
      consolidation treatment during 2 months.

      Subsequently patients will start maintenance treatment during 24 months. Therefore, the total
      duration of the treatment will be approximately 36 months.

      This clinical trial is a multicenter Phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      toxicity of an intensive therapeutic approach in 90 patients with asymptomatic high risk
      multiple myeloma (SMM).

        1. - Patients will receive an induction treatment consisting of 6 cycles of carfilzomib,
           lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (KRd): patients will receive carfilzomib 20-36
           mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; with oral lenalidomide 25 mg daily on days 1-21,
           subsequently there will be a rest period of a week (from day 22 to day 27). Moreover,
           oral dexamethasone 40mg daily will be administered weekly (days 1, 8, 15 and 22).

        2. - Following the induction treatment, patients will receive high-dose (200 mg/m2)
           melphalan-based treatment administered via the intravenous route followed by peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT).

        3. - The consolidation treatment will consist of 2 cycles of KRd, with the same doses and
           scheduled of the induction treatment.

        4. - Maintenance treatment: all patients, without progression to symptomatic multiple
           myeloma or toxicity requiring discontinuation of the trial, will receive maintenance
           treatment during 24 cycles.

      This maintenance treatment comprises the administration of lenalidomide 10mg on days 1-21,
      followed by a rest period of 1 week, with the weekly administration of dexamethasone 20mg.

      Treatment will be administrated until the end of the maintenance, although patients will
      continue in the trial.

      If biological progression is observed following the discontinuation of the treatment,
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone will be reinstituted in order to control the disease again.
      Lenalidomide 10 mg will be administrated on days 1-21 combined with dexamethasone 20mg on
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22. All patients will be monitored for asymptomatic disease progression and
      to collect data regarding on overall survival (OS).

    <description>Induction treatment: patients included in the trial will receive an induction treatment for approximately 6 months (6 cycles of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (KRd)). After the third cycle of KRd, all patients will be mobilized with colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone to collect peripheral blood stem cell for the ASCT.
High dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation: patients will receive melphalan 200 mg/m2 via intravenous followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT).
Consolidation treatment: approximately 3 months after the autologous stem cell transplantation, patients will receive consolidation treatment for 2 months (2 cycles of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (KRd)).
Maintenance treatment: subsequently they will start a maintenance treatment that will be administered for approximately 24 months (24 cycles of lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone</description>
