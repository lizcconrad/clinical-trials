      This phase IV clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the
      recombinant Hepatitis E vaccine(Hecolin®), manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO., LTD.,
      in healthy volunteers aged over 65 years of age at enrollment. The study volunteers will
      receive the 3 doses of Hecolin® administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month
      schedule.
