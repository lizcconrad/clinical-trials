  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with emphysema, lung volume reduction by insertion of endobronchial valves could
      be an expedient approach to improve the diaphragm function and the strength of breathing
      muscles. Therefore in the present study investigators intend to examine, whether the lung
      volume reduction by valves might improve the physical capacity and the quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In line with routine explorations it is necessary to clarify whether a patient is suitable
      for the lung volume reduction by insertion of endobronchial valves. To address this question
      lung function diagnostics, 6-minutes-walk-test, blood withdrawal, CT of the thorax, lung
      perfusion scintigraphy and transthoracic echocardiography have to be performed.

      After confirmation of the suitability for the endoscopic lung volume reduction patients who
      fulfill all other eligibility criteria will be educated about the aim and performance of the
      study by an investigator.

      Following examination will be performed additional due to the study: determination of the
      strength of breathing muscles via sniff nasal pressure (PImax, PE max, P0.1), determination
      of the life quality index via St.-George-questionary and determination of the depression
      score via the Short Form 8 (SF-8) Health Survey.

      After that endobronchial valve will be implanted and a permanent post-operative examination
      will be performed for 24 hours.

      Three, respectively nine month after the implanting follow up exploration will be performed
      on the study patients. Once again the determination of the strength of breathing muscles, the
      life quality index via St.-George-questionary and the depression score via SF-8 will be
      performed to clarify an improvement of the physical capacity and the quality of life

    <description>Independent of the study, subject will get a bronchoscopy with chartis measurement in general anaesthesia. chartis measurement is a Balloon angioplasty. Balloon will be well-positioned in lung and filled by air for occlusion of lobe of the lung. System recognizes collateral ventilation of lobe of the lung via calculation of airflow resistance.
Negative result allows the endoscopic placement of selfexpandig endobronchial valves in the subject lung. Inhale airflow will be inhibit an enclosed air and liquids can exhaust.</description>
