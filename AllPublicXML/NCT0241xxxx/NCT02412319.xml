      This study using entecavir tablets as basic therapy, is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled multi center study, including the screening period (-4 weeks), baseline
      and treatment period (96 weeks). The treatment period of first 48 weeks, using entecavir
      tablets as basic treatment, placebo-controlled trials; the second 48 weeks, taking entecavir
      tablets alone, continue observation experiment.
