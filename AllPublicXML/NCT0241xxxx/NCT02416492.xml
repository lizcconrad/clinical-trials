    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of
      intracranial administration of SB623 cells on patients with chronic motor deficit from
      Traumatic Brain Injury. A secondary purpose of the study is 1) to evaluate the effect of
      intracranial administration of SB623 cells on disability parameters and 2) to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of intracranial administration of SB623 cells. Patients with stable,
      chronic motor deficits secondary to focal traumatic brain injury must be 12 months post TBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SB623 cells are adult bone-marrow-derived cells that are transiently transfected with a
      plasmid construct encoding the intracellular domain of human Notch-1. These cells produce
      trophic factors that protect neurons in models of ischemic insult. In a rat contusion model
      of TBI, implantation of SB623 around the area of the injury resulted in significant
      improvement of motor function. Further, safety evaluation of animal models implanted with
      SB623 cells have shown no adverse effects and no SB623-related clinical, laboratory, or
      histological abnormalities were found. A 2-year Phase 1/2A dose escalation study
      (NCT01287936) of SB623 stereotactically implanted into the brains of patients with chronic
      motor deficits due to ischemic stroke has completed.The study has shown
      statistically-significant improvements in motor function in each of three scales: the
      European Stroke Scale (ESS), the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the
      Fugl-Meyer scale. The study showed no serious adverse events likely attributed to SB623, and
      only minor adverse events mostly grade 1 or 2 (with one grade 3) that were unrelated,
      unlikely related, or possibly related to SB623. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed.
