      Post-marketing clinical study,international, multi-centre, prospective, observational. The
      investigation will be carried out in 2 sites in Europe for a maximum total number of 160
      patients.The aim of this study is to assess clinical, radiographic and subjective outcomes
      after hip arthroplasty with a cementless metaphyseal MINIMA short stem, define the
      survivorship of the implant and identify possible risk factors that may lead to failure.

        Patients will be selected for recruitment into the study from the general diagnosis
        population of patients requiring a primary hip arthroplasty, due to symptomatic painful
        degenerative joint diseases (NDJD). Patients requiring a revision of a previous failed stem
        cannot be enrolled into the clinical evaluation.
