  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levacalm Tab. was approved in Jul 2013 by MFDS in South Korea. Levacalm Tab. is combination
      drug of Valsartan as an angiotensin II receptor blocker and Lercanidipine as a Calcium
      channel blocker. It is a new drug of combination of Valsartan and Lercanidipine. Thus,
      there's no enough safety data and efficacy data defined from the clinical study.

      Also, many combination drugs of valsartaa and amlodipine are widely used in the market.

      LGLS will compare the safety(adverse events especially the lower leg edema) and efficacy
      (blood pressure and pulse) of Levacalm and Valsartan/amlodipine combination drug from this
      study.
