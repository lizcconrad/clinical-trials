  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participants of this study have been diagnosed with mild to moderate depression with no
      evidence of suicidal actions prior to recruitment. All recruited subjects receive standard
      therapy and participate in a metacognitive training program (D-MKT) independently of study
      participation. Diagnostic and therapeutical interventions are not part of this study. As part
      of this study, the change of cognitive and psychosocial achievement/behavior in patients with
      mild to moderate depression after taking part in the training program is being investigated.
      The training program seeks to enable group members to recognize and correct the often
      automatic and unconscious thought patterns that accompany depression, in part by viewing this
      depressive thought process at a distance (i.e., depersonalizing). In addition, dysfunctional
      assumptions about one's thought processes, as well as dysfunctional coping-strategies (i.e.,
      thought suppression, rumination as problem-solving) are targeted (Lena Jelinek &amp; Steffen
      Moritz, http://clinical-neuropsychology.de/metacognitive_training_for_depression.html).
      Within this study the cognitive and psychosocial behaviour changes are being investigated by
      neuropsychological assessment as well as questionnaires.
