      This project will collect quantitative pilot data that will allow the characterization of
      uptake and binding of 18F-AV-1451 (also known as F 18 T807), a novel tau imaging compound, in
      individuals with Progressive Posterior Cortical Dysfunction (PPCD). The primary goal is to
      develop tau imaging technique as an antecedent biomarker of cognitive decline. The
      investigators propose to obtain preliminary data that will support the possibility of
      detecting cognitive decline in its earliest stages, before the occurrence of dementia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female participants, at least 45 years of age.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of PPCD.

          3. Participant is able and willing to undergo testing (MRI or CT, PET, radioactive tracer
             injection, LP; for those unable to undergo an MRI, CT will be used to generate
             regions-of-interest).

          4. Pre-menopausal women will have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of T807
             drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could increase risk to the
             participant, limit the participant's ability to tolerate the experimental procedures,
             or interfere with the collection/analysis of the data (for example, participants with
             severe chronic back pain might not be able to lie still during the scanning
             procedures).

          2. Is deemed likely unable to perform the imaging procedures for any reason.

          3. Has a high risk for Torsades de Pointes or is taking medications known to prolong QT
             interval.

          4. Has hypersensitivity to F 18 T807 or any of its excipients.

          5. Contraindications to PET, PET-CT or MR (e.g. electronic medical devices, inability to
             lie still for long periods) that make it unsafe for the individual to participate.

          6. Severe claustrophobia.

          7. Currently pregnant or breast-feeding.

          8. For those electing to undergo the optional lumbar puncture: on anticoagulant of any
             form prior to lumbar puncture.
