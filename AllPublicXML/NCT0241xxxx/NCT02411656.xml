  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have inflammatory breast cancer
      (IBC) or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that is metastatic (has spread to other parts
      of the body).

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if pembrolizumab (also called MK-3475
      and Keytruda) can help to control metastatic IBC and TNBC. The safety of this drug will also
      be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Its use in patients with metastatic IBC and TNBC is
      investigational. The study doctor can describe how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part in at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive pembrolizumab by
      vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 (+/- 3 days) of each 21-day cycle.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At Cycles 3, every 3rd cycle after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on), and if the disease gets
      worse, blood (about 10 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker and immune system testing.

      About every 2 Cycles, you will have imaging scans to check the status of the disease as part
      of standard of care. .

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 24 months, as long as the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you stop receiving the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 10 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have the same imaging scans you had at screening to check the status of the
           disease.

      Follow-Up:

      About 1 and 3 months after the last dose of study drug, you will be asked about your health
      and any side effects you may have had. You may be asked during a routine clinic visit or you
      may be called. If you are called, each call should last about 2 minutes.

             including diffuse erythema and edema (peau d'orange), with or without an underlying
             palpable mass involving the majority of the skin of the breast. Pathological evidence
             of dermal lymphatic invasion should be noted but is not required for diagnosis of
             inflammatory breast cancer regardless ER/PR status; OR B).Has histological
             confirmation of triple negative breast carcinoma (HER2 normal, ER/PR &lt; 10%) without
             clinical diagnosis of IBC

             weeks) of chemotherapy is required to determine clinical response. Per RECIST criteria
             1.1, Clinical response for measurable disease is defined as complete response (CR) or
             partial response (PR); for non-measurable disease only (i.e. bone metastasis, ascites,
             pleural effusion, and pathological lymph nodes &gt;/= 10 to &lt;15 mm short axis) is defined
             as persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and no increase in overall tumor
             burden.

          6. Is HER2 normal, defined as HER2 0 or 1+ by IHC and negative by FISH if performed; or
             HER2 is 2+ by IHC and negative by FISH; or HER2 negative by FISH if IHC is not
             performed.

          7. Has a performance status of 0-1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

             Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN, ALT and AST &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN or &lt;/=5 x ULN for subjects
             with liver metastases.

          9. Subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use effective methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through at least 4 months after the last dose of study drug.Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Effective methods of birth control include 1). Use
             of hormonal birth control methods: pills, shots/injections, implants (placed under the
             skin by a health care provider), or patches (placed on the skin); 2).Intrauterine
             devices (IUDs); 3).Using 2 barrier methods (each partner must use 1 barrier method)
             with a spermicide. Males must use the male condom (latex or other synthetic material)
             with spermicide. Females must choose either a Diaphragm with spermicide, or Cervical
             cap with spermicide, or a sponge (spermicide is already in the contraceptive sponge).

         10. Has negative serum or urine pregnancy test for subjects of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating in a study of an investigational anti-cancer agent.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy.

          3. Has not recovered from adverse events due to prior therapies, i.e. monoclonal
             antibody, chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, radiation therapy, or
             surgery.( Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy, alopecia and general disorders and
             administration site conditions (per CTCAE version 4.0) are an exception to this
             criterion and may qualify for the study.)

          4. Has a known malignancy (other than breast cancer) except basal cell carcinoma or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone
             potentially curative therapy.

          5. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
