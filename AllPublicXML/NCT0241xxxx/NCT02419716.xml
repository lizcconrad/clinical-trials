    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal study to assess the impact of repeat Cologuard testing at
      3 years in average risk patients. Enrolled subjects will be prescribed Cologuard per approved
      labeling at baseline. Subjects with positive results will be referred to colonoscopy and
      study participation completed. Subjects with negative Cologuard results will be seen annually
      for 3 years. At year 3, subjects will repeat Cologuard, followed by colonoscopy, regardless
      of the Cologuard test outcome. Subjects who have a colonoscopy at any time during the study
      will be discontinued following collection of the colonoscopy and associated histopathology
      results.

        The study will enroll approximately 2,400 men and women aged 50 years and older at a
        minimum of 20 sites to achieve a minimum of 1,119 subjects at the Year 3 visit. To increase
        the point prevalence of CRC in the study population, subject enrollment will be
        age-weighted toward a slightly older population. Enrollment of at least 65% of subjects age
        65 years or older will be targeted

               -  Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (also referred to as &quot;HNPCC&quot;
