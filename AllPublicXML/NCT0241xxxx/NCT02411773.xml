  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out why patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have
      poor exercise capacity and what causes an increase in blood pressure during exercise (i.e.
      increased adrenaline levels, or decreased ability of blood vessels to dilate).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from exercise intolerance and poor physical
      capacity which contributes to increased cardiovascular risk in this patient population. Prior
      studies have shown that CKD patients have an exaggerated increase in blood pressure (BP)
      during both static and rhythmic exercise. Such abnormal hemodynamic responses to exercise can
      contribute to poor physical capacity and abnormal muscle blood flow during exercise in these
      patients. The goals of this project are to investigate the mechanisms and potential therapies
      targeting the abnormal hemodynamic response during exercise in CKD by examining the roles of
      impaired vasodilation, and exaggerated vasoconstriction.

    <description>Exercise training consists of riding a stationary bicycle for 20-45 minutes, 3 times per week, supervised by trained exercise specialists, for 6-12 weeks. The exercise program will follow the guidelines provided by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for optimizing cardiovascular fitness. Exercise intensity will begin at low levels (50 percent of resting heart rate) and increase to no greater than 80 percent of resting heart rate. Exercise time will progress, depending on subject's progress, from 20 minutes per session at first, to a maximum of 45 minutes. Trained staff members will give instructions throughout each exercise session. Before beginning each exercise session, subjects will be instructed on a warm-up focusing on preparing the legs for activity.</description>
