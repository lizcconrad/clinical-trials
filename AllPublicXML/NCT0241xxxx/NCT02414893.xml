  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms that regulate appetite in the morbidly obese are multifactorial and not
      well-known. Different peripheral signals (such as ghrelin or cholecystokinin) play an
      important role in the central regulation of appetite and hunger. Postprandial ghrelin and
      cholecystokinin (CCK) response has also an effect on gastric emptying that, in turn, has an
      effect on satiety sensation.

      On the other hand, bariatric surgery is supposed to affect hunger and satiety in and also
      promotes changes in gastric emptying which are not clearly defined.

      Aim: To better understand the physiologic mechanisms involved in the regulation of hunger and
      satiety in morbidly obese individuals, especially those related with gallbladder and gastric
      emptying, as well as those related with the response of the gastrointestinal hormones
      ghrelin, CCK and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), before and after bariatric surgery (sleeve
      gastrectomy). Methodology: Three groups of individuals will be studied and compared: group A)
      non obese healthy subjects, group B) morbidly obese subjects and group C) morbidly obese
      subjects who had had a previous sleeve gastrectomy. In all subjects a standard meal test
      after a fasting night will be administered and appetite, satiety and hormonal response
      (ghrelin, CCK, GLP-1 and insulin) during 4 hours post-ingestion assessed, as well as
      postprandial gallbladder and gastric emptying by means of ultrasonography and the paracetamol
      absorption technique.
