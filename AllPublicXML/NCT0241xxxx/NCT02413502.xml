  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to obtain biological samples through leukapheresis and
      cryopreservation of cells for the future study, by in vitro assay, of immune responses after
      one dose of BCG in BCG-naïve healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label protocol in 12 healthy adults who are BCG-naïve. All participants will
      receive a single dose of BCG, by percutaneous administration, on Study Day 0. There will be
      two follow-up visits on Study Days 54 and 56, with telephone contact every 2 weeks in between
      these visits. Leukapheresis will be conducted on Study Days 0 and 56. The Study Day 56
      leukapheresis was selected based on results from functional biological assays that suggest
      analysis of samples at this time point may provide insight into the protective immune
      responses elicited by BCG. The study will be conducted at a single site in the US (University
      of Rochester Medical Center [URMC]).
