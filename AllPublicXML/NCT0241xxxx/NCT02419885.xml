  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fingertips facilitate smooth motor activity, precise sensation, and the delicate movement of
      the hands and have an aesthetic function. Fingertip injuries are defined as injuries
      occurring distal to the insertion of the flexor and extensor tendons. These injuries are one
      of the most common trauma injuries presented in acute care settings, accounting for
      approximately 4.8 million emergency department visits per year in the United States.(1)
      Fingertip amputations may not constitute the majority among these fingertip injuries but can
      have a complex spectrum of injury. In these cases, the reconstruction methodologies focus on
      preserving the digital length, ensuring adequate soft tissue coverage, preserving the nail
      structure, achieving a well-contoured and painless fingertip, and restoring durable and
      sensate skin.

      There are so many factor that influence the result of composite graft in distal finger tip
      amputation. Investigators will collected the data including the size of amputee , shape,
      level of amputation, mechanism of amputation, if hyperbaric oxygen therapy, operation
      procedures.

      Fingertip amputations underwent

        1. modified composite grafting with pulp Adipo-fascia advance flap

        2. composite graft

        3. revision amputation was collected in this study

      Follow-up was arranged in out-patient department, including:

      type of amputation ( Hirase classification, ) 2-point discrimination test, DASH(Disabilities
      of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) outcome measure, graft survival, pain evaluation with visual
      Analog scale other associated treatment such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy length of finger
      shortening at 6 month after operation
