  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common and serious condition and is associated with adverse outcome. The
      elderly who have cognitive dysfunction are expected to show delirium more frequently. It is
      most likely that delirium represents a response to impaired cholinergic neurotransmission.
      Investigators aimed to establish the preventive effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor,
      rivastigmine patch, on the post-operative delirium limited to femur neck fracture operation
      in patients at risk of dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators evaluated the delirium prevention effect of rivastigmine patch in patients with
      femur neck fracture and cognitive impairment. Investigators measured the frequency and
      severity of post-operation delirium in the patch applied and non-applied subjects.
