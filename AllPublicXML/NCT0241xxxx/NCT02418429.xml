  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence shows that dietary supplementation with resistant starch (RS) increases fat
      catabolism and resting energy expenditure and decreases plasma insulin and glucose responses
      as well as the gut-derived hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
      Consumption of whey protein has also been shown to increase energy expenditure and favorably
      affect gut hormones. Thus, investigators tested consumption of both RS and whey protein on
      energy expenditure and gut hormones in lean and obese women and men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumed separately, resistant starch (RS) and whey protein (WP) favorably affect energy
      metabolism and gut hormones, as well as suppress feelings of hunger. These findings are
      important because release of certain gut hormones (i.e., GIP) is associated with a lower
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in healthy humans. Interestingly, a recent study showed that
      ingestion of RS reduces postprandial GIP and increases postprandial REE and fat utilization
      in healthy men and therefore may be an effective strategy in weight management. Thus, there
      is a need to replicate these findings in a healthy cohort of lean and obese women and men.

      The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of RS on the number of calories burned
      after eating a meal, as well as specific hormones that are released from the stomach and
      intestines following meal ingestion in healthy lean and obese women and men. Investigators
      used a single ingestion of a meal supplemented with or without the resistant starch and whey
      protein.
