    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-center feasibility study to acquire more knowledge
      regarding the NeuRx DPS and develop a routine in the optimal pacing of the diaphragm with
      this system during the weaning period from mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit
      in patients after bilateral lung transplant.

      This study is a prospective, single-center feasibility study to acquire more knowledge
      regarding the NeuRx DPS and develop a routine in the optimal pacing of the diaphragm with
      this system during the weaning period from mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit
      in patients after bilateral lung transplant. The objectives are to evaluate the safety and
      technical performance of DPS by assessing:

        -  the immediate safety and technical surgical results of implantation

        -  the safety and tolerability of use and removal until patient discharge from the
           Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or hospital

        -  the effects of diaphragm pacing on MV interaction, diaphragm force, fatigue resistance,
           and diaphragm electromyography (EMG)

    <description>NeuRx Diaphragm Pacing System electrodes are placed in the diaphragm during lung transplant surgery. The diaphragm will be continually paced until the patient is free from the ventilator or the patient is discharged from the ICU whichever. Diaphragm measurements are taken daily to assess tolerability and pacing success.</description>
