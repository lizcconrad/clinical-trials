    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of exposure to standard smoking
      environments on ability to resist smoking as measured with a Delay to Smoking Task. The
      results of this study will inform whether the Delay to Smoking Task is a sensitive measure
      for evaluating environment-provoked craving and smoking behavior.

    <textblock>
      Adult smokers (n=25) will complete 4 visits and a 6 month follow-up phone call. Participants
      will complete a Delay to Smoking Task following 6 hours smoking abstinence. The task involves
      viewing pictures of smoking and non-smoking locations and participants will have the choice
      to smoke a cigarette at any time during the session. A monetary reinforcer will be provided
      for each 6-minute period that a participant resists smoking. Once participants stop the task
      they can choose to smoke as much or a little as they want for the next 30 minutes.
      Participants will be provided with a smoking tab. Each cigarette they light will cost them
      from their tab. Measurements of tobacco craving, emotion ratings, and nicotine withdrawal
      will be assessed.

    <description>Participants will be presented with an unlit cigarette of their brand and an opportunity to initiate ad lib smoking at any time during the 60-minute task. During this period, participants will be allowed to read books or magazines, but will hear a tone alerting them to view cues (standard smoking environments) for the final minute of each 6-minute period. A monetary reinforcer will be provided for each 6-minute period that a participant resists smoking. Once participants stop the task they can choose to smoke as much or a little as they want for the next 30 minutes. Participants will be provided with a smoking tab. Each cigarette they light will cost them from their tab.</description>
