  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the preferred procedure to investigate any large-bowel disease in adults and
      children. In addition, colonoscopy is the current gold standard for colorectal cancer
      screening due to its high diagnostic capabilities and its unique feature that permits
      sampling and removal of pathology. For optimal performance and visualization of details,
      however, an adequate bowel preparation is essential. Inadequate bowel preparation is
      associated with cancelled procedures, prolonged procedure time, incomplete examination,
      increased cost and possibly complications, physician frustration and patient anxiety, but
      most importantly serving to impede colorectal cancer screening and surveillance.

      A good bowel preparation would need a solution with a reasonable volume, acceptable taste,
      minimal diet restrictions, and easy to follow instructions; and would also need patients'
      adherence to the instructions and diet restrictions. Noncompliance of patients to the diet
      restrictions, the starting day of diet, the timing of drinking the solution, and other
      instructions play an important role in rendering the colon preparation inadequate.

      Aim: The investigators aim, at assessing the influence of having a reminder mobile
      application on the compliance and adherence to instructions and diet and consequently on the
      quality of colon preparation.

      Hypothesis: The investigators' hypothesis is that patients having a customized mobile App
      reminding them systematically about instruction and time of intake of the preparation will
      have a better adherence to the prep protocol and likely on the quality preparation than those
      given written and verbal instructions in clinic.

      This is a randomized controlled trial that will include patients undergoing elective
      colonoscopy at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Patients will be randomized
      into one of two study arms using a computer generated randomization list. 160 patients will
      be enrolled in total. All patients will be instructed by the study coordinator on the
      importance of adherence to the protocol in the leaflet emphasizing its importance to the
      colonoscopy quality. In addition, patients in Arm 2 will be given information about the
      application features. The application will have push notifications to inform patient on time
      of start of dietary changes, type of diet, time of preparing the solution, time of drinking
      the solution, reminder of their appointment, etc. All patients will then be interviewed by
      the research coordinator to evaluate the adherence to the assigned diet and compliance with
      the prep protocol as the main outcome and the ease of the application and the patient's
      attitude towards having such application as secondary outcomes. Based on the results of
      similar studies that assessed the use of software system to improve compliance, the
      investigators' sample size was a calculated assuming similar results. Calculations showed
      that 78 patients per arm will be enough to attain significance. The number 80 was chosen as
      attrition is presumed to be low. As for the statistical analysis, SPSS version 20.0 will be
      used for data entry and analysis.
