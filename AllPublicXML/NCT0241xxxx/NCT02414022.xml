  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned analysis is a prospective cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) analysis from the
      perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system, examining the costs and outcomes
      (quality-adjusted life years gained) of ibrutinib-based therapy compared to a standard
      therapy (bendamutine-rituximab). Collection and management of the data required for the
      economic analyses (including resource utilization and outcomes) will be fully integrated into
      the clinical data. Health state utilities will be derived directly from the study population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be eligible for the core CLC.2/A041202 protocol.

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in
             the trial to document their willingness to participate.

          -  Patient must be able (i.e. sufficiently fluent), and willing to complete the health
             utilities questionnaire in English or French. The baseline assessment must be
             completed within required timelines, prior to registration/randomization Inability
             (illiteracy in English or French, loss of sight, or other equivalent reason) to
             complete the questionnaires will not make the patient ineligible for the core
             protocol. However, ability but unwillingness to complete the questionnaires will make
             the patient ineligible for the core protocol.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.
