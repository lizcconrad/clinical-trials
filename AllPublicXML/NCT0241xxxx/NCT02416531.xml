  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is a lymphocyte-mediated disease of unknown etiology that can
      cause intense itching as well stenosis, hindering the evacuation and urination. It can also
      limit the sex life due to severe local pruritus, pain and dyspareunia (pain during sexual
      intercourse). The standard treatment for this disease is the use of topical corticosteroids
      to reduce the clinical symptoms and to try to increase disease-free intervals. Photodynamic
      therapy (PDT), a treatment that associates a light radiation with a photosensitizing agent
      and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) are therapies that can promote effective immunomodulatory
      responses at the application site by means of photophysical and photochemical phenomena from
      the molecular to the systemic level, which promote their use in chronic dermatoses. The aim
      is to study and compare the effects of PDT, LLLT, and topical corticosteroid in VLS
      evaluating clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and spectroscopic responses. The study
      will be prospective, randomized, and controlled, in a population of 60 women with
      histological diagnoses of VLS, enrolled on the outpatient clinic of Genitoscopy Department of
      the Pérola Byington Hospital in São Paulo. There will be 3 treatments groups: PDT, LLLT and
      topical corticosteroid, where will be allocated by randomization 20 patients in each one. The
      clinical course will be monitored by measuring local temperature, itching, clamping
      (atrophy), and the appearance of the lesion. Histologically, the slides will be classified
      according to the Hewitt grading and will have the ordering of collagen fibers quantified.
      Immunohistochemical analysis will be done using the markers IFN-γ, TGF-β, CD4, CD8, IL-1, p53
      and Ki-67. Finally, the spectroscopic evaluation will be done by reflectance. Descriptive and
      inferential statistical analyses will be conducted to compare the groups and for associations
      between different responses.

      Dosimetry and Experimental Groups: There is no dosimetric protocol established for the
      treatment of VLS with PDT, nor with LLLT. According to the literature, energy densities range
      from 9 to 150 J/cm2 and power densities from 40 to 700 mW/cm2, not to mention work that do
      not report the dosimetry used. As such, the dosimetry to be used in this study is based on a
      pilot clinical study performed by our group.

      The patients will be randomized into 3 groups with 20 patients in each one:

      Group GC: Corticosteroid over the whole vulva. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment applied
      once daily at a dose of 1 g/application (1 g sachets) for 4 weeks.

      Group GPDT: Localized photodynamic therapy at 8 points of the vulva. Methylene blue 0.01%
      intralesional, λ = 660 ± 10 nm, P = 100 mW, PD = 510 mW/cm2, E = 4 J, ED = 20 J/cm2, t = 40
      s, once a week for 4 weeks.

      Group GLLLT: Localized low-level laser therapy at 8 points of the vulva. The same parameters
      as for GPDT, except for the methylene blue, once a week for 4 weeks.

      Analyses: The histological and immunohistochemical analyses will be performed before and 30
      days after the start of treatment, whereas clinical analysis will be performed weekly on
      treatment days for the GPDT and GLLLT groups. The control group will not be seen weekly
      because the standard treatment is performed by the patients themselves, in their own homes,
      for 30 days as recommended by the International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease
      (ISSVD).

      After treatments the patients will be followed for verification of recorrence during one
      year, at minimum.

    <description>The appearance and area of the lesion will be monitored with a digital camera at every session, before irradiation.

    <measure>Collagen birefringence, as assessed by polarized light microscope, in nm.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for 1 month during VLS's treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation between birefringence and collagen ordering has been used since the 1960s. To the present date, polarized-light microscopy is an efficient method to quantify the change in collagen birefringence due to the effects of different agents. Since atrophy of the skin is a characteristic symptom of patients with VLS, the more detailed study of collagen fibers will elucidate the interaction of radiation with this type of tissue.</description>
