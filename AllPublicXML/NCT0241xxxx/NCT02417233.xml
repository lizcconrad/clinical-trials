      This study will evaluate the efficacy of two strategies for enhancing overall preventive
      behaviors, retention in HIV care, and adherence to medication for HIV positive individuals in
      South Africa: SMS text messing and peer navigation services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment-as-prevention represents a game changing potential to stem further HIV transmission
      by ensuring that infected individuals are tested, linked to care, retained in care, and
      adherent to their regimens. Little is known, however, about the most feasible and
      cost-effective means to promote overall engagement in care coupled with behavioral risk
      reduction for HIV positive individuals in South Africa. For this reason, the study proposes
      to first assess what engagement in care activities are underway in select clinics in the
      Bojanala Platinum District, North West Province, South Africa, and will then implement and
      evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of two strategies for
      enhancing overall preventive behaviors, retention in HIV care and adherence to medication.
      The first strategy will employ automated text message reminders to encourage patients to
      return for needed care, adhere to their ART regimens, and practice safer sex and other risk
      reduction behaviors. This approach also includes designation of a retention, adherence, and
      prevention monitor to supervise the system. A second strategy builds on the first model,
      including the automated text message system, but also utilizes peer navigator-provider teams
      to serve as point people for care engagement. Peer navigators will work with providers to
      introduce patients to care and help them establish a care and prevention plan. They will also
      check in with patients to discuss and support resolution of challenges to engaging in care,
      adhering to drug regimens, and reducing transmission risk behavior.
