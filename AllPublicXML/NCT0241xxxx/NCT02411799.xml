      The purpose of this study is to create a data repository of patients who have undergone
      spinal arthrodesis procedures supplemented with the Implanet Jazz System. This device is
      designed to provide a stable interface between spinal constructs and the rods; it can be
      secured around vertebral structures (such as the lamina, transverse or spinous processes)
      from T1 to L5 and is intended to provide temporary stabilization as a bone anchor during the
      development of a solid bony fusion.

      Patients who are candidates for hybrid thoracolumbar fixation with the Implanet Jazz System
      during arthrodesis surgery will be asked to participate in this protocol. Clinical data will
      be collected as indicated at 6 weeks, as well as 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 48, and 60 months post
      surgery in the database. Data collected will include demographic and surgical information,
      physiological data, neurological assessments and patient reported outcomes. This
      comprehensive database will allow for gathering of relevant information for potential future
      research use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are candidates for spinal arthrodesis surgery (thoracic and/or lumbar)
             supplemented by the Implanet Jazz System are eligible to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the age of 18 are excluded because the investigators do not routinely
             perform spinal arthrodesis surgery on these patients.
