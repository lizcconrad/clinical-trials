      This study is open-label, prospective, randomized paralleled study. The investigators
      evaluate the efficacy of high-dose donepezil in patients with Parkinson's disease with
      dementia (PDD) who have taken standard donepezil (10mg) for 12 weeks. The participants, who
      sign the informed consent, are assigned into two groups randomly (high-dose donepezil group
      and standard donepezil group). All participants will be maintained the medication for 24
      weeks and assessed cognitive function at 24 weeks. They will visit to clinic for 3 times (4,
      12, 24 weeks) to assess cognitive function and adverse event. After the end of study, all
      participants were administrated by standard dose donepezil again.
