  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the metrological properties of a
      questionnaire that aims to identify the vitamin D status in reference to a vitamin D blood
      dosage.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will perform only one visit (visit V1). The study duration per subject will last
      about 2 hours. During this visit V1, the subjects will perform a medical exam in order to
      check their eligibility (general statement and check of inclusion / non-inclusion criteria).
      The eligible subjects will fill up a study questionnaire and will perform a blood sampling
      for a dosage of serum vitamin D.
