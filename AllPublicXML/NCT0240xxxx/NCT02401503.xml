      The CLL2-BAG-trial is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase-II trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of a sequential regimen of a debulking with Bendamustine followed by an
      induction with GA101 (obinutuzumab) and ABT-199 (venetoclax, GDC-0199) followed by ABT-199
      and GA101-maintenance in CLL patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the CLL2-BAG-trial, a total of 62 patients of an allcomer CLL population (irrespective of
      physical fitness, previous therapies and prognostic factors) with an indication for treatment
      will be included. Patient will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with Bendamustine
      unless contraindications (e.g. refractoriness) are present or a debulking is not indicated
      due to a low tumor load. Afterwards, 6 cycles of induction treatment with GA101
      (obinutuzumab, 3 doses in the first cycle and monthly in cycles 2-6) and ABT-199 (venetoclax,
      continuously starting in cycle 2 with a low dose escalation) will be applied. The primary
      endpoint overall response rate will be assessed at final restaging (2 months after end of
      induction treatment). Patients benefitting from treatment receive further therapy with GA101
      (3 monthly) and ABT-199 (continuously) in a maintenance phase for up to 24 months.
      Maintenance treatment will be stopped in case of achievement of a complete remission and
      confirmation of MRD (minimal residual disease) negativity in peripheral blood or if
      unacceptable toxicity or progression occurs.
