      ABSTRACT Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory, chronic and
      progressive disease that can lead to joint destruction and important functional disability.
      Chronic inflammation, with a substantial increase in the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines
      in synovial joint, is one of the biggest challenges in controlling RA. Resistance exercise
      has been recognized for positively modulate inflammation in healthy subjects. Objective: To
      evaluate the effect of an acute bout of resistance exercise on serum concentrations of tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist(IL-1ra), interleukin 1 beta
      (IL-1β), C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in postmenopausal women with RA and women without
      the disease. Methods: 17 volunteers with RA and 17 without the disease, with a mean age of
      54.7 + 6.63 underwent a resistance exercise session with a set of 12 repetitions at 50% of
      one repetition maximum (1RM ) and a set of 8 repetitions at 75% of 1RM. The exercises
      performed were: knee extension, knee flexion, hip abduction and hip adduction. Blood samples
      were obtained 30 minutes before, 5 minutes before, immediately after, 1 hour, 2 hours and 24
      hours after the exercise session. Serum glucose concentrations prior to exercise were also
      measured. The investigators used the Student's't test, the model of analysis of variance with
      repeated measures and Bonferroni method of multiple comparisons to analyze the data, being
      considered statistically significant levels of p &lt;0.05.
