  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overdose with potential deadly outcome is a serious problem among opioid abusers, not least
      in Norway. To save lives, immediate treatment with a Î¼-opioid antidote such as naloxone is
      required. The purpose of this study is to explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      of naloxone in healthy volunteers under opioid influence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will be brought into a state of opioid influence in a well-known, short
      acting, controlled and safe manner using remifentanil. This will create a strong opioid
      effect inducing a miosis, reduced respiration and reduced sensation to pain, all three strong
      indicators of opiates. Naloxone will counteract these effects, which can be measured as a
      change in pupillary size. Blood samples for both naloxone and remifentanil will be also be
      taken.

      Naloxone is a well-known, well-tolerated drug with an excellent safety profile over many
      decades of use. The formulation used in this trial holds market authorization. Care will be
      taken not to include opioid users in this study as naloxone would precipitate acute
      withdrawal. Also possible drug misusers will be excluded as well as people who have access to
      remifentanil and infusion equipment in their daily work, although the abuse potential of this
      highly specialised drug is minimal. By weighing syringes before and after discharge the
      reliability of the dose delivered will be confirmed.
