  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disabling and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative
      disorder. There is no treatment that significantly slows progression. Increasing age is an
      important risk factor for developing ALS; thus, the societal impact of this devastating
      disease will become more profound as the population ages. A significant hurdle to finding
      effective treatment has been an inability to accurately measure brain degeneration in humans.
      Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques hold promise in this respect, and may
      assist in aiding diagnosis and the efficient testing of new drugs.

      Different MRI features of brain degeneration will be measured in a large sample of patients
      with ALS. The study will operate within the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium (CALSNIC).
      CALSNIC is a clinical research platform comprised of ALS clinics with standardized clinical
      and neuroimaging protocols.

      This study will use advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques to measure brain
      changes in ALS and related neurological conditions. Results from cognitive and neurological
      tests will be compared to the MRI. It is believed that these techniques will reveal changes
      in the brain that will help us understand normal brain function and the symptoms of
      neurological diseases as seen in ALS, as well to provide an objective measurement of
      degeneration (which is called a biomarker). This could improve not only the process by which
      new drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases are evaluated, but also how health care
      professionals address the needs of patients with these diseases.

      Furthermore, a biomarker may give insight into the biological factors related to the diverse
      and variable clinical features amongst different patients.

      Subjects will be recruited from ALS clinics that are a part of the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging
      Consortium (CALSNIC). Patients will have a diagnosis of ALS, PLS, PMA, or FTD. Healthy
      controls will be age and gender matched to patients. Subjects will visit their respective
      sites to undergo a clinical evaluation and an MRI. Follow up visits will occur at
      approximately 3-6 month intervals. Most subjects will have 2 follow up visits; more visits
      may occur for subjects who are physically able to continue in the protocol.

    <description>ALS patients (as well as patients with other motor neuron diseases such PLS and PMA) will be recruited from ALS clinics under the direction of ALS neurologists who are participating in this study. ALS patients should meet research criteria for possible, probable, probable laboratory-supported, or definite ALS. Patients with a history of CNS disease (e.g. stroke, head injury) or significant psychiatric disease will be ineligible. Patients must be able to undergo a brain MRI for approximately an hour.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with other psychiatric/CNS illnesses such as Major Depressive Disorder,
             Schizophrenia, and Bipolar disorder, and those with significant head injury.
