  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of lanabecestat on how the body absorbs and
      processes 3 other medications, midazolam, simvastatin and donepezil and how these 3
      medications affect lanabecestat when they are taken together. This study is in 2 cohorts,
      Cohort A is approximately 44 days long and Cohort B about 70 days only. The screening visit
      is required within 30 days prior to the start on the study

      Astra Zeneca (AZ) registered this trial as sponsor. In July, 2015, sponsorship changed to Eli
      Lilly and Company (Lilly). In August, 2015, AZ transferred this trial to Lilly's
      ClinicalTrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record. This trial is not an applicable
      trial under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA).
