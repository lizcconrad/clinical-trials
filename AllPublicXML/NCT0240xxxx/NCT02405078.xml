  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if performing blood tests and imaging
      scans at different time points during chemotherapy can help researchers predict if patients
      with DLBCL will respond to treatment.

      Study Visits:

      If you are found to be eligible, you will have the following tests and procedures performed
      during the 2 cycles of your already-scheduled chemotherapy.

      Within 5 days before Cycle 1 of chemotherapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease. You must fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 6 hours
           before this blood draw.

      On Days 2 and 3 of Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to
      check the status of the disease. You should fast for at least 6 hours before the Day 3 blood
      draw.

      On Day 4 of Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease. You must
           fast for at least 6 hours before this blood draw.

        -  During Cycle 1 only, you will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the
           disease.

      On Day 14 (+/- 5 days) of Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy:

      Â°Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the
      disease. You must fast for at least 6 hours before this blood draw.

      Within 5 days before the end of Cycle 2 of chemotherapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease. You must fast for at least 6 hours before this blood draw.

        -  You will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      Some of the blood collected on this study may be banked at the MD Anderson Lymphoma Tissue
      Bank under MD Anderson Protocol 2005-0656. You will be given a separate consent form that
      describes this banking.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over after the End-of-Study Visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 21 days (+/- 5 days) after the start of Cycle 2 of chemotherapy, you will have an
      FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      If the scan shows that the disease does not appear to be getting better, you will have a fine
      needle aspiration (FNA), core needle biopsy, and/or an excisional biopsy to check the status
      of the disease. To collect an FNA, a small amount of tissue is withdrawn through a needle. To
      perform a core needle biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed using a hollow core needle that
      has a cutting edge. To perform an excisional biopsy, the affected area is completely removed
      by cutting it out.

      Follow-Up:

      Researchers may collect information from your medical record after your participation in this
      study is over to check how you are doing.

      This is an investigational study. FDG-PET/CT scans on this study are performed using
      FDA-approved and commercially available methods.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>Response defined by the end of therapy FDG PET/CT result. Participants be classified as Responders and Non-Responders defined as: On the end of therapy FDG PET/CT scan, Non-Responders will have:
equivocal active disease with a positive biopsy for confirmation
unequivocal active disease in a previously biopsy-confirmed site of disease.
On the end of therapy PET/CT scan, Responders will lack either above criterion.
Participants who have an end of therapy FDG PET/CT scan with equivocal active disease with a negative biopsy for confirmation will be classified as Responders, but will also be analyzed separately to determine if a false positive or borderline true positive FDG PET/CT scan results in different outcomes.</description>

    <description>Participants receive 2 cycles of high dose chemotherapy (RICE or RDHAP) at discretion of treating physician. Four FDG PET/CT scans, five blood-based detection of tumor-specific clonotype tests, and five blood-based evaluations of the metabolic profile performed for each participant. With day 1 designated as start of chemotherapy, FDG PET/CT scans performed sequentially between day -21 - day 0 (baseline PET), day 4 (interim PET1, after completion of 1st high dose chemotherapy), day 21 (interim PET2, after completing 1st cycle of chemotherapy), and day 42 (end of therapy PET). Blood-based detection of tumor-specific clonotype and metabolic profile testing collected on day -5 - 0, day 4, day 8, day 21 and day 42.</description>
