      This objective study to verify the effect of physical training with and without behavioral
      cognitive therapy, compared with controls, in functional capacity and cardio-metabolic

      This study is a Randomized Clinical Trial, with individuals with morbid obesity, and will be
      consists of 3 groups:

        1. Group 1 (G1 EXERCISE): This group will participate in an physical exercise program twice
           a week in hospital.

        2. Group 2 (G2 - LIFESTYLE AND EXERCISE): This groups will receive the same G1 intervention
           associated with a weekly group followed up with techniques of cognitive behavioral
           therapy with a psychologist

        3. Group 3 (G3 - CONTROL): This group will keep medical appointments information and
           routine procedure in the hospital.

      Will be included in study the individuals with morbid obesity who do not have
      contraindications to practice low-intensity exercise.

      Exclusion criteria are contraindications to physical exercise, individuals with
      cardiovascular disease with reduced functional capacity (class III and IV of the New York
      Heart Association), orthopedic problems, severe retinopathy, severe neuropathy, drug addicts
      and severe mental illness, metabolic or blood pressure decompensated.

    <description>The group will Participate in an physical exercise program twice a week. This program consists of 20 minutes of aerobic exercises of low intensity (2-4 on the Borg scale) in the rhythm of different songs that encourage their implementation. After these exercises will be performed five minutes of stretching exercises.</description>

These groups worked techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy based on principles of learning, in order to promote and maintain new healthy behaviors, as well as the reduction or elimination of undesirable conduct.</description>
