      This is a retrospective chart review. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively examine
      the use of perioperative analgesics on the incidence of postoperative pain and emergence
      delirium in patients undergoing bilateral myringotomy with tube insertion (BTI), as well as
      events associated with treatment including postoperative vomiting and time to discharge.
