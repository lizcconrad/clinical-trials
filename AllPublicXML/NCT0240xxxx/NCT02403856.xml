  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff is a common cause of chronic pain of the shoulder.
      Needling and lavage of the calcification is one of the therapeutic options after failure of
      conservative management with physiotherapy and anti-inflammatory drugs. Needling is usually
      followed by a corticosteroid injection in the subacromial bursae in order to prevent acute
      pain reaction due to the intervention. However, the relevance of this injection has never
      been proven. Moreover, corticosteroid could prevent the inflammatory reaction induced by the
      needling and thus the body's natural calcium resorption processes. Finally, corticosteroids
      could have deleterious effect on the tendon structures and favour local infection. Our
      hypothesis is that corticosteroid have no significant effect on acute pain after needling and
      therefore should not been performed systematically after needling.
