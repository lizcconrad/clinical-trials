  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is an advanced form of mammography which is
      performed after injection of contrast or dye into a vein in the arm. This dye is the same dye
      that is used for CT scans. This type of mammogram includes a regular mammogram as well as
      additional pictures with the dye.

      This particular study is being done to determine if by adding the dye in the veins the
      investigators are better able to identify the cause of the lump than if they just did the
      regular mammogram alone.

    <description>(PPV) will be defined using three distinct definitions: (1) PPV1 is the proportion of women with a positive assessment who had a cancer diagnosis in the follow-up period. (2) PPV2 is the proportion of women with a recommendation for biopsy who had a cancer diagnosis in the follow-up period. (3) PPV3 is the proportion of women with a biopsy recommendation and a biopsy performed within 1 year who had a cancer diagnosis in the follow-up period. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the proportion of women with a negative assessment who did not have a cancer diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Women presenting to MSKCC with a palpable abnormality within the breast either self palpated &amp; or palpated by their physician will be offered CESM instead of FFDM alone. The breast imager assigned to care for the patient will interpret the low energy images (including any additional views they routinely obtain) &amp; record their findings. They will then interpret the CESM &amp; record those results. As per standard of care, the patient will have a targeted ultrasound as well. Appropriate clinical recommendations will be made. In patients with no specific imaging findings, follow-up will be determined by the degree of suspicion of the palpable finding &amp; will either be called negative &amp; followed clinically if not suspicious, or will go on to MRI , percutaneous biopsy by a surgeon or surgical biopsy if suspicious.</description>
