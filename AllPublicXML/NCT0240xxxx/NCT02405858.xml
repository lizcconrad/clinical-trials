  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of participants achieving
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response by 12 weeks of therapy from baseline according to
      Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, non-randomized, multi-center (when more than one hospital work on a
      medical research study), open label (identity of study drug will be known to participant and
      study staff), single arm study of abiraterone acetate to investigate its efficacy and safety
      in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who failed the
      first-line combined androgen blockade (CAB) therapy. The study consists of Screening Phase
      (28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1), Treatment Phase (up to 2 years), Post Treatment Phase (30
      days after the last dose of study drug). Participants will receive 1000 milligram (mg) (four
      250 mg tablets) of abiraterone acetate orally once daily. In addition, 5 mg of oral
      prednisolone will be concomitantly administered twice a day (10 mg per day). A 28-daily
      dosing cycle will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is
      observed. The total duration of study will be 2 years. Participants will be primarily
      evaluated for PSA response. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

Total score ranges from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating more pain.</description>
