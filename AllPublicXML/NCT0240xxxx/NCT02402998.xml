  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter phase II trial designed to evaluate the activity of
      Eltrombopag second line treatment in adult patients with primary Immune Thrombocytopenia
      (ITP) not responsive or in relapse after a full first line steroids treatment (prednisone or
      dexamethasone) ± Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG).

             from diagnosis);

          4. Patients not responsive or in relapse after a full course of steroid therapy
             (prednisone 1 mg/kg/d for at least 28 days or 3 cycles of dexamethasone 40 mg/day for
             consecutive 4 days, according to the GIMEMA ITP0207 trial) ± IVIG;

          5. Patients have a platelet count &lt; 10 x 109/L documented in a single blood cell count;

          6. Patients have bleeding symptoms and a platelet count &gt; 10 &lt; 30 x 109/L documented in a
             single blood cell count;

          7. Patients have no bleeding symptoms and a platelet count &gt;10 &lt; 30 x 109/L in at least 2
             blood cell counts at 3 days interval in the week preceding the enrollment with the
             last count at the day of enrollment;

          8. Patients have corticosteroids or IVIG dependence (the need for ongoing or repeated
             doses administration of corticosteroids or IVIG to maintain a platelet count ≥ 30 x
             109/L and/or to avoid bleeding;

          9. Written informed consent obtained from the subject;

         10. Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior
             vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception from time of enrollment until 6
             months after the last dose of study treatment;

         11. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study; for this
             study population, non-childbearing potential is defined as current tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause; OR

         12. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject
             has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to start of Eltrombopag, has a
             negative pregnancy test within 14 days of first dose of Eltrombopag, and has agreed to
             continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 6 months
             after completion of the treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of secondary ITP. As far as patients with immune thrombocytopenia and
             antiphospholipid antibodies positivity, individuals without a previous thromboembolic
             event are excluded only if lupus anticoagulant (LAC) is associated with the presence
             of anticardiolipin (aCL) and aβ2-Glycoprotein I (aβ2GPI) antibodies;

          2. Previous treatment with other anti-ITP second line therapies (i.e. Rituximab,
             Azathioprine, Cyclosporin-A or other); only patients with a previous full course of
             steroid (see inclusion criteria for definition) ± IVIG are admitted to the study;

          3. Previous treatment with any TPO-R agonists;

          4. Patients have life threatening bleeding complications;

          5. Patients had deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or arterial thrombosis in the 3 months
             preceding the enrollment;

          6. Patients are HIV, HCV, HBsAg positive;

          7. Patients with hepatic impairment (i.e. mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment
             (Child-Pugh score &gt; 6);

          8. Patients have a well established liver disease that represents a contraindication for
             the use of Eltrombopag;

          9. Patients are unable to respect the 4-hour interval between Eltrombopag and other
             medications (e.g. antacids), calcium-rich foods (e.g. dairy products and calcium
             fortified juices), or supplements containing polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium,
             aluminium, magnesium, selenium, and zinc;

         10. Patients are unable to stop medications that are known to cause a drug-drug
             interaction with Eltrombopag;

         11. Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in an Eltrombopag
             study:

               -  Lactating female.

               -  History of another malignancy. Exception: subjects who have been disease-free for
                  5 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin
                  cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.

               -  Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder, or other
                  conditions that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent
                  or compliance with the study procedures.

               -  Hormone replacement therapy. Subjects must discontinue hormone replacement
                  therapy prior to study enrollment due to the potential for inhibition of
                  Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins.

               -  Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives,
                  whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of study treatment.

               -  Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to
                  drugs chemically related to Eltrombopag or excipients that contraindicate their
                  participation.
