  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical insufficiency (CI), responsible for 8% of preterm births (PB), is used to describe
      painless cervical dilation leading to recurrent second-trimester pregnancy losses/births of
      otherwise normal pregnancies. Structural weakness of cervical tissue was thought to cause or
      contribute to these adverse outcomes. The term has also been applied to women with one or two
      such losses/births or at risk for second-trimester pregnancy loss/birth. Cervical pessary and
      cervical cerclage are both considered as preventive treatments in women at risk for PB. This
      study aims to demonstrate that the cervical pessary could reduce the preterm birth rate
      before 37 weeks of gestation in women with prior PB due to cervical insufficiency or in women
      with prior PB and a short cervix in the current pregnancy.

      Methods/Design: This is an open-label, pilot, multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled
      trial (RCT). Enrolees are women with singleton pregnancies and previous PB based on CI
      (primary intervention, &lt;16 weeks) or in case of previous PB and a short cervical length in
      current pregnancy ≤ 25 mm (secondary intervention, &lt;24 weeks). Women are randomised (1:1)
      either to cervical cerclage or pessary treatment. The primary outcome is the spontaneous
      preterm birth rate before 34 weeks of gestation. The sample size was calculated, as a pilot
      study, based on the estimated population that we will be able to recruit during the duration
      of the trial: 60 women, 30 for each group (cervical cerclage and cervical pessary group) to
      observe, at least a reduction in the PB rate &lt; 34 weeks from 34% to 27% in the pessary group,
      as does cerclage.

      Discussion: The outcome of this study will show the effectiveness of a cervical cerclage and
      of a cervical pessary in this group of patients.
