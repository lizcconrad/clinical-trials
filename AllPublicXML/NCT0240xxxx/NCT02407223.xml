  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in adult
      participants with active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA) measured by the
      reduction in signs and symptoms of nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in the treatment of participants with active
      non-radiographic axial spondylo arthritis. Participants will receive either placebo or
      ustekinumab 45 or 90 milligram (mg). Participants will primarily be assessed for Assessment
      of Spondylo Arthritis (ASAS) International Society criteria 20 at Week 24. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This study was stopped because ustekinumab did not achieve key endpoints in a related study.
    The safety profile was consistent with past ustekinumab studies.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 20 Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS measures symptomatic improvement in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) participants in 4 domains: participant global assessment of disease activity, pain, function, inflammation. ASAS 20 = 20 percent (%) improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;= 10 units on a 0-10 scale (0=no disease activity; 10=high disease activity) for &gt;= 3 domains, and no worsening in remaining domain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving ASAS 40 at Weeks 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS 40 = 40% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;= 20 units on a 0-10 scale (0=no disease activity, 10=high disease activity) for &gt;= 3 domains, and no worsening in remaining domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is participant assessment of discomfort, pain and fatigue measured using a 10 centimeter Visual Analog Scale (VAS); range: 0=none to 10=very severe. BASDAI 50 response is defined as at least a 50 percent (%) improvement (decrease) from baseline to observation in the BASDAI score. Baseline score minus score at observation divided by Baseline score * 100 should be &gt;=50%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participant Who Achieve ASDAS (CRP) Inactive Disease (&lt;1.3) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS-CRP was derived from back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global score and peripheral pain/swelling. The scores were categorized as follows : inactive disease(&lt; 1.3), moderate (1.3 - &lt; 2.1), high (2.1 - 3.5) and very high disease activity ( &gt; 3.5).</description>

At Week 16, participants in placebo group with &lt; 10% improvement from baseline in both total back pain and morning stiffness measures at Week 12 and 16 will enter early escape to receive ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg at Weeks 16, 20, and 28 followed by every 12 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 52, participants who achieved inactive disease by ASDAS (ESR) &lt;1.3 at both Week 40 and 52 will be re-randomized to receive placebo or ustekinumab every 12 weeks up to Week 88. At Week 52, participants who did not achieve inactive disease by ASDAS (ESR) &lt;1.3 at Week 40 or 52 will continue with ustekinumab every 12 weeks up to Week 88.
