      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the PRECIZON
      Presbyopic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical evaluation with a 3 months
      follow-up. The PRECIZON Presbyopic is a lens intended for implantation in the capsular bag,
      indicated for optical correction of aphakia in adults whom the crystalline lens has been
      removed and who desire presbyopia correction. The main objective is to evaluate the ability
      of the PRECIZON Presbyopic to provide near, intermediate and distance vision in patients
      undergoing cataract extraction / Clear Lens Exchange (CLE) and intraocular lens implantation.
      Study results will be used for CE-approval and registration and marketing purposes.

          -  Patient lifestyle and outlook fit with multifocal IOL implantation

          -  Qualifies for bilateral implantation

          -  Patient must have a calculated IOL power within the available diopter range

          -  Expected best corrected visual acuity of 0.5 Snellen decimal or better after IOL

             disorders)

          -  Acute or chronic disease or illness or use of medication that could confound the
             outcome of the study or increase the risk to the subject

          -  Endothelial cell count &lt;1500 cells/mm2

          -  Amblyopia

          -  Congenital eye abnormalities

          -  Previous ocular surgery that might confound the outcome of the investigation or
             increase risk to patient

          -  Concurrent participation or participation during the last 30 days in any other
             clinical trial

          -  Patient must not be pregnant or has another condition with associated fluctuation of
             hormones that could lead to refractive changes
