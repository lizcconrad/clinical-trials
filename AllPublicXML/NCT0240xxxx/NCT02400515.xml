      This quasi-experimental study aim to evaluate the effect of moderate aerobic exercise on
      glucose and lipid metabolism as well as the scales of anxiety and depression and levels of
      salivary cortisol in women with type 2 diabetes.

      This quasi-experimental study aim to performed a 12-week training program (3 times/week, 60
      minutes per session) which consisted of a supervised moderate aerobic exercise previously
      determined (50% to 70% of maximal Heart Rate) in women with type 2 diabetes.
