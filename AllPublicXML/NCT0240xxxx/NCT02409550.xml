      This project is an observational study for the Italian language validation of the CARATKids
      questionnaire investigating the asthma and coexisting allergic rhinitis control in children.
      113 patients with concomitant asthma and allergic rhinitis followed up from at least 3 months
      will be enrolled for the validation process at outpatient clinic of Pediatric Allergology &amp;
      Pulmonology (PAP) of Respiratory Disease Research Center (RDRC) within the Institute of
      Biomedicine and Molecular Immunology (IBIM) of the National Research Council (CNR) of Palermo
      (RDRC-IBIM CNR), Italy.

      The study will be completed in two medical examination, within 3-6 weeks of each other.
