    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators hypothesize that antidepressant therapy may improve the
      overall welling of patients with acute or chronic kidney disease when given around the time
      of starting chronic dialysis therapy. This study is a pilot, randomized controlled trial that
      aims to examine whether prescribing oral escitalopram to all incident dialysis patients is
      safe and feasible.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 120,000 people with kidney disease start chronic dialysis therapy across North America
      each year. In addition to high mortality, studies uniformly report high rates of depression,
      pain and non-specific symptoms after dialysis is started. Suicide rates are high,
      particularly early in the treatment history, and withdrawal from dialysis is increasingly
      common in recent years, suggesting a high burden of depressive symptoms. While various
      treatments appear to be effective, there are multiple barriers preventing patients from
      getting or accepting appropriate care for depression. The investigators hypothesize that
      antidepressant therapy may improve morbidity and mortality when prescribed to patients with
      acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD) around the time of starting chronic dialysis therapy.

      This is a phase II, multi-centre, double blind, randomized controlled trial to compare the
      safety and feasibility of oral escitalopram to placebo in incident dialysis patients. Those
      who have started chronic dialysis therapy within 12 weeks of being identified will be
      eligible for the study. Participants will randomized 1:1 to receive either escitalopram or
      placebo daily for 26 weeks.

      The primary outcome is feasibility in terms of recruitment rates and protocol compliance. The
      secondary outcomes include estimates of safety (adverse events) and efficacy (hospitalization
      days, mortality, and changes in depression and quality of life scores). This pilot trial is
      intended to guide and inform the design of a full scale study to evaluate whether the routine
      use of escitalopram can improve the quality of life and hospital free days in patients on
      dialysis, as compared to placebo.
