      RO5126766 will be administered initially as a single daily dose of 4mg using either a twice
      weekly dosing schedule (Monday-Thursday) or a 3 times per week dosing schedule
      (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). The daily dose will be given orally according to the dosing
      schedule. A cycle of treatment will comprise 28 days. In Part I of the study both the twice
      weekly and the three times per week schedules will be assessed. In the absence of dose
      limiting toxicities 6 patients will be recruited to each dosing schedule cohort. In the event
      of a DLT being observed in Part I of the study, a single dose reduction to 3.2 mg will then
      be instigated and up to 6 patients will be recruited to that dosing schedule at the lower
      dose. The optimal dosing schedule determined in Part I will be taken forward to Part II and
      20 patients with tumours harbouring BRAF, KRAS and NRAS mutations will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre Phase I trial evaluating two intermittent dosing schedules.

      Part I: A total of six patients will be enrolled to each dosing schedule and based on
      assessment of toxicity, PK and PD data the optimal schedule will be taken forward into Part
      II (see below).

      Patients will be treated on a 4-weekly cycle with a single daily dose of 4 mg of RO5126766 on
      either the twice weekly (Monday &amp; Thursday) or three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday and
      Friday) schedule. Six patients will be enrolled per arm and after all patients have received
      at least one cycle of treatment, safety data and available PK/PD data will be reviewed by the
      Safety Review Committee (SRC). On the basis of the previous Phase I trial, dose limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) are not expected at a dose of 4 mg but in the event of ≥ 2 DLT's occurring
      in (a) the 2 x weekly arm, then no further patients will recruited into that arm and the
      schedule will not be taken forward to Part II, or (b) the 3 x weekly arm, a single dose
      reduction to 3.2mg on the same dosing schedule will be implemented and 6 patients enrolled at
      the reduced dose. If 4 mg given 3 x weekly is considered non-tolerable then the SRC may
      decide to enrol patients to the 3.2 mg dose level in the absence of dose limiting toxicity.

      Selection of the optimum schedule from Part I will be made by the Safety Review Committee and
      will be the schedule that delivers the highest, tolerable, cumulative weekly dose. Therefore
      selection will be as follows:

        -  If both the 2 x weekly (Mon &amp; Thurs) and 3 x weekly (Mon, Wed &amp; Fri) schedule are
           tolerated at 4 mg i.e. &lt; 2 DLT's out of a 6 patients in each schedule, then the 3 x
           weekly schedule will be selected.

        -  If the 3 x weekly schedule requires a dose reduction to 3.2 mg and the 2 x weekly
           schedule is tolerated at 4 mg then PD data will be evaluated relative to AUC to aid the
           selection.

        -  If ≥2 DLT's occur out of 6 patients in both schedules (despite the 3 x weekly arm being
           dose reduced), Part II will not be initiated and the study will be terminated.

      Part II: Once the optimal dosing schedule has been established 20 patients with either solid
      tumours or multiple myeloma with documented KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutations will be enrolled.

             inhibitors).

         14. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of RO5126766. Participation in an
