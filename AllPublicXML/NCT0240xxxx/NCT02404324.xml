  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective study is the treatment of esotropia by prescribing the full
      precise optical correction of refractive errors in children up to 3 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation includes children with esotropia associated with hyperopia, hypermetropic
      astigmatism, myopia, myopic astigmatism and minor ametropias. All children are prescribed
      full optical correction of refractive errors with special attention to astigmatism up to 0.5
      Dpt to achieve maximal clear image on the retina of both eyes.If necessary, direct occlusion
      or penalization were administered to the children. The investigators suggest that this
      approach will give good results in the treatment of esotropia.
