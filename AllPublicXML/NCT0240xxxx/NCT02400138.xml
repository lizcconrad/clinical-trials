  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weakness of the respiratory muscles demonstrated by individuals with stroke, may generate
      important symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea. Since adequate strength of the inspiratory
      and expiratory muscles is required, mainly when performing physical activities,
      rehabilitation interventions for stroke subjects should include respiratory training. This
      study will test the hypothesis that home-based combined training of the inspiratory and
      expiratory muscles is effective in improving strength of the inspiratory and expiratory
      muscles, endurance of the inspiratory muscles, dyspnea, walking capacity, and ocurrence of
      respiratory complications after stroke. For this clinical trial, people after stroke will be
      randomly allocated into either experimental or control/sham groups. The experimental group
      will undertake training of the inspiratory plus expiratory muscles with the Orygen Dual Valve
      device, regulated at 50% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory and exp√≠ratory pressure values,
      seven times/week over eight weeks during 40 minutes/day. The control group will undertake the
      same protocol, but the participants will receive the devices without resistance. At baseline,
      post intervention, and four weeks after the cessation of the intervention, researchers
      blinded to group allocations will collect the following outcome measures: maximal inspiratory
      and expiratory pressures, inspiratory endurance, dyspnea, walking capacity, and ocurrence of
      respiratory complications.

      Rationale: Weakness of the respiratory muscles demonstrated by individuals with stroke, may
      generate important symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea. Since adequate strength of the
      inspiratory and expiratory muscles is required, mainly when performing physical activities,
      rehabilitation interventions for stroke subjects should include respiratory training.

      Aim: This study will test the hypothesis that home-based combined inspiratory muscular
      training (IMT) plus expiratory muscular training (EMT) program is effective in improving
      strength of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, endurance of the inspiratory muscles,
      dyspnea, walking capacity, and ocurrence of respiratory complications after stroke.

      Design: For this prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, people after stroke
      will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control/sham groups. The experimental
      group will undertake training of the inspiratory plus expiratory muscles with the Orygen Dual
      Valve, regulated at 50% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal
      expiratory pressure (MEP) values, seven times/week over eight weeks during 40 minutes/day.
      The control group will undertake the same protocol, but the participants will receive the
      devices without resistance. At baseline, post intervention, and four weeks after the
      cessation of the intervention, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect all
      outcome measures.

      Study outcomes: Primary outcomes will be MIP. Secondary outcomes will include MEP,
      inspiratory endurance, dyspnea, walking capacity, and ocurrence of respiratory complications.

    <description>Respiratory training will include training of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles seven times per week over eight weeks, during 40 minutes per day, divided into two 20-min sessions (morning and afternoon). Each 20-min session comprised 4-min sets of respiratory training, followed by 1-min rest between the sets. The training program will be carried-out with the Orygen Dual Valve device, regulated at 50% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure values. Once a week, the treating physiotherapist performed a home visit, measured the current values of inspiratory and expiratory strength, and progressed the load to 50% of the new values.</description>

    <description>The control/sham group will underwent exactly the same protocol and weekly monitoring at home, but the participants will receive the devices without resistance of the spring, which will be also concealed. The control group will also attend the weekly sessions and undergo the same procedures, except for the load adjustments. If the training proves to be effective, the control subjects will be informed and have the choice to receive the training with proper loads.</description>
