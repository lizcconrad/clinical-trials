    <textblock>
      In response to the Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&amp;D) Deployment Health Research,
      this study addresses the delivery of an evidenced-based vocational rehabilitation,
      specifically Individual Placement and Support (IPS), for Veterans who often face unemployment
      and mental illness as they try to recovery from illness and re-establish civilian life. This
      study provides the requisite evidence needed to guide VHA as to whether to expand the target
      population for IPS to all Veterans with a mental disorder, delivered directly within the
      primary care setting (i.e. Patient Aligned Care Team; PACT). Such modifications in VHA
      practice could substantially improve Veteran vocational rehabilitation access and outcomes,
      moving a significantly greater number of disabled Veterans back to full and productive lives
      in the community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan wars often confront unemployment as
      they reintegrate into civilian life. Over the past two decades, studies of Individual
      Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment have yielded remarkably robust and
      consistent vocational rehabilitation outcomes. However, IPS has predominantly only been
      studied in mental health settings and in the seriously mentally ill populations. Access to a
      mental health setting for recently deployed Veterans is often delayed by months or years, and
      thus, result in substantial delay of referrals to vocational rehabilitation programs which
      leave many Veterans vulnerable to continued unemployment and a deteriorating trajectory.

      Methods: This is a single site, prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy of IPS when delivered within a primary care Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) serving
      Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND)
      Veterans. Participants will be Veterans from OEF/OIF/OND and all other Southwest Asia
      operations (i.e. since 1992) receiving care in the primary care PACT who are currently
      unemployed and have a disabling or potentially disabling Axis I diagnosis, other than a
      serious mental illness and will be randomized 1:1 to either IPS or the VHA standard of care
      which may include Transitional Work Program. Compared to usual care which may include
      Transitional Work Program (control condition), IPS delivered within a PACT is hypothesized to
      result in a higher rate of steady workers, as defined by working &gt;50% of the weeks in the
      12-month follow-up period in a competitive job (primary); quality of life, and self esteem
      (secondary), improved community re-integration (exploratory), improved psychiatric symptoms
      (exploratory), and lower rates of high intensity crisis events/services (exploratory). In
      addition, IPS delivered within a PACT will be feasible and yield very good Veteran
      satisfaction.

      Significance: In an innovative approach, this study breaks from the diagnostic categorical
      approach and the mental health treatment setting and evaluates the efficacy of IPS when
      delivered in a primary care setting, specifically a PACT that serves Veterans who have
      returned from the Iraq, Afghanistan, and other Southwest Asia conflicts. Making a substantial
      paradigm shift, this study will integrate IPS within a PACT for the first time ever. The
      research is directly linked to the RR&amp;D priority areas of improving vocational outcomes and
      promoting recovery in Veterans.

    <description>The Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) developed by Frisch is a 32-item self-report measure of life satisfaction that takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. The Frisch QOLI recognizes social integration, which takes into account a persons' capacity to exercise connectedness and citizenship.</description>

    <description>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) is a widely used, public domain, 10-item self-report Likert-type questionnaire that asks participants to indicate the degree of their agreement or disagreement with statements about their self-esteem and self-depreciation.</description>

    <measure>Community Reintegration of Service Members</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Community Reintegration of Service Members (CRIS) is a self-report instrument used to evaluate the Veteran's reintegration into the community. The correlations between the CRIS and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scales of role physical, role emotional, and social functioning were 0.44-0.80 and the CRIS has strong reliability, conceptual integrity, and construct validity. In pilot studies with 126 veterans, working subjects had better CRIS scores then unemployed subjects. Items on the CRIS cover 9 aspects of participation: (1) Learning and Applying Knowledge, (2) General Tasks and Demands, (3) Communication, (4) Mobility, (5) Self-care, (6) Domestic Life, (7) Interpersonal Relationships, (8) Major Life Areas, and (9) Community, Social and Civic Life. Subscale scores for 1) extent of participation, 2) perceived limitations, and 3) satisfaction with participation are calculated.</description>

    <description>Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) is a 90-item self-report questionnaire that assesses nine constructs: somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic-anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. Coefficients of internal consistency range from 0.79 to 0.90 and test-retest stability is very good (r = 0.78 - 0.90). Some evidence supports the sensitivity of the SCL-90-R to changes due to treatment.</description>
