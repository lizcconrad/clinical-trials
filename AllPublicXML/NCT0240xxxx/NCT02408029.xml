      This study is being performed to obtain data about the CORA System when used in a trauma
      clinical setting. The CORA analyzer is a new device that is currently being tested in trauma
      clinical applications and is not yet cleared for this purpose by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for sale in the United States.

      The purpose of the study is to validate the CORA System by comparing the results of this test
      to that of the standard of care device called the TEG 5000 system. Both systems evaluate
      hemostasis, a highly complex and interactive process involving many protein and cellular
      elements, especially platelets, occurring in a series of interrelated phases, which results
      in either normal hemostasis or a tendency toward bleeding or clotting complications.

      The study protocol specifies testing using multiple reagents which are similar for both the
      CORA and TG 5000 systems. Tests are run in duplicate on blood samples taken from patients
      undergoing treatment for injuries and trauma. Following the protocol defined in CLSI Standard
      EP09-A2, equivalence between the two systems will be demonstrated if the conclusions from the
      Standard Section 7, Interpreting Results and Comparing to Internal Performance Criteria, are
      found to be acceptable.

      All blood samples drawn for this study will use venous blood. Only citrated or heparinized
      whole blood samples are used. All samples are tested twice (run in duplicate). Quality
      Control procedures are run on both instruments at a frequency specified by the manufacturers.
      Results obtained from this testing are not used to make treatment decisions.
