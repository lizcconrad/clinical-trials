    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, Phase II study of crenolanib as maintenance in AML patients with FLT3
      mutations who have achieved complete remission (CR) after allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation. Oral crenolanib will be administered daily post-transplant for up to two
      years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two patient subgroups: 1) those who were in complete remission (CR) at the time of
      transplant, and 2) those who were not in complete remission (NCR) at the time of transplant.
      Start of crenolanib therapy at 100 mg TID is intended at the earliest time no sooner than 30
      days but no later than 90 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients may take
      crenolanib continuously for up to 728 days or until one of the criteria for study
      discontinuation is fulfilled.
