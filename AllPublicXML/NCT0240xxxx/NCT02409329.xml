  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a mobile phone-delivered intervention, called REACH (Rapid
      Education/Encouragement And Communications for Health), in supporting adults with type 2
      diabetes in their self-management relative to a control group. The goal of this study is to
      determine if individually tailored content (based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral
      Skills Model) delivered to the participant via text messages can improve the participant's
      glycemic control and adherence to diabetes medications. We will test whether our intervention
      improves adherence-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills and whether
      improving these mechanisms drives improvements in adherence and, in turn, glycemic control.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive REACH text messages (individual-focused text messaging tailored to user's individual barriers to adherence and targeted to address other self-care behaviors) for 12 months.
All participants will also receive text messages advising how to access their study A1c test results, receive quarterly newsletters on healthy living with diabetes, and have access to a Helpline for study- and diabetes medication-related questions.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In addition to the REACH text messages tailored to user's individual barriers to adherence, participants will receive FAMS components (monthly phone coaching and text messages supporting a goal set in coaching, plus the option to invite a family member/support person to receive text messages) for six months. After six months, participants in this arm will receive REACH text messages only.
All participants will also receive text messages advising how to access their study A1c test results, receive quarterly newsletters on healthy living with diabetes, and have access to a Helpline for study- and diabetes medication-related questions.</description>
