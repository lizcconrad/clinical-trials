      This study was designed to examine the effect of incentive spirometry in pulmonary
      rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy. The incentive spirometer, a device that can
      help improve breathing and strengthen inspiratory muscles. If the patient assigned to
      training group, the subjects started to respiratory muscle strengthening exercise using
      incentive spirometry. The training was performed ten sessions daily, for 4 weeks. Respiratory
      function tests including forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, Peak
      cough flow, maximal phonation time were compared before interventions and at the end of
      exercise.

    <description>The incentive spirometer, a device that can help improve breathing and strengthen inspiratory muscles. First, the subjects exhaled normally, then placed the mouthpiece in their mouth and sealed their lips around the mouthpiece. Then they inhaled slowly and deeply with their lips sealed tightly on the mouthpiece. After they inhaled as deeply as possible, held their breath for at least 3 seconds, and then removed the mouthpiece from their mouth and breathed out normally. Subjects repeated this technique 10-15 times. When they finished 10-15 exercises, they took a deep breath and coughed. The training was performed ten sessions daily, for 4 weeks.</description>
