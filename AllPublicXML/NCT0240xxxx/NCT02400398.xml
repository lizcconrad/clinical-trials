  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of both pancreatic adenocarcinoma and cachexia
      defined as greater than 5% unintentional weight loss within 6 months prior to screening
      visit. Patients must be greater than 18 years of age; and have greater than 3 months life
      expectancy.

      This study will observe a standard of care intervention (tube feeding) for potential benefit.
      Peptamen will be administered through a jejunal or a gastrojejunal feeding tube and dosing
      will be calculated using the Mifflin St. Jeor equation. It will be administered daily for the
      duration of the protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will prospectively evaluate advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients
      with cachexia, who are receiving enteral feeding, with a peptide based diet (medical food),
      through a jejunal or gastrojejunal feeding tube. We plan to collect serum samples routinely
      and establish a cohort of patients with this clinical syndrome. Our aims are to establish the
      feasibility and efficacy of enteral nutrition and its relationship to meaningful clinical
      outcomes. Furthermore, we will assess for a correlation between cachexia, activity, and
      patient reported outcomes on domains of quality of life in an optional activity tracker
      sub-study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced or locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients (can include new or recurrent
             diagnosis) referred to SOCCI-CSMC for chemotherapy

          -  Cachexia defined as greater than 5% unexplained weight loss within 6 months prior to
             screening visit or consultation with medical oncologist

          -  Candidate for enteral feeding with Peptamen, a peptide based formula. Must have
             jejunal or gastrojejunal tube either previously placed or at least prior to Day 1 of
             study

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Greater than or equal to 3 month life expectancy

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent

          -  May have received prior anti-cancer treatment, complete or partial resection of
             primary tumor

          -  Patients must be ambulatory and have access to a smart phone to participate in the
             activity tracker sub-study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Malignant ascites requiring paracenteses

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Bowel obstruction, partial or total

          -  Pregnancy
