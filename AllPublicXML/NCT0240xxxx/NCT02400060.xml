  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies a telephone-based intervention to see if it increases adherence to
      adjuvant hormonal therapy in patients with breast cancer. Increasing communication between
      doctors and patients with breast cancer may help patients to better follow recommendations on
      taking adjuvant hormonal treatment medication. A telephone-based intervention may help to
      increase doctor-patient communication and patients' adherence to their prescribed medication.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pilot test intervention effects on adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy (AHT) and
      explore trends in the adherence outcomes by demographic and psychosocial factors defined as
      acceptance, continuation, and adherence.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility of study design defined as recruitment rate, rate of using intervention as
      instructed, rate of protocol completion, and completion of psycho-social questionnaires which
      have been associated with adherence to AHT in the existing literature (i.e., depression,
      social support, pain, stress, fatigue, quality of life, pill taking attitude and behavior,
      perceived risk of breast cancer recurrence).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Surveying patients and physicians regarding their comments on the intervention components
      (i.e., video, text messaging, and app [application]) and overall study participation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daily text messages reminding them to take AHT and weekly interactive
      surveys delivered by a smart phone app for 3 months.

Logistic regression will be used to explore whether any trends are observed in the outcomes by demographic or psychosocial factors. Mediation analyses will be conducted to determine if any of the psychosocial measures are mediators of compliance. Weekly compliance (number of days reported taking medication) via the text messaging system will be examined longitudinally to assess whether a change over time was observed.</description>
