  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the administration of multiple doses of
      Oxycodone Hydrochloride plus Naltrexone Hydrochloride (a) or Oxycodone Hydrochloride plus
      Naltrexone Hydrochloride (b) in patients who have undergone primary, unilateral, distal first
      metatarsal bunionectomy with osteotomy and internal fixation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oxycodone/naltrexone (a) and
      oxycodone/naltrexone (b) versus placebo. During the blinded phase of the study (inpatient
      portion) the dosing regimen is 1 capsule containing Oxycodone Hydrochloride plus Naltrexone
      Hydrochloride (a) or Oxycodone plus Naltrexone Hydrochloride (b) or placebo taken with 4 to 6
      ounces (oz) of water every 6 hours (q6h) for 48 hours following the first dose (Multiple-dose
      Period) while in-house. Then for the open-label phase of the study (outpatient portion)
      dosing will occur every 4 to 6 hours prn with Oxycodone plus naltrexone. The active and
      placebo study medications will appear identical. Study subjects with acute postoperative pain
      of moderate to severe intensity following unilateral bunionectomy surgery will be randomized
      after surgery, and will stay at the study center for the duration of the 48-hour double-blind
      period after dose 1 of study medication. The study will be conducted in the following 4
      periods: 1) a pre-treatment period, 2) a multiple-dose inpatient period (double-blind), 3) a
      multiple-dose outpatient period (open-label), and 4) End of Study/Follow-up.
