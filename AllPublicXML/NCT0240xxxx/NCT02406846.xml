  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have the potential to provide a surrogate for'real-time
      biopsy' of tumor biological activity. Enumeration and molecular characterization of CTCs in
      pancreatic cancer could play an important role in diagnosis, predicting the risk for tumor
      recurrence, and providing novel target therapy biomarkers.In view of these facts, We wanted
      to demonstrate the value of multiparameter flow cytometry in detecting human tumor cells of
      pancreatic cancer in normal peripheral blood after cryosurgery with or without dendritic
      cell(DC)-cytokine-induced killers(CIK) treatment, and we also compared the specificity with
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1 day before and 2 days after cryosurgery with or without DC-CIK treatment，approximately
      17-mL ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid(EDTA)-blood was drawn by vein puncture from patients
      with pancreatic cancer and healthy volunteers. The blood of the healthy volunteers will be
      used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity and as negative control cells. To avoid
      contamination with skin cells, 2 mL blood will be discarded before the study samples will be
      taken.Briefly, the mononucleate cells will be separated from the blood over Ficoll- Paque for
      20 min with 1800g at 4℃. The interface cells will be removed and washed, and the red blood
      cells(RBCs) will be removed using a lysis buffer followed by a repeated wash. The mononuclear
      cells will be counted and aliquot for RT-PCR and multiparameter flow cytometry on the basis
      of at least 2-3×106 cells for each methodology. The cell pellet will be resuspended in
      phosphate-buffered saline for multiparameter flow cytometry and in Trizol reagent for RT-PCR.
      Aim : Identification of CTCs may lead to better diagnosis and prognosis and could help to
      choose an adequate therapy.
