      Objectives: Investigating the effectiveness of soft tissue mobilization in babies with
      congenital muscular torticollis and deformational plagiocephaly.

      Design: A Randomized controlled trial design Setting: University research department
      Participants:Babies with congenital muscular torticollis, aged between 0-6 months, who had a
      head tilt from 5 to 20 degrees and no other health problems were the participants of the
      study. The study included two groups; home program group was seen once every six weeks, the
      study group in addition to the home program also received soft tissue mobilization three
      times in a week. All groups received a baseline home program consisting of positioning,
      handling strategies plus stretching, stretching and strengthening exercises, environmental
      adaptations and classical massage. Babies were allocated to two groups by sealed envelope
      randomization. Babies were evaluated initially, at sixth weeks, at 12 weeks and follow-up at
      18 weeks with muscle function scale, head tilt and ear shift assessments which included
      photographing method, neck normal range of motions (lateral flexion and rotation) and
      plagiocephaly severity scale

    <description>Baby lies in supine position and caregiver holds the baby's upper extremities by stabilizing shoulders to prevent compansatuar movements. For lateral flexion therapist bends the neck to opposite side from affected SCM. For neck rotation, therapist rotate the neck to affected SCM.</description>

    <description>soft tissue mobilization technique has three phases. First phase 'the passive mobilization phase' is applied by gentle but tight gripping of the SKM muscle two or three fingers below the muscle origo and the muscle is mobilized rhythmically in the antero-posterior direction. Secondly, after gently continue to hold the muscle the baby was encouraged to do active repetitive cervical rotation to the affected side by means of catching the babies attention with colored and sonorous toys. Third phase was mobilization with stretching. Caregiver holds the baby on his/ her affected side while the therapist gently grips and withholds the muscle. Therapist mobilizes the muscle in the antero-posterior direction and stretch the muscle</description>
