  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of mothers are uncertain of the date of their last menstrual period and where
      there is a high incidence of small-for-dates babies, there is a real need for a method of
      estimating gestational age that is both rapid and accurate for early referral and management
      of preterm newborns to reduce their mortality and morbidity. The National Family Health
      Survey 2005-06 reports that the proportion of low birth weight babies (LBW) in India is 22%.
      Of these LBW babies, the proportion of prematurity is not known in the survey as it is
      difficult to measure gestational age of the newborn due to lack of reliable and valid scores
      with ease of use at the primary health centers. Different scores to assess maturity have been
      developed namely New Ballard score, Dubowitz score and Meharban Singh score. It is not known
      whether these scores have regional, geographical, racial or ethnic robustness. It has also
      been found that these scores tend to overestimate newborns &gt; 37 weeks and underestimate those
      &gt;32 and &lt; 37 weeks. The investigators conducted a cross sectional study to validate three
      neonatal gestational age (GA) assessment scores namely New Ballard, Dubowitz and Meharban
      Singh with the reference standard i.e. GA assessed by LMP using Naegeles rule and validated
      by gestational ages also assessed by at least one ultrasound (GA-LMP), in Indian newborns
      delivered at a tertiary hospital. The investigators derived a new &quot;Simplified Gestational Age
      Score&quot; (SGAS) using the best applicable items from the three validated scores and assessed
      its accuracy with the reference standard (GA-LMP). This score has only 4 items (posture, skin
      texture, breast and genital assessment) and community health workers can be trained in
      implementing SGAS due to its simplicity. The investigators propose a study in the GN sites to
      validate this simplified method of assessment of the GA using our SGAS protocol.
