    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well selumetinib works in treating patients with
      neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas (tumors which arise from the nerves)
      that cannot be removed by surgery (inoperable). Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate (plexiform neurofibromas [PN] volume decrease &gt;= 20%
      compared to baseline) to selumetinib in adult patients with NF1 and inoperable PN.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) responses with percent
      target inhibition phosphorylated (p)ERK in PN biopsies obtained pretreatment and on treatment
      with selumetinib.

      II. Analysis of histomorphology and molecular signature of tumor samples, as well as
      pathological evaluation of tumor changes on treatment.

      III. Analyze paired biopsies for mechanisms of response and resistance to selumetinib:
      measurement of pAKT, pMEK, tumor kinome, and tumor transcriptome.

      IV. Compare changes in pERK as a result of MEK inhibition in dermal neurofibromas and in PN.

      V. Evaluate immune infiltrate of plexiform neurofibromas, as well as peripheral blood for
      presence of circulating tumor cells.

      VI. Evaluate steady state pharmacokinetics of selumetinib (in blood) and correlate steady
      state levels with response and changes in pERK as a result of MEK inhibition in tumor
      samples.

      VII. Analyze bone marrow derived precursor cells and cytokines from blood samples obtained
      pretreatment and on treatment with selumetinib.

      VIII. Compare volumetric response and target inhibition and pathway activation in PN and
      nodular lesions.

      IX. Establish patient derived xenografts. X. Characterize the effect of selumetinib on pain,
      quality of life, and physical functioning.

      XI. Determine baseline functional impairments secondary to PN, and the effect of selumetinib
      on functional outcomes depending on PN location.

      XII. Determine the effect of selumetinib on the PN growth rate based on volumetric analysis
      of MRI studies obtained prior to enrollment (if available and amenable to volumetric
      analysis).

      XIII. Determine time to progression (TTP) and progression free survival (PFS) in progressive
      PN (&gt;= 20% increase in PN volume within 12-15 months prior to enrollment).

      XIV. Evaluate change in dermal neurofibroma burden using digital photography.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (approximately every 12 hours) on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             diagnostic criterion in addition to the presence of a PN; NF1 mutation analysis will
             be performed on germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as described by Messiaen &amp;
             Wimmer; histologic confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of
             consistent clinical and imaging findings, but should be considered if malignant
             transformation of a PN is clinically suspected; additional criteria are as follows:

               -  Six or more cafe-au-lait macules (&gt;= 0.5 cm in prepubertal subjects or &gt;= 1.5 cm

             removed without risk for substantial morbidity due to: encasement of or close
             proximity to vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN; the PN
             either causes morbidity or it is growing and has the potential to cause morbidity such
             as (but not limited to): head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or
             great vessels, paraspinal lesions that can cause myelopathy, brachial or lumbar plexus
             lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could
             result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring,

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (patients who are
             wheelchair bound because of paralysis secondary to a plexiform neurofibroma should be
             considered ambulatory when they are up in their wheelchair; similarly, patients with
             limited mobility secondary to need for mechanical support (such as an airway PN
             requiring tracheostomy or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] will also be
             considered ambulatory for the purpose of the study)

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 g/dL (not requiring red blood cell [RBC] transfusions)

          -  Creatinine =&lt; upper limit of normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

             parameters, clearance by hematology will be required prior to undergoing a biopsy

          -  Normal ejection fraction (echocardiogram [ECHO]) &gt;= 53% (if a range is given then the
             upper value of the range will be used) or cardiac MRI

             products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the study

          -  Patients with NF1 will only be eligible if complete tumor resection is not considered
             to be feasible without substantial risk or morbidity, or if a patient with a surgical
             option refuses surgery

               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and PN,
                  patients may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical
                  therapy directed at their PN

               -  Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there

               -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at
                  the PN
