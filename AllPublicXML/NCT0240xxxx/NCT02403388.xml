  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avoidable care associated incidents are relatively frequent in primary care. In France for
      example, avoidable incidents rate is estimated to 22/1000 medical acts from general
      practitioners. Patient safety is now a growing issue in primary care. One tool to increase
      patient safety is incident reporting and analysis. It could reduce some important
      consequences for patients and could allow implementing substantial corrective actions.

      The aim of the PRisM study is to assess and compare the efficiency of a multifaceted risk
      management program implemented in the french pluridisciplinary offices in primary care in
      association with a centralized incident reporting system, versus a centralized incident
      reporting system only.
