  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose in the present study an innovative approach, combining the most
      recent therapeutic opportunities in high risk ER+ breast cancer with the most recent and
      innovative diagnostic approaches such as the PAM50 signature and the RCB tumor response
      evaluation method. In line with the most recent recommendations on targeted anticancer
      therapies, the investigators have designed a parallel phase II randomized trial with early
      stopping rules 26, which will able in the meantime to build a unique prospective collection
      of tumor tissue, pre- and post-treatment.
