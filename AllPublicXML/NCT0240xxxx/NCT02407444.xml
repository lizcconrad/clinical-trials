  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether a combination of cycling training as part of
      physiotherapy treatment will contribute more than conventional physiotherapy treatment for
      elderly patients after hip fracture surgery in their subacute phase of rehabilitation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults who have experienced a fall, followed by proximal hip fracture that required surgery,
      suffer from specific problems that interrupt the rehabilitation period in their subacute
      phase.

      Various modes of treatment available as part of the physical rehabilitation but there is not
      enough data in the literature regarding the contribution of cycling training with leg cycle
      ergometer as part of conventional physiotherapy treatment in elderly patients after hip
      fracture surgery.

      This study evaluates whether the additional cycling to physiotherapy treatment will improve
      the functional ability, the balance performance while standing, hip muscle strength and pain
      level in those patients.

    <description>Provides a uniform system of measurement for disability, it measures the level of patient's disability and indicates how much assistance is required for the individual to carry out activities of daily living. It contains 18 items composed of 13 motor tasks and 5 cognitive tasks. Tasks are rated on 7 point ordinal scale that ranges from total assistance to complete independence. Score range from 18 (lowest) to 126 (highest) indicating level of function.</description>

    <description>The balance and weight bearing distribution parameters will be evaluated by posturographic device . This system assesses pressure fluctuations produced by the heels and toes of a subject standing on four separate platforms two for each foot and their respective halves. The pressure plates emit electronic signals which are digitized and processed by the posturographic device software to yield a set of unique parameters. Calculated results based on these parameters, which are statistically and functionally independent, reflect the interactions of the various neuro-physiological and neuro-anatomic subsystems involved in balance control.</description>
