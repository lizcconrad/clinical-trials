      The purpose of this study is to examine weather treatment with anthocyanins will affect lipid
      profile, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in addition to antioxidative level in
      serum to the better in persons with increased risk of dementia.

      The purpose of this study is to examine weather treatment with anthocyanins will increase the
      score of relevant tests of cognitive function.

      The investigators will do an open pilot study where patients receive anthocyanin for 16
      weeks. 34 patients are expected to be included.

      In addition we will include 20 healthy Controls.

      Design, method and material:

      The investigators will first do an open pilot study where 30 people will receive anthocyanins
      for 16 weeks.

      The investigators aim to recruit persons with increased risk of cognitive reduction: persons
      over 50 years with stable coronary heart disease (CAD) from the cardiology department
      Stavanger University Hospital. In addition will persons with mild cognitive impairment or
      mild dementia be included from the memory outpatient clinic, Stavanger University Hospital.

      Blood will be taken by venepuncture by an experienced nurse, centrifuged and handled in
      according to standardized procedures.

      The patients will be tested in relevant tests of cognitive function at inclusion and after 16
      weeks. At inclusion the patients will be tested in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and
      Geriatric depression scale (GDS) to make sure that the patients meet the inclusion criteria.
      At inclusion and after 16 weeks the patients will be tested in Word List Memory Word List
      Recall Word List Recognition, Trail Making Test A + B and Stroop Word and Colour test.

      From the healthy controls blood will be taken at inclusion and study end.
