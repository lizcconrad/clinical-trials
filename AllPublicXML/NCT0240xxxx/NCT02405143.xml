  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occipital stroke is associated with homonymous visual field defects (occurring on one side of
      the visual field). Despite spontaneous recovery, some degree of defect is often permanent.
      Currently, no treatment exists for such visual field defects.The purpose of this study is to
      test the efficacy of a type of electrical brain stimulation method, transcranial alternating
      current stimulation, in reducing these type of visual field defects in their chronic stage.

    <description>HRP is a computer-based perimetry using a supra-threshold stimulus. It is used to detect residual vision between the absolute defect and seeing field and to monitor subtle changes in perceptual ability. HRP is performed in fixation control using an eye tracker.
The primary outcome measure will be the percentage change in HRP detection accuracy between pre-test and post-test measurements.</description>

    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be the change in extent of visual fields i.e. mean threshold measured by means of standard automated perimetry.</description>

    <intervention_name>Active tACS using DC-Stimulator MC</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is administered using DC-Stimulator MC (NeuroConn GmbH, Ilmenau Germany). Stimulation is administered through two 5 cm2 saline-soaked electrodes placed in the Fpz position and on the right arm. Stimulation will consist of short blocks, during which stimulation frequency will be ramped up to 30Hz with maximum current of 1.5mA. Stimulation will be administered for 20 minutes on 10 consecutive weekdays.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sham stimulation using DC-Stimulator MC</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients in the sham group will undergo the same preparations as the treatment group. This includes using an identical electrode placement and session duration as for the experimental arm. In order to create the effect of phosphenes, one 5Hz current burst per minute will be administered using the individual phosphene threshold of the patient. This is not expected to have therapeutic effects.</description>
