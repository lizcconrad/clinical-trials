    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      JNJ-54861911 in participants in the early Alzheimer's disease (AD [progressive brain disease
      that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually even the ability to carry out
      the simplest tasks]) spectrum that have completed a Phase 1b or Phase 2 clinical trial with
      JNJ-54861911, who are willing to continue their assigned treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) spectrum, enrolled in ongoing or future
      clinical trials with JNJ-54861911 (Phase 1b or Phase 2 studies) will be provided the
      opportunity to participate in this study upon completion of their treatment period under the
      parent protocol. The study will consist of a Screening phase and 2 sequential treatment
      phases (a 12-month double-blind [DB] treatment phase [placebo controlled] and an open-label
      [OL] phase [active]) followed by an End-of-Treatment visit. Treatment in OL phase will
      continue until registration of JNJ-54861911; unless safety issues emerge as determined by the
      Data Review Committee (DRC) that would warrant termination of the study. Blood and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected to evaluate the plasma and CSF
      pharmacokinetics of JNJ-54861911, as well as amyloid beta fragments. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Amyloid Beta (ABeta) (1-37, 1-38, 1-40, 1-42) Levels and Soluble Amyloid Precursor Protein (sAPP) Fragments (sAPP-alpha, sAPP-beta), Total sAPP Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Week 24 and Week 52 in treatment period 1; Every 96 weeks in treatment period 2 up to end of treatment visit (until registration of JNJ-54861911 or any safety issue)</time_frame>
    <description>The CSF and plasma samples will be obtained for measuring levels of different ABeta fragments such as ABeta 1-37, ABeta 1-38, ABeta 1-40, ABeta 1-42. ABeta fragments of different length are produced by cleavage of the APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and the gamma-secretase complex in the brain and excreted into CSF.</description>

    <description>Plasma samples will be obtained for measuring levels of different ABeta fragments such as ABeta 1-37, ABeta 1-38, ABeta 1-40, ABeta 1-42. ABeta fragments of different length are produced by cleavage of the APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and the gamma-secretase complex in the different peripheral tissues, including white blood cells and can be measured in Plasma.</description>

    <measure>Relationship Between Changes in CSF and Plasma ABeta Species and sAPP Fragments With Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 30 days after last dose of study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>ABeta species and sAPP fragments in plasma and CSF will be measured.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants in the early Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum at time of enrollment
             under the parent protocol and according to its inclusion and exclusion criteria, must
             have very recently completed their treatment in a Phase 1b or Phase 2 JNJ-54861911
             clinical study (example [e.g.], 54861911ALZ2002) under the parent protocol. Enrollment
             in this study should be completed (Day 1 of double-blind [DB] treatment phase) as soon
             as possible, but within 6 weeks, following completion of their treatment period under
             the parent protocol. If not defined under the parent protocol, completion of the
             treatment period is defined as having completed all study related procedures of the
             last visit of the treatment period under the parent protocol. A screening phase of up
             to 12 weeks may be allowed following written approval of the Sponsor

          -  Participant must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in this protocol

          -  Each Participants (or their legally acceptable representative and caregiver depending
             on disease state and local requirements) must sign an informed consent form (ICF)
             indicating that he or she understands the purpose of and procedures required for the
             study and are willing to participate in the study

          -  Participants must have a reliable informant (relative, partner, or friend). The
             informant must be willing to participate as a source of information and has at least
             weekly contact with the participant (contact can be in-person, via telephone or other
             audio/visual communication). The informant must have sufficient contact such that the
             Investigator feels he/she can provide meaningful information about the participant's
             daily function. If possible, an alternate informant meeting these criteria who can
             replace the primary informant should be identified prior to randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition or situation which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the
             participant at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with participant's participation in the study

          -  The use of concomitant medications known to prolong the QT/QTc interval

          -  Participant has a history of moderate or severe hepatic impairment or severe renal
             insufficiency unless completely resolved for more than a year. Participant has
             clinically significant ongoing hepatic, renal, cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric or metabolic
             conditions (e.g., requiring frequent monitoring or medication adjustments or is
             otherwise unstable)
