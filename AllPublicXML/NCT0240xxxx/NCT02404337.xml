  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral treatment with betaine is conventionally used for patients with inherited
      homocystinurias.

      These conditions include a first group of patients with a cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)
      deficiency and a second group of patients with remethylation defects.

      The aim of betaine therapy is to reduce level of total plasma homocysteine. Daily dosages and
      rhythm of administration proposed in the literature vary between 100 to 250 mg / kg / d in 2
      to 4 doses. These dosages are not based on validated data and several publications mention
      much higher dosages particularly when total homocysteine is not controlled. These practices
      may be unnecessary or even detrimental given the fact that high doses of betaine could for
      example lead to secondary folate deficiency.
