      Study GT-030 is a phase 2a, single-center, open-label study of subjects with moderate to
      severe plaque psoriasis

  <detailed_description>

      The overall objective is to establish the safety and efficacy of GR-MD-02 in patients with
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

      Primary objective:

      The objective is to evaluate the number of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis
      who have 75% improvement in Psoriasis Activity Severity Index (PASI-75) following 12 weeks of
      therapy with GR-MD-02

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine the PASI-50 and PASI-100 scores in patients with moderate to severe plaque
           psoriasis following the first 12 weeks of therapy with GR-MD-02

        -  To determine the PASI-50, PASI-75, and PASI-100 scores in patients with moderate to
           severe plaque psoriasis following an additional 12 weeks of therapy (total 24 weeks)
           with GR-MD-02

        -  To determine the durability of response to therapy in responders over a one year period
           following the end of therapy

        -  To determine whether there is any change in disease status of patients who also have
           psoriatic arthritis

        -  To determine the incidence of adverse events and vital sign and laboratory abnormalities
           during study treatment
