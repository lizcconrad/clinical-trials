    <description>Rey-Kim scale is a tool to assess the short-term memory. It is composed of AVLT and CFT.
# AVLT After tester speaks each 15 word, subjects are asked to tell all words immediately as memory serves. This process is repeated 5 times (Each process is called AVLT process 1-5 according to priority). After 20 minutes interval, subjects are also asked to tell all words they can remember (AVLT process 6). Right after that, subjects should select the words they heard among 35 words (AVLT process 7).
Memory registration is calculated by converting score difference into a percentage between AVLT process 1 and 5 mentioned above.</description>

    <description>Rey-Kim scale is a tool to assess the short-term memory. It is composed of AVLT and CFT.
# CFT After tester shows subjects very complicated figure, subjects are asked to copy it (CFT process 1). Right after that, subjects should draw the figure as memory serves (CFT process 2). After 20 minutes interval, subjects are also asked to select the part of figure they copy among various figures (CFT process 3).
Copy-recall difference index is calculated by converting score difference into a percentage between CFT process 1 and 2 mentioned above.</description>
