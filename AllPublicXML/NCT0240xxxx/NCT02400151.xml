      The main objective of this study is to analyze in a population of obese adolescents, the
      effect of vitamin D3 supplementation in addition to lifestyle and dietary management on
      vascular function assessed by the change between M0 and M3 of endothelium-dependent
      vasorelaxation measured at the brachial artery (Flow-Mediated Dilation).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To analyze in obese adolescents, the effect of the addition of vitamin D3 supplementation
      on metabolic and vascular function.

      B. To compare the relationships between food intake, metabolic, inflammatory, oxidative
      stress and vitamin D status, and vascular dysfunction between obese and normal weight
      subjects.

      C. To evaluate the effects of sun exposure variations on relationships described in Objective
      B by comparing the observed parameters at baseline and at the end of the three month
      follow-up period, in non-supplemented obese adolescents and adolescents of normal weight.

      D. To identify biomarkers (metabolic signatures) in obese adolescents associated with vitamin
      D deficiency and vascular function.

      E. To evaluate in obese adolescents, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the
      metabolome (metabolic signature).

      F. To evaluate the effects of lifestyle and dietary management on these biomarkers (in the
      &quot;control group&quot;).

      For these targets (A to F), all teenagers will be classified according to three levels of
      skin pigmentation.

      G. Establish a biobank of samples taken at baseline and at 3 months.

    <description>Lifestyle and dietary management at the Saint Pierre Institute (Palavas-les-Flots, France) occurs for three months. Nutritionally speaking, each child or adolescent receives a controlled and balanced diet, consistent with the recommendations appropriate for his/her age, slightly hypocaloric or normocaloric. This dietary approach is complemented by a nutrition education program and supervision by a doctor and a dietician. Three hours of exercise training per week are scheduled; these sessions include adapted aerobic activities supervised by instructors and educators at the center.</description>
