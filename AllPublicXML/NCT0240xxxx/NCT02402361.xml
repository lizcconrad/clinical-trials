      Understanding risk factors and determinants for neuropathic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain (NP) is common (population prevalence of 7-8%) and will present a rising
      health burden in the future. NP arises as a consequence of a disease or lesion in the
      somatosensory nervous system. NP results in significant morbidity, reduces quality of life
      and has a major deleterious impact on health in aging. However, not everyone with such a
      lesion develops significant neuropathic pain, and those who do develop it include a wide
      range of severity, impact and outcomes, and an unpredictable response to evidence-based
      treatment. The reason why some subjects develop neuropathic pain and others do not following
      the same injury is not known. Genetic variants are increasingly recognized as being important
      in the development of neuropathic pain. There are a number of Mendelian primary neuropathic
      pain disorders which act as exemplars of high impact gene variants which have in a number of
      cases been shown to alter primary afferent excitability. In addition genetic factors are also
      likely to be important as risk factors in more common acquired (or secondary) neuropathic
      pain disorders. So, identifying these risk factors will have a significant impact on health
      both in identifying vulnerable patients and potential for developing new treatment
      modalities. The proposed study is a part of multicenter international project under Horizons
      2020 program of the European Union. Our aim is to understand pain pathophysiology in terms of
      risk factors and protective mechanisms ranging from molecular pathways to societal impacts.
      The desired impact is to provide a firm platform to improve diagnosis and stratify patients
      according to risk profile, employ preventive strategies and ultimately develop novel
      therapeutics.

      Specific objectives for the study at large will be to: 1) Identify the influence of
      demographic, environmental/societal and clinical factors on the risk of developing and
      maintenance of NP. 2) To apply modern genomics to validate (using a targeted approach) and
      find novel (using genome wide association) genetic risk factors for NP. 3) To determine if
      patient stratification using physiological (sensory profile, endogenous analgesic mechanisms
      and nerve excitability) and psychological factors can predict NP risk and progression. 4)
      Development of a risk model/algorithm for (severe) NP, combining measurable genetic and
      environmental factors. The desired impact is to provide a firm platform to improve diagnosis
      and stratify patients according to risk profile, employ preventive strategies and ultimately
      develop novel therapeutics.

        200 patients with painful and non-painful diabetic neuropathy (males and females, ages ≥18)
        will be tested in the study performed in the Rambam Medical Center. The patients will be
        recruited from the neurology/diabetes clinics and by advertisement in local newspapers.

        No patients will be requested to withdraw from any of their medication, or to change the
        treatment regimen due to participation in the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diabetes who are ≥18 years of age who have a diagnosis of peripheral
             neuropathy based on a prior clinical assessment combined with supportive clinical
             investigations such as abnormal nerve conduction studies, reduced intraepidermal nerve
             or abnormal findings on quantitative sensory testing.

          -  If supportive clinical investigations (as described above) are not available at entry
             into the study, a neuropathy disability scale ≥3 will be required.

          -  Patients with symptoms highly suggestive of neuropathy that in the judgment of the
             clinical researcher are suitable for the study even if they do not fulfill other
             inclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects with insufficient command of Hebrew to obtain consent from or to complete the
             study questionnaires.

          -  Subjects with insufficient mental capacity to obtain consent from or complete study
             questionnaires.

          -  Subjects with concurrent severe psychological or psychiatric disorders.

          -  Patients with moderate to severe pain form other causes that may confound assessment
             or reporting of pain.

          -  Patients with central nervous lesions, which may complicate somatosensory testing.

          -  Who is in the opinion of the investigator unsuitable for participation in the study.
