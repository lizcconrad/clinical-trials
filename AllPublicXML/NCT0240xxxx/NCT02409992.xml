  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will focus on the development of a brief emotion-coaching (EC)
      parenting program (which directly targets child emotion awareness/recognition and affective
      empathy), that will be combined with a well-established parent management training program
      (Helping the Noncompliant Child; HNC) for treating oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in
      children who also have limited prosocial emotions (e.g., lack of guilt and empathy, callous
      use of others).
