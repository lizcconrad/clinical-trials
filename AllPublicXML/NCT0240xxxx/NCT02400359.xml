      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate, using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI), the effect of treatment with lorcaserin on centers of the brain that control appetite
      and food intake, as well as lorcaserin's downstream metabolic effects.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the effect of treatment with the study drug,
      called lorcaserin on centers of the brain that control appetite and food intake, as well as
      lorcaserin's other metabolic effects. Lorcaserin's effect on the brain will be investigated
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Lorcaserin was approved in June 2012 as
      an addition to a reduced-calorie diet and exercise, for chronic weight management. Previous
      weight loss drugs, such as fenfluramine, acted throughout the body and caused heart problems.
      Lorcaserin is different because it only acts on receptors (sites of action) that are found in
      the brain and does not act on the heart, and thus, has not been shown to cause the heart
      problems seen in the past.

        1. To examine the effects of the study drug lorcaserin, on the brain, and its impact on
           food visualization (high fat and low fat images) and interaction with satiety (by
           measuring during the fasting or fed states) using fMRI. (Satiety is defined as when a
           person has had enough or too much food and does not want to eat any more, as after
           finishing a satisfying meal.)

        2. To examine the satiety and weight-reducing effect of lorcaserin using physiological
           measurements (such as how much weight is lost and how this may affect hormone levels),
           and its association with changes in fMRI responses and neuropsychological performance.
           To examine whether the long-term weight reducing effects of lorcaserin can be predicted
           by early food visualization.

    <description>Changes in body composition will be assessed by the following measurements:
DEXA (Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry): Body composition and bone density will be measured by DEXA. For the DEXA test, the subject will be lying on an examination bed for about 25 minutes. A small part of the DEXA machine will be recording and moving back and forth about 3 feet above their body. The radiation the subject will get is very small and is much less than what one gets from a regular chest X-Ray.
Anthropometry: Anthropometry will be performed by a licensed dietician. Measurements include: Height, Weight, umbilical and smallest waist, broadest and iliac hip measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolic Rate (Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR): RMR is the amount of calories the subject burn without doing any physical work. The subject's RMR will be measured with a commonly used instrument. The subject will be asked to lie quietly in bed and stay awake with a large plastic hood over the subject's head and upper body for about 20 minutes. The subject will breathe normally while the air they breathe out is collected and analyzed.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Obese: BMI&gt; 30 kg/m2 or &gt;27 kg/m2 with comorbidities (including but not limited to insulin
        resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, sleep apnea,
        gallbladder disease, hyperuricemia and gout, and osteoarthritis).

        Additionally, women participants must use double barrier methods to prevent pregnancy
        (diaphragm with intravaginal spermicide, cervical cap, male or female condom with
        spermicide). If a woman suspects that she has become pregnant at any time or does not use
        one of the contraceptive methods recommended by the investigator, she must notify the study
        staff. If a woman becomes pregnant, she will be withdrawn from the study. The study staff
        will follow the progress of her pregnancy and the birth of her child.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects using any other weight loss products (orlistat, phentermine, topiramate,
             fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, amphetamines, GLP-1 agonists) or use within 3 months.

          2. Women who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or wanting to become pregnant.

          3. Women using IUD (intrauterine device)

          4. Any change in the dosage of hormonal contraceptive medications (birth control pills,
             implanon). Subjects should remain on same medication/ same dose during the time of the
             entire study.

          5. Moderate (creatinine clearance of 30-59 ml/min) and severe renal impairment
             (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min) and end-stage renal disease

          6. Moderate, or severe hepatic impairment

          7. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients in lorcaserin
