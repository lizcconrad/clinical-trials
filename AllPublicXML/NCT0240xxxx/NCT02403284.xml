  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, investigators will test the effects of an approved medication for
      diabetes,Liraglutide, to reduce insulin resistance that develops from eating a diet high in
      saturated fats.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to determine the ability of subacute liraglutide
      administration to protect against dietary lipid induced peripheral insulin resistance in
      non-diabetic subjects who have normal glucose tolerance. Recent data from our laboratory and
      others suggest that high fat meals, enriched with saturated fatty acids (SFA) in particular,
      have a unique and profound ability to induce rapid (in ≤ 24 hr) and profound onset of insulin
      resistance in humans. This is presumably mediated in part through delivery of lipids and
      lipid products generated during postprandial lipolysis into non-adipose tissue. This unique
      model therefore provides an excellent platform to test agents for their ability to inhibit
      dietary induced insulin resistance. As we and others have demonstrated the ability of GLP-1
      receptor agonists to markedly suppress postprandial lipid elevations and to modify lipid
      metabolism, we hypothesize that liraglutide may be an effective agent to inhibit development
      of dietary induced insulin resistance.
