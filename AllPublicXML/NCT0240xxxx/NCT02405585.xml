    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most
      patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer continue to die from the rapid progression of their
      disease. One primary reason for this is that the disease is typically without symptoms until
      significant local and/or distant spread has occurred and is often beyond the chance for cure
      at the time of the diagnosis. The lack of any treatment to substantially increase long term
      survival rates is reflected by the poor outcomes associated with this disease, specifically
      time to disease progression and overall survival.

      However, another important part of the body is now being looked at as a target for therapy
      against this disease - the immune system. Scientists have clearly shown that pancreatic tumor
      cells produce a number of defective proteins, or express normal proteins in highly
      uncharacteristic ways, as part of this cancer. In some cancers, these abnormalities can cause
      an immune response to the cancer cells much in the way one responds to infected tissue. In
      progressive cancers however, the immune system fails to effectively identify or respond to
      these abnormalities and the cancer cells are not attacked or destroyed for reasons not yet
      fully understood. This clinical trial proposes a new way to stimulate the immune system to
      recognize pancreatic cancer cells and to stimulate an immune response that destroys or blocks
      the growth of the cancer.

      This new method of treatment helps the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients to
      &quot;identify&quot; the cancerous tissue so that it can be eliminated from the body. As an example,
      patients with certain diseases may require an organ transplant to replace a damaged kidney or
      heart. After receiving their transplant, these patients receive special drugs because they
      are at great danger of having an immune response that destroys or &quot;rejects&quot; the transplanted
      organ. This &quot;rejection&quot; occurs when their immune system responds to differences between the
      cells of the transplanted organ and their own immune system by attacking the foreign tissue
      in the same way as it would attack infected tissue. When the differences between foreign
      tissues and the patient's body are even larger, as with the differences between organs from
      different species, the rejection is very rapid, highly destructive, and the immunity it
      generates is longlasting. This is called hyperacute rejection and the medicine used to
      immunize patients in this protocol tries to harness this response to teach a patient's immune
      system to fight their pancreatic cancer just as the body would learn to reject a transplanted
      organ from an animal.

      To do this, Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy contains human pancreatic cancer cells that contain
      a mouse gene that marks the cancer cells as foreign to patient's immune systems. The immune
      system therefore attacks these cancer cells just as they would attack any truly foreign
      tissue, destroying as much as it can. Additionally, the immune system is stimulated to
      identify differences (aside from the mouse gene) between these cancer cells and normal human
      tissue as foreign. This &quot;education&quot; of the immune system helps treat the patient because
      pancreatic cancer cells already present in a treated patient are believed to show some of the
      same differences from normal tissue as the modified pancreatic cancer cells in the product.
      Due to these similarities, the immune system, once &quot;educated&quot; by the Algenpantucel-L
      immunotherapy, identifies the patient's cancer as foreign and attacks.

      Historically, external beam radiation has been part of the treatment of pancreatic cancer,
      both before and after surgical resection. Recent breakthroughs in technology now allow for
      more intensive doses of radiation to be delivered to the body with greater precision. These
      newer, more precise radiation treatments, called stereotactic body radiation, deliver more
      intensive radiation to a locally advanced tumor and are now being employed in the treatment
      of pancreatic cancer. Stereotactic body radiation may increase the chances that surgery will
      successfully remove a pancreatic cancer.

      In this experimental study, all patients will be given a strong combination of antitumor
      chemotherapy while receiving injections of an immunotherapy drug consisting of two types of
      pancreatic cancer cells that have been modified to make them more easily recognized and
      attacked by the immune system. The investigators propose to test this new treatment paradigm
      along with stereotactic body radiation in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic
      cancer to demonstrate that treatment with this combination of therapies increases the time
      until the tumor progresses as well as overall survival.

      This protocol attempts to treat pancreatic cancer using a naturally occurring barrier to
      xenotransplantation in humans to increase the efficacy of immunizing subjects against their
      pancreatic cancer. In this protocol, the transfer of the murine
      alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase [alpha(1,3)GT] gene to immunotherapy component cells results
      in the cell surface expression of alpha(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (alpha gal) epitopes on
      membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute
      rejection response. This response occurs when organs are transplanted from lower animal donor
      species into primates and results in rapid destruction of transplanted tissue and an
      augmented response against transplant antigens, including antigens not related to the alpha
      gal epitopes. Human hosts have pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies that are thought to
      result from chronic immunological stimulation due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are
      naturally expressed on normal gut flora and these antibodies may comprise up to 1% of serum
      IgG. Opsonization and lysis of the immunotherapy component cells mediated by this antibody is
      believed to increase the efficiency of antigen processing by targeting vaccine components to
      antigen presenting cells via the Fc gamma receptor.

             defined below:

               1. Borderline resectable- Tumors considered borderline resectable are defined as
                  follows:

               2. Venous involvement of the SMV/portal vein demonstrating tumor abutment with
                  impingement and narrowing of the lumen, encasement of the SMV/portal vein but
                  without encasement of the nearby arteries, or short-segment venous occlusion
                  resulting from either tumor thrombus or encasement but with suitable vessel
                  proximal and distal to the area of vessel involvement, allowing for safe
                  resection and reconstruction

               3. Gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the hepatic artery with either short
                  segment encasement or direct abutment of the hepatic artery without extension to
                  the celiac axis.

               4. Tumor abutment of the SMA not to exceed greater than 180 degrees of the
                  circumference of the vessel wall.

          -  Tumors considered to be unresectable due to local advancement include an absence of
             distant metastases as well as:

               1. Head: Greater than 180 degrees SMA encasement or any celiac abutment or
                  unreconstructible SMV/portal occlusion or aortic invasion or encasement.

               4. Nodal status: Involvement of lymph nodes beyond the field of resection should be
                  considered unresectable due to distant spread and therefore not eligible for this
                  protocol.
