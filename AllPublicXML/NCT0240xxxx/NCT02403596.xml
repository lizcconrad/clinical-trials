    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of tranexamic acid versus placebo on perioperative blood
      loss using two dosage regimens (standard and extended) after a surgery during total hip
      arthroplasty in patients receiving the novel fast-acting oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban for
      prophylaxis of thrombosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, 140 000 total hip replacements were performed and bleeding remains one of the major
      complications responsible for significant morbidity. This study will evaluate a new treatment
      to prevent bleeding due to this surgery. Indeed, the tranexamic acid (Exacyl) will be used in
      two modes of administration (standard or extended) versus placebo combined with a Rivaroxaban
      treatment at a dose of 10 mg / day for 35 days.

      Patients will be randomized (exacyl standard vs exacyl extended vs. placebo) and will be
      followed for 3 months.
