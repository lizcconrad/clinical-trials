      The purpose of this research study is to determine what causes pain after surgery to increase
      or decrease over time.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before surgery, study participants will be asked questions about age, gender, race/ethnicity,
      annual income, and education level. Study participants will also be questioned regarding
      prior pain experiences, their mood and how they think about pain. A small test tube of blood,
      a cheek swab or a saliva sample will be taken to see what genetic differences may influence
      individuals pain after surgery.

      After surgery, study participants will be asked questions about their pain intensity while in
      the hospital. Additional information will be collected about the effects of pain medicine,
      and their recovery from surgery.

      Following discharge from the hospital, study participants will be contacted monthly to
      confirm continued communication. Study participants will also be contacted six months after
      surgery, and asked to complete a final survey about their pain after surgery.
