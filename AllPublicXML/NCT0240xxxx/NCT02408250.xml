  <brief_summary>

      Practice guidelines recommend early physical therapy in intensive care unit. Feasibility,
      safety and efficacy are confirmed by growing evidence based data. However, the scientific
      literature emphasizes the heterogeneity of targeted populations, lack of precisions
      concerning eligibility criteria, program modalities, timing initiation, progressions and
      stopping criteria. However, all these results remain to be precised and confirmed. So, the
      investigators hypothesize that an early exercise program in intensive care unit formalized
      from a decisional algorithm is well tolerated in clinical practice.
