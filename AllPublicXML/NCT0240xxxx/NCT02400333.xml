    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomised, four-period, four-treatment, crossover study in
      healthy male and female of non-childbearing potential subjects, performed at a single study
      centre.

      The objective of the study is to assess the bioavailability of ticagrelor orodispersible (OD)
      tablets when administered with water, without water and suspended in water to be administered
      through nasogastric tubes, compared to ticagrelor immediate-release (IR) tablets

        <description>An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. The term AE is used generally to include any AE whether serious or non-serious. A serious AE (SAE) is an AE that fulfills one or more of the following criteria: results in death, is immediately life-threatening; requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; is a congenital abnormality or birth defect; is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
