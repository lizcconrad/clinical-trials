  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate whether IVC index measured intraoperatively was
      affected by fluid administration and could add any helpful information about the hemodynamics
      during hepatic resection. In addition, the investigators evaluated whether IVC index was
      somehow correlated with the risk of postoperative complication.
