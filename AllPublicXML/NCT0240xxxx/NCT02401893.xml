    <textblock>
      Little is known about factors associated with maintenance of hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI)
      antibodies after influenza vaccination in older adults so the investigators enrolled adults
      ≥50 years.

    <textblock>
      In the United States, yearly influenza vaccination begins in August or September. However,
      influenza season can extend into April of the following year. The duration of protection from
      annual vaccination in older adults is unknown, and little is known about factors associated
      with the maintenance of response throughout the influenza season. This study evaluated
      factors associated with the immune response of older adults to trivalent influenza vaccine
      and the maintenance of antibody responses for the duration of the influenza season.

      Subjects

      Subjects were enrolled at two sites, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN) and
      Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation (Marshfield, WI), during September and October 2009.
      Subjects were eligible for recruitment if they were ≥50 years of age and had no
      contraindication to influenza vaccination. Subject recruitment included advertisements at
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center and letters of invitation to older adults who had
      received an influenza vaccine in the year prior at Marshfield Clinic.1 All subjects were
      vaccinated either by their usual caregiver or by the study staff. Strain components for the
      2009-2010 Northern Hemisphere vaccine included A/Brisbane/59/2007-like (H1N1),
      A/Brisbane/10/2007-like (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like. Participants were given the
      trivalent seasonal vaccine because the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine was not available.

      Data Collection

      All subjects donated serum pre-vaccination (S1) during September through October 2009, 21 -
      28 days post-vaccination (S2) and post-influenza season, May through July, 2010,
      approximately 250 days (8 months) post-vaccination (S3). Study procedures, informed consent
      documents and data collection forms were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards
      at each of the study sites.

      Age, co-morbid conditions, sex, and race were ascertained from participant interview. Recent
      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or use of immunomodulating medications were ascertained by
      self-report or chart review. CDC-defined high risk medical conditions were identified by
      self-report of organ transplantation, cancer, diabetes mellitus, splenectomy (functional or
      anatomic), cardiovascular disease, renal disease, sickle cell disease, chronic pulmonary
      disease, seizure disorder, immune deficiency, or dementia.2 Self-reported stress was
      determined by asking participants to respond yes or no to the question &quot;Have you suffered
      psychological stress or acute disease in the past 3 months?&quot; included as part of the Mini
      Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire.3 Height and weight were measured by research study
      staff and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) / height (m)2.

      Laboratory Methods

      Blood samples were processed, stored, and shipped by each institution's local Sample
      Processing Core to Battelle (Columbus, OH). Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) testing was
      performed in duplicate against the influenza vaccine strains in the 2009-2010 Northern
      Hemisphere influenza vaccine. Although there is debate about the best correlate of protection
      for influenza,4 seroprotection was defined as an HAI titer of ≥40 since it is the correlate
      recognized by the United States Food and Drug Administration.5 Seroconversion was measured at
      S2 and defined as a four-fold rise in HAI post-influenza vaccination compared to
      pre-vaccination or ≥40 if S1 was &lt;10. Maintenance of antibody response was measured in
      participants with an S2 ≥40, and defined as an S3≥40. If duplicate HAI results were
      discrepant by more than two fold, a third test was performed and the minimum result was
      recorded.

      Statistical Analysis

      Multivariable logistic regression models were run for the binary outcomes seroprotection at
      S2 and S3 and seroconversion at S2. Age, BMI, stress, high risk medical conditions (yes/no),
      female gender, study site and transformed S1 titer were included in all models. Time in days
      from S1 to S3 was included in models with S3 related outcomes as a continuous variable.
      Restricted cubic splines were applied to age and BMI. All raw HAI titers were log transformed
      using the method outlined by Beyer,6 changing dilution titers to integers with HAI &lt;10 coded
      as 0, 10 as 1, 20 as 2, 40 as 3 and so on. Interaction terms between age and high risk
      status, and stress or age and sex were tested and were not included based on non-significant
      p values of overall interaction terms. Figures were generated by predicting the probability
      of having a HAI titer ≥40 by logistic regression. All analyses were done using R version
      2.12.2.
