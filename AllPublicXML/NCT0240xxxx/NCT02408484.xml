  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of Octafibrin, a fibrinogen concentrate in in the
      on-demand treatment of spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes in paediatric patients less
      than 12 years of age.The planned study duration is up to 5 years. The study will be
      considered completed when a minimum of 6 subjects (i.e., at least 3 subjects aged between 0
      and &lt;6 years and 3 subjects aged between 6 and &lt;12 years) have at least one documented
      bleeding episode and when in total a minimum of 2 surgical procedures have been performed.

      All patients will undergo a pharmacokinetic (PK) study after screening. This will have a
      duration of 14 days, after which a patient can be treated for a bleeding episode or planned
      surgical procedure when they occur.
