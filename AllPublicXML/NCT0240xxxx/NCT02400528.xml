  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The studies conducted so far concerning the medical and paramedical cares provided to
      patients with profound and multiple disabilities (PMD) often show important limitations:
      samples are too small or very heterogeneous, generally constituted of children only; studies
      are mainly cross-sectional and retrospective, focusing on very specific issues instead of
      assessing health and quality of life from a more global perspective… So far, the
      investigators found no published data from a prospective cohort study involving a
      representative sample of patients with PMD. The present project aims to set up such a cohort
      so as to describe for the first time the natural history of French patients with PMD as well
      as the cares they receive at home or within the different dedicated structures in France.
      This cohort will also make it possible to identify the factors responsible for differences in
      the cares patients are provided, the consequences of these differences on their health and
      their quality of life (and those of their relatives) as well as the evolutions of these data
      over time. It will then allow for assessing the effectiveness of the French healthcare system
      to care for patients with PMD as well as building a frame of reference regarding the best
      cares to provide to these patients.

      The primary goal of this study is to identify the determinants of health among patients with
      PMD.
