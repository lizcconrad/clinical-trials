  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centre for Magnetic Resonance in Biology and Medicine (CRMBM, UMR-CNRS 7339 AMU) obtained
      funding for a whole body NMR imaging at 7. It is the only MRI at 7T installed in a hospital
      in France (only two 7T MRI in France) and therefore a unique opportunity to develop new
      diagnostic approaches.

      The purpose of this study is to develop, implement and validate new MRI quantitative
      parameters derived from ultra high field MRI in order to characterize non-invasively with an
      unprecedented resolution and sensitivity, anatomy as well as certain physiological,
      hemodynamic and metabolic function of brain, spinal cord, musculoskeletal system, and heart
      in healthy subjects

      The key is that the goal of our projects is not only producing images of better quality than
      using a 3T scanner but also making images differently, by highlighting new contrasts and
      features of theses organs in order to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of neurological,
      psychiatric, cardiovascular and rheumatologic diseases.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>qualitative validation concerning structure visible with high field MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>the validation criteria are qualitative (contrast and visibility of anatomical structures usually visible 7T but not visible at 3T will be used to assess the sensitivity of images for each modality) and quantitative (signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial and temporal resolution).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>acquisition of normative data and verification of the quality criteria obtained during the first phase</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>During the second phase, we will acquire normative data and verify the quality criteria of the first phase. Each quantitative variable will be extracted. After the acquisition of the first 30 volunteers for each parameter, the variance will be analyzed to assess the population distribution. Depending on the results, and issues raised by clinical research studies, other populations will be acquired</description>
