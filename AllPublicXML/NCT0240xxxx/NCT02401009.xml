  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the CIBMTR Research Program is to improve the safety and effectiveness of
      hematopoietic cell (HC) transplantation for both donors and recipients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Research Database contains demographic and clinical data on allogeneic related and
      unrelated donor and autologous HC transplants. Data are also collected on unrelated donors
      and their donation experiences. The data contained in the research databases are
      observational data. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research
      (CIBMTR) does not determine which therapies are used for patients, but rather collects
      information regarding therapies as they are applied by transplant centers.

      Secondary goals of the CIBMTR Research Program are to understand uses of hematopoietic cells
      for regenerative medicine or immune-based therapy, including for malignancy or infection, and
      to improve treatments and outcomes for those individuals who have been exposed to radiation
      or other chemicals that are toxic to marrow. In these cases, exposure data, organ injury
      data, treatment data, and outcomes data are collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any recipient of an unrelated or related donor or autologous HC transplant (includes
             cells collected from peripheral blood, bone marrow or cord blood) or any recipient of
             cellular therapy in a CIBMTR center is eligible to participate in the Research
             Database. This includes adults with and without decision making capacity, and
             children.

          -  Individual with Marrow Toxic Injury Eligibility Criteria

          -  In the event of a radiation exposure accident, the National Marrow Donor Program
             (NMDP) has a radiation injury treatment network, whose purpose is to collect data to
             understand the outcomes of patients treated under these circumstances.

          -  Any individual who is treated for a marrow toxic injury at a center participating in
             the NMDP's Radiation Injury Treatment Network (RITN) is eligible to participate in the
             Research Database.

          -  This includes adults with and without decision making capacity, and children.

          -  Eligible individuals may have received supportive care only, growth factor support, HC
             transplant or other appropriate medical treatment for marrow toxic injury.

          -  Treatments applied are at the discretion of the care facility, and are not determined
             by the NMDP or CIBMTR.

          -  Unrelated Donor Eligibility Criteria

          -  All donors registered on the NMDP Registry who have been requested to donate a product
             for a recipient are eligible to participate in the Research Database.
