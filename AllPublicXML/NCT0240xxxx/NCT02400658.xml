      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational way to provide radiation therapy
      to treat early-stage breast cancer at the time of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single-arm phase II study designed to study the efficacy of high dose
      rate (HDR) brachytherapy with CT-imaging, single-fraction intraoperative radiation therapy
      (IORT). The study will accrue patients with early-stage breast cancer who will be treated
      with breast-conserving surgery (BCS). The main clinical eligibility criterion is based on
      suitability for accelerated partial breast irradiation. Patients may be eligible prior to
      receiving BCS or within 30 days of receiving BCS. Eligible patients that will undergo BCS
      will receive surgery according to the standard clinical practice in the Brachytherapy Suite
      in the Emily Couric Clinical Cancer Center. Patients that have already undergone BCS must
      meet all other eligibility criteria and are able to be treated with IORT within 30 days of
      their breast surgery. Eligible subjects will undergo a lumpectomy or re-excision lumpectomy
      according the standard clinical practice. Immediately following lumpectomy, the breast HDR
      brachytherapy applicator will be placed and CT imaging will be performed for treatment
      planning. After HDR brachytherapy is delivered, the applicator will be removed, and the
      breast surgeon will complete the skin closure. Although the ultimate goal of the study is to
      determine 5-year ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), all efforts will be made to
      follow the patients until death.
