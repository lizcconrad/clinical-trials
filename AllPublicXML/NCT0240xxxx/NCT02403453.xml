    <textblock>
      A Prospective, open label, multi-center observational study of patients requiring surgical
      treatment at one or two (contiguous) cervical spine levels. The primary objectives of the
      RHINE Cervical Disc study are to: obtain operative data and feedback on surgical instruments
      and surgical technique; confirm device performance in terms of clinical and radiographic
      outcomes; confirm device performance in terms of safety and to collect original data to be
      compared to published reports of the performance of comparable motion-sparing devices, as
      well as clinical outcomes of fusion devices.

      A Prospective, open label, multi-center observational study of patients requiring surgical
      treatment at one or two (contiguous) cervical spine levels ( C3-C7). The primary objectives
      of the RHINE Cervical Disc study are to: obtain operative data and feedback on surgical
      instruments and surgical technique; confirm device performance in terms of clinical and
      radiographic outcomes; confirm device performance in terms of safety and to collect original
      data to be compared to published reports of the performance of comparable motion-sparing
      devices, as well as clinical outcomes of fusion devices. Device- and procedure-related
      adverse events, serious adverse events, and secondary surgeries will be monitored throughout.
      AEs will be characterized by severity, seriousness and relationship to device. Investigator
      reports of serious adverse events and any AE trends will be reviewed by a medical monitor.

    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI) change from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the change in function will be scored using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) at all time points compared to baseline (pre-operative). NDI is a subject-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 questions. Each question is scored from 0 to 5, summed to a total and multiplied by 2 to get a score from 0 to 100. A 15 point change in NDI score compared with baseline (pre-operative score) will be used as the measure for a clinically significant change.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6-12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anteroposterior &amp; Lateral ( or MRI at Pre-operative ) and Flexion and Extension x-rays will be taken at all time points. An independent radiologist will review and assess all radiographs including: range of motion, translation, intervertebral height, device height, device positioning/migration, heterotopic ossification and adjacent segment degeneration.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain: Neck, Right Arm, Left Arm, Worst arm Visual analog Scale Change form Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6-12 weeks post-discharge , 6 months, 12 months, 24 months annd 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of neck pain, right arm pain and left arm pain will be evaluated using a 100 mm VAS. The scale is measured from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (extreme pain). The VAS will be scored at all time points and compared to baseline (pre-operative). A change of 15 mm is considered clinically significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Surgeries (Surgical Interventions)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-12 weeks post-discharge , 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary surgeries will be described and will be classified as follows:
Index Level Revision without Implant Removal: a procedure that adjusts or in any way modifies the original implant configuration without removal of the original implant, e.g., adjusting the position of the implant, or adding supplemental fixation.
Index Level Revision with Implant Removal: a procedure that removes the original implant, with replacement using a new implant or without replacement.
Adjacent Level Surgery: any surgical procedure at a level adjacent to the treated level(s) that does not remove, modify or add any components to the implant configuration.
Other Spine Surgery: surgery at spine level that is not an index or adjacent level.
Surgeries unrelated to the spine will not be recorded as secondary surgeries but the adverse effect leading to the surgery will be recorded on an AE form and characterized as an 'inpatient hospitalization.</description>
