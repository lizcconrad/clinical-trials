      This is a phase II, open label, single-center study of ultra-high dose dexamethasone
      administered intravenously and orally as monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed multiple
      myeloma. Dexamethasone has known anti-myeloma activity, and has been studied extensively both
      alone, and in combination with other agents, in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

      This study implements an optimal 2-stage design. In Stage 1, 10 patients will be enrolled.
      Each patient will receive 100mg of intravenous dexamethasone once on Day 1, immediately
      followed by 24mg of oral (PO) dexamethasone every 6 hours for 3 days (Days 1-3) in a 28-day
      cycle. After 4 cycles, the patients will be evaluated for efficacy and safety. If 2 or more
      of the original 10 patients experience a CR, very good partial response (VGPR), or PR, an
      additional 20 patients will be enrolled in Stage 2. The enrollment for Stage 2 will occur
      after the completion of 4 cycles of ultra-high dose dexamethasone. If &lt;2 patients experience
      a CR, VGPR, or PR, the study will be discontinued. Patients will be treated until
      progression, intolerable side effects, or death.

      The purpose of the proposed phase II study is to determine the overall response rate,
      progression free survival, and tolerability of &quot;ultra-high&quot; dose dexamethasone.

      relapsed multiple myeloma.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Characterize the safety and tolerability of UHDD as monotherapy in patients with
           relapsed multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the progression free survival amongst responders.

        -  Determine the subset of patients in whom UHDD can be used as monotherapy for treatment
           of relapsed multiple myeloma

      STUDY ENDPOINTS

      Primary endpoint: To determine the anti-tumor activity of UHDD as monotherapy in patients
      with relapsed multiple myeloma as measured by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
      response criteria:

        -  Change from baseline in M protein component.

        -  Objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) assessed
           according to IMWG response criteria.

        -  Disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease [SD]).

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Safety and tolerability of UHDD

        -  Progression free survival.

        -  Characteristics of patients responding to UHDD.
