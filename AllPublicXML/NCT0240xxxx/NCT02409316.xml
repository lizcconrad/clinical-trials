  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate
      estrogen receptor (ER) activity in sites of metastatic disease using the investigational
      radiotracer [18F]fluoroestradiol (FES).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate [18F]FES PET/CT uptake as a predictor of progression free survival
      in endocrine refractory recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients starting a new therapy
      regimen including endocrine targeted therapy. Imaging will occur prior to starting new
      therapy. Some patients may also undergo a second FES PET/CT scan at the time of suspected
      progression of disease to compare for changes in FES uptake measures. This is an
      observational study in that [18F]FES PET/CT will not be used to direct therapy decisions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age

          2. Recurrent or metastatic cancer that is of known or suspected breast origin - may be
             biopsy proven or identified on standard imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, FDG PET/CT)

          3. History of ER+ pathology (ER+ may be confirmed from surgery or biopsy of primary
             breast cancer or lymph nodes, and/or surgery or biopsy of a metastatic site,
             metastatic biopsy is not required)

          4. At least one site of disease outside of the liver that is seen on standard imaging
             (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, FDG PET/CT); patients with measurable or nonmeasurable
             disease are allowed.

          5. History of progression or recurrence of disease while on an endocrine targeted therapy
             containing regimen as assessed by medical record review of breast cancer history at
             screening

          6. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be
             willing to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to study-specific
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant at the time of screening will not be eligible for this study,
             urine pregnancy test will be performed at screening in women of child-bearing
             potential.

          2. Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          3. Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the
             study.

          4. History of HER2/neu positive cancer (IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive) as assessed by
             medical record review at screening
