      A Phase IIa single arm open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of
      F-652 in combination with systemic corticosteroids in subjects who have undergone
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and have newly diagnosed grade II-IV lower GI
      acute Graft Verses Host Disease (aGVHD). Treatment with F-652 will be once a week for 4
      weeks, with post treatment follow up visits on days 28, 56, 180 and 365.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa single arm open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and
      PK of F-652 in combination with systemic corticosteroids in subjects who have undergone HSCT
      and have newly diagnosed grade II-IV lower GI aGVHD. The HSCT may be derived from bone
      marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood. The PK of F-652 in this subject
      population will be investigated. Subjects may be replaced if subject withdrawal is not
      related to safety or treatment response.

      F-652 will be administered in conjunction with prednisone (or equivalent) at the time of the
      onset of clinical symptoms consistent with GI and/or liver aGVHD. Prednisone (or equivalent)
      will be given at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day and tapered as per protocol.

      F-652 will be administered intravenously at a rate of 100 mL/hour for one hour once per week
      for four weeks. A total of 4 doses will be administered at a dose of 45 μg/kg each. Subjects
      will be followed for safety and efficacy through Day 180, and subject survival status will be
      collected at Day 365.

      In the first stage of the trial, a total of 16 subjects will be enrolled. If six or fewer
      have a Day 28 treatment response, the trial will close due to a lack of efficacy. If seven or
      more have a response, an additional 11 subjects will be enrolled into study for a total
      sample size of 27. During the course of a subject's therapy, dose reduction may occur on an
      individual basis as per protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years and ≤80.

          2. Newly diagnosed lower GI grade II-IV aGVHD with clinical diagnosis based on modified
             Keystone criteria1 following allogeneic HSCT using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem
             cells, or cord blood. Grading of aGVHD will be based on International Bone Marrow
             Transplant Registry (IBMTR) criteria.

          3. Subjects are willing to undergo a biopsy to confirm lower GI aGVHD. Biopsy results are

             hours).

          5. Subjects who received any corticosteroid therapy (for non-GVHD) at doses &gt;0.5
             mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent) within 7 days prior to the onset of GVHD therapy.

          6. Subjects who developed aGVHD after unplanned donor lymphocyte infusion.

          7. Subject with chronic GVHD features (acute/chronic GVHD overlap syndrome or classical

             tests.

         13. The subject has tested positive for the Clostridium difficile toxin within 7 days of
             study entry.

         14. Receiving other investigational drugs or biologics within 1 month or five half-lives.
             Cytotoxic or biologic are not permitted throughout the study.

         15. ALT (alanine aminotransferase; SGPT), AST (aspartate aminotransferase; SGPT), alkaline
             phosphatase (ALP) &gt;2.5 upper limit of normal (ULN), unless attributed to GVHD.
