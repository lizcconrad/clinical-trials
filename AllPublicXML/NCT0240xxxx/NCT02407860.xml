    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is the physiological and recommended way of feeding newborns as indicated by
      the World Health Organization, Health Canada and the politics of perinatality 2008-2018 in
      Quebec. Despite these, mothers who exclusively breastfed their babies are rare. According to
      Statistics Canada, the first month of life is the most at risk time to wean because of
      technical difficulties (53% of weaning) including mechanical issues. In Quebec city, despite
      a supportive network of health care professionals including lactation consultant, many babies
      are weaned. Lactation consultant are often feeling helpless when facing these mechanical
      difficulties.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficiency of an osteopathic treatment for
      newborns presenting breastfeeding mechanical difficulties. The investigators' hypotheses is
      that an osteopathic treatment integrating in the usual care is more efficient than usual car
      alone to help healing mechanical breastfeeding issues.

      The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial on a sample of 90 babies (45 in each
      group), under six weeks, presenting sucking dysfunctions, in Quebec city (Canada). The
      control group will receive usual care with a lactation consultant and the intervention group
      will receive usual care plus an osteopathic treatment. It is a simple blind clinical trial:
      the osteopath finds out, prior to evaluating the patient, what intervention should be
      delivered to the baby (assessment alone or standardized osteopathic treatment for infant).

      The results will ultimately lead to improvements in the existing knowledge on the fields of
      osteopathy and lactation support, allowing implementation of osteopathic care in the
      perinatal network.
