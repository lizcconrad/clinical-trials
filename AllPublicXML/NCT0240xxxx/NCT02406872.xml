    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the optimal dose for Remimazolam Tosilate as an
      intravenous general anaesthetic drug in operations and to determine its efficacy and safety
      profile comparing to propofol.

    <textblock>
      This is an multi-center，double-blinded，parallel and control study using Remimazolam or
      propofol for anesthesia in operations.Subjects are randomized to different treatment groups
      (including 3 for Remimazolam Tosilate and 1 for propofol) and anaesthetics are pumped
      contimuously into bodies.Analgesics and muscle relaxants are permitted during
      operations.Efficacy，safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of Remimazolam
      Tosilate are to be evaluated.
