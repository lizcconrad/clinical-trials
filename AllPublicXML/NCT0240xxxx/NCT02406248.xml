      A multicenter, single arm, open label, Phase IV study to evaluate safety and to describe the
      cumulative incidence of major cardiovascular events of Ticagrelor in Taiwanese patients with
      non ST-segment (a segment in the eletrocardiogram which presents the period when ventricles
      are depolarized) elevation myocardial infarction

  <detailed_description>

      This study will be conducted in approximately 8 investigational centres in Taiwan. It is
      expected that approximately 100 patients will be enrolled into study treatment. This study is
      to describe the safety and tolerability of ticagrelor, by assessment of the bleeding events
      and other serious adverse events (SAEs) during 1year follow up in Taiwanese non ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients.
