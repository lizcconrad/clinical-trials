    <textblock>
      To compare surgical site infection (SSI) rate in patients undergoing laparoscopic
      appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis and treated with single dose regime of
      antibiotics versus group of patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy without antibiotics
      treatment. Patient will be given either single dose of perioperative antibiotics or no
      antibiotics before surgery.

    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic appendectomies are performed by one of the 6 institutional attending surgeons.
      US and/or abdominal CT scans are obtained as clinically necessary to make the diagnosis of
      appendicitis. All of the appendectomies are initiated laparoscopically. Postoperative orders
      are controlled via a standard electronic order set for all operations.

      Patients found to have acute uncomplicated appendicitis at appendectomy will be randomized to
      either single dose of perioperative antibiotics /On the second post-operative day the patient
      who has no fever and tolerating a regular diet, will be discharged home without oral
      antibiotics. On the post-operative, day seven after surgery all patients will be examined in
      the outpatient clinic on the presence of surgical site infection. then will be followed for a
      30 days after surgery .
