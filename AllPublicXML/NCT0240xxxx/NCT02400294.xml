      Effect of toothbrushing in oral care of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients on
      prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, before and after study in 5 Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of a university
      hospital.

      The before period (control phase, 6 months): standard oral care 3 times a day in every
      consecutive intubated patients in the participating ICUs The interphase period (1 month):
      formal training of all the nurses, physicians and residents on the use of toothbrushing
      during oral care The after period: (study phase, 6 months): standard oral care with tooth
      brushing 3 times a day in every consecutive intubated patients in the participating ICUs

    <measure>Nosocomial ventilator associated pneumonia</measure>
    <time_frame>at Day-28</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of at least two signs (body fever greater than 38°C; leukocytosis greater than 12000/ml or leukopenia below 4000/ml, purulent pulmonary secretions) associated with the appearance of a new infiltrate or modification of an existing infiltrate on chest-X-ray. Confirmation by a lower respiratory tract sample using a quantitative culture with a predefined positive threshold. Hospital-acquired pneumonia was defined as a pneumonia that occurs at least 48 hours after admission, which was not incubating at time of admission (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2005; 171, 388-416).</description>
