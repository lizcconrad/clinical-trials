    <textblock>
      Transsynaptic degeneration of the retinogeniculate pathways is well documented to occur in
      nonhuman primates when the cerebral lesion occurs even during adulthood. In case of humans,
      retrograde transsynaptic degeneration of the retinogeniculate pathways has been shown to
      occur following prenatal or perinatal lesions, but its occurrence after cerebral lesions in
      adults is considerable rare. It is, however, well established that retrograde transsynaptic
      degeneration affects other neural systems in humans even when the injury occurs during
      adulthood. Some histopathological evidence points to the possibility of transsynaptic
      degeneration of the retinogeniculate pathway in humans even when the lesion occurs in adults,
      but the clinical significance is unknown.'

      Purpose:

      To measure the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) in patients with visual field defects due to
      intracerebral processes. To correlate GCL with the localization and type of intracerebral
      lesion.

      To compare the GCL with the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) to investigate, which of the 2
      parameters is more sensitive to show retinal layer abnormalities.

      To correlate GCL with visual field defects and electrophysiological parameters.
