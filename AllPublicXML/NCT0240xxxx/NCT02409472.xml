  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dukes B2-C colorectal cancer patients who had no evidence of disease at the end of their
      front line treatment (surgery and adjuvant radio-chemotherapy, if indicated) are eligible for
      the trial and randomized to two different surveillance programs. These programs differ
      greatly in the frequency of diagnostic imaging. They have similar schedules of physical
      examinations and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assessments. Patients will receive baseline
      and yearly health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) questionnaires. Primary outcomes are
      overall survival and QoL.

      Minimal program for colon cancer: Office visit and CEA at 4,8,12,16,20,24,30,36,42,48, and 60
      months. Colonoscopy at 12, and 48 months. Liver echography* at 8, and 20 months.

      Intensive program for colon cancer: Office visit, CBC, CEA+CA 19.9 at
      4,8,12,16,20,24,30,36,42,48, and 60 months. Colonoscopy at 12, 24, 36, 48,and 60 months.
      Liver echography* at 4,8,12,16,24,36,48, and 60 months. Chest X-ray at 12,24,36,48,and 60
      months.

      * Abdominal-pelvis C.T., as an alternative to echography, was a 2° level exam only (doubtful
      results of physical examination or echography; increasing levels of CEA; predictable poor
      sensitivity of echography due to obesity or other anatomic-clinical conditions)
