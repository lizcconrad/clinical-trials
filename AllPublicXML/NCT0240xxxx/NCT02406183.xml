  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of advanced metastatic melanoma remains poor although a breakthrough has been
      achieved with the novel anti-CTLA-4 treatment (ipilimumab) for a subset of patients.
      Unfortunately, due to immune resistance, the majority of patients do not obtain long-lasting
      clinical benefit. Radiotherapy is able to interfere with immune resistance by inducing
      immunogenic cell death. Preclinical evidence indicates that combining radiotherapy with
      anti-CTLA-4 treatment increases response rates compared to single agent treatment. These data
      are supported by several spectacular clinical cases and one retrospective study. The
      investigators hypothesize that combining ipilimumab with radiotherapy will result in a higher
      response rate compared to ipilimumab or radiotherapy in monotherapy. Given the complexity of
      the interaction in anti-tumor immunity, the first goal of this project is to assess the
      safety of the combined treatment.

      The safety profiles of ipilimumab and SBRT are well studied separately 22-24, but prospective
      data on the combination of ipilimumab and high-dose SBRT are lacking. Consequently, the first
      goal of the proposed prospective phase I trial is to assess the safety (dose limiting
      toxicity, DLT) of the combination of high-dose SBRT and ipilimumab in patients with advanced
      melanoma.
