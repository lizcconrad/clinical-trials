      This will be a single centre, evaluator blind, randomized, parallel group, stratified, two
      week study in healthy participants. The clinical study is designed to provide reassurance
      that the formulations developed for children and babies with mild to moderately dry skin and
      for children whose skin is prone to atopic dermatitis (eczema) are well tolerated in the
      target population, babies and young children with dry skin.

    <measure>Tolerability assessment of test product</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The tolerability of the test product under normal conditions of use, will be assessed by paediatrician using a 5 point scale (where score 1= very good; 2= good; 3= acceptable; 4= poor and 5= very poor) at day 14, or earlier if the participant withdraws from the study prematurely with at least one product use.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual assessment of skin</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in participants' skin condition will be assessed using the Overall Dry Skin (ODS) score (0= Absent; 1= Faint scaling, faint roughness and dull appearance; 2= Small scales in combination with a few larger scales, slight roughness, whitish appearance; 3= Small and larger scales uniformly distributed, definite roughness, possibly slight redness and possibly a few superficial cracks; 4= Dominated by large scales, advanced roughness, redness present, eczematous changes and cracks) at baseline and day 14.</description>
