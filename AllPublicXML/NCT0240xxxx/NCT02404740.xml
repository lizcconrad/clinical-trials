  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a pulse oximeter, we have developed an algorithm that estimates intracranial pressure
      (ICP) based on patients who have had traumatic brain injuries. Patients with hydrocephalus
      are typically treated with a shunt in order to reduce ICP. At times the shunt can
      malfunction. We believe that our algorithm will help identify when a hydrocephalus patient's
      shunt has malfunctioned.

      A malfunctioning ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt will typically cause a rise in intracranial
      pressure, which can be difficult to identify without costly imaging. Novel, state-of-the art
      machine learning techniques can be leveraged to develop an algorithm that noninvasively
      estimates intracranial pressure. The resulting algorithm will accurately determine the
      presence or absence of ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in patients with hydrocephalus.
