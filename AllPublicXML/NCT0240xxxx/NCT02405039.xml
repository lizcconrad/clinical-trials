  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double masked study designed to evaluate the safety of EBI-005 5 mg/mL
      topical ophthalmic solution given three times daily (TID) compared to vehicle-control over a
      one year period in subjects with dry eye disease (DED). Approximately 188 subjects will be
      enrolled to either EBI-005 or vehicle at up to 15 centers in the United States (US) and
      Canada.
