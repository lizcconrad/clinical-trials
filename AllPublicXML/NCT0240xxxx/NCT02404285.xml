    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week, multi-site, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in subjects with mild
      to moderate facial acne. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to apply either topical NAG or
      vehicle gel daily. Subjects will be evaluated for clinical acne and quality of life outcomes
      at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks.

      Sample Size: N= 60 completed subjects Male and female subjects 12 years or older diagnosed
      with mild to moderate inflammatory facial acne vulgaris.

      Subjects will be treated with once daily topical NAG or matching vehicle and will attend
      screening, randomization, 2,4,8 and 12 week visits. The following will be assessed:

        1. Lesion counts with photography

        2. Investigator Global Assessment

        3. Acne Quality of Life Questionnaire

        4. Treatment Area Assessment by Investigator

      Subjects will discontinue all baseline topical acne treatments with a 2 week washout and/or
      all systemic acne treatments with a 3 week washout. All subjects will be provided open label
      Cetaphil facial cleanser and double-blind NAG or vehicle product.

    <description>Subjects will complete the Acne-QoL form at each visit. The Acne-QoL is a validated measure that contains 19 questions referring to the past week, organized into four areas: self-perception, role-social, role-emotional, and acne symptoms. Domain scores are calculated by adding the item scores within each domain, with higher scores reflecting better QoL determination.</description>

          3. In the area to be treated, has no significant facial dermatological conditions other
             than acne (as determined by the investigator) that would interfere with any study
             treatment or procedure

          4. Is willing and able to discontinue use of all baseline acne treatments for the
             duration of their trial participation

          8. Is able to read, understand and sign the informed consent document and communicate
             with study staff and investigator. If the subject is a minor, the parent or documented

          3. Has any history of skin malignancy

          4. Has significant facial hair that would interfere with evaluation of acne lesions or
             global assessment.

          5. Has used any systemic medications (including antibiotics, estrogens, retinoids)
             primarily for treatment of acne in the 21 days prior to randomization.

          6. Has used estrogens primarily as treatment for acne in the 21 days prior to
             randomization (estrogens prescribed for other reasons will be allowed if stable for at
             least 30 days prior to randomization).

          7. Has had any professional facial treatments in the 14 days prior to randomization.

          8. Has received any investigational treatment in the 30 days prior to randomization.

          9. Have any significant medical problems or other issues that would, in the
