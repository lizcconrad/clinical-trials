  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients who present with problem drinking also present with mood problems. Problem
      drinking and mood problems co-occurring together in individuals lead them to have more severe
      symptoms, greater disability and poorer quality of life than individuals with only problem
      drinking, and they pose a greater economic burden to society due to their higher use of
      health services. This study aims to assess the efficacy of a new, innovative and cost
      effective treatment strategy aimed at reducing the burden that these co-occurring conditions
      impose on the suffers and their families as well as the community and health systems.

      In a recent pilot study of supportive text messages for patients with problem drinking and
      co-occurring depression, the investigators established that patients who received twice daily
      supportive text messages for three months had significantly less depressive symptoms than
      those who did not receive such messages. There was also a trend to finding that patients who
      received the supportive text messages were more likely to have higher alcohol free days than
      those who did not receive any supportive text messages.

      This study seeks to extend the knowledge gained from the pilot study. A larger group of
      patients with alcohol use disorder and a depressive disorder will be randomly assigned to two
      groups. One group will receive supportive text messages for six months duration whilst the
      other group will receive no supportive text messages. The patients will be followed up at 3,
      6, 9 and 12 months to determine which of the two groups have less alcohol and mood problems.
      It is anticipated that patients receiving supportive text messages will report significantly
      greater alcohol free days as well as significantly less relapses, hospitalizations and mood
      symptoms than those not receiving such messages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Co-morbidity of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and mood disorders presents a great challenge to
      health systems and exacts a tremendous toll world-wide. Individuals with a dual diagnosis
      have more severe symptoms, greater disability and poor quality of life than those with either
      diagnosis alone, and pose a greater economic burden to society due to their higher use of
      treatment services. New, enhanced, efficient, innovative and cost effective treatment
      strategies aimed at reducing the burden that the disorders impose on the suffers and their
      families as well as the community and health systems are required. In a pilot trial of
      supportive text messages for patients with alcohol use disorders and co-morbid depression,
      the investigators established that patients who received twice daily supportive text messages
      for three months had significantly less depressive symptoms than those who did not receive
      such messages. There was also a trend to finding that patients who received the supportive
      text messages were more likely to have higher cumulative abstinence duration than those who
      did not receive any supportive text messages.

      This research seeks to extend the knowledge gained from the pilot trial. A randomised trial
      will be conducted on a larger sample size of patients with alcohol use disorder and a
      co-morbid depressive disorder (including bipolar depression) for an extended duration (6
      months of supportive text messages and 1 year follow-up instead of 3 months text messages
      with 6 months follow-up in the pilot trial). It is hypothesised that patients receiving
      supportive text messages will report significantly greater cumulative abstinence duration as
      well as significantly less relapses, hospitalizations and mood symptoms than those not
      receiving such messages. It is anticipated that this technology intervention for relapse
      prevention will be acceptable to patients as well as cost effective.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive twice daily supportive text messages to their mobile phone for 6 months following discharge from a 4-week in-patient dual diagnosis treatment programme. The messages will be sent by a computer programme at 10am and 7pm each day and will be set up and monitored by the research worker who will not participate in follow-up assessments. They will receive a fortnightly text message thanking them for participating in the study, and a brief phone call every 2 weeks to ensure that they are still using their phone and that they have received some messages. The intervention group will also receive treatment as usual, i.e. any follow-up after-care that they chose to participate in and regular AA/Lifering meetings.</description>

    <description>The supportive text messages are based on existing aphorisms in the recovery literature. Each day patients will receive one message targeting mood and another message targeting abstinence from alcohol in accordance with the primary aims of our study. An example text message aimed at improving mood is: &quot;Monitor changes in your mood; develop a list of personal warning signs.&quot; An example message targeting abstinence is: &quot;Keep Sobriety as a number one priority and you will reach your goals. None of the messages will be repeated. The messages will be sent in the morning and evening, with the theme (mood/alcohol) of the messages pseudo-randomised according to delivery time, so that no more than three successive days will have the same theme sent at the same time slot.</description>
