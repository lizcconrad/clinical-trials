      This study is determining whether the addition of cyclophosphamide to pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone improves progression free survival in patients with relapsed refractory myeloma
      (RRMM) compare to pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone. Patients will be randomised on a 1:1
      basis to receive CPD or Pd. Treatment will be continued until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the European Union (EU),
      responsible for an estimated 21,000 deaths in the EU in 2008. For patients that relapse or
      are refractory to current standard treatment (combination of bortezomib/lenalidomide,
      dexamethasone and an alkylating agent) there are few options available and therefore the
      prognosis within this group is often poor with response to treatment decreasing with
      successive relapses until resistant disease develops. . Current standard treatment at first
      relapse in the UK is the use of bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone and
      cyclophosphamide. Another common treatment is lenalidomide given with dexamethasone and
      cyclophosphamide. The addition of cyclophosphamide has demonstrated to improve treatment
      outcomes whilst being tolerated well. A recent clinical study has shown the addition of
      cyclophosphamide to the combination of pomalidomide and dexamethasone has shown to be safe
      and tolerable and beneficial in terms of treatment outcomes. The primary aim of this study is
      to investigate whether the addition of cyclophosphamide to pomalidomide and dexamethasone
      leads to an improved progression free survival. A secondary aim is to identify markers from
      clinical material that will predict response to pomalidomide in a group of relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients to provide important information for use in
      discussions with NICE on how best to improve the value and use of pomalidomide in the UK in
      the RRMM setting.
