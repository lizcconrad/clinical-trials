      The overall goal of this project is to identify, assess and longitudinally monitor subjects
      who are interested in participating in brain research. Participants will enroll through the
      website, BrainHealthRegistry.org, and provide informed consent prior to any study activities.
      The website will collect a variety of information, including participants' overall health,
      memory complaints, family history of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), mood status,
      sleep, diet, and exerciseâ€”all through self-reported online questionnaires. Participants will
      also be ask to take online cognitive tests, and to return to the website at regular
      intervals, to complete follow-up questionnaires and neuropsychological assessments. Everyone
      over the age of 18 is welcome to participate. To join the Brain Health Registry, please visit
      www.BrainHealthRegistry.org.

      Through advertisement and community outreach, potential participants will be directed to the
      website, BrainHealthRegistry.org. The overall goal of this project is to identify, assess and
      longitudinally monitor subjects who are interested in participating in brain research.
      Participants will enroll through the website, BrainHealthRegistry.org, and provide informed
      consent prior to any study activities.

      The website will include:

        1. Information about the Brain Health Registry (who is eligible to participate, the goals
           of the project and other relevant information about investigators and sponsors involved

        2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) such as &quot;How will my information be used?&quot;, &quot;How will
           patient information be safeguarded?&quot;, &quot;What information will be requested?&quot;, &quot;How much
           time will be required for registration and testing?&quot; will be addressed for participants.

        3. General information about Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases
           discussed in lay terms Links to sites that may be of interest to participants

        4. Login to our secure Registry website

      The Registry will be a large, online database of volunteers who are interested in
      participating in neuroscience research. While anyone over the age of 18 is welcome to join
      the Registry, the intent is to concentrate all efforts on enrolling participants age 55 years
      and older. It will consist of online tools and databases, which are HIPAA-compliant and
      secure.

        1. Participants will access the Registry by going to the BHR website,
           BrainHealthRegistry.org

        2. Participants will provide their email address and create an account and username with
           the Registry

        3. The Registry will send an automatic email to the participant to verify their email
