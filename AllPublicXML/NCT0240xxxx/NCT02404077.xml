  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' clinical practice makes use of oral clonidine as a means of transitioning
      from intravenous dexmedetomidine following prolonged infusions (more than 3-5 days). Although
      this is common clinical practice, there is limited clinical data to demonstrate the efficacy
      of this technique and to provide clonidine dosing guidelines. The purpose of this study is to
      retrospectively review the investigators' experience with the use of oral clonidine to
      prevent withdrawal following the prolonged administration of dexmedetomidine.

    <description>Withdrawal is assessed using the Withdrawal Assessment Tool-1 (WAT-1). The 19-item assessment consists of (1) a review of the patient's record for the past 12 hours, (2) direct observation of the patient for 2 minutes, (3) patient assessment during a progressive stimulated exam routinely performed to assess level of consciousness at the beginning of each 12-hour shift, and finally (4) assessment of post-stimulus recovery.</description>
