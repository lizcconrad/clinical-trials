    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the success rate of letrozole and misoprostol versus
      misoprostol alone for medical termination of first trimester pregnancy.

      Primary outcome:

      Incidence of complete miscarriage (complete expulsion of the products of conception with no
      need for surgical intervention within one week from the first dose of misoprostol)

      Secondary outcome:

      Need for surgical evacuation of the products of conception

        -  Incomplete expulsion of the products of conception (incomplete miscarriage).

        -  Considerable bleeding necessitating immediate surgical evacuation. Maternal morbidity

        -  Major side effects (Sepsis, considerable vaginal bleeding leading to hemodynamic
           instability or necessitating blood transfusion)

        -  Minor side effects (fever, rigors, nausea, vomiting) Patient's compliance and adherence
           to treatment Hemoglobin and hematocrit deficit

    <description>Women will receive three tablets of letrozole(FemaraR, NOVARTIS) as a single dose, each tablet 2.5 mg (total dose 7.5 mg per day) for two days at home and will be told to bring back the empty packs.
