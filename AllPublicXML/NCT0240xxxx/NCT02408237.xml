  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromodulation is characterized as a technique whose principle neurostimulation to produce
      inhibition or cortical arousal. The tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) is a
      noninvasive brain stimulation method used to modulate cortical excitability using low
      intensity direct current (1-2mA) directed to the scalp via cathodes and anodes electrodes;
      the current reaches the cortex, producing hyperpolarization or depolarization of the axonal
      membrane potential. Evidence has shown that this method is presented as a technique that can
      alter cortical and subcortical neural networks. This technique has been used to treat
      psychiatric disorders such as depression, acute mania, bipolar affective disorder panic,
      hallucinations, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, withdrawal, rehabilitation
      after-stroke and pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, migraine, pancreatitis chronic pain
      and fibromyalgia. It is low-cost technique, with virtually no side effects and carries the
      therapeutic effect by neuromodulatory pathways by distinct pathways activated by the drugs.
      In this scenario falls within the importance of developing devices for home use, inexpensive,
      and easy to use so as to maintain the benefits observed in previous studies. The tDCS is
      presented as a non-pharmacological option that may be offered in this context in society. It
      is noteworthy that, if the benefit is demonstrated, the impact will be of great importance to
      patients and to society, since these are focal techniques and low cost. Because they have no
      focal adverse effects of conventional drug treatments. Additionally, can be constituted as
      technical additive to pharmacotherapy in so much pain as in the treatment of other
      neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, further studies should be encouraged to increase
      knowledge of their effects and mechanisms involved. If the effectiveness of this method for
      home use is confirmed, the therapeutic impact will undoubtedly be of great importance.
      However, to make this project come true, the investigators depend on support for the
      development and validation of tDCS device for home use, so allowing the qualified knowledge
      can be applied to the clinical setting, as well as advance the development of this area of
      neuroscience in Brazil. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop tDCS device for home
      use.
