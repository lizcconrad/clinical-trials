  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the Freedom SCS (spinal cord stimulation) System for the treatment of
      chronic back and leg pain. Patients who have been diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome
      (FBSS) will receive a stimulator device for treatment of their pain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Appropriate Freedom SCS candidate as affirmed by study investigator

          -  Candidate has a stable spine not suitable for further surgery as confirmed by
             physician

          -  18 years of age or older (no upper age limit)

          -  Diagnosis of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) characterized by chronic, intractable
             pain of the legs, back, or both legs and back

          -  At least 6 months since last surgical procedure on the spine

          -  Average score of 60mm or greater on a VAS scale (Scale of 0 to 100, where 0 equals no
             pain and 100 equals worst possible pain)

          -  Pain duration of at least 6 months

          -  Expected lifespan of at least two years

          -  Able to comply with study requirements

          -  Gives informed consent for study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A consistent VAS score of 100 over the past 24 hours as established at Visit 1

          -  A co-existing condition that could increase the risk of SCS implantation (e.g., severe
             cardiac or respiratory disorders, coagulation disorder) or planned surgery within the
             study duration that could be compromised by SCS (e.g., diathermy)

          -  Pregnant or planning to become pregnant

          -  Known or suspected substance abuse within the last 2 years

          -  Major psychiatric disorder (untreated or refractory to treatment) in the investigators
             opinion

          -  Cognitive and/or behavioral issues that could impair study participation, (e.g.,
             unreliability; defective memory; noncompliance in taking medications or keeping
             appointments; or impaired orientation to time, place, and events)

          -  Documented allergy to Freedom SCS material components

          -  Co-existing pain condition or participation in another clinical study that could
             confound the results of this study

          -  History of another implanted medical device (e.g., explanted spinal cord stimulator,
             peripheral nerve stimulation, sacral nerve stimulator, pacemaker, or intrathecal drug
             delivery)
