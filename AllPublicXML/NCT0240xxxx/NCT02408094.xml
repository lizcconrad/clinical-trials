      The purpose of this study is to explore the protein markers and to applicate those protein
      markers in syndrome diagnosis of hot-dampness and blood stasis syndrome in patients with RA.

      RA is one of the main disabling diseases in nowadays, which is an autoimmune disease with
      complex networks mechanism involving multiple signaling pathways and existing cross path. The
      investigators consider that the &quot;heat-dampness and blood stasis&quot; syndrome is the main
      syndrome and major pathogenesis for active RA, which on the base of the theory of traditional
      Chinese medicine and a large quantity of clinical practice, and also examined by mechanism
      experiments. But the material basis of this syndrome is remained unclear, lack of high
      specific objective basis to ensure the syndrome differentiation consistency accurately in
      clinical practice. Proteomic techniques study cells or the body by all the protein expression
      and function, thus has the potential efficient for decoding syndrome biological basis.
      Proteomic techniques are the most effective way to reveal the essence of TCM syndrome. The
      investigators will use proteomic technology to explore the protein markers and to applicate
      those protein markers in syndrome diagnosis of hot-dampness and blood stasis syndrome in
      patients with RA. With strong clinical applicability, this will reveal the scientific
      connotation of this syndrome, preliminarily guide the syndrome differentiation.
