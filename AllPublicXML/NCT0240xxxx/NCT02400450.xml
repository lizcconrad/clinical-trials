  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, double-blind, randomized, controlled food intervention study being
      conducted at the Canadian Centre for Agri-Food Research in Health and Medicine (CCARM) in
      Winnipeg and the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, to examine the effects of a portfolio of
      functional foods on blood glucose and lipids, and blood vessel function in individuals with
      prediabetes.

      A total of 116 participants (n=58/site) with prediabetes (hemoglobin A1c â‰¥6.0 &amp; &lt;7.0 and no
      glucose-lowering medications) and body-mass index (BMI) 18-40 will be recruited for a 12-week
      clinical trial to determine the effect of eating 2 items containing functional ingredients
      daily compared to 2 similar items lacking the functional ingredients. Study foods provided
      are to be incorporated into participant's usual diet.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of a 12 week intervention with a portfolio of 7 food
      products and 7 comparator products for their effect on glycated hemoglobin, blood lipids,
      blood vessel function and metabolic parameters in persons with prediabetes. Prediabetes
      precedes the manifestation of type 2 diabetes and is therefore an appropriate target for
      dietary interventions. It is also associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
      because of the presence of abdominal obesity, elevated LDL-cholesterol and reduced vascular
      function. CVD risk will be assessed based on the profile of lipids and other factors in the
      blood as well using specialized equipment for non-invasive monitoring of blood vessel
      function.

      If the foods prove beneficial for managing blood glucose levels, the publication of results
      in scientific journals and in lay documents will increase awareness and provide important
      information of the health benefits of these products for consumers, health professionals and
      the food industry. It will also help individuals who may be able to manage their illnesses in
      a healthful non-pharmaceutical nutritional approach and who may benefit from
      physician-prescribed nutritional counseling with a focus on foods known to improve certain
      disease biomarkers. At this time these approaches lack practicality and direct application to
      individuals who are interested in adopting a new dietary regime capable of disease
      prevention.
