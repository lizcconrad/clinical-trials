  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 3 week study is to test the effectiveness of an over-the-counter (OTC)
      skin balm in infants and toddlers with mild to moderate dry, itchy skin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 infants and toddlers will be enrolled in this study to yield 40 completed subjects, 30
      babies in the active treatment group and 10 babies in the positive control group.

      Infants and toddlers aged 6 to 47 months inclusive will receive either a prescription or
      non-marketed investigational product for the treatment of eczema. Caregivers will be asked to
      stop use of prescription eczema treatments one week before the start of the study and during
      the study. Caregivers will apply study product to babies as indicated for 14 days to affected
      areas.

      Subject caregivers will record treatment use in a daily diary and complete questionnaires. A
      dermatologist will examine and score the babies eczema and symptoms. Skin moisture levels
      will also be tested.

        <description>The signs and symptoms of eczema are measured using the Investigator’s Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA). An assessment of atopic dermatitis based on a 4 point scale, ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe), is used to describe signs and symptoms in 4 designated body regions. Based on the presence or absence of the total number of signs and symptoms, the final rating is categorized as clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe.</description>
