      This is a multi-centre, open label, prospective, non-randomized phase I/II trial in 20
      patients including a safety-run in phase I part comprising 6 patients.

      Trial subjects will receive repeated immunotherapies with autologous Dendritic Cells (DCs),
      presenting two leukemia-associated antigens.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suitable for allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          -  AML M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia)

             failure &gt; grade II NYHA

          -  Recent cerebral hemorrhage

          -  Known allergies to substances used in the generation of DCs

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
