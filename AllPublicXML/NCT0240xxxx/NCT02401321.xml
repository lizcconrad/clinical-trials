      This pilot clinical trial studies the Taking Care of Her program in patients with stage III
      or IV ovarian cancer and spouse caregivers. This counseling program may equip the spouse
      caregiver with skills to support and nurture the patient through initial diagnosis and
      treatment. It may also help patients and spouse caregivers improve communication and coping
      skills.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the feasibility of the study protocol, including recruitment and retention.

      II. Assess the short-term impact of the intervention on standardized measures of
      behavioral-emotional adjustment of spouse caregivers and diagnosed women on depressed mood,
      anxiety, quality of marital communication, perceived spousal support, and spouse caregivers'
      skills and self-confidence to manage the emotional toll of the illness on themselves and the
      ill partner.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and spouse caregivers complete the Taking Care of Her Program comprising 5
      telephone-delivered intervention sessions over 45-60 minutes every 2 weeks. The intervention
      sessions are designed to provide training for spouse caregivers and patients to better manage
      the impact and emotional toll of recently diagnosed ovarian cancer, including its impact on
      their interpersonal communication and support about the cancer.

    <description>To test the feasibility of the study protocol, including recruitment, a detailed spreadsheet will be used to track the relative success of different recruitment channels. The channel through which every eligible patient is recruited will be tracked: self-referral, provider referral, or passive letter referral. The enrollment method that yielded the most accruals will be computed. The proportion of enrolled study participants that came from each channel used for the referral will be reported.</description>
