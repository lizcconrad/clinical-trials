      Introduction: Voice therapy is the best indication for the most voice disorders, with a
      strong degree of recommendation based on systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials,
      with a predominance of benefit over risk. Some speech therapy techniques are specific, others
      are organized principles or with eclectic approaches, that use a combination of strategies.
      So far, few studies have tested the effectiveness of treatment for dysphonia due to time
      spent, safety and improved quality of life more comprehensive as they are made in clinical.
      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the Comprehensive Voice Rehabilitation
      Program compared with Vocal Function Exercises in behavioral dysphonia. Methods: 106
      professional of voice with dysphonia behavior, between 18 and 50 years old and vocal
      complaints for more than six months. These professionals have been evaluated by an
      otolaryngologist, randomized to participate of Vocal Function Exercises arm or Comprehensive
      Voice Rehabilitation Program arm. Both arms were follow for six sessions with speech
      therapists and reassessed when finish the period and after one month. The primary outcomes
      assessed are: reduction of VHI score, improved voice quality in the CAPE-V and improves the
      larynx condition. Conclusions: The Comprehensive Voice Program has an eclectic approach and
      follows the philosophy of what is practiced in clinics in Brazil. We believe this program can
      demonstrate the power of voice therapy effectiveness more organized to solve problems, with
      shorter duration of treatment, benefit patient health and funding agencies such as Unified
      Public Health System (SUS) and health insurance.
