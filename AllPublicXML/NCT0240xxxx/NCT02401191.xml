      Primary Objective:

      To assess the safety of twice-daily fexofenadine 60 mg/phenylephrine 10 mg (FEX60/PE10)
      combination tablet in patients with allergic rhinitis.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the effectiveness of a twice-daily FEX60/PE10 combination tablet on nasal
      symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), and daily activity impairment.
