      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether saxagliptin (and vitamin D3) with
      insulin therapy can better protect islet β cell function than insulin alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LADA is actually a form of type 1 diabetes, which is caused by autoimmune damage of islet β
      cells and triggered by environmental factors based on genetic susceptibility. LADA shows some
      characteristics of type 2 diabetes at its onset, which develops slowly and latently, and
      easily be misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes due to slowly β cell function deterioration. This
      is a multi-center, open-label, 1:1:1 randomized controlled trial to investigate the
      protective efficacy of saxagliptin and vitamin D3 in LADA patients previously treated with
      insulin. The study comprises twice screening, the 8-week run-in period and the 104-week
      treatment period. The first screening is to choose the LADA patients from the diabetes
      patients whose disease duration &lt; 1 year. After obtaining the informed consent from the
      patient who is willing to participate the 104-week treatment will enter to the 8-week run-in
      period and receive the guidance of diet, exercise, insulin, blood glucose monitoring, and
      patient diary recording, etc. The second screening will find out the eligible patients from
      the 6-week to 8-week run-in period according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, then the
      patients will be randomized to the 104-week treatment period. Subjects will be randomized
      into three groups through central dynamic randomization: insulin, insulin+saxagliptin,
      insulin+saxagliptin+vitamin D3. Our previous randomized-controlled pilot study showed that
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors could significantly improve islet β-cell function
      in patients with LADA. The main purpose of this study: evaluate whether saxagliptin (and
      vitamin D3) with insulin therapy can better protect islet β cell function than insulin alone.
