    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1a/1b, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, dose escalation study to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor
      activity of ACY-241 for oral administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy with
      orally administered pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in eligible patients with
      relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During phase 1a, patients will receive 1 cycle of ACY-241 monotherapy. Patients who complete
      the ACY-241 monotherapy cycle without a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and are clinically
      stable may continue to phase 1b combination therapy, beginning with Cycle 2. During phase 1b,
      patients will receive ACY 241 in combination with pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone at
      the currently approved pomalidomide dose and schedule. Each cohort of patients in phase 1a
      and phase 1b will consist of at least 3 patients. The first patient enrolled in each cohort
      of phase 1a will be observed for 1 week before enrollment of subsequent patients in the
      cohort. Patients who withdraw consent before entering phase 1b will be replaced. (Replacement
      patients must complete phase 1a prior to continuing to phase 1b.) Patients who experience a
      DLT or other unacceptable toxicity in Cycle 1 of phase 1a monotherapy or Cycle 2, the first
      cycle of phase 1b combination therapy, will be removed from study treatment. An assessment of
      the safety of treatment will be completed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) prior to
      dose-escalation.
