  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, American Academy of Pediatrics and the
      World Health Organization have recently published recommendations related to placental
      transfusions in preterm infants. This project will review outcomes of preterm infants
      following a quality improvement implementation process in several delivery centers in
      Indiana. Centers involved in this project are also part of the Indiana Vermont Oxford Network
      (IRB#1003-84). Data is recorded for that network and the investigators site will be reviewing
      that data every 3 months from infants who have completed the Vermont Oxford Network
      collection. This project will specifically look at the incidence of intraventricular
      hemorrhage, necrotizing entercolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, sepsis and death
      following the implementation of the ACOG recommendations.
