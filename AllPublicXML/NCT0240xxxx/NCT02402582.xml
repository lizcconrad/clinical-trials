      Implementing the Family-centered Empowerment Model (FCEM) as a new Cardiac Rehabilitation
      program for Myocardial Infarction patients with four-stage including perceived threat with
      group discussion method, self-efficacy with problem solving method, self-esteem with
      educational partnership and outcome and process evaluations

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FCEM was designed in 2003 by Alhani for chronic patients in Iran and accordingly it was
      executed for 20 different chronic diseases. Few studies have been conducted to investigate
      the effect of FCEM on the quality of life, perceived stress, and anxiety of patients with
      Myocardial infarction (MI). Improving quality of life, perceived stress, and anxiety in
      patients with MI can be associated with decrease in prevalence of overt cardiovascular
      disease due to a large proportion of cardiovascular diseases' deaths are premature and
      preventable. The study was conducted to identify the effect of Family-centered Empowerment
      Model on the quality of life, perceived stress, and state and trait anxiety of patients with
      Myocardial infarction. A triple-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial design was used
      to conduct the study. A total of 70 patients and family members aged 45-85 years in coronary
      care unit were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The patients in the
      intervention group received FCEM with four-step including perceived threat with group
      discussion method, self-efficacy with problem solving method, self-esteem with educational
      partnership and outcome and process evaluations. Pre and post intervention the patients'
      empowerment levels by FCEM questionnaires were measured. Data were collected over thirty two
      months from the beginning of June 2012 to the end of January 2015 in nine times during every
      three-month. Quality of life, perceived stress, and state and trait anxiety were assessed
      using the short form health survey (SF-36), the 14-item Perceived Stress, and the 20-item
      state and 20-item trait anxiety questionnaires, respectively.

    <description>First stage was including the perceived intensity and the perceived sensitivity. Self-efficacy in stage two was that the individual gets belief in that they can do a special task. Self- efficacy alludes to the individual's expectation of themselves and the ability to do action. Self-esteem in third stage was to clarify and identify the level of approval, acceptance and merit that the individual feels they have. Formative assessment was to encourage the patients more toward internalizing their locus of control and summative evaluation was to evaluate the effectiveness of this model on modifying, balancing and improving the health related quality of life (HRQOL) dimensions of MI patients after 3 months for eight points in the stage four.</description>
