  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether intraoperative intraportal chemotherapy combined with adjuvant
      chemotherapy as treatment could improve disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with curative
      colorectal cancer resection compared with adjuvant chemotherapy alone.

      This is a prospective, blind (doctors who done outcome measures were masked), multi-center,
      2-arm randomized controlled trial.

    <description>patients treated with intraoperative intraportal chemotherapy (IPC) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC; mFOLFOX6).; IPC: During the operation, one dose of fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) 1000 mg and oxaliplatin 100 mg were administered as a bolus into the regional vein within 5 minutes just before ligation.
AC: All patients received mFOLFOX6 adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of a 2-h infusion of 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin given simultaneously with a 2-h infusion of 400 mg/m2 LV, followed by a bolus of 400 mg/m2 5-FU, and then a continuous infusion of 2000 mg/m2 5-FU given on 2 consecutive days by intravenous pumping every 14 days for 12 cycles.[1] Adverse events were categorized according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0.</description>
