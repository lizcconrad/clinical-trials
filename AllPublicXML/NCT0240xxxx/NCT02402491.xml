  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for in-stent restenosis
      (ISR) are enrolled. All patients will be randomized to receive either 12 months or 24 months
      of dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 receptor antagonist in addition to aspirin, all
      patients continue receiving aspirin indefinitely. The primary efficacy end points of this
      study are the incidence of a composite end point including all cause deaths, myocardial
      infarction, the incidence of Academic Research Consortium defined definite or probable stent
      thrombosis and stroke (MACCE) at 24 months. The primary safety end point is the incidence of
      GUSTO moderate or severe bleeding.

      The ISR-DAPT Study is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial that will enroll 1000
      subjects treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for in-stent restenosis. All
      patients will be randomized to receive either 12 months or 24 months of dual antiplatelet
      therapy with a P2Y12 receptor antagonist in addition to aspirin after index procedure. All
      patients continue receiving aspirin indefinitely. The primary efficacy end points of this
      study are the incidence of a composite end point including all cause deaths, myocardial
      infarction, the incidence of Academic Research Consortium defined definite or probable stent
      thrombosis and stroke (MACCE) at 24 months. The primary safety end point is the incidence of
      GUSTO moderate or severe bleeding at 24 months.
