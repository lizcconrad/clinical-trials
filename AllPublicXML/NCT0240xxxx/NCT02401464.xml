      This study was designed to evaluate the bioequivalence of a single oral dose of 2 different
      drug forms of TAK-536 pediatric formulation (dry syrup, granules) and a single oral dose of
      TAK-536 commercial tablet by using open-label, 2 × 2 crossover design.

         17. The participant has abnormal laboratory values at screening or prior to the start of
             study medication for Period 1 that suggest a clinically significant underlying disease
             or participant with the following lab abnormalities: alanine transaminase (ALT) or
