  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate a diagnostic test that combines different blood
      markers to identify and correctly classify patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to
      individuals with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, patient control) versus
      cognitively healthy individuals (healthy control).

      The purpose of this study is to validate a new multi-parameter diagnostic test, on a
      well-characterised population based on new AD diagnostic criteria, that combines different
      types of markers, selected based on prior exploratory studies carried out by Raman Health
      Technologies.

Neary (Neurology, 1998) for primary aphasia. A clinical and neuropsychological assessment is required, with the optional presence of alterations to the progranulin gene (and others) and there must be a compatible, previously performed imaging test (MRI, PET or SPECT) (predominantly frontal or frontotemporal atrophy).</description>

        It is estimated that a sample of 500 patients (250 with AD and 250 with FTD) and 200
        controls (700 individuals in total) will be sufficient to corroborate the hypothesis that
        permits validation of the new diagnostic test. The sample size estimate is based on a
        hypothesis of non inferiority between the new test and the test used in normal clinical
        practice, expecting a 10% delta of the 75% validity, sensitivity and specificity indices
        with an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.20.
