  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the efficacy of triheptanoin oil in patients with
      Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) due to ATP1A3 gene mutation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical spectrum of Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) is wide and characterized
      by the association of permanent and paroxysmal (palsy, dystonia, ocular, epileptic,
      dysautonomic events) neurological events, with onset in childhood. Most of AHC patients carry
      mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. This gene encodes the Na+/K+ ATPase witch is a transmembrane
      ion pump generating chemical and electrical gradient of sodium and potassium across the
      plasma membrane. Those paroxystic events in AHC patients with mutations in the ATP1A3 gene
      could be associated with a glucidic/energetic metabolism or intracerebral excitability
      disorder.

      Triheptanoin is a triglyceride, whose derivatives pass the blood - brain barrier and enhance
      the Krebs cycle functions. Triheptanoin could therefore allow energy supply to the brain,
      which is essential for the functioning of the Na+/ K+ ATPase that consumes a significant
      amount of energy in the brain.

      The investigators goal is to do a pilot study to test the effectiveness on paroxystic
      manifestations and the safety of triheptanoin in a small group of patients with Alternating
      Hemiplegia of Childhood secondary to ATP1A3 mutations.

    <description>Triheptanoin is a triglyceride composed of three heptanoate (C7 fatty acid) esters. Triheptanoin is manufactured by chemical synthesis from glycerol and heptanoic acid. Triheptanoin is a liquid, intended for oral (PO) administration.
Participants will be given approximately 1g/kg of Triheptanoin divided at least in three doses (at 8 am, 12 noon, and 8 pm). A one-day titration period will be used, using 0.5 g/kg increments before arriving at the full dose.</description>
