      48-week open label randomized phase IV investigator initiated intervention study. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate whether HIV-1 suppression can be maintained by DTG monotherapy
      in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed patients on cART.

      104 adults fulfilling the in and exclusion criteria and on stable cART will be randomized
      over 2 investigational arms.

      The first arm will contain the direct switch population. This population will switch directly
      from stable cART to Dolutegravir mono-therapy on baseline visit.

      The second arm will contain the delayed-switch population. This group will switch from stable
      cART to Dolutegravir monotherapy 24 weeks after baseline visit.

      The main goal is to investigate if Dolutegravir mono-therapy could be non-inferior to cART in
      virological suppressed HIV-1 infected adults.

      If a interim analysis (performed when 40 patients on dolutegravir monotherapy have passed
      week 12) shows that it is safe to continue the study, an additional 30 patients will be
      included on top of the 104 patients needed for the primary endpoint analysis. In contrast to
      the primary endpoint population, these additional 30 patients will have a CD4 nadir &lt;200 but
      a CD4 &gt;350 at the time of the screening visit. Besides that, these 30 patients will have to
      fulfill all other in and exclusion criteria of the primary endpoint population (specifically
      a viral load never &gt;100.000). These 30 patients are part of a pilot study looking at the
      possibility to broaden the eligible population in a future larger randomized clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      DTG Monotherapy will be considered non-inferior to cART if the lower bound of the one sided
      97.5%CI for the difference in proportion of patients reaching the primary endpoint is not
      lower than -12%. For this purpose, a sample size of 52 per arm would provide 80% power at
      alpha 0.025 to establish non-inferiority of DTG monotherapy compared with cART when the
      primary endpoint success rate is 95% in both treatment arms.
