  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a major public health problem and there is a strong need of new preventive
      strategies based on drug and lifestyle interventions. It is now well-established that healthy
      eating patterns and increasing physical activity can prevent or delay prostate cancer
      progression. Intake of cruciferous vegetables (e.g. broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels
      sprouts, kale) has been associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer progression;
      however the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. The investigators propose to
      undertake a pilot study on a group of men with early prostate cancer on active surveillance
      to determine whether a diet rich in broccoli will induce changes in tumor size and blood flow
      measured by conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques. Men with early prostate
      cancer on active surveillance who have visible cancer lesions on MRI will be recruited onto
      this double-blinded randomized intervention and they will be asked to eat one portion of
      broccoli soup per week for 6 months. The investigators will test two varieties of broccoli
      (standard and 'Beneforte extra' broccoli) that are able to deliver two different levels of
      sulforaphane (SF), an active compound extensively studied for its potential anticancer
      properties. This study will involve MRI scans, blood and urine collection before and after a
      6 month intervention period. This study design will not only allow us to observe diet-induced
      changes within the prostate but also at the systemic level. In addition, participant's
      lifestyle (habitual diet and physical activity) will be assessed by food diaries and exercise
      questionnaires.

      This study has been funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)
      and Prostate Cancer foundation (PCF).

      The study is a randomised double-blinded dietary intervention study. The study population
      will consist of men (n=20) aged 18-80 years with a BMI between 19.5 and 35 kg/m2 with low
      risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen [PSA] &lt; 10ng/ml; Gleason grade 6; T category
      T1 or T2) or intermediate risk prostate cancer patients (PSA 10-20ng/ml; Gleason 7 (including
      selected 4+3 cases that will not be advised for radical prostatectomy; T category T1 or T2)
      who have visible lesions on MRI and have already decided to take up active
      surveillance/monitoring. The investigators chose these inclusion criteria because they
      reflect the population of men on active surveillance that the investigators are currently
      recruiting in the ESCAPE study (Effect of Sulforaphane on Prostate CAncer PrEvention;
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01950143) via the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.
      Volunteers recruited onto this study will be randomly allocated to one of two arms in which
      they will be required to consume one portion of broccoli soup per week, delivering different
      levels of glucoraphanin (SF precursor) in each study arm. This will be part of their normal
      diet for 6 months. The two soups will contain standard broccoli (i), or
      glucoraphanin-enriched broccoli named for the study 'Beneforte extra' (ii). The study will
      involve MRI monitoring at baseline and after 6 months. In addition the investigators will
      collect blood and urine samples at baseline and after 6 months. The volunteers' habitual diet
      and physical activity will also be assessed during the intervention period.
