    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient at least 18 years old and has definitive histologically or cytologically
             confirmed: classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) or diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
             non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

          2. Patient has one or more metastatic lesions &gt;1.5 cm as defined by lymphoma response
             criteria by PET-CT scan. If CT scan is needed for clarification of findings on PET-CT
             it may be done additionally. Tumor sites that are considered measureable must not have
             received prior radiation therapy.

          3. Patients can be enrolled only on one of the treatment arms on this trial.

          4. The investigator will select the appropriate treatment arm for the patient with the
             following requirements: (a) Patients cannot have had prior progression or intolerance
             on the single agent chemotherapy and then enrolled on an arm with that same single
             agent chemotherapy plus pembro (b) The chemotherapy on the arm selected must be
             considered standard of care or listed in www.nccn.org for that cancer type.

          5. Have recovered from acute toxicities of prior treatment:

               -  &gt; 3 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any investigational agent.

               -  &gt; 2 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any radiotherapy, or ≥ 3 weeks or 5
                  half-lives whichever is shorter for treatment with cytotoxic or biologic agents (
                  ≥ 6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas). Chronic treatment with
                  non-investigational gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs or other hormonal or
                  supportive care is permitted.

          6. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood
             counts at time of screening:

          7. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/ microliter, platelet count ≥ 75,000/
             microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL. Subject can be given packed red blood cell
             transfusion.

          8. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min by Cockroft-Gault equation, total
             bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) range, AST/ALT ≤ 3 times the upper
             limit of normal (ULN) range.

          9. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within institutional normal limits. If TSH is above
             the upper limit of normal range, then a free T4 within institutional normal limits is
             acceptable.

         10. At least 100 days must have elapsed in subjects that had a prior autologous
             transplant.

         11. Resolution of prior systemic therapy non-hematologic AE to grade ≤ 2 (except alopecia
             or correctable electrolyte abnormality with supplementation)

         12. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60.

         13. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically
             sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method (abstinence, oral
             contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the study and for 4 months
             following the last dose of Pembrolizumab, brentuximab vedotin, or for 2 years
             following the last dose of chemotherapy on this trial, and must have a negative urine
             or serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. If
             a female subject or female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during this
             period then patient will be recommended to seek appropriate obstetric care. The study
             will not be monitoring subjects or female partners of subjects for pregnancy after the
             last dose of study drug or chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active clinically serious infection &gt; Grade 2.

          2. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          3. Patient has known brain metastases.

          4. Patient has with myelodysplasia, polycythemia vera, idiopathic thrombocythemia,
             myelofibrosis, or acute leukemia.

          5. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment
             plan and follow-up requirements.

          6. Patient has known active infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C (patients
             will be required to be tested for the presence of such viruses prior to therapy on
             this protocol).

          7. Ejection fraction measuring less than 45% (measurement of ejection fraction is
             required only for subjects with prior anthracycline exposure).

          8. Requiring daily corticosteroid dose ≥ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.

          9. Patient has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (e.g., surgery done
             to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ), within 4 weeks prior to
             Day 1 of treatment in this study.

         10. Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any
             of their excipients, or the patient exhibits any of the events outlined in the
             Contraindication or Special Warnings and Precautions sections of the product or
             comparator SmPC or Prescribing Information.

         11. Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems, or
             serious psychiatric disorders, which could compromise the patient's safety or the
             study data integrity.

         12. Patient will be receiving any other anti-cancer therapy during participation in this
             trial.

         13. Prior treatment with Pembrolizumab is not allowed. Prior receipt of other PD-1
             inhibitors or PD-L1 inhibitors is allowed.

         14. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the
             past 2 years.
