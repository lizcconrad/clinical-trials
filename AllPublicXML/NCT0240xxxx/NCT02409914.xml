    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether higher insulin resistance in young women
      with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with reduced cerebral metabolic rate of
      glucose (CMRglu). Brain volumes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative
      cerebral glucose uptake using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) were obtained. The
      potential relationships between anatomical and functional cerebral parameters and insulin
      resistance were assessed with the updated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-IR).

        Women with PCOS (n=7) were referred by physician specialist in endocrinology between April,
        2010 and September, 2013. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on clinical examination using the
        Rotterdam criteria.
