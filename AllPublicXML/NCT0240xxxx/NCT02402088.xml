  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the role of stress in food craving and food
      consumption in obesity. Using experimentally validated guided imagery procedure, the
      investigators propose to examine the stress response using subjective, physiological and
      neurobiological measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and fifty men and women will participate in three laboratory sessions to assess
      stress responses to personal stress imagery, food cue imagery, and to neutral-relaxing
      imagery. Subjects will be distributed into 3 groups stratified by BMI category. Subject
      recruitment, eligibility determination, baseline assessments and script development will be
      conducted at the Yale Stress Center. Subjects will complete a variety of diagnostic,
      cognitive and psychological assessments, a comprehensive physical examination and blood work
      and will be involved in development of imagery scripts from personal stress, food cue and
      neutral-relaxing situations. Subjects will then be scheduled for three laboratory sessions at
      the Yale Stress Center. Subjects will also participate in an imagery and relaxation training
      session followed by three laboratory sessions. The three laboratory sessions will be
      conducted within a brief interval of days, when subjects will be exposed to a personal
      stress, a food cue and a neutral-relaxing imagery condition, one condition per day. The order
      of imagery conditions will be randomly assigned and counterbalanced across subjects in order
      to balance any influences due to order of imagery conditions.

    <description>An abbreviated assessment base don the Food Craving Inventory. The Food Craving Inventory is a self-report questionnaire of specific food cravings. The questionnaire consists of 25 items measuring the frequency of cravings for specific foods and consists of 4 factors or subscales measuring cravings for High Fats, Carbohydrates/Starches, Sweets, and Fast Food Fats and also generates a total score. The brief version of the inventory uses 2 items from each of the 4 subscales.</description>

    <description>The stress imagery script will be based on subjects' description of a recent personal stressful event that they had experienced as &quot;most stressful&quot;. &quot;Most stressful&quot; is determined by having the subjects rate the perceived stress experienced by them on a 10-point Likert scale where &quot;1=not at all stressful&quot; and &quot;10=the most stress they felt recently in their life&quot;. Only situations rated as 8 or above on this scale are accepted as appropriate for script development. Examples of acceptable stressful situations include breakup with significant other, a verbal argument with a significant other or family member or unemployment-related stress, such as being fired or laid off from work.</description>
