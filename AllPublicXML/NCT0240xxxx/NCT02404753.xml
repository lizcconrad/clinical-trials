  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic distal D2
      gastrectomy (LDG) compared with open surgery (ODG) for resectable gastric cancer, to
      determine whether LDG can be a test arm for a future Phase III trial to evaluate the
      non-inferiority of overall survival compared with ODG in patients who receive neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      The study is an open-label, controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trial. The protocol has
      been approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Cancer Hospital.

      The primary endpoint is the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The secondary
      endpoints are the overall survival, surgical morbidity and mortality.

    <measure>Surgical morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical morbidity is defined as the events which occurs with-in postoperative 30 days, extension of hospitalization and re-hospitalization. It is necessary to evaluate the complication and if it occurs during the hospitalization, it is required to record complication name, date of on-set (postoperatively), grade on Clavien-Dindo Classification and treatment for complication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as the death within postoperative 30 days regardless of postoperative reason. If the patient is transferred to other medication institutes with impossible condition for recovery before death, it is regarded as death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative recovery index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperatively, the investigator evaluates the patient's recovery condition once a day. Evaluation items for patient's recovery condition: the pain score, the leaving bed time, postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery time and hospital stay.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>In pre-therapy &lt;7 days, pre-operative &lt;7 days, and post-operative at 12 months after surgery, both the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) C30 and STO22 are analyzed with quality of life by following methods. In case of EORTC-C30, the analysis is undergone by classifying into 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea, and vomiting), 1 global health status and 6 single items.</description>
