      This is a single center, open, dose-escalation clinical trial. According to the Chinese
      guidelines for vaccine clinical trial, the sample size of a phase 1 clinical trial should be
      at least 20. In this study, a total of 60 participants will be included.30 participants will
      be firstly recruited and assigned to receive the low dose Ad5-EBOV. After the safety of the
      low dose vaccination is confirmed, another 30 participants will be recruited and assigned to
      receive the high dose Ad5-EBOV.

      The whole follow-up period for each participant will be 28 days.
