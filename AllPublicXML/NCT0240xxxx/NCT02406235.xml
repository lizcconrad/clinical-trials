      The overall objective of this study is to assess turnaround time, pre-BRCA test onco-genetic
      counselling quality and satisfaction with a new onco-genetic BRCA testing model.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a prospective observational study of patients diagnosed with epithelial
      ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer prior to, or at enrolment in this study. The
      study is descriptive in nature and does not attempt to test any specific a priori hypotheses.

      Clinical teams (physicians and nurses) will be trained to discuss BRCA testing with ovarian
      cancer patients who meet study criteria and consent to participate in the study. Patients
      will be recruited from participating sites in North America and Europe. Patients selected per
      the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented for participation in the study.
      Patients will be recruited during an estimated 12 month period and participating patients
      will be followed from enrollment in the study until provision of BRCA test results, final
      genetics counselling, and completion of satisfaction survey or death. A case report form will
      be developed to collect information on the primary variable of interest (i.e., turnaround
      time), patient and disease characteristics, medical history, treatment patterns and outcome
      of the BRCA test. In addition, a survey will be developed to evaluate patient's assessment of
      pre- BRCA onco-genetic counseling quality and satisfaction with onco-genetic testing process.

      Finally, surveys will be developed to evaluate oncologist (or oncology nurse) and genetic
      counselor's assessment of the processes associated with the onco-genetic testing pathway.

    <description>The primary objectives include a) assessing turnaround time with the new BRCA (Breast Cancer)-testing pathway; b) patient's assessment of pre-BRCA test onco-genetic counselling quality and satisfaction with the onco-genetic BRCA testing pathway; c) oncologists, and genetic counsellor's assessment of onco-genetic BRCA testing process. The study will be limited to patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.</description>
