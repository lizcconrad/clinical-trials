      An Open-Label Study to Characterize the Incidence and Severity of Diarrhea in Patients with

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 2 study that will investigate the incidence of diarrhea in HER2+
      breast cancer patients receiving neratinib with intensive loperamide diarrhea prophylaxis,
      alone and in combination with an anti-inflammatory treatment or a bile acid sequestrant
      treatment, who have previously undergone a course of trastuzumab therapy in the adjuvant
      setting.

      Patients will receive:

        -  Neratinib 240 mg orally once daily for thirteen (13) 28-day cycles.

        -  Loperamide daily for two (2) 28-day cycles and then as needed.

        -  Starting with Amendment 3, an anti-inflammatory treatment for 1 cycle and loperamide to
           be administered daily for two (2) 28-day cycles and then as needed, thereafter;

        -  Starting with Amendment 4, colestipol for 1 cycle and loperamide to be administered 1
           cycle and then as needed, thereafter;

        -  Starting with Amendment 5, colestipol for 1 cycle and loperamide to be administered on
           an as-needed basis only.

         10. Significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhea as a major symptom (eg,
             Crohn's disease, malabsorption, or Grade ≥2 National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common

         13. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational products; known
             hypersensitivity to salicylates; known hypersensitivity to aspartame-containing
