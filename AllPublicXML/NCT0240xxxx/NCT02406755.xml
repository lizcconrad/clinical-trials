  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial about self-care mediated by the senses in female health
      professionals and their influence on stress, self-esteem, mood states, life satisfaction and
      levels of salivary cortisol.

    <textblock>
      The work environment of health professionals is commonly considered stressful, given that
      they need to deal with difficult situations that include pain, risk of death, the decisions
      that need to be fast and accurate, and conflicts generated in interpersonal relationships.
      There is an ongoing discussion that the investigators need to care for those who care,
      however, there are few interventions studied and validated to effectively reduce the stress
      of these professionals that resonate in states of well-being. There is little room for
      discussion of this topic during the workday, as well as to learn techniques and measures for
      effective stress management. This study aims to explore the relationship between well-being,
      self-esteem and stress of women health professionals, and compare three self-care
      interventions mediated by the senses.
