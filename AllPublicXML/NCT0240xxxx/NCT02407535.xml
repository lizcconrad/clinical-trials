  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to assess the diagnostic performance of intraoperative,
      ultrasonographic assessment of the surgical extracted uterus for determining myometrial
      invasion's depth in comparison to preoperative ultrasound, intraoperative gross inspection
      and final pathological report (gold standard). The investigators hope that intraoperative
      gross inspection of the extracted uterus might offer an additional intraoperative tool for
      assessing the need for pelvic lymphadenectomy in early stage of endometrial cancer at least
      as good as pathological exam.
