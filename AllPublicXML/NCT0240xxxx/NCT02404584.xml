  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the percentage of patients with a plasma
      concentration of sunitinib remaining at equilibrium ([Suni]REq) greater than 100 ng / ml
      (effective concentration according to the current literature).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To describe the distribution of constitutional genetic determinants related to sunitinib
           pharmacokinetics, and to study their correlation with

             -  the [Suni]REq,

             -  the advent of toxicity,

             -  the tumor response.

        -  To describe the variation in the [Suni]REq and the plasma concentration of the active
           entity remaining at equilibrium ([ActEnt]REq) at:

             -  the interindividual level,

             -  overtime, between chemotherapy cycles.

        -  To describe the variation in the ratio of the plasma concentration of the metabolite
           remaining at equilibrium ([Metab]REq) to the [Suni]REq at:

             -  the interindividual level,

             -  overtime, between chemotherapy cycles.

        -  To explore potential correlations between the [Suni]REq and

             -  toxicity,

             -  tumor response.

        -  To explore potential correlations between the [ActEnt]REq and

             -  toxicity,

             -  tumor response.

        -  To explore potential correlations between the ratio [Metab]REq / [Suni]REq and

             -  toxicity,

             -  tumor response.
