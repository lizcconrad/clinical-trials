  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of oral azilsartan once daily for 32
      weeks on coronary artery plaque in essential hypertensive patients with stable angina and
      dyslipidemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open-label design without a control group was selected because this clinical study
      primarily aims to explore the effects of azilsartan on coronary artery plaques.

      This study targeting patients with coronary artery plaque has been designed to enroll
      hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia. Also in light of the invasive nature of the major
      assessment procedures (i.e., IB-IVUS, OCT), this study will only enroll patients with stable
      angina planned to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement, among
      patients with coronary artery plaque.

      The starting dose of azilsartan has been set to 20 mg on the basis of the usual clinical dose
      of the drug in patients with essential hypertension, and dose increase of azilsartan will be
      permitted only when the target blood pressure has not been achieved.

      The duration of treatment has been set to 32 weeks in line with clinical practice, in which
      coronary angiography is typically performed after a 32-week follow-up period following PCI
      with stent placement.
