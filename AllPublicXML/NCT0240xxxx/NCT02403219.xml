    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, comparative, contralateral eye study. Patients older than 18 years who
      have had treatment with topical lubricants for at least 1 month and persist with symptoms of
      dry eye and corneal staining with fluorescein were included. Patients with dry eye
      attributable to abnormalities of the eyelids, nasolacrimal obstruction and active corneal
      infection, as well as patients with severe dry eye were excluded from the study. One eye
      randomly received a subcutaneous injection of botulinum toxin in the medial part of the lower
      eyelid, and the other eye received a similar procedure with placebo. The subjective
      evaluation was achieved with a questionnaire assessing symptoms of dry eye and
      conjunctivitis, quality of vision and ocular comfort level each eye separately. The objective
      evaluation included the measurement of the tear film break up time, Schirmer's test and with
      a modification of the Oxford grading scheme for corneal and conjunctival staining.
