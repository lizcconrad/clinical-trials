  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different protocols to treat gum diseases. One relevant differential aspect is
      related to time. There are protocols that usually takes one to two months to be completed
      while other are completed within 24 hours. Although both protocols seem to provide clinically
      similar improvements, there are some positive aspects related to the short-term one. Among
      them lower number of clinical sessions, easier schedule and costs advantages. However, there
      are many other relevant aspects that can be helpful for patients and clinicians decisions
      regarding type of treatment.

      This study evaluates if and how clinically effective protocols used to treat periodontitis
      affect quality of life related to individual's oral statuses. In addition, the experiences of
      fear, anxiety and pain before and after these specific protocols are monitored.

      Most randomized controlled clinical trials regarding the effects of non-surgical periodontal
      treatment have focused on objective parameters. Their effects on patient-centered variables
      have been received very little attention. After determining clinical therapeutic efficacy,
      this study compared over 6 months the effects of two different forms of non-surgical
      periodontal therapy - scaling and root planing per quadrant (SRP) and one-stage full-mouth
      disinfection (FMD) - on scores of quality of life, fear, anxiety and pain of moderate chronic
      periodontitis. Initially, the sample size was calculated considering protocols' clinical
      efficacy. Specifically for the present study it was verified if the initial sample size would
      be enough for analysis of the subjective variables.

      Patients registered in dental care centers from University of Taubate, Taubate - Sao Paulo,
      Brazil and Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte - Minas Gerais, Brazil were
      informed about the objectives and methods of the study, being consecutively included in the
      study only after signing an informed consent form. Selected participants were randomly
      allocated to one of the treatment groups by a closed envelope system. According to the
      designated group, participants receive either conventional quadrant scaling in four weekly
      sections or full-mouth scaling within 24 hours.

      Two experienced trained periodontists carried out debridement procedures of both protocols
      with manual Gracey and McCall curettes and Hirschfield files.

      Specific validated instruments were used to evaluate subjective variables. Oral Impacts on
      Daily Performance (OIDP) and Oral Health and Quality of Life (OHQoL-UK) measured quality of
      life while Dental Fear Survey (DFS), Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) questionnaires and, Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS) measured experienced fear, anxiety and pain, respectively.
