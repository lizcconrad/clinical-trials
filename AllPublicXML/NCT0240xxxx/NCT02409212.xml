  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study design: The study is a two arm randomised controlled trial (randomisation ratio 1:1)
      comparing an aerobic exercise training intervention to usual care plus exercise advice. The
      primary outcome is the feasibility of the intervention as novel primary therapy in men with
      localised prostate cancer.

    <description>The rate of recruitment will be measured by comparing the number of patients screended to the number of patients recruited. This will allow us to asses if a future full-scale trial is feasible.</description>
