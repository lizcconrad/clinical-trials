  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive bleeding after dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) requiring interventions is common,
      occurring in approximately 30% of cases at one large abortion-providing clinic. Uterotonic
      prophylaxis at the time of D&amp;E, particularly with methylergonovine maleate (MM), is a common
      practice among D&amp;E providers despite nearly no evidence for its efficacy. Finding ways to
      decrease excessive bleeding after D&amp;E has the potential both to improve patient safety and to
      reduce costs of provider-initiated interventions. The investigators propose a randomized,
      controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of MM prophylaxis versus placebo in decreasing
      excessive bleeding measured by a composite outcome among women undergoing D&amp;E at 20 to 24
      weeks.
