      The purpose of this study is to determine whether tDCS is effective as an add-on treatment in
      SSRI-resistant patients with obsessive and compulsive disorder

      Total number of scheduled patients to be recruited: 46 We used the effect size of the study
      of Ruffini and colleagues (2009) in which rTMS was used to target the left orbito frontal
      cortex to calculate the number of patients to be recruited. With a risk alpha of 5%, a power
      of 80%, the number of patients to be included was 46 with an anticipated rate of 10% of lost
      to follow-up patients. (calculation was made on the
      http://www.spc.univ-lyon1.fr/mfcalc/NSN/assistant.htm)

      Statistical analysis to address the primary and secondary objectives:

      Chi squared test will be applied for quantitative data.

    <description>patients will received 2 sessions per day for 5 consecutive days. Each session will last 20 minutes. The tDCS device will deliver a direct current of 2mA during 20 minutes. Cathode will be localized in front of the left orbito-frontal on the FP3 point according to the EEG international reference. Anode will be localized in front of the right cerebellum 3 cm below the inion and 1 cm right from the midline</description>
