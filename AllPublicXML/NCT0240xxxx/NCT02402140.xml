      Primary end-point

      The primary end-point was the influence of pharmaceutical intervention in tacrolimus
      intra-subject variability during the first 3 months after kidney transplant. Coefficients of
      variation were calculated from the average of dose-corrected tacrolimus blood
      concentration(CV= Standard Deviation (SD) x 100/mean) of study visits day 10, 14, 21, 30, 60
      and 90 post kidney transplant.

      Secondary end-points

        1. Secondary outcomes included evaluate percentage of patients who achieved target levels
           of tacrolimus in day study visits 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 60 e 90 days after kidney
           transplant;

        2. Tacrolimus bioavailability profile during the period of 3 months,characterized by mean
           and standard deviation (SD) of dose corrected tacrolimus blood concentration(ng/ml/mg);

        3. Assess patient adherence through validated questionnaire &quot;Portuguese version of Basel
           Scale Adherence Rating Immunosuppressive Drugs (BAASIS) scale&quot;. It consists of a
           four-item questionnaire measuring nonadherence to immunosuppressives over the past four
           weeks. This questionnaire assesses omission of single doses or successive doses, timing
           deviations &gt;2h and dose reductions. Responses are given on a six-point scale: never,
           once per month, every second week, every week, more than once per week and every day.
           Patients that answer different from &quot;never&quot; in any of the four questions are considered
           as nonadherent;

        4. We evaluated renal function eGFR by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD);

        5. We evaluated Incidence of Infections;

        6. We evaluated Treated acute rejection episodes;

        7. We evaluated Death cases;

        8. We evaluated Graft loss cases;

        9. We evaluated Discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatment;

       10. We evaluated Hospital readmissions.

      Study Design

      This was a single-center, prospective, randomized and controlled study to evaluate the
      influence of pharmaceutical intervention in tacrolimus intra-subject variability during the
      first 3 months after transplantation. The authors designed the protocol, acquired and
      maintained the data, and conducted the statistical analysis. The protocol was approved by an
      independent ethics committee. All subjects signed a written informed consent before
      enrollment and the study was conducted according to good clinical practices and declaration
      of Helsinki. This study was conducted at Hospital do Rim between February 2014 and December
      2014, 128 randomized and were followed for 3 months after transplantation.

      Population

      Inclusion criteria were patients who underwent renal transplantation aged ≥18 years old, who
      signed the informed consent, who underwent follow-up post transplant clinic at the Hospital
      do Rim for 3 months, receiving immunosuppressive drugs tacrolimus, prednisone and sodium
      mycophenolate or tacrolimus, azathioprine, and prednisone. Exclusion criteria were patients
      who underwent second kidney transplant, which did not follow the Hospital do Rim after
      transplant and who were participating in some other study with pharmaceutical intervention.

      Randomization The randomization plan was carried out in blocks and stratified by
      immunosuppressive drugs tacrolimus, prednisone and mycophenolate sodium or tacrolimus,
      prednisone and azathioprine.

      Opaque envelopes were made from a table of random numbers and they were open on the day of
      randomization to determine the group to which each patient was allocated group 1 with
      pharmaceutical intervention or group 2 without pharmaceutical intervention.

    <description>Patients allocated to group 1, with pharmaceutical intervention, received instructions on the proper use of immunosuppressants as doses, frequency, importance, schedules on the following days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 90 after kidney transplant. Teaching materials were designed to assist in the pharmaceutical guidelines that understood the importance of immunosuppressive drugs, the risk of rejection, the schedules and the most appropriate way for the administration. In addition to these guidelines, pharmacists helped patients in filling out the patient diary. This diary contains all the medications that the patient administers and encourages them to write down daily doses in order to remind them. This was a standardized pharmacist intervention.</description>
