  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apnea is a common discharge-delaying diagnosis in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit. While it
      is relatively more common in extremely premature infants, it also occurs frequently in late
      preterm and even full term infants. Since the majority of all births include late preterm
      infants and full term infants, the absolute number of late preterm and full term infants with
      apnea remains significant. Evidence-based guidelines for the management of apnea in such
      infants do not exist. Current management falls into two distinct but very different
      categories. This study will compare these two distinct management strategies.

      Our study will be a prospective, randomized pilot trial to provide data regarding (a)
      feasibility for recruitment and study protocols and (b) provide preliminary data regarding
      efficacy of both treatment arms.

      Our primary objective will be to test the hypothesis that early discharge and outpatient
      monitoring of late preterm and term infants with apnea of prematurity results in decreased
      length of hospital stay, is safe, and results in improved patient satisfaction, as assessed
      by the PedsQL questionnaire and Impact on Family Scale.

      Our study population will include infants who meet the following criteria: (1) Born at
      greater than or equal to 34 0/7 weeks gestation; (2) Are assigned a diagnosis of apnea,
      bradycardia, and/or oxygen desaturations by the primary clinical team; (3) Have met all other
      discharge criteria (i.e. feeding maturity, temperature regulation, etc.) so that
      apnea/bradycardia/desaturation remains the final discharge issue for at least 7 days.

      Infants enrolled in this research study will be randomized to in hospital observation versus
      early discharge home with caffeine and a home monitor. Neither strategy is experimental as
      both are currently utilized by neonatologists locally and nationally. A direct comparison of
      the two treatments, however, has never been undertaken in a study. If an infant is assigned
      to the in hospital group, they will remain in the hospital until an apnea free period of at
      least 5 consecutive days has been established. Outpatient follow up will occur per unit
      standard and typically includes a nursing visit and a doctor visit within 2-3 days of
      discharge. Caregivers will be asked to complete 3 brief questionnaires at enrollment, at 1
      month after hospital discharge, and at 6 months of age. Each questionnaire will ask about
      topics such as satisfaction with hospital stay, quality of life, and numbers of acute care
      visits and/or rehospitalizations. Alternatively, if an infant is assigned to the early
      discharge group, caffeine will be given to the infant and if after a 3 day period no further
      apnea is noted the infant will be discharged home with continued daily caffeine therapy by
      mouth as well as a home monitor. Caffeine is a very commonly used drug in neonates and has an
      excellent safety profile. Side effects are minimal and may infrequently consist of
      gastroesophageal reflux. All caregivers will receive training on the use of a home monitor.
      Initial outpatient follow up will occur per unit standard and typically includes a nursing
      visit and a doctor visit within 2-3 days of discharge. Additionally, caregivers will be
      contacted via telephone within 2 days to answer any questions or address any concerns
      pertaining to apneic events, home monitor use, or caffeine therapy. Follow up in the
      pulmonary clinic will be arranged at 42-43 weeks gestational age at which time caregivers
      will be taught to determine the baseline frequency of monitor alarms on caffeine. At 43 weeks
      corrected gestational age, caregivers will be instructed to discontinue caffeine therapy and
      advised to contact the pulmonary clinic should alarm frequency increase. An outpatient
      recorded oximetry study will be arranged at least 1 week after discontinuation of caffeine
      therapy. Home pulse oximetry monitoring will be discontinued if no significant events are
      recorded. Caregivers will be asked to complete 3 brief questionnaires at enrollment, at 1
      month after discontinuation of the home monitor, and at 6 months of age. Each questionnaire
      will ask about topics such as satisfaction with hospital stay, quality of life, and numbers
      monitor alarms, acute care visits and/or rehospitalizations.

      1. Study Design This is a prospective, randomized study. Our primary objective will be to
           test the hypothesis that early discharge and outpatient monitoring of late preterm to
           term infants with apnea of prematurity results in decreased length of hospital stay, is
           safe and cost effective, and results in improved patient satisfaction, as assessed by
           the PedsQL questionnaire and Impact on Family Scale.

        2. Patient Selection and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

        3. Description of Study Treatments or Exposures/Predictors The investigators will identify
           all qualified infants who meet eligibility criteria for enrollment, and will obtain
           informed consent at that time. Infants will not be randomized until their apnea,
           bradycardia, and/or oxygen desaturation has been the sole remaining discharge criteria
           for at least 7 days. Prior to randomization, but after the receipt of written informed
           consent, the investigators will confirm that the primary clinical team has determined
           that there are no alternate etiologies for the apnea/bradycardia/desaturation events,
           based on diagnostic testing or clinical judgment.

           Randomization will be stratified according to gestational age at birth to include two
           broad categories as follows: 1) late preterm infants who are born between 34 0/7 and 36
           6/7 weeks gestation (late preterm infants) and 2) term infants who are born at or
           greater than 37 0/7 weeks gestation. Our aim will be to recruit at least 5 infants in
           each treatment arm for both late preterm and full term infants.

           Arm A will include continued inpatient monitoring of apnea, bradycardia, and/or
           desaturation until an event free period of time (5 days per the current standard of care
           at each participating institution) has been established and deemed appropriate for
           discharge home per the discretion of the responsible provider. The protocol described in
           Arm A is currently utilized as a standard of care for many infants locally and
           nationally and is the first management option utilized at all participating
           institutions. Arm B will include the initiation of caffeine treatment once randomization
           has been established. Per current dosing guideline, patients will receive a one-time
           loading dose of 20 milligrams per kilogram on day 1 with a daily maintenance dose
           thereafter of 10 milligrams per kilogram. Monitoring of caffeine drug levels will not be
           included in our protocol as the safety of caffeine treatment in neonates without
           laboratory monitoring has been well established. After receiving the loading dose of
           caffeine, infants will receive continued inpatient monitoring of
           apnea/bradycardia/desaturation until an event free period of time (3 days per the
           current standard of care at each participating institution) has been established and
           deemed appropriate for discharge home per the discretion of the responsible provider.
           Infants discharged home on caffeine therapy will receive instructions regarding use of a
           home monitor, with alarms set to alarm for heart rate &lt;80 or &gt; 200 beats per minute, or
           for oxygen saturation level &lt; 90%. The protocol described in Arm B is currently utilized
           as a standard of care for many infants locally and nationally as a secondary option
           after observation alone has resulted in a prolonged inpatient stay due to persistent
           apnea with all other discharge criteria having been met. In a recent retrospective
           analysis of home monitor use, the investigators found that 1 in 20 infants with apnea of
           prematurity were discharge home with a monitor.

           Following discharge home, infants in Arm B will be contacted via telephone within 2 days
           to answer any questions or address any concerns pertaining to apneic events, home pulse
           oximeter use, or caffeine therapy. Follow up in the pulmonary clinic will be arranged at
           42-43 weeks gestational age at which time caregivers will be taught to determine the
           baseline frequency of monitor alarms on caffeine. At 43 weeks corrected gestational age,
           caregivers will be instructed to discontinue caffeine therapy and advised to contact the
           pulmonary clinic should alarm frequency increase. An outpatient recorded oximetry study
           will be arranged at least 1 week after discontinuation of caffeine therapy. Home pulse
           oximetry monitoring will be discontinued if no significant events, as previously
           defined, are recorded.

           Follow up after discharge in both treatment arms will otherwise proceed per unit
           protocol and typically consists of a home visiting nurse within 2-3 days of hospital
           discharge and a primary care provider appointment within 2-3 days of hospital discharge.

        4. Data Collection Methods, Assessments, Interventions and Schedule (what assessments
           performed, how often) For infants in both arms, parents will participate in a structured
           questionnaire at enrollment, and 1 month after hospital discharge for patients in Arm A
           and 1 month after discontinuation of home monitor use for patients in Arm B. The
           investigators will also contact families at 6 months of age to determine
           rehospitalization rates, and frequency of emergency department visits related to
           respiratory issues.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Our study population will include infants who meet the following criteria: (1) Born at
        greater than or equal to 34 0/7 weeks gestation; (2) Are assigned a diagnosis of apnea,
        bradycardia, and/or oxygen desaturations by the primary clinical team; (3) Have met all
        other discharge criteria (i.e. feeding maturity, temperature regulation, etc.) so that
        apnea/bradycardia/desaturation remains the final discharge issue.

        As our intent will be to study infants for whom hospital stay is prolonged as a result of
        presumed apnea of prematurity, exclusion criteria will include: (1) comorbidities
        associated with an increased risk of apnea, including neurologic abnormalities such as
        congenital CNS malformations, seizures, or intracranial bleeds, anatomic abnormalities of
        the airway, significant congenital heart disease, residual lung disease requiring
        respiratory support, infectious disease including sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis,
        chromosomal abnormalities, and drug withdrawal; (2) prolonged hospitalization for an
        indication other than apnea, bradycardia and/or oxygen desaturation such as feeding
        immaturity, temperature instability, or phototherapy; (3) transfer to an outside hospital;
        (4) provider concern with caregiver ability to safely operate and comply with home monitor
        use.
