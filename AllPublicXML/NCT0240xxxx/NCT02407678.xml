  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of the efficacy (with respect to preservation of visual function and retinal
      structure) and safety of a single subretinal injection of AAV2.REP1 in participants with a
      confirmed diagnosis of choroideremia, as evaluated by various functional and anatomical
      outcomes measured over a number of time points up to 24 months post-treatment.

    <masking_description>The study is designated as Open Label with no masking. However, in order to minimise bias evaluation of the treated eye and untreated fellow eye (control eye), the ophthalmic assessments (visual acuity, microperimetry, fundus autofluorescence, etc.) will be conducted by an appropriately qualified masked observer once the participant's treated eye has had time to heal after the surgical procedure and has regained its normal appearance and function.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Candidate is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study.

          2. Male aged 18 years or above.

          3. Genetic or molecular confirmed diagnosis of choroideremia (REP1 protein deficiency).

          4. Active disease visible clinically within the macula region.

          5. Best corrected visual acuity better than or equal to 6/60 (20/200; Decimal 0.1; LogMAR
             1.0) in the study eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any female, or a male aged below 18 years.

          2. An additional cause for sight loss (e.g. amblyopia) in the eye to be treated.

          3. Any other significant ocular and non-ocular disease or disorder which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may put the participants at risk because of participation in the
             study.

          4. Inability to take systemic prednisolone for a period of 45 days.

          5. Unwillingness to use barrier contraception methods for a period of three months
             following gene therapy surgery.

          6. Participation in another research study involving an investigational product in the
             preceding 12 weeks.
