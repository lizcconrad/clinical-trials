  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infection of a total knee replacement often imposes changing implants. The change in two
      step is currently considered the gold standard. The change in one step is a much debated
      attitude: strictly contra-indicated for some professionals, but others agree to reserve these
      for favorable suspected cases selected. Several criteria have been proposed in the
      literature: age, condition, duration of infection, known bacterium responsible, not virulent
      and sensitive to antibiotics, no fistula, no significant bone destruction. But these criteria
      are poorly validated, standing over an experience of surgical teams rather than high-level
      scientific studies. Some authors have proposed to achieve change in one step systematically.
      The results of these cohorts on healing the infection does not seem very different from the
      changes in two steps. But it is most often single-center series, uncontrolled, with small
      numbers.
