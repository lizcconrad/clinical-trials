  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system
      (CNS), which ultimately leads to myelin damage and axonal loss. The disease is complex and
      multifactorial, but the key pathogenic event appears to be an uncontrolled response of
      components of the immune system (T and B lymphocytes) to myelin proteins. No definitive
      treatment is available for MS, however immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant drugs act as
      disease-modifying agents (DMDs).

      Unfortunately, the current treatments demonstrate partial efficacy in targeting the
      deleterious immune reactions. According to the present knowledge of the pathophysiology of
      MS, an ideal therapeutic strategy would be to modulate or suppress the aggressive immune
      process, to protect axons and neurons from degeneration, and to enhance repair and facilitate
      remyelination.

      A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown
      remarkable ability to modulate the immune response. This study will evaluate the safety of
      injecting MSCs in people with MS.

      MSCs have the remarkable ability to modulate the immune response mainly by inhibiting
      proliferation of T cells and to protect injured tissues through paracrine mechanisms. There
      is an urgent need to evaluate the real efficacy of MSC transplantation, and its possible
      position in the current therapeutic armamentarium. An international panel of MS neurology and
      stem cell experts, as well as immunologists formed an &quot;International Mesenchymal Stem Cells
      Transplantation&quot; (MSCT) Study Group with the aim to derive a consensus on what cells should
      be used for transplantation and develop a treatment protocol and an experimental program that
      will eventually attest to the efficacy of MSC transplantation and understand the mechanism
      that underlie the benefit. 12 patients with MS will be treated with IV injections of
      autologous isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells. Clinical and objective evaluations
      will be performed at baseline and during 12 months follow-up.
