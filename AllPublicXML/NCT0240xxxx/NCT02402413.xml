    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders occurring in
      women of reproductive age. PCOS is considered a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction that is
      characterized by the heterogeneous clinical manifestation of infrequent or absent menstrual
      cycles, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology.

      An important ultrasound parameter is the ratio stroma/ovary, the ratio of the volume,
      evaluated in two-dimensional ultrasound, of the stroma, that secrete androgen, and the ovary.
      It has been shown that when this ratio is higher than a third the levels of circulating
      androgens and high. Aim of the present study is to assess whether this ratio, determined with
      three-dimensional ultrasound, is correlated to the increase of androgens.
