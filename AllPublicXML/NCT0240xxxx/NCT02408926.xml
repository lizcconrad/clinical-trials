  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young infants are most vulnerable to severe disease and even death when infected with
      Bordetella pertussis. The current vaccines and vaccination programs do not guarantee
      protection of neonates from this disease. Maternal acquired pertussis-specific antibodies
      show low concentrations with short persistence in newborns creating a susceptibility gap for
      infection between birth and the first vaccinations. A possible strategy to protect infants
      from birth is pertussis vaccination during pregnancy, which will increase the amount of
      passively transferred maternal antibodies.

      However, little is known regarding the effect of high titers of maternal antibodies on the
      infants immune responses to different pertussis vaccines (whole cell versus acellular).
      Humoral immune responses will be assessed in infants receiving whole cell versus infants
      receiving acellular pertussis vaccines. Functionality of the antibodies will also be
      analyzed.
