  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, prospective, non-inferiority, double blind
      intervention trial to evaluate the children growth (at 6, 9 and 12 months) using a rice
      hydrolysed protein formula compared to an extensively cow's milk protein hydrolysed formula
      for the management of Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the rice protein hydrolysed based
      formula manufactured by Ordesa ensures proper growth and as secondary outcomes, that the
      formula is devoid of any risk of arsenic or other potential contaminants toxicity and its
      effect on the duration of CMA (Cow Milk Allergy) from cow's milk protein allergy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects up to 10 months old with clinical history of a reaction to cow's milk protein
             and/or confirmed diagnosis (up to grade II anaphylaxis) of allergy to cow's milk
             protein by one of the following criteria, within two months prior to the baseline
             visit are eligible to enter the study:

               -  Negative or positive skin prick tests ( fresh milk, rice, casein hydrolysates)

               -  Negative or positive specific IgE for cow's milk proteins (alphalactalbumine,
                  betalactoglobuline, caseine and cow's milk)

               -  Negative or positive Milk Atopy Patch Test

               -  Positive Double Blind Placebo Control Food Challenge (DBPCFC) with cow milk

          -  Gestational Age 37-42 weeks inclusive

          -  Apgar SCORE &gt;7 at 5 minutes

          -  Singleton birth

          -  Birth weight ≥2.500 g

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous signs of allergy to any extensively hydrolysed formula

          -  Confirmed history of acute severe, potentially life threatening reaction after
             isolated accidental ingestion of cow's milk e.g. history of anaphylactic reaction,
             graded more or equal to grade III, as this could not be compatible with an allocation
             to the eHF group

          -  Daily formula intake &lt; 100 ml

          -  Major congenital malformations or neonatal diseases

          -  Severe concurrent or chronic diseases

          -  Intrauterine growth retardation

          -  Neonatal infections ( e.g. CMV, HIV)

          -  Simultaneous participation in other clinical trials

          -  Parents not signing written informed consent

          -  Unable to adhere to protocol requirements or study visits due to non compliance of
             parents or caregivers.

          -  Liver, kidney, haematological abnormalities as judged clinically by investigators at
             baseline.
