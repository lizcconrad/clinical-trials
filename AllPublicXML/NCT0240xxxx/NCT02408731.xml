      Shock is a condition of reduced tissue perfusion, resulting in the inadequate delivery of
      oxygen and nutrients that are necessary for cellular function. The current resuscitative
      agents can extend patient's life to a limited extent. Centhaquin (PMZ-2010) in very low doses
      reduced blood lactate levels, improved blood pressure, cardiac output, survival and proved to
      be a highly effective resuscitative agent. The investigators are conducting a phase I
      clinical study in humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of centhaquin citrate in normal healthy volunteers.

      Shock is a condition of reduced tissue perfusion, resulting in the inadequate delivery of
      oxygen and nutrients that are necessary for cellular function. Common causes of shock are
      hypovolemia (excessive blood or fluid loss), sepsis, cardiac failure, dengue and
      neuroendocrine dysfunction. The current resuscitative measures include administration of
      crystalloid solutions (e.g., 0.9% saline, Ringer's lactate, or hypertonic saline) or colloid
      solutions (e.g., hydroxyethyl starch, albumin, or dextrans). These agents can extend
      patient's life to a limited extent. Centhaquin (PMZ-2010) in very low doses reduced blood
      lactate levels, improved blood pressure, cardiac output, survival and proved to be a highly
      effective resuscitative agent. The investigators are conducting a phase I clinical study in
      humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      centhaquin citrate in normal healthy volunteers. Successful completion of phase I studies
      will lead to efficacy studies in patients with hypovolemic shock.
