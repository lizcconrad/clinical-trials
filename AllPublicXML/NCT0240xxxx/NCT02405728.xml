    <textblock>
      The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) represents a major advance for
      hematological patients, enabling the effective delivery of chemotherapy and/or blood products
      particularly for prolonged infusions or in situation of difficult venous access. In modern
      medical practice their use has increased rapidly for several reasons, including ease of
      insertion, many uses (e.g., drug administration and venous access), perceived safety, and
      cost-effectiveness compared with centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs).

      The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) represents a major advance for
      hematological patients, enabling the effective delivery of chemotherapy and/or blood products
      particularly for prolonged infusions or in situation of difficult venous access. In modern
      medical practice their use has increased rapidly for several reasons, including ease of
      insertion, many uses (e.g., drug administration and venous access), perceived safety, and
      costeffectiveness compared with centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs). Despite these
      benefits, PICCs are associated with deep vein thrombosis of the arm and pulmonary embolism.
      These complications, which are often called venous thromboembolism, are important because
      they not only complicate and interrupt treatment, but also increase cost, morbidity and
      mortality. Despite this effect, the burden and risk of PICC-related venous thromboembolism is
      uncertain and clinicians have scarce evidence on which to base choice of vascular access.
      Evidence to choose one vascular access over the other is lacking in literature, in particular
      for patients affected by haematological malignancies, in which chemotherapy is more likely to
      cause myelosuppression, with a major risk of bloodstream infections. Furthermore, the precise
      incidence and the risk of PICC-related venous thromboembolism relative to that of other CICCs
      is unknown. An understanding of this risk in the context of growing PICC use is an important
      cost and patients safety questions. Up to now, no systematic review has been done to
      investigate these questions.
