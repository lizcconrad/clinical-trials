      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy (sustained virological response 12 weeks after end-of-treatment
      [SVR12]) of 12-week course of an interferon-free regimen combining sofosbuvir and
      weight-dosed ribavirin (genotype 2), or sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (genotype 1 or 4) in
      treatment-naïve patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 2 or 4 in West and Central Africa

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To estimate the study treatment SVR24 rate

        2. To evaluate the clinical and biological tolerance of study treatment

        3. To describe HCV kinetics under HCV treatment, and identify associated factors

        4. To describe the evolution of HIV disease under HCV treatment in HVC-HIV co-infected
           patients

        5. To describe the changes of liver fibrosis based on non-invasive tests between treatment
           initiation, week 24, and week 36 after treatment, and estimate its association with
           SVR12 or SVR24

        6. To identify factors associated with SVR12 and SVR24 (including HIV status)

        7. To evaluate the performance of a nanodevice for rapid diagnosis of HCV viral load and
           genotypying and for assessing response to treatment (SVR12 and SVR24)

        8. Facilitate the detection and treatment of those infected with HCV by supporting national
           initiatives for access to strategies without interferon

        9. To set up a HCV clinical research network across French and English-speaking African
           countries, able to run large-scale comparative randomized clinical trials in a near
           future.

      Study design Multicenter, phase IIb, non randomized, open-label trial involving 3 groups of
      HCV-mono infected or HCV-HIV co-infected patients: group G1 (patients infected with HCV
      genotype 1), group G2 (patients infected with HCV genotype 2), and group G4 (patients
      infected with HCV genotype 4).

      Number of Subjects A sample size of 40 patients per group will allow to demonstrate that the
      SVR12 is &gt;70% (&quot;expected efficacy&quot; in difficult-to-treat patients, according to SPARE interim
      results), with the lower bound of the confidence interval being &gt;50% (&quot;unacceptable&quot;
      efficacy). The overall sample size is 3x40=120 patients.

      Participating Countries 3 countries from West Africa (Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire) and Central
      Africa (Cameroon) Number of Sites 5 clinical sites:

        -  Côte d'Ivoire: Hepatology Departementat the Yopougon University Teaching Hospital, ,
           Abidjan; and Blood Donors clinic (CMSDS) at the National Blood Bank (CNTS), Abidjan

        -  Senegal: CRCF (Centre Régional de Recherche et de Formation), and Fann University
           Teaching Hospital

        -  Cameroon: Clinique de la Cathédrale

      Duration of Recruitment : 6 months

      Duration of Treatment : 12 weeks

      Duration of follow-up : 36 weeks

      Anticipated Start Date / Anticipated End Date: November 2015 - October 2016

      Target Population /Demographics : Patients &gt;18 years, living with chronic hepatitis C
      genotype 1, 2 or 4, in West and Central Africa. In each genotype group approx. 50% of
      patients will be HCV-HIV co-infected, and 50% of patients will be mono-infected with HCV

      This study will enable us to assess the feasibility, tolerance and efficacy of such a
      strategy in resource-constrained settings with considerable treatment needs.
