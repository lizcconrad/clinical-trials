  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients of suitable fitness with non-metastatic esophageal cancer are treated
      with surgery, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. If treated with radio or chemoradiotherapy,
      a Computerised tomography (CT) scan is performed and is the dataset used for planning
      radiotherapy. Information from the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), performed during routine
      staging, is used to help localize the tumor, as tumors of the esophagus are poorly visualised
      on CT. This information is subjective and dependant on the clinician performing the
      procedure. The tumor is described in relation to common anatomical landmarks. Interpretion of
      this information can lead to over-compensation when attempting to cover the tumor with a
      radiation field, to avoid a &quot;miss&quot;. It is thought that using fiducial markers called
      Visicoils placed in or adjacent to the tumor's top and bottom extent at the time of EUS, will
      lead to better definition of the tumor in the planning process and hence, improvement in
      local tumor control, and reduction in radiotherapy dose to normal tissue.
