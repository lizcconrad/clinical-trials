  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although soldiers must be ready to respond to occupational and war theatre demands at a
      moment's notice, there is an epidemic of overweight and obesity and a need for improved
      fitness and health in the military. Using a cluster randomized clinical trial we propose to
      test the effectiveness of a High-Intensity Functional Training (HIFT) exercise intervention
      to improve the body composition and fitness of active duty military personnel. The
      effectiveness of the HIFT intervention will be compared to usual Army Physical Readiness
      Training. Main outcomes will include changes in body composition and traditional fitness
      measures, a test of combat-preparation, and measures of cardiovascular health risk for both
      groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will examine the effectiveness of a high-intensity functional training (HIFT) exercise
      intervention compared to Army Physical Readiness Training (APRT) and their related dietary
      instructions in improving body composition (percent body fat [%BF], fat mass, lean body mass,
      weight) and domains of Total Force Fitness (TFF; Army Physical Fitness Test [APFT], aerobic
      capacity, power, strength, and combat preparation and readiness) in a 6-month
      cluster-randomized clinical trial (CRCT) with 2 (+/- 1) month follow-up. We also will examine
      the effects of both exercise programs on cardiovascular disease (CVD) health risk (resting
      heart rate, blood pressure). We will conduct assessments at baseline, 6-months, and 2-month
      follow-up (+/- 1 month). We also will assess training time/volume, injuries, adverse events,
      adherence, and participant satisfaction and account for demographic and psychosocial
      variables.

      In our CRCT, we aim to recruit and randomize approximately 200 soldiers (n=10 clusters—staff
      groups/platoons—per condition with at least 10 soldiers nested within each cluster) comparing
      the effectiveness of HIFT versus usual care (APRT) on:

      Specific Aim 1 - changes in body composition including: percent body fat (%BF), fat mass, fat
      free mass, and body weight.

      We hypothesize that soldiers in the HIFT condition will be significantly more likely to
      decrease a. %BF and b. fat mass, and to increase c. fat free mass than those in the APRT
      condition; we expect both groups to d. maintain body weight.

      Specific Aim 2 - changes in fitness (e.g., APFT, power, strength), while accounting for
      actual physical training time in each condition.

      We hypothesize that soldiers in the HIFT condition will have significantly greater
      improvement in their performance on fitness tests when compared to those in APRT, despite
      significantly less total training time. These outcomes will help determine if
      functional-oriented training can result in better fitness and combat preparedness for Army
      personnel.

    <measure>muscular strength</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess participants' strength by determining their one repetition maximum (1RM) using the deadlift. Use of the 1RM test is a safe and reliable method of assessing strength in both trained and untrained subjects. The test procedure begins with a warm-up of 5-10 repetitions at 40% to 60% of the participant's estimated maximum. After a brief rest period, the load is increased to 60% to 80% of the participant's estimated maximum, attempting to complete 3-5 repetitions. At this point a small increase in weight is added to the load and a 1RM lift is attempted. The goal is to determine the participant's 1RM in 3 to 5 trials, allowing for ample rest (3-5 minutes) between each 1RM attempt.</description>

    <measure>injury</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Injuries will be assessed by having participants report any injuries when they complete their daily log. Participants will provide the following information: injury date, body part, injury type, side, when it occurred, description, and the effect of the injury on their physical training status. Reported injuries will be automatically categorized as minor (e.g., bruise, skin tear), medium (e.g., dislocation, sprain/strain) or major (e.g., broken bone, cardiac event). Any medium or major injury will be automatically flagged in the system and both PIs will be immediately notified.</description>

    <description>All participants will complete a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and 6 months. The Dietary Screener Questions for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-10, a validated self-administered monthly FFQ, will be used to monitor participants' dietary intakes. The 26 item food list has been amended to include 10 additional foods to more specifically capture intakes of meats, breads, pastas, eggs, nuts, and vegetables. The FFQ will be modified, scanned and frequencies of food intake calculated.</description>

    <description>CrossFit will be the HIFT intervention framework with training elements, exercise programming, and scheduling set by CrossFit staff. Workouts will be comprised of one or more of three exercise modalities: aerobic/monostructural (e.g., running), gymnastics (e.g., pullups), and weightlifting/resistance training with workouts designed to maximize use of equipment available in deployed environments (e.g.,vehicle tires). All workouts will be individually scaled to each soldier's current level of fitness by a certified trainer. Sessions will be standardized across the 6 months of intervention so that each cluster will receive exactly the same training.</description>

    <description>The APRT program has combat readiness as the primary focus and is mandated for active duty personnel. For this study, APRT sessions have been standardized across the 6 months of the intervention according to FM 7-22 &quot;Army Physical Readiness Training&quot; manual so each cluster will receive the same training program using the Reset Phase. Sessions will consist of preparation, activities and recovery and will include strength, endurance, and mobility exercises that involve on-ground (e.g., running), off-ground (e.g., climbing), and combatives (e.g., striking and grappling) training, with supervision by a certified trainer.</description>

    <description>Constantly varied functional movements performed at a high intensity and incorporating monostructural (aerobic), gymnastics (body weight) and/or weightlifting movements. CrossFit is a good model of HIFT for the military because of its emphasis on general physical preparedness and functional movements and because it is open source and programming is available at no cost (see www.crossfit.com). Sixty-minute HIFT sessions will include a warm-up, workout and cool down. Workouts will average 15 minutes in duration (range = 5-45 minutes) for a total of 50-100 minutes per week.</description>
