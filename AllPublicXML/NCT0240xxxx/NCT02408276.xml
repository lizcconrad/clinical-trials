  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is one of the most common mechanisms leading to the
      development of early cartilage and labral damage in the non-dysplastic hip. Anatomic
      abnormalities of the proximal femur and/or acetabulum result in repetitive injury during
      dynamic hip motion, leading to abnormal regional loading of the femoral head-neck junction
      against the acetabular rim. The resulting damage to the cartilage, labrum, and surrounding
      capsular structures predispose the patient to developing hip pain and early osteoarthritic
      changes. Clinically, patients with FAI are a heterogeneous group, with a wide array of
      presentation from pain to instability that may or may not be related to activity. To date no
      studies have identified specific prognostic indicators associated with successful surgical
      treatment of FAI, leaving surgeons without adequate criteria to determine which patients are
      best suited for arthroscopy. The investigators propose to address this critical knowledge gap
      by identifying the patient characteristics and morphological features of the hip that are
      associated with the optimal clinical outcomes in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy or
      non-operative management for treatment of suspected FAI in order to establish a treatment
      algorithm for FAI patients.

    <description>Patients will be treated surgically (hip arthroscopy) or nonoperatively (physical therapy) and pain medications as needed. For surgical patients, cartilage samples and surgeon operative reports will be a source of research. For both cohorts, MRIs, radiographs and patient reported outcome surveys will be additional research sources.

        35 years of age or younger enrolled in the HSS Hip Preservation Registry prior to September
        30, 2016 with an MRI confirmed diagnosis of FAI

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients 35 years of age or younger enrolled in the HSS Hip Preservation Registry
             prior to September 30, 2016 with an MRI confirmed diagnosis of FAI will be eligible
             for inclusion in this study regardless of surgery status.

          -  Patients who agree to participate must complete a baseline questionnaire consisting
             of: 1) Modified Harris Hip Score (MHHS), an overall measure of hip condition; 2) the
             Hip Outcome Score (HOS), a measure developed specifically for younger active patients
             that measures quality of life and levels of sports and recreation; and 3)
             International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT33), a newly developed hip specific outcome score,
             which measures a number of subscores relating to physical and social functioning with
             hip problems.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over age 35 will be excluded as the focus of this study is early changes that
             may predispose to later degenerative changes.

          -  Patients undergoing revision hip arthroscopy as their first treatment in the Registry
             will not be eligible, as these are patients who have failed initial therapy.

          -  Patients with no complete questionnaires at any time point will be excluded.
