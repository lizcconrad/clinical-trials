    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has detrimental effects on the health and quality of life of
      suffers. Recent literature has shown that females may be particularly susceptible to adverse
      the quality of life effects, and that female obstructive sleep apnea manifests differently
      than male obstructive sleep apnea. A new AutoSetting Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) device
      has been designed specifically to treat female OSA. In this Cohort study, female patients who
      are newly diagnosed with OSA will be asked to complete various questionnaires relating to
      their quality of life. Patients will then use the AutoSet for Her for three months. At the
      completion of the three months the questionnaires will be repeated. Before treatment and
      after treatment quality of life will be compared to determine if treating female specific OSA
      in these patients improves quality of life.
