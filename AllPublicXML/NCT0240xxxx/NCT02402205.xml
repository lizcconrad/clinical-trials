      Adjudicated youth often have traumatic stress responses but rarely receive treatment for
      these problems. This study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate two alternative
      implementation strategies for providing an evidence-based trauma treatment, Trauma-Focused
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), to therapist who treat adjudicated youth in 18
      residential treatment facilities (RTF) in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut: 1)
      web-based TF-CBT implementation strategy (&quot;W&quot;), consisting on only web-based training and
      consultation; versus 2) W plus live TF-CBT implementation strategy, consisting of W plus
      face-to face training and phone consultation with TF-CBT experts (&quot;W+L&quot;).

      Therapists in each of 18 participating RTFprograms that serve adjudicated youth are
      randomized to receive either:

        1. W TF-CBT implementation strategy, provided via the free distance learning resources
           TF-CBTWeb, (www.musc/edu/tfcbt) and TF-CBTConsult (www.musc.edu/tfcbtconsult); or

        2. W+L implementation strategy, provided through W + 2 day TF-CBT training plus one year of
           twice monthly TF-CBT consultation calls with a TF-CBT expert trainer.

      All RTF staff receive one day training in trauma-informed care. All therapists in both
      conditions receive training in screening youth for trauma exposure and symptoms. Data are
      collected regarding primary outcomes of: 1) number of youth therapists in each condition
      screen for trauma symptoms, 2) number of youth consent to TF-CBT treatment; 3) number of
      youth complete TF-CBT, 4) TF-CBT fidelity during treatment. Secondary outcomes include
      1)changes in therapist knowledge and satisfaction regarding TF-CBT treatment and 2) youth
      outcomes including PTSD symptoms, depression and satisfaction with treatment.

    <description>Web implementation (&quot;W&quot;)provides only web-based (distance learning) training and consultation to mental health therapists providing TF-CBT treatment to adjudicated youth in RTF. Therapists access the initial 10 hour training course(www.musc.edu/tfcbt) and follow-up consultation (www.musc.edu/tfcbtconsult) at their own convenience and as needed during the course of the study, with RTF administrators guaranteeing that therapists have time to do so. This implementation strategy is free and more convenient to therapists and administrators as it can be accessed whenever desired.</description>

    <description>Web + Live (&quot;W+L&quot;) implementation provides web-based training and consultation as described in W, and also provides 1) face-to-face training and 2) twice monthly phone consultation with an expert TF-CBT trainer. W+L requires greater resource commitment from therapists and administrators and is less convenient, but provides more specific consultation on the therapists' personal TF-CBT treatment cases.</description>
