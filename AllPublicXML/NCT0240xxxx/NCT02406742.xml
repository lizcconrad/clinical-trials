  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 alone and in combination with
      ibrutinib and obinuzutumab.

      CC-122 has multiple activities, including immune modulation of several immune cell subsets
      and antiproliferative activity in CLL. CC-122 has also been shown to have a tolerable safety
      profile with some preliminary signs of efficacy with early human experience.

    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this Phase 1/2 Study are to determine the safety of single agent
      CC-122 and the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of CC-122 when administered in combination with
      ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab to subjects with CLL/SLL. The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the PK profiles of subjects administered CC-122 in combination
      with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab, to determine ibrutinib concentrations
      when given alone and in combination with CC-122 and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of
      CC-122 at selected dose levels/regimens.

             Plan:

          1. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must undergo pregnancy testing based on the
             frequency outlined in the Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management Plan (PPRMP) and
             pregnancy results must be negative.

          2. Unless practicing complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, sexually active
             FCBP must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods as specified in the PPRMP.

             *For Arm C, subjects must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods for 18 months
             (please refer to the obinutuzumab IB, PI, and SmPC).

             - Complete abstinence is only acceptable in cases where this is the preferred and
             usual lifestyle of the subject.

             - Periodic abstinence (calendar ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable.

          3. Males (including those who have had a vasectomy) must practice complete abstinence or
             use barrier contraception (condoms) when engaging in sexual activity with FCBP as
             specified in the PPRMP.

          4. Males must agree not to donate semen or sperm for the duration of the study and for 3
             months after the last dose of CC-122.

          5. All subjects must:

             - Understand that the (investigational Product) IP could have a potential teratogenic
             risk.

             - Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking IP and following discontinuation
             of IP.

               -  Agree not to share IP with another person.

          6. Other than the subject, FCBP and males should not handle the IP or touch the capsules,
             unless gloves are worn.

          7. Be counseled about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.

        ARM B ONLY:

        10. Enrollment into Arm B will be permitted if ibrutinib is considered the standard of care
        in the clinical practice.

        EXPANSION COHORT 2 OF ARM C:

        11. Subjects in Cohort 2 of Arm C must meet the following criteria:

          1. Subject must have received at least one BCR PI (ibrutinib, idelalisib, or other
             approved BTK or PI3K inhibitor) and/or venetoclax;

          2. Subject must be either resistant to or intolerant of (ie., treatment failures) the
             last BCR PI and/or venetoclax. Resistant is defined as relapsed or refractory per

        IWCLL2008:

        i. Relapse is defined as a patient who has previously achieved a CR or PR, but after a
        period of 6 or more months, demonstrates evidence of disease progression. ii. Refractory is
        defined as failing to achieve a CR or PR, or disease progression within 6 months after
        initiation of treatment with an approved BTK or PI3K inhibitor (eg, ibrutinib, idelalisib)
        or venetoclax. iii. Intolerance is defined as the inability to continue treatment with a
        BCR PI or venetoclax due to toxicities or due to development of a contraindication that
        makes the subject ineligible to receive further treatment with a BCR PI or venetoclax.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

          3. Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT)/bone marrow transplant
             within 12 months of signing the ICD. Subjects who received allogeneic SCT ≥ 12 months
             before signing the ICD may be eligible provided there is no ongoing graft-versus-host
             disease and no ongoing immune suppression therapy.

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:

               1. Ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.

               2. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

             i. The glycemic targets for subjects with diabetes should take into consideration age,
             comorbidities, life expectancy, and functional status of the subjects and follow
             established guidelines (eg, International Diabetes Federation, the European Diabetes
             Working Party guidelines, and the American Diabetes Association). For younger (&lt; 70
             years old) or subjects with life expectancy ≥ 10 years, the target glycosylated
             hemoglobin, type A1C (HbA1c) should be &lt; 7.0%. The target HbA1c for older (≥ 70 years
             old) subjects or subjects with life expectancy &lt; 10 years should be &lt; 8.0%.
             Consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended when deciding if diabetes is
             optimally controlled.

             c. Chronic symptomatic congestive heart failure (Class III or IV of the New York Heart
             Association Classification for Heart Disease). d. Active central nervous system
             involvement as documented by spinal fluid cytology or imaging. e. Uncontrolled
             autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia. f. Other concurrent severe and/or
             uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions that could cause unacceptable safety risks
             or compromise compliance with protocol.

          6. History of second malignancies with life expectancy of &lt; 2 years or requirement of
             therapy that would confound study results. This does not include the following:

               1. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

               2. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

               3. Carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

               4. Carcinoma in situ of the breast.

               5. Carcinoma in situ of the bladder.

               6. Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (TNM stage of T1a or T1b).

          7. Known seropositivity for or history of active viral infection with human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis B or C virus (HBV, HCV).

             a. Hepatitis B screening is mandatory for all patients (HBsAg and anti-HBc). Patients
             with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated with obinutuzumab. Patients
             should be referred to a specialist if they are carriers before treatment starts (see
             PI or SmPC). Subjects who are positive for anti-HBc and/or anti-HBs but negative for
             HBsAg and HBV DNA may be treated after consultation with a hepatologist.

          8. Any peripheral neuropathy ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 2.

          9. Use of systemic corticosteroids in doses greater than prednisone equivalent to 20
             mg/day.

         10. Medicines with high probability to cause QT prolongation or torsades de pointes.
             Subjects on chronic medications in this category may enroll after discussion with the
             medical monitor if changing these medications are not in the best medical interest of
             the patient.

         11. History of hypersensitivity to IMiDs® (lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide).

         12. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of
             the following:

               1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45% as determined by MUGA scan or
                  echocardiogram (ECHO).

               2. Complete left bundle branch, or bifasicular, block.

               3. Congenital long QT syndrome.

               4. Persistent or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation.

               5. QTcF &gt; 470 msec on Screening ECG (mean of triplicate recordings).

               6. Unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to starting CC
                  122.

               7. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension.

               8. Troponin-T value &gt;0.4 ng/mL or BNP &gt;300 pg/mL. Subjects with baseline troponin-T
                  &gt;ULN or BNP &gt;100 pg/mL are eligible but must have cardiologist evaluation prior
                  to enrollment in the trial for baseline assessment and optimization of
                  cardioprotective therapy.

         13. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational anticancer therapy or major surgery within
             28 days of Day 1 dosing with the following exceptions:

             a. Arm A: A minimum 5-day washout after discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy (or other
             BTK inhibitors) is required; only those subjects without rapid disease progression
             during the 5-day washout will be allowed to enroll into Arm A.

             i. Rapid disease progression is defined as follows:

        1. For subjects with measurable nodal disease, the increase in the sum of diameters of the
        largest lymph nodes (up to 3 nodes) exceeds

        1 cm per day OR the diameter of the largest lymph node exceeds 5 cm during the 5 day wash
        out. 2. For subjects with lymphocytosis, the increase in the ALC exceeds 2x109/L per day OR
        the ALC exceeds 100,000 x109/L during the 5-day wash out; b. Arm C: No minimum washout is
        required after discontinuation of ibrutinib (or other BTK inhibitors) c. Approved PI3
        kinase inhibitors: Subjects may start study treatment within 3 days of discontinuation of
        approved PI3 kinase inhibitors.

        14. Persistent diarrhea or malabsorption ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 2, despite medical management
        15. Active disease transformation (ie, Richter's Syndrome); subjects with Richter's
        Syndrome that has resolved &gt; 2 years from signing the ICD are eligible.

        16. Known acute or chronic pancreatitis 17. Pregnant or lactating females

        Arm B only (CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib):

        18. Prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor 19. Presence of transfusion-dependent
        thrombocytopenia or a history of bleeding disorders or clinical conditions (eg,
        gastrointestinal bleeding or constitutional disorders) that may increase risk of
        life-threatening bleeding when thrombocytopenic 20. History of stroke or intracranial
        hemorrhage within 6 months prior to signing the ICD 21. Medications that are strong
        inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 (eg, itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin,
        ritonavir, phenytoin, pentobarbital, and rifampin) should be changed; subjects who cannot
        change these medications must be excluded.

        22. Use of concomitant anticoagulation with warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists is
        prohibited, as is treatment with these agents in the 7 days prior to signing the ICD. The
        use of other anticoagulants (eg, heparins) and anti-platelet agents is allowed per
        investigator's discretion.

        Arm C only (CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab):

        23. Hypersensitivity to obinutuzumab
