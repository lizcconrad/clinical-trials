      Selective laryngeal bilateral reinnervation as a secondary treatment in patients with
      bilateral vocal fold paralysis, previously treated by endoscopy, without residual arytenoids
      ankylosis.

      The surgical procedure is : functional reinnervation with the upper root of one phrenic
      nerve, is used for reinnervation of both cricoarytenoid muscles (laryngeal inspiratory
      muscles), and simultaneous reinnervation of adductor laryngeal muscles is performed by right
      and left thyro -hyoid nerves (coming from the hypoglossi) on both sides.

      Results are obtained after 6 to 9 months delay. In case of good inspiratory arytenoid
      abduction, and residual dysphonia, a secondary vocal fold medialization is done by an
      endoscopic approach 12 months after reinnervation (included in the protocol).

      Improvement is expected in voice and breathing, without aspiration.
