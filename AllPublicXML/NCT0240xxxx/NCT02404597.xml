  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the use of non-invasive cardiac output monitors
      (NICOM) in patients with burn injuries and to develop a protocol for NICOM in a burn unit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate fluid resuscitation in the first 24 hours after a burn injury directly influences
      patient outcome and morbidity. Currently, there is some controversy surrounding the over and
      under-resuscitation and endpoints of resuscitation using older fluid resuscitation formulas
      in patients with burn injury. The NICOM has been used in the resuscitation of patients with
      sepsis. The NICOM will be used in patients with burn injury to determine the patient's fluid
      responsiveness and the need for additional fluid boluses versus medications to increase the
      patient's blood pressure.

    <description>Subjects with burns greater than 20% total body surface area (TBSA) will have a NICOM placed on them after the first 24 hours of admission if subject has an episode of hypotension (mean arterial pressure &lt; 65 or a systolic blood pressure &lt; 90mmHg). The NICOM will generate a number that reflects stroke volume of the heart. If the number is greater than 10 percent, subject will be given a bolus of crystalloid fluids. If the number is less than 10 percent, subject will start a medication to raise the blood pressure.
Physicians may also use traditional endpoints of resuscitation include base deficit values and urine output goals of 0.5cc/kg/hr as indications of adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation.</description>

    <intervention_name>NICOM (non-invasive cardiac output monitor)</intervention_name>
    <description>The non-invasive cardiac output monitor (NICOM) will be used to tailor fluid management to optimize resuscitation if the patient has an episode of hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;100 or mean arterial pressure &lt;65). NICOM consists of two electrodes placed on the patient's chest and back and uses bioreactance technology to transduce signals to compute hemodynamic parameters on an associated monitor.
The electrodes will remain on the patient for twenty minutes. Once the electrodes are in place the patient's leg will be raised to 45 degrees and the monitor to which the electrodes are attached will generate a number that reflects stroke volume of the heart. The electrodes will be removed once this number is determined.</description>
