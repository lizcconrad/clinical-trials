        Inclusion Criteria: Study inclusion criteria are such that study participants must:

          1. meet a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) alcohol abuse or dependence
             diagnosis based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule - IV (DIS-IV);

          2. consume a weekly average of at least 24 standard drinks during the baseline period to
             include at least 5 episodes of heavy drinking;

          3. agree not to seek additional alcohol or other substance abuse treatment during the
             study period;

          4. be at least 18 years of age; and

          5. be sufficiently proficient in their English speaking ability to interact effectively
             with the research interviewer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals assessed as having a drug diagnosis that is more severe than their alcohol
             diagnosis (e.g., cocaine dependence and alcohol abuse, IV drug use),

          -  a serious psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., uncontrolled schizophrenia or major depression)
             as well as those meeting criteria for organic brain impairment, as measured by the
             mini-mental status examination section of the DIS-IV will be precluded from study
             participation.

        In addition,

          -  individuals reporting current enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program,

          -  mandated to substance abuse treatment by a court order, or

          -  severely socially unstable (e.g., homeless) also will be precluded from study
             participation.
