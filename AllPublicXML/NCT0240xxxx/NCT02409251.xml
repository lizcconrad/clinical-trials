  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a simple intervention (a combination of
      education and feedback) on Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) testing.

      This aim was chosen because of the known overuse of many laboratory tests, of which ANA
      testing is one. As overuse of ANA tests can have negative consequences (both for patients and
      society), the investigators designed an intervention to see how this would influence
      Antinuclear Antibody testing by rheumatologists.

    <description>The intervention consisted of a one-hour, small group educational session. During this session information on rational ANA testing was provided and feedback on current ANA testing was provided to the rheumatologists. A booster session with the same components was held 6 months after the first session.</description>
