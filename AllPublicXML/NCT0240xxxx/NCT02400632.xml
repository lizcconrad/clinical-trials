      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of MagicTouch DCB in reducing late
      lumen loss / suppressing neointimal tissue formation as assessed by Quantitative Coronary
      Angiography / Intravascular Ultrasound examination for the treatment of coronary artery
      lesions ranging from 3.0 mm to 3.5 mm of diameter and lesion length ≤ 15 mm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be ≥18 and ≤ 80 years of age

          2. Symptomatic ischemic heart disease;

          3. Acceptable candidate for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) or Angioplasty;

          4. Target lesion located in a native coronary artery

          5. Target lesion (maximum length is 15 mm by visual estimate) covered by a single
             balloon;

          6. Reference vessel diameter must be ≥3.0 to ≤ 3.5 mm by visual estimate;

          7. Target lesion ≥50% and &lt;100% stenosed by visual estimate

          8. Restenosis of initially stented main vessel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year
             following index procedure;

          2. Patient has had a known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours
             preceding the index procedure;

          3. Lesions in bypass grafts or bifurcations

          4. Any non-target vessel or lesion intended to be treated during the index procedure,
             which is an unprotected left main, ostial lesion, chronic total occlusion (CTO),
             heavily calcified, bifurcation, vein grafts, have angiographic evidence of thrombus,
             be anything requiring atherectomy, thrombectomy, or pre-treatment with anything other
             than balloon angioplasty;

          5. Patient presents with cardiogenic shock;

          6. Patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath
             insertion

          7. Unprotected left main coronary artery disease with ≥50% stenosis;

          8. Totally occluded target vessel (TIMI flow 0);

          9. Calcified target lesion(s) which cannot be successfully pre-dilated;

         10. A significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that cannot be
             covered by same single balloon

         11. Diffuse distal disease to target lesion with impaired runoff;

         12. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤30% (LVEF must be obtained within 1 months
             prior to the index procedure).
