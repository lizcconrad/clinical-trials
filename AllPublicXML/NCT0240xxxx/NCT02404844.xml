  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial with a molecularly stratified parallel cohort, single arm design to
      explore the efficacy and safety of BKM120 in combination with tamoxifen in patients with
      ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with prior exposure to antihormonal therapy, and
      different biomarker profiles, two of them potentially indicative of constitutive PI3K pathway
      activation.

      This is a clinical trial with a molecularly stratified parallel cohort, single arm design to
      explore the efficacy and safety of BKM120 in combination with tamoxifen in patients with
      ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with prior exposure to antihormonal therapy, and
      different biomarker profiles, two of them potentially indicative of constitutive PI3K pathway
      activation:

        -  PIK3CA mutation/preserved PTEN expression

        -  PIK3CA wildtype or mutation/ loss of PTEN expression

        -  PIK3CA wildtype/preserved PTEN expression. This trial will explore, if the combination
           of BKM120 and tamoxifen can overcome resistance to antihormonal therapies. BKM120 is
           selective for class I PI3K enzymes with no mTOR inhibitory activity that has entered
           Phase II and III clinical trials. The tumor suppressor PTEN is the most important
           negative regulator of the PI3K signaling pathway. Therefore, in addition the trial will
           prospectively evaluate PIK3CA mutations and/or loss of PTEN expression as predictive
           biomarkers for clinical benefit from combined treatment with BKM120 and tamoxifen.
