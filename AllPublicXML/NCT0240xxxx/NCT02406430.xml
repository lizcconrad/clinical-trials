  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective interventional case series study reporting preoperative clinical and anatomical
      factors associated with visual recovery 1 year after combined cataract and idiopathic
      epiretinal membrane surgery. Age, duration of symptoms, and preoperative best corrected
      visual acuity appeared to be reliable prognostic factors. Combining these factors with
      analysis of the photoreceptors' inner and outer segments junction in spectral-domain optical
      coherence tomography provides a predictive score to estimate individual chances of good
      visual recovery

    <description>All patients underwent a combined cataract and ERM surgery owing to visual impairment or disabling metamorphopsia. A complete ophthalmological examination was performed before and at 1,6, and 12 months after the surgery, including best corrected visual acuity with Snellen charts converted into the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect fundus, and macular optical coherence tomography</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  symptomatic idiopathic epiretinal membrane operated on between April 2009 and
             September 2012 at the university hospital of Dijon, France.

          -  All patients signed informed consent for the surgical procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if they presented any cause of secondary epiretinal membrane
             (including diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusion, ocular inflammation, retinal
             detachment, or previously vitrectomized eye), high myopia (axial length ≥ 26 mm or
             spherical equivalent ≥ 6 diopters), severe media opacities with weak SD-OCT signal
             strengths, or any macular or optic nerve disease. Patients with a follow-up of less
             than 12 months were excluded and only one eye was included in those with bilateral
             epiretinal membranes.
