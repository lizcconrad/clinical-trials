  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety of concurrent chemoradiation combining
      radiotherapy (IGRT) with two cytotoxic agents, capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with
      advanced or inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I study, patients with advanced or inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma, or
      those failed other strategies will be recruited. The primary tumor and nearby metastatic
      nodes will be irradiated with Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) mostly with conventional
      fractions. During the course, oral capecitabine and intravenous oxaliplatin will be given
      concurrently. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the two drugs will be determined during
      escalation according to the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT).

    <description>Patients recruited will be treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with IGRT and two cytotoxic agents: capecitabine and oxaliplatin. Capecitabine will be taken orally twice a day, from D1 to D14 while oxaliplatin will be given intravenously on D1 and D8, every 21 days. The doses of the two drugs will be escalated alternatively in each level group. The radiation will be given by IGRT and the dose is between 45 to 54Gy, 1.8-3Gy per fraction.</description>
