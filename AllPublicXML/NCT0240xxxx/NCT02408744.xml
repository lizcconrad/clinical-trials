    <description>Pirfenidone was supplied orally in the form of prolonged-released tablets according with body surface area (m2 BS) of each patient. The target dosage of PFD was 1200 mg two times a day (b.i.d.) for a full dosage of 2400 mg daily during three years. Therapy was initiated at 600 mg b.i.d. and escalated to full dosage after 3 weeks when symptoms were controlled.</description>
