  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wheat germ is a by-product of the wheat-milling industry with high nutritional value and
      therefore could be used as a raw source for the preparation of food products such as bread,
      cookies, muffins, etc.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of ingesting wheat breads supplemented with
      wheat germ on gastrointestinal discomfort, blood cholesterol and postprandial glycaemic
      response in healthy human volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover, double blinded, placebo controlled randomized trial. The study will
      compare the effect of consumption of wheat breads with or without wheat germ on healthy
      individuals, during 2 intake periods of 4 weeks each and 5 weeks washout before crossover.

      The study will focus on the effects of wheat breads supplemented with wheat germ on
      gastrointestinal discomfort, blood cholesterol and postprandial glycaemic response in healthy
      human volunteers.

    <measure>Changes in mean Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) score from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 7, 9, 11 and 13</measure>
    <time_frame>at the end of week 0 (after 2-week run-in period), at the end of weeks 2 and 4 (during 4-week intake period), at the end of weeks 7 and 9 (during 5-week washout period), at the end of weeks 11 and 13 (during 4-week intake period after crossover)</time_frame>
    <description>A validated PAC-SYM questionnaire will be used. PAC-SYM is a 12-item, self-administered questionnaire used to measure severity of symptoms over the past 2 weeks in patients with constipation. The PAC-SYM questionnaire has been demonstrated and documented to have internal consistency, reproducibility, validity, sensitivity, and responsiveness. PAC-SYM items are rated on a 5-point scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe) and grouped into three subscales related to abdominal symptoms (bloating, discomfort, pain, and cramps), stool symptoms (incomplete bowel movement, false alarm, straining, too hard, and too small), and rectal symptoms (painful bowel movement, burning, and bleeding or tearing). The total score and subscale scores are computed by taking the mean of item responses (score range 0-4). A reduction in score reflects an improvement in symptoms. Cultural adaptation and linguistic validation of the PAC-SYM for Portugal was performed by Mapi Research.</description>

    <description>A validated PAC-QOL questionnaire will be used. PAC-QOL questionnaire is a 28-item self-administered questionnaire that is being used to measure health-related quality of life (over the past 2 weeks) in patients with chronic constipation. The 28 items are grouped into four subscales: physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, worries and concerns, and satisfaction. Previous studies have shown that PAC-QOL is internally consistent, reproducible, valid and responsive to improvements in chronic constipation over time. Cultural adaptation and linguistic validation of the PAC-QOL for Portugal was performed by Mapi Research Trust.</description>
