        This study was a retrospective case series of 694 patients, in which the fracture was
        caused due to primary or secondary osteoporosis, and who were treated at the department of
        trauma surgery at our level-I trauma center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -patients older than 50 years of age with vertebral fractures at the thoracic or lumbar
        spine caused by a low-energy trauma or without any trauma, or with vertebral fractures at
        the thoracic or lumbar spine with typical osteoporotic deformity of the vertebrae (wedge,
        fish, or flat)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients younger than 50 years of age

          -  vertebral fractures at the cervical spine

          -  vertebral fractures at the thoracic or lumbar spine caused by a high-energy trauma
             (motor-vehicle accident, sports-related accident, fall from a considerable height)

          -  patients suffering from a malignancy, making a pathological fracture presumably,
             patients with vertebral fractures, whose dataset of follow-up monitoring was lacking,
             to make an evaluation of osteoporotic involvement impossible
