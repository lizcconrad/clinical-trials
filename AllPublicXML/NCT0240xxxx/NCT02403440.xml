        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Chronical ITP patients.

          2. The subjects were diagnosed as ITP with bone marrow aspiration within 3 months before
             enrollment or in the screening period. And secondary immune thrombocytopenia (e.g.,
             myelodysplastic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, aplastic anemia) was excluded.

          3. Patients had a mean platelet count of less than 30,000/µL in the screening period.

          4. Patients receiving chronic maintenance steroid therapy must have received a stable
             dose for at least 1 month.

          5. Patients receiving danazol, mycophenolate mofetil or cyclosporine A must have received
             a stable dose for at least 12 weeks.

          6. Normal PT/INR and APTT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior history of arterial or venous thrombosis (stroke, transient ischemic attack,
             myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), AND ≥ two of the
             following risk factors: hormone replacement therapy, systemic contraception
             (containing estrogen), smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, medication for
             hypertension, cancer, hereditary thrombophilic disorders (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII
             deficiency, etc), or any other family history of arterial or venous thrombosis.

          2. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure, New York Heart
             Association [NYHA] Grade III/IV), or arrhythmia known to increase the risk of
             thromboembolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation).

          3. Malignant disease

          4. Cancer treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

          5. Patients with one of the following conditions should be excluded:

               -  Treatment with immunoglobulins within 1 week preceding the first dose of study
                  medication.

               -  Treatment with splenectomy or rituximab within 12 weeks preceding the first dose
                  of study medication.

               -  Treatment with eltrombopag or Nplate within 4 weeks preceding the first dose of
                  study medication.

               -  Treatment with cyclophosphamide or vinca alkaloids within 4 weeks preceding the
                  first dose of study medication.

          6. ALT&gt;2×ULN，AST&gt;2×ULN，Total Bilirubin&gt;1.5×ULN，serum creatinine &gt;1.2×ULN，Total albumin
             &lt;0.9×LLN
