      suspected medications, clinical types, histological characteristics, severity and outcomes.

      It investigates medical records of patients who were hospitalized during 2012 to 2014. Those
      patients should be diagnosed as drug-induced liver injury, drug-induced liver disease,
      drug-induced hepatitis, drug-induced hepatocirrhosis, drug-induced hepatic failure, or any
      other similar diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury nature.
