    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The primary
      outcome of this trial is achieving durable eradication persistent high risk HPV infection
      determined by HPV negative test results achieved while on active treatment with AHCC and
      maintained for 6 month post supplementation and 12 months post completion of AHCC treatment
      compared to placebo.

      This is a phase II randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The primary
      outcome of this trial is achieving durable eradication HPV infection determined by HPV
      negative test results achieved while on active treatment with AHCC and maintained for 6 month
      post supplementation and 12 months post completion of AHCC treatment for Group 1. We will
      follow all patients for at least 12 months and up to 30 months depending on success of
      achieving a negative HPV testing results. After receiving AHCC 3 grams x 6 months if positive
      at the end of 12 months of study treatment, they are considered a treatment failure. If
      negative after completion of 6 months of AHCC supplementation + 6 months of placebo, they
      will continue on study for another six months (2 visits) to confirm they remain HPV negative
      and durable response. Group 2 will serve as untreated control for all time points (end of
      supplementation, then 6, 9, and 12 months post end of AHCC supplementation.
