    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel group study designed to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of fulvestrant followed, at progression, by examestane and everolimus
      versus examestane and everolimus followed, at progression, by fulvestrant in postmenopausal
      women with HR+ and HER2- LABC or MBC whose disease has progressed to NSAI in the adjuvant or
      metastatic setting.

      In this study everolimus will be administered in combination with exemestane, which is an
      irreversible steroidal aromatase inactivator that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment
      of postmenopausal patients with ABC. Exemestane is indicated for adjuvant treatment of
      postmenopausal women with HR+ EBC who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are
      switched to exemestane for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant
      hormonal therapy. It is also indicated for the treatment of ABC in postmenopausal women whose
      disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy (in the USA) or following antiestrogen
      therapy (in Europe). In 2011, the BOLERO-2 trial reported (5; 33) a significant benefit for
      HR+ HER2- postmenopausal pretreated women in the ABC setting by combining everolimus with
      exemestane. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial a statistically
      significant improvement in PFS by adding everolimus to exemestane versus exemestane alone was
      reported. Adding everolimus determined a 2.4-fold prolongation in PFS from 3.2 up to 7.4
      months and so lowered the risk of cancer progression by 56% for these women. These findings
      were confirmed by an independent assessment (4.1 vs. 11.0 months, risk reduction: 64%). The
      QoL data shows positive trend in the everolimus plus exemestane treatment arm.

    <description>The number of events required for the other primary endpoint (PFS1), and the expected time needed to achieve it are derived from previous calculations. Assuming an average accrual rate of 31 pts/month (677pts/22 months), a median PFS1 of 6 months in the Fulvestrant arm (control), a Hazard ratio of 0.70 (implying that a median PFS1 of 8,6 months is expected in the experimental arm, a 2-sided significance level of 0.025 and power of 0.90, 391 events are required for PFS1, that will be achieved in about 22 months (East 6 software).</description>

    <description>Overall study size is driven by the endpoint less frequent (PFST). Sample size is planned to identify a Hazard ratio of 0.75, assuming an overall study duration of 36 months, an accrual duration of 24 months, a 2-sided significance level of 0.025 and power of 0.80. Assuming a median PFST of 12 months in the Fulvestrant arm (control), the expected PFST in the experimental arm will be equal to 16 months and 677 subjects need to be enrolled (East 6 software) with an average accrual rate equal to 30.8 patients/month (11 months per year have been considered).</description>
