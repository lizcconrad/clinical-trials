    <textblock>
      The study will determine the effects of different types of soybean oils on biomarkers of risk
      for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There will be four 4-week diet periods in which
      participants will consume the following oils, within the context of a controlled diet:
      soybean oil, high-oleic soybean oil, blend of high oleic soybean oil &amp; fully hydrogenated
      soybean oil, and blend of palm olein &amp; palm stearin.
