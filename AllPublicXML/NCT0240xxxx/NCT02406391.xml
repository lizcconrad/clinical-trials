  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, the highest incidence of cervical cancer occurs in inner city urban
      centers, rural areas, the deep South, Appalachia and the U.S.-Mexico border. The goal of this
      study is to study predictors of adherence among patients seeking care at an inner city
      medical center in New York City and the U.S. Mexico border for cervical cancer prevention,
      namely, Pap smears and colposcopy exams.

      Because there are multiple pathways through which a person is influenced to seek and receive
      care, the investigators will conduct interviews with patients seeking care for cervical
      cancer prevention at an inner city medical center. The investigators will ask questions
      related to previous screening, diagnostic, and treatment practices as well as barriers
      experienced in seeking such care. The investigators will also explore patients' level of
      resiliency and coping as predictors of adherence to timely care. Furthermore, among
      immigrants, questions about acculturation and discrimination will be asked. Additional
      measures of socioeconomic status, such as education, income and occupation will also be
      collected.
