  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single site, Phase II clinical trial to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of an individualized anti-cancer vaccine (CRCL-AlloVax) in advanced HCC patients
      after a minimum of 90 days on sorafenib.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or primary liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer
      death worldwide. It accounts for 90% of all liver cancers. More than 80% of patients present
      with advanced or unresectable disease.

      For patients with vascular invasion and/or metastases, the only approved therapy that offers
      a survival advantage is Sorafenib (Nexavar®). While palliative systemic chemotherapy other
      than Sorafenib is sometimes offered for HCC, there is no evidence that any chemotherapy has
      any meaningful therapeutic benefit, especially in overall survival. Subjects in the current
      study will have completed at least 90 days of sorafenib treatment. Subjects will continue
      sorafenib as tolerated while receiving experimental therapy. The experimental dosing schedule
      has four segments: (1) priming, which consists of intradermal AlloStim alone; (2)
      vaccination, which consists of intradermal dosing of AlloStim+CRCL; (3) activation, which
      consists of an intravenous infusion of AlloStim; and (4) booster, which consists of monthly
      intradermal injections of CRCL alone
