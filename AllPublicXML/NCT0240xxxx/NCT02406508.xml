      This is a single arm, open label, multi-center, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of sequential treatment with Melphalan/HDS followed by sorafenib in patients with
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) confined to the liver.

      Eligible patients will receive up to 3 Melphalan/HDS treatments. Each treatment cycle
      consists of 6 weeks with an acceptable delay for another 2 weeks before next planned
      treatment. The Melphalan/HDS treatment will be terminated in patients with progressive
      disease (PD), complete response (CR), and &gt; 8 weeks delay of recovery from toxicity after
      last PHP treatment.

      With the exception of patients with PD, all patients will be treated with sorafenib after
      completing the Melphalan/HDS treatment. Patients with PD will be managed with standard of
      care off-study by their treating physician.
