    <textblock>
      This is an observational comparative study to compare the standard-of-care methods for sweat
      testing used to support diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) against a new method of sweat testing
      called the CF Quantum Sweat Test System. The results of the new device in this study are for
      comparison ONLY and will NOT be used to diagnose, treat or mitigate the subject's condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new sweat test method in
      both normal individuals and individuals with CF or cystic fibrosis related metabolic syndrome
      (CRMS).

      Subject participation is for one day and duration of study for each subject is one day. No
      follow-up will be required.

      Number of subjects; 300 split evenly between subjects with previously diagnosed CF or CRMS
      (cystic fibrosis related metabolic syndrome) and subjects referred to the sweat test lab for
      clinical reasons.

      Number of sites = 6, U of WI-Madison, U of WI-Milwaukee, U of MI-Ann Arbor, Dayton Children's
      Hospital (OH), U of MN, and Children's of Alabama.

      Primary endpoints:

        -  Clinical and analytical sensitivity of the new test method

        -  Clinical and analytical sensitivity of the standard-of-care methods

      Statistics Sensitivity and specificity will be calculated and reported along with the
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Bias assessment will be conducted according to the
      Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for method comparison and bias
      estimation. Pearson's correlation analysis will be conducted to test for adequate range of
      the replicate values for the new test method.

    <description>Subject's with a previous cystic fibrosis or cystic fibrosis related metabolic syndrome (CRMS) diagnosis will receive the institution's standard iontophoresis sweat testing (Gibson-Cooke or Wescor Macroduct) to provide a diagnosis.
The patient will also receive a sweat test provided by the new CF Quantum Sweat Test System which includes the same process and principal of operation of iontophoretic stimulation, collection and analysis of sweat compared to the standard. The results of the new sweat test and the standard sweat test will be compared. The new sweat test will not be used to diagnose, treat or mitigate the patient's condition. Results are used only to compare to the standard of care.</description>
