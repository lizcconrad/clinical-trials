  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the leading causes of mortality in the
      industrialized world. Bystander CPR before arrival of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) is
      a positive predictor of survival. During the last decade, the best form of bystander CPR has
      been debated. Chest Compression Only CPR (CO-CPR) has been advocated as a preferable method
      in situations where the bystander has no previous knowledge in CPR, both because its believed
      to be equally efficient but also a simplified form of CPR that could lead to a higher
      incidence of bystander-CPR.

      The purpose of this study is to perform av run-in period with focus on safety and feasibility
      prior to the launch of a larger randomized trial which has a primary end-point of survival.
      This study will compare OHCA with standard CPR (S-CPR; chest compressions and rescue breaths
      in a 30:2 fashion) compared to CO-CPR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Witnessed cases of OHCA with a non-asphyctic aetiology will be the principal study
      population. According to current guidelines an unresponsive patient with no or agonal
      breathing is treated as a suspected case of OHCA at the dispatch centre. These cases are
      eligible for screening for inclusion. If the case is witnessed, the bystander has previous
      knowledge in CPR and no exclusion criteria are present, the case can be included in the
      study. If included, it will be randomly assigned to either CO-CPR (intervention) or S-CPR
      (control).

      The intervention consists of instructions from a dispatcher at the dispatch centre to
      bystanders and first responders to perform either CO-CPR (intervention) or S-CPR (control).

      Instructions to bystanders on how to perform CO-CPR emphasizes continuous chest compressions
      without interruptions or rescue breaths. The instructions on how to perform S-CPR in the
      control group include information on giving chest compressions and rescue breaths in a 30:2
      ratio (like current CPR recommendation state). Please se Appendix a) for detailed
      instructions to both groups.

      If first responders equipped with an automated external defibrillator arrive prior to EMS
      they will carry on with CPR in accordance with initial allocation. The intervention continues
      until arrival of the EMS at the patient's side.
