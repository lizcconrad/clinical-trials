      The purpose of this study is to determine if local administration of vancomycin powder at the
      site of Grade I-IIIA open fractures at the time of surgery will be an efficacious method to
      lower infection rates in open fracture treatment and to elucidate any detrimental effects of
      applying vancomycin powder at the site of open fractures.

      Hypothesis:

      Local administration of 1 gram of vancomycin powder at the site of primarily closeable
      Gustilo-Anderson Grade I-IIIA open fractures at the time of surgery, in addition to
      clinically accepted open fracture management (intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation
      and debridement and stabilization), will significantly decrease the postoperative infection
      rate in comparison to the current treatment algorithm.

      Methods:

      Study subjects will be randomized to one of two groups prior to surgery (parallel group
      design): standard treatment (control group) versus vancomycin powder treatment (experimental
      group). Each group will have an equal number of subjects. Once randomized, the intervention
      is then un-blinded to facilitate treatment.

      Post-operatively, all patients will receive intravenous antibiotics, such that all patients
      receive a total of 24 hours of intravenous antibiotics. The surgical drain will be removed at
      the patient's bedside approximately 24 hours after the surgical procedure. Patients will
      follow up with their surgeon for routine scheduled visits at approximately 2 weeks, 6 weeks,
      12 weeks, and further until aseptic union or resolution of infection. There will be no
      additional appointments solely for the purpose of research follow-up.

    <description>Infections will be considered clinically significant if they require a return to the operating suite for surgical debridement. These infections will be classified as acute infections and/or chronic osteomyelitis. Superficial skin infections will be treated with local wound care, oral antibiotics and incision and drainage (as indicated). Deep infections and chronic osteomyelitis will be treated with staged serial surgical debridement, hardware removal (as indicated), culture specific IV antibiotics, and Infectious Disease consultation.</description>

    <description>If the patient randomizes to the experimental group (vancomycin powder), the patient will receive open fracture care identical to the control group except that, prior to closure, 1 gram of vancomycin powder will be applied locally to the open fracture bed. The traumatic and surgical wounds will be closed over a sterile drain and dressed, and the extremity will be immobilized.</description>

    <description>If the patient randomizes to the control group (standard treatment), the patient will receive irrigation and debridement of the fracture site and surrounding soft tissues. The fracture will then be stabilized in standard fashion determined by fracture personality. Once stabilized, a sterile drain will be placed in the open fracture bed and the traumatic and surgical wounds will be closed and dressed. The extremity will then be immobilized.</description>
