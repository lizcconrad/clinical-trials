    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether high-flavonoid cocoa can decrease appetite
      in humans. In addition the study is designed to test epicatechin, a compound found in cocoa
      and procyanidins, a class of compounds found in cocoa, for their ability to decrease appetite
      in humans.
