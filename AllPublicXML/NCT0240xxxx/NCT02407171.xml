  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part prospective trial examining the ability of Stereotactic Body Radiation
      Therapy (SBRT) to induce a response to MK-3475, a humanized antibody to PD-1, in patients who
      progress on this antibody. Patients with metastatic melanoma will be enrolled after they have
      progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients with metastatic NSCLC (previously untreated with
      anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy) will be enrolled and treated with MK-3475 until they exhibit
      progression of disease. At this point (when patients have demonstrated progression of
      disease) a single target lesion will be selected and treated with SBRT, and then MK-3475 will
      be restarted and continued until there is further progression of disease. The first phase of
      the study is a radiation dose escalation with a constant dose of MK-3475. The second part of
      the study includes expansion cohorts of NSCLC and melanoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase 1b portion of the trial is a radiation dose escalation study to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SBRT when given to patients previously and subsequently
      exposed to MK-3475. Because the class of PD-1 inhibitory antibodies conveys a risk of
      pneumonitis, there will be two parallel dose escalation arms- Arm A will include SBRT targets
      in the lung parenchyma, and Arm B will be limited to targets outside the lung parenchyma.
      Each arm will be separately escalated, and two MTDs will be determined. The starting dose
      will be 3000 cGy in 5 fractions; there will be one dose escalation cohort (3000 cGy in 3
      fractions), and if necessary one dose de-escalation cohort (1000 cGy in a single fraction).
      If there is dose-limiting toxicity at the lowest cohort, that arm will be closed and SBRT to
      that site will be discontinued.

      The phase 2a portion of the study includes 2 expansion cohorts, for melanoma and NSCLC, with
      SBRT delivered at the MTD. The primary endpoint of this phase of the study is the overall
      response rate to post-SBRT MK-3475. Secondary endpoints include determining the time to
      progression, overall survival, and exploratory biomarkers.

      IND exempt per FDA.
