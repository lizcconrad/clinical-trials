    <textblock>
      This study is to compare metabolic control, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life
      during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII ) therapy with a new insulin pump
      system with multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy. Furthermore, this study will add
      clinical data originating from clinical investigation in a special population, i.e. children
      and adolescents of ages 2 - 17 years , to the existing clinical data of the ACCU-CHEK Insight
      insulin pump.
