      This is an exploratory biomarker study. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer will
      receive regorafenib, which is FDA approved in this setting, on day 1-21 of every consecutive
      28 day cycle. Patients will be asked to undergo tumor biopsy at baseline and 2 weeks after
      starting regorafenib. Peripheral blood samples will be collected at baseline 2 weeks after
      starting regorafenib, after initiation of cycle 3, and every 4 weeks thereafter.

      Tumor tissue collected at baseline and 2 weeks after starting regorafenib will be analyzed
      for phosphoproteins and RNA. Peripheral blood samples will be collected and banked for
      protein, miRNA, and mutated DNA analysis.
