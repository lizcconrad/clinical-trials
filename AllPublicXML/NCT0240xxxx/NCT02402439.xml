    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to gain initial clinical experience regarding the safety and
      efficacy of treating type I diabetes in people who have received a kidney transplant by
      transplanting islets into a new transplant site in the stomach (gastrointestinal submucosa).
      A total of 6 patients will be enrolled in the study and followed for a period of up to 3
      years after the last islet transplant.

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic islet transplantation offers a minimally invasive approach to restore
      normoglycemia in type 1 diabetics while avoiding the hypoglycemic complications observed with
      intensive insulin therapy and the surgical complications associated with pancreas
      transplantation. Although significant progress has been made in clinical islet
      transplantation, overall outcomes remain suboptimal since many patients lose insulin
      independence a few years after transplantation and multiple donors are usually needed to
      achieve independence. The cause of this progressive loss of function is multifactorial, but
      mounting evidence suggests that much of the islet loss after transplant is directly related
      to the intraportal transplant site that is used in clinical islet transplantation.
      Intravascular infusion of the islets triggers a severe,non-specific inflammatory response
      (immediate blood-mediated inflammatory reaction, IBMIR) which destroys at least 50% of the
      islet mass. The engraftment of the surviving islets is further compromised by the relatively
      hypoxic portal venous environment, and the infused islets are exposed to potentially toxic
      levels of immunosuppressive agents being absorbed from the gut into the portal circulation.
      Together, these characteristics contribute to early as well as late loss of islet function
      after transplantation. The gastrointestinal submucosa is a newly described transplant site
      that can support islet engraftment while avoiding many of the drawbacks associated with
      intraportal infusion. In addition, this site is easily accessible via upper endoscopy and the
      submucosal injection procedure is safe and technically straightforward.

      The aim of this prospective, single-center trial is to provide initial clinical experience
      regarding the safety and efficacy of endoscopic gastric and duodenal submucosal islet
      transplantation in type I diabetic patients with kidney allografts. A total of 6 patients
      will be recruited into the trial. The investigators will follow the standardized islet
      manufacturing protocols and the thymoglobulin-based induction immunosuppressive regimen
      developed by the Clinical Islet Transplant consortium (CIT). Outcomes will include safety
      measures, glycemic control and insulin use, metabolic assessments of graft function,
      allo/auto-immune responses, and protocol biopsies to assess graft rejection/inflammation. The
      investigators believe that this novel approach to islet transplantation has the potential to
      significantly improve current islet transplantation outcomes by enhancing islet engraftment
      and long-term function.

             calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based maintenance immunosuppression ([tacrolimus alone or
             in conjunction with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, myfortic, or azathioprine; or
             cyclosporine in conjunction with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or myfortic ±
             Prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day).

          6. Stable renal function as defined by a creatinine of no more than one third greater
             than the average creatinine determination performed in the 3 previous months prior to

             of three or more insulin injections each day or insulin pump therapy. Severe
             hypoglycemia is defined as an event with one of the following symptoms: memory loss;
             confusion; uncontrollable behavior; irrational behavior; unusual difficulty in
             awakening; suspected seizure; seizure; loss of consciousness; or visual symptoms, and
             which was associated with either a BG level &lt; 54 mg/dl [3.0 mmol/L] or prompt recovery
             after oral carbohydrate, IV glucose, or glucagon administration.

          3. Other (non-kidney) organ transplants except prior failed pancreatic graft where graft
             failure is attributed to thrombosis within the first 4 weeks or to other technical
             reasons that require graft pancreatectomy; with the graft pancreatectomy occurring
             more than 6 months prior to enrollment.

          4. Untreated or unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

          5. Blood Pressure: SBP &gt; 160 mmHg or DBP &gt;100 mmHg despite treatment with
             antihypertensive agents.

          6. Calculated GFR of ≤ 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the subject's measured serum creatinine
             and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. (59)

             transplantation.

          8. Calculated panel-reactive anti-HLA antibodies &gt; 50%. Subjects with calculated panel
             reactive anti-HLA antibodies ≤ 50% will be excluded if any of the following are
             detected:

               -  Positive cross-match

               -  Islet donor-directed anti-HLA antibodies detected by Luminex® Single
                  Antigen/specificity bead assay including weakly reactive antibodies that would
                  not be detected by a flow cross-match

          9. For female subjects: Positive pregnancy test, presently breast-feeding, or
             unwillingness to use effective contraceptive measures for the duration of the study
             and 4 months after discontinuation. For male subjects: intent to procreate during the
             duration of the study or within 4 months after discontinuation or unwillingness to use
             effective measures of contraception. Oral contraceptives, Norplant®, Depo-Provera®,
             and barrier devices with spermicide are acceptable contraceptive methods; condoms used
             alone are not acceptable.

               -  Valvular disease requiring replacement with prosthetic valve.

         16. Persistent elevation of liver function tests at time of study entry. Persistent SGOT
             (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline phosphatase values &gt; 1.5, or total bilirubin &gt; 1 times
             normal upper limits will exclude a subject.

         18. Acute or chronic pancreatitis.

         19. Active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, symptomatic gallstones, or portal
             hypertension.
