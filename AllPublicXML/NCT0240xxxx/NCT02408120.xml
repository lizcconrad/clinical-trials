  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether using extra doses of aspart insulin to correct
      blood sugars before meals improves the care of patients with type 2 diabetes in the hospital
      who are already receiving the standard of care treatment with glargine and aspart insulin
      injections to control blood sugar levels. Studies done in the past indicate that blood sugar
      levels are controlled on the standard treatment of insulin and that most patients do not need
      the small extra dose of insulin at bedtime. The investigators want to test if there is any
      benefit to giving patients extra doses of insulin during the day to correct the high blood
      sugars.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of patients with Type 2 diabetes involves treatment with two different types
      of insulin injections to control blood sugar levels. The doses of the two types of insulins,
      glargine insulin and aspart insulin are adjusted daily through the hospital stay based on
      blood sugar levels. Many times, in addition to glargine and aspart insulin at meals,
      additional small doses of aspart insulin are given to correct high blood sugar levels. It has
      not been determined if using these extra doses of aspart insulin to correct blood sugars
      before meals improves care of the patients. Studies done in the past indicate that blood
      sugar levels are well controlled on the standard treatment of the two insulins and that most
      patients do not need the small extra dose of insulin at bedtime. This study will test if
      insulin supplementation improves glycemic control and prevents hypoglycemia in insulin
      treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    <description>Blood glucose (BG) will be measured at screening and at the time of discharge in patients receiving insulin supplementation for correction of hyperglycemia (BG &gt;140 mg/dL) compared to those without insulin supplementation using a glucose meter. Change is the difference between the discharge blood glucose and screening blood glucose.
