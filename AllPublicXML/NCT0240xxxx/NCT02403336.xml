      Sample size: N=355 patients. Data: Principal response variables: quality of life measured
      with the SF-12 questionnaire. Secondary response Variables: visits number, medicine /month
      number, and transitory disability days. Other prognosis and descriptive variables.

      Data analysis: Main effectiveness will be analyzed by comparing the improvement in 4 or more
      points in the SF-12 Mental Health area at 6, 12, 18 y 24 months post- intervention, between
      intervention and control group. Logistic regression will be used to adjust for prognostic
