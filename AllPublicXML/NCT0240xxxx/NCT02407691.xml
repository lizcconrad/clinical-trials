  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa, HIV has transitioned
      from a terminal illness to a long-term condition. It is likely to be accompanied by higher
      levels of disability and other chronic non-communicable diseases, resulting from the HIV
      itself, as well as adverse effects of medication. This requires an expansion of the purview
      of HIV care beyond direct HIV clinical care to also include a more comprehensive and
      integrated package of treatment and care for physical and mental conditions and their
      consequences. COBALT is a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) in public
      sector primary care clinics in the North West Province of SA. It will assess mental health
      and HIV outcomes for depressed adults receiving ART by measuring the real-world effectiveness
      of a facility-based stepped care intervention combining depression case detection by
      non-physician clinicians with group counselling intervention delivered by lay-health workers.
