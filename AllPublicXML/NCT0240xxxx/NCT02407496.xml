      The purpose of this study is develop a new assessment tool for Attention
      Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and to then test its validity (i.e. ability to
      discriminate between individuals with ADHD and healthy controls).

      The purpose of this study is to develop a novel approach and software for analyzing
      electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers of ADHD. Then to test the ability of
      this assessment tool to differentiate between adults with ADHD and healthy controls by
      comparing the classification accuracy of the metrics from the new tool to the classification
      accuracy of existing behavioral tests for ADHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific inclusion criteria for ADHD are:

               1. meet established DSM-5 criteria for ADHD predominately inattentive or combined
                  subtype with clinically significant levels of impairment, diagnosed by structured
                  clinical interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and
                  corroborating information

               2. Clinical Global Impression—Severity (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 for ADHD

               3. no lifetime history of DSM-5 bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, pervasive
                  developmental disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, or
                  substance dependence (except nicotine) as assessed wit the MINI

               4. able in the opinion of the investigator to complete all required study
                  procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for both groups are:

               1. History of diagnosis of childhood disorder other than ADHD (e.g. autism,
                  dyslexia)

               2. history of any general medical condition likely to require chronic use of
                  medication with identified CNS effects suspected to alter cognitive performance

               3. history of seizure disorder, brain tumor, other major neurological disorder or
                  head injury resulting in loss of consciousness

               4. serious oxygen deprivation

               5. current psychopathology requiring ongoing treatment with antipsychotic
                  medications, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, or anticonvulsants

               6. current untreated psychopathology which is rated to be primary in terms of
                  severity (greater than ADHD severity)

               7. current treatment with guanfacine.
