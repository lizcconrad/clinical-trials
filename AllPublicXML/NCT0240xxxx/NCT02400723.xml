  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety leads to poor quality of life, avoidance of activities, decreased social engagement,
      functional decline, and disability in older patients. This study will compare two
      self-directed treatments delivered via DVD videos that can be viewed in one's own home. The
      two treatments being compared are: psychoeducation, which refers to information and education
      about anxiety, and a behavioral treatment program, called BREATHE (Breathing, Relaxation and
      Education for Anxiety Treatment in the Home Environment). BREATHE teaches diaphragmatic
      breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Participants will be randomly assigned to either
      treatment. The study is 12 weeks long. There are 4 weeks of treatment via DVD and 8 weeks of
      follow-up. Participants will be asked questions about anxiety symptoms, mood, health and
      functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is pervasive, costly, and leads to behavioral avoidance, disability, and poor quality
      of life. The proposed CDA-2 study will examine the efficacy of a brief psychosocial
      intervention for anxiety in older Veterans with anxiety disorders. The psychosocial
      intervention is called BREATHE (Breathing, Relaxation and Education for Anxiety Treatment in
      the Home Environment) and teaches diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation
      via DVD videos that can be viewed in Veterans' own homes. The BREATHE treatment includes
      age-appropriate vignettes of anxiety-evoking situations. This project is aligned with older
      adults' preference of psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety. BREATHE is
      expected to benefit older Veterans ( 60 years) by reducing anxiety and avoidance and thereby
      increasing their engagement in activities and improving overall functioning. This aim will be
      tested in a randomized control trial of DVD-based BREATHE compared with DVD-based
      psychoeducation in 60 older Veterans with anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder,
      Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, and unspecified/other specified anxiety
      disorder). The study is 12 weeks long with both treatments lasting 4 weeks followed by an 8
      week follow-up period. It is hypothesized that BREATHE will result in a statistically and
      clinically significant reduction of anxiety symptoms as measured with the Geriatric Anxiety
      Scale compared with psychoeducation. Improvements in functioning (Activity Card Sort) are
      expected for participants randomized to the BREATHE condition compared with those randomized
      to psychoeducation. Hypotheses in will be addressed with mixed effects models.

    <description>The Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) (Segal et al., 2010) is a 30-item measure of somatic, cognitive, and affective symptoms of anxiety. The first 25 items of the measure are used to compute the total score; the last 5 items provide information about the content of worries or fears. Participants provide severity ratings for items using on a four-point Likert-type scale.</description>

    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) (Hamilton, 1959), a clinician-administered rating scale, assesses the severity of anxiety using 14-items rated on a five-point scale. It has adequate internal consistency, high inter-rater reliability, and good-to-adequate concurrent validity (Diefenbach et al., 2001; Stanley et al., 2009). The Structured Interview Guide for Hamilton Anxiety Scale (Shear et al., 2001) provides descriptive anchors to guide clinician decision making ratings based on both frequency and severity.</description>

    <description>The Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a 12-item measure that assesses mental and physical health and functioning. It is validated for use with Veterans.

    <description>The Anxiety Control Questionnaire (ACQ) (Rapee et al., 1996) is a 30-item self-report measure assessing one's perceived ability to control anxiety-evoking situations and emotional reactions to these situations. This measure assess aspects of avoidance and was included to examine whether BREATHE has an effect on perceived anxiety control compared with the psychoeducation control condition. This questionnaire asks participants to indicate how typical each statement is of themselves.</description>

    <description>The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) was selected to measure comorbidity. The CIRS-G assesses severity of conditions important to older adults' functional status and well-being, such as arthritis, that are impairing yet not fatal. Raters will examine the severity of 14 medical problem categories. Categories include the severity of present illness and the consideration of past medical history. This construct of comorbidity is being examined as a potential moderator of treatment outcomes in exploratory analyses.</description>
