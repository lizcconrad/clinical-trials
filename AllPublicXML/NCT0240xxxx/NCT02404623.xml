      This trial objective is to assess whether doubling the daily intake of vitamin D improves
      serum vitamin D levels and serves as primary prevention of respiratory infections and asthma
      in premature infants.

      This is a prospective randomized (1:1) double-blinded trial.

      The study population will be randomized into two groups (1:1):

        -  Intervention Group - 800 IU of Vitamin D once daily

        -  Control Group - 400 IU of Vitamin D once daily Patients will be followed up for one year
           after randomization for serum Vitamin D levels and respiratory morbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rational of this trial is that a daily supplementation of a double dose of Vitamin D (800
      IU instead of 400 IU) to late premature infants during the first year of life will result in
      elevated Vitamin D serum levels and in an improvement in respiratory morbidity.

      This randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation is planned to determine the optimal dose
      of daily vitamin D supplementation required to achieve sufficient vitamin D levels in preterm
      infants and to assess whether doubling the daily intake of vitamin D may serve as primary
      prevention of respiratory infections and asthma in premature infants.
