  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological well-being and cognitive function will be measured in patients enrolled on the
      primary study, NCT01790568, a phase 2 trial of vorinostat plus tacrolimus and methotrexate to
      prevent graft versus host disease following unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation. Validated questionnaires will be administered to assess patients' level of
      depression, anxiety, quality of life, perceived cognitive functioning, and sleep quality.
      Cognitive testing will include reliable and valid measures of processing speed, attention,
      executive function, episodic memory, and visual learning and memory. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether these measures are feasible to administer in patients before
      and at early time points after bone marrow transplantation .
