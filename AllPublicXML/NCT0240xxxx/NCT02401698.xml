  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The past 10 years of research in post stroke patients have shown certain types of
      rehabilitation can help neuronal plasticity of the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) can be used to monitor this plasticity by mapping the brain's function (measuring brain
      activity). Recent research suggests that TMS can be used for both prognosis (determining
      future function) and to determine what type of rehabilitation therapy will work best after
      stroke. The purposes of this research study are to: 1) determine changes in cerebellar
      activity after motor cortical stroke 2) compare changes in recovery of motor function with
      changes in cerebellar - motor cortex connections; 3) determine the ability of TMS to
      &quot;predict&quot; functional outcome after stroke. The primary hypotheses are: 1) functional recovery
      will be correlated with TMS changes (as measure of motor threshold (MT), intracortical
      inhibition, cerebellar cerebral inhibition (CBI), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and
      recruitment curves; 2) baseline TMS will predict future functional outcomes.
