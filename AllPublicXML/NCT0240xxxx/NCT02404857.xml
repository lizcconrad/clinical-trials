  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to evaluate the potential of a EEG based BCI (Brain-Computer-Interface) connected
      to a non-invasive pneumatic glove for rehabilitation of hand-movements post-stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain computer interfaces (BCI) encompasses the usage of the brain signals to compensate for
      lost physical function. The current protocol evaluates the therapeutic potential of a EEG
      based driven BCI that is connected to a non-invasive pneumatic glove for rehabilitation of
      hand flexion/extension post-stroke. The system non-invasive, portable and low-cost. The
      utility and usability of the system will be investigated at two levels. First by means of
      questionnaires for patients and therapist and second by means of in depth analysis of the EEG
      signals during intended, imagined and passive driven hand movements in relation to no
      movement at all and the capacity of the BCI to distinguish between these conditions.
