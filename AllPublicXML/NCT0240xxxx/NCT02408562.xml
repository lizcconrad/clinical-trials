    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomised, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and tolerability
      of two 2-weeks cycles of i.c.v. administration of sNN0031 infusion solution to patients with
      PD of moderate severity with persisting on-off symptoms in spite of other PD medications.
