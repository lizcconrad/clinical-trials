  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite being a miracle of modern medicine, solid organ transplant recipients are always at
      risk of rejection, and remain dependent on lifelong immunosuppression. Currently used
      immunosuppressive drugs suppress the potential of immune system and interfere with the
      metabolism of medications. Cellular therapies currently being investigated for this purpose
      require the use of ablative radiotherapy. The investigators are using a less toxic strategy
      by harnessing the immunosuppressive potential of the MSCs in the Kidney Transplant (KTx)
      recipients and studying immunomodulation mediated by these cells in the KTx patients.

      Hypothesis MSCs interfere with signalling of Immune cells like T cells, B cells and Dendritic
      cells which leads to improve graft survival of renal transplant patients.

      Aim To investigate effect of MSCs on immune cell repertoire in a donor specific mediated
      response.

      The investigators aim to collect peripheral blood from 30 patients (10 patients for
      autologous cell infusion and 10 for allogeneic (donor derived cell infusion) at various time
      intervals following MSC therapy. 10 patients serve as controls on standard dose of drugs but
      without MSC infusion. This peripheral blood would be utilized for isolation of mononuclear
      cells and performing various immune assays on these cells in a donor specific response.

      This is an open label type of study having 3 groups of patients: 1st group comprising of
      patients that would undergo allogeneic (donor-derived) mesenchymal stem cell infusion, 2nd
      group that would undergo autologous (patient-derived) mesenchymal stem cells and the third
      group (control group) without any stem cell infusion. All the three groups would have
      standard dose of Immunosuppressive drugs. Initially the investigators want to recruit 10
      patients in each group and would increase the group size if the investigators get promising
      results on the follow up. The investigators plan to follow up the patients upto 1-2 years for
      immune based assays and then continue the follow up for atleast 5 years.
