  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel was reported to have very good outcomes in the
      treatment of foot ulcers in pilot studies and retrospective uncontrolled trials. Therefore, a
      larger randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be useful to determine whether
      platelet-rich plasma is safe and effective for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of RegenKit autologous PRP Gel for the treatment of diabetic
      foot ulcer is a randomized, placebo controlled, blind-assessor study. One hundred and seventy
      four patients will be treated, 87 patients receiving treatment arm and 87 patients receiving
      placebo. The primary endpoint is to evaluate proportion of patients with complete wound
      closure at week 16 when treated with autologous platelet rich plasma gel compared to the
      proportion of control (saline gel) treated patients with complete wound closure at the same
      time-point.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the Investigator, are capable of understanding and
             complying with protocol requirements

          -  Patients or, when applicable, their legal representatives, sign and dates a written
             IFC and/or any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study
             procedure

          -  Patients aged 18 to 95 (inclusive) with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes undergoing therapy
             for glycemic control

          -  Patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) less than or equal to 12%

          -  Patients having ulcers which meet the following criteria:

          -  Ulcer should not be infected as determined by clinical examination

          -  Ulcer duration of 4 weeks or longer

          -  Ulcer area (length x width) of between 1.5 cm2 and 20 cm2

          -  Full-thickness ulcer of Grade 1 or Grade 2 as per Wagner's classification system

          -  Ulcer has undergone recent debridement (2 weeks prior to screening)

          -  Post-debridement ulcer is free of necrotic debris, foreign bodies, sinus tracts,
             tunneling, and undermining and is comprised of healthy vascularized tissue

          -  Patients with Charcot deformity, the wound should be free of acute changes and, in the
             opinion of Investigator, should have undergone appropriate structural consolidation
             (the affected charcot fractures will have been fused together and should be
             sufficiently stable to allow the patient to weight-bear)

          -  Patients having adequate circulation to the foot as documented by either:

               1. Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) between 0.60 and 1.30, or

               2. Patients with falsely elevated ABI values (equal to or greater than 1.30) due to
                  non-compressible ankle vessels:

             i)Toe Brachial Index (TBI) equal to or greater than 0.50 or, ii)TBI is not available
             (toe is absent, wounds are present, or investigative site cannot perform a TBI), a
             Doppler waveform in the posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis arteries at the ankle

          -  Patients having had any revascularization surgery within the 4-week period prior to
             signing the ICF

          -  Patients with renal failure requiring dialysis

          -  Patients with platelet count outside of the normal range of 150-400 x 1000/uL

          -  Patients with a history of allergy to one of tested components

          -  Patients with a history of bleeding disorders

          -  Patients suffering from skin or blood cancers, or having suffered in the past from
             such cancers and not having, certification of a total remission

          -  Patients presenting skin lesions potentially caused by abnormal cellular proliferation
             process (history of being cancerous)

          -  Patients with a history of any condition, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding, giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of the investigational agent or may confound the
             interpretation of study results or might render the patient at high risk for treatment
             complications

          -  Patients with active Charcot or other structural deformity that would prevent adequate
             off-loading of the study foot
