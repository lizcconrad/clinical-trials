        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with a confirmed diagnosis at least 24 weeks prior to Visit 1 and a disease
             onset prior to 30 years of age, consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)
             experiencing primary generalizedtonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures (Type IIE) that are
             classifiable according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)
             Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ILAE, 1981)

          -  Subject has 3 PGTC seizures during the 16-week Combined Baseline (12-week Historical
             Baseline plus 4-week Prospective Baseline)

          -  If a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) scan has been
             performed, there must be no evidence of any progressive abnormality or any lesion
             likely to be associated with partial-onset seizures

          -  Subject has been maintained on a stable dose regimen of 1 to 2 non-benzodiazepine
             marketed Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) OR 1 to 3 AEDs (with 1 AED identified as a
             benzodiazepine) for at least 28 days prior to Visit 1 with or without additional
             concurrent stable Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)

          -  Subjects are required to have had an electroencephalogram (EEG) report consistent with
             IGE (eg, generalized 3Hz epileptiform discharges and a normal EEG background)
             confirmed by a Central Reviewer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of partial onset seizures or EEG findings indicating partial onset seizures

          -  Symptomatic generalized epilepsy, e.g. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome

          -  Lifetime history of suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation in past 6 months

          -  Women of child bearing potential must practice contraception according to protocol
             requirements

          -  Regular use of clozapine, monoamine oxidase (MAO-A) inhibitors, barbiturates (for
             indication other than epilepsy) within 28 days prior to Visit 1

          -  Use of Vigabatrin within the last 6 months
