      This prospective double-blind, randomized, clinical trial, will be conducted at Ain Shams
      University Maternity Hospital.

      Patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will be divided into two groups.

      Group (A):

      181 women will receive three tablets of letrozole (On December 28, 2005, the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration approved letrozole tablets (FemaraÂ®, made by Novartis Pharmaceuticals
      Corp.) as a single dose, each tablet 2.5 mg (total dose 7.5 mg per day) for two days at home
      and will be told to bring back the empty packs. The third dose will be given on admission to
      hospital on day three and will be followed by 400 mcg vaginal misoprostol soaked with saline
      every three hours up to maximum five doses on Day 3.

      Group (B):

      181 women will receive three tablets of placebo (manufactured by Egyptian Group Company for
      drug industries) as a single dose, for two days at home and will be told to bring back the
      empty packs. The third dose will be given on admission to hospital on day three and will be
      followed by 400 mcg vaginal misoprostol soaked with saline every three hours up to maximum
      five doses on Day 3.

      Data recording:

        1. Duration of complete abortion.

        2. Post abortion bleeding.

        3. Incomplete delivery of the placenta necessitates evacuation under anesthesia.

        4. Hemoglobin and hematocrit after 24 hours from abortion to estimate the decrease in
           hemoglobin level.

        5. Recording maternal morbidities.

        6. Patients that will receive 5 doses and did not abort till 24 hours from the first dose
           of misoprostol will be considered failed induction and will stop follow up without
           reporting outcome.
