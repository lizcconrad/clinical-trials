      This is phase II study on the efficacy of octreotide lar as maintenance treatment after
      first-line chemotherapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic gastro-entero-pancreatic
      or esophageal neuroendocrine carcinomas.

      This is a prospective, randomized, open label study on the efficacy of octreotide lar as
      maintenance treatment after first-line chemotherapy for patients with unresectable or
      metastatic gastro-entero-pancreatic or esophageal neuroendocrine carcinomas.The patients with
      unresectable or metastatic GEP or esophageal NEC who got CR/PR/SD after chemotherapy with IP
      or EP regimen qualified with the inclusion criteria are enrolled. All the patients enrolled
      in our study will be randomly assigned to receive octreotide LAR (group A) as maintenance
      treatment or follow up (group B) to disease progression. Treatment will be discontinued on
      withdrawal of patient consent, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, a treatment delay
      of &gt;2 weeks, or major protocol violations, after which patients were followed up every 3
      months for a minimum of 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic diagnosis of high grade (poorly differentiated) gastro-entero-pancreatic
             neuroendocrine carcinoma.

          2. High grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of esophageal or unknown primary site (if a
             pulmonary primary has been excluded)

          3. Metastatic or unresectable disease

          4. Measurable disease

          5. Accepted chemotherapy with EP or IP regimen for no less than three months

          6. Effectiveness with CR/PR/SD

          7. Informed consent

          8. Performance status of 0 or 1

          9. Adequate bone marrow function (defined as absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt;= 1500,
             platelet count [PLT] &gt;= 75,000 and a hemoglobin [Hgb] &gt;= 9).

         10. Adequate hepatic function with a bilirubin of &lt;= 2.0 mg/dl, and aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) &lt;= 2.5 times
             the upper limits of normal, unless caused by liver metastasis. If caused by
             metastasis, then should be SGPT and SGOT &lt;= 5 times the upper limits of normal.

        Adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 mg/dl.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are on EP or IP chemotherapy for less than three months .

          2. Effectiveness with PD.

          3. Patients with brain metastases are not eligible.

             are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the complications of this
             therapy.

          9. Patients with osseous metastasis as only site of disease.

         10. Patients with any concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers or
