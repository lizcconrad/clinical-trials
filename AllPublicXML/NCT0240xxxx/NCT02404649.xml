  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test the clinical outcome of Trabecular Metal™ Dental Implants
      (TMDI) (Zimmer Dental Inc Carlsbad, CA, US) in the Maxillary Sinus region. This project will
      enroll 30 active subjects who will receive two dental implants in the edentulous maxillary
      molar region. This 24-month research study will examine the clinical stability of TMDI in
      both sinus elevation and sinus augmentation environments. The proposed research lays the
      foundation for improved health care by providing surgeons and restorative dentists with data
      for determining the effects TMDI have on clinical success in less than optimal osseous
      environments. The rationale that underlies the investigation is that identification of the
      influences of trabecular surface design on implant stability in varying bone types will allow
      routine, predictable use of early loading, which, in turn, will translate into more rapid,
      economical health care, and improved psychosocial well-being of the patient. If these
      hypotheses are correct, the results are expected to provide evidence based research data to
      support early loading and immediate loading of single implants in sites of adequate bone
      volume, and density with or without the use of graft materials in sinus lift procedures. In
      addition, it is expected that these results will fundamentally advance the field of implant
      dentistry and bioengineering by providing information on the principles of the bone
      density-mechanical environment-implant stability interaction.

      Specific Aims

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      • The objective of this study is to allow a preliminary analysis of the resonance frequency
      values over the 12 month period, which will be the primary outcome

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      • To assess bone maturation, crestal bone level maintenance, and implant survival over two
      years

      Study Arms Bone Augmentation: Placement of two dental implants in Sinus augmented with Puros
      Cortico-Cancellous Particulate Allograft (70% Cortico and 30% Cancelleous) (Zimmer Dental-
      Carlsbad, CA, USA)- one implant will be TMDI (Zimmer Dental- Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the
      second will be Tapered Screw-Vent TSV-MTX (Zimmer Dental- Carlsbad, CA,USA). Implant
      stability will be determined by the initial insertion torque and RFV values at time of
      implant placement and after 1 month of healing on a monthly basis up until 12 months post
      implant placement. Thickness of bone surrounding implant body positioned in the sinus will be
      measured.

      Sinus Elevation only: Placement of two dental implants as mentioned above in sinus augmented
      by sinus elevation procedure, blood clot and CopiOs Pericardium Membrane (Zimmer Dental-
      Carlsbad, CA, USA) only. One implant will be TMDI (Zimmer Dental- Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the
      second will be Tapered Screw-Vent TSV-MTX (Zimmer Dental- Carlsbad, CA,USA). Implant
      stability will be determined by the insertion torque and RFV values at time of implant
      placement and after 1 month of healing on a monthly basis up until 12 months post implant
      placement. Thickness of bone surrounding implant body positioned in the sinus will be
      measured.

    <description>Implant stability quotient (ISQ) is the value on a scale that indicates the level of stability and osseointegration in dental implants. The scale ranges from 1 to 100 and is measured by implant stability meters instruments using resonance frequency analysis (RFA) technique. The acceptable stability range lies between 55-85 ISQ. Lower initial stability will normally increase with time due to the lower mechanical stability being enforced by the bone remodeling process (osseointegration). The overall average ISQ value of all implants over time is approximately 70. A significant decrease in ISQ indicates a potential problem and should be considered an early warning. For each time period three measurements were taken from three different positions on the dental implant and the measurements were averaged for each time period.</description>

        <title>Resonance Frequency Values of Dental Implants</title>
        <description>Implant stability quotient (ISQ) is the value on a scale that indicates the level of stability and osseointegration in dental implants. The scale ranges from 1 to 100 and is measured by implant stability meters instruments using resonance frequency analysis (RFA) technique. The acceptable stability range lies between 55-85 ISQ. Lower initial stability will normally increase with time due to the lower mechanical stability being enforced by the bone remodeling process (osseointegration). The overall average ISQ value of all implants over time is approximately 70. A significant decrease in ISQ indicates a potential problem and should be considered an early warning. For each time period three measurements were taken from three different positions on the dental implant and the measurements were averaged for each time period.</description>

Implant stability will be determined by the initial insertion torque and RFV values at time of implant placement and after 1 month of healing on a monthly basis up until 12 months post implant placement. Thickness of bone surrounding implant body positioned in the sinus will be measured.
