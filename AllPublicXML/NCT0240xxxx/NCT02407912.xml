      To assess the effect and toxicity of intrapleural administration of hypertonic cisplatin for
      malignant pleural effusion in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>

      The lung was fully expanded by a thoracostomy using a chest tube with a double lumen, and
      then the patients were enrolled into the trial.First, premedication including antiemetics and
      hydration were performed. Thereafter, 75 mg of body surface area of cisplatin in 50 ml of
      distilled water was injected through a chest tube.The patients were asked to change position
      (supine and bilateral decubital) from time to time for 30 minutes. The chest tube was clamped
      for 48 h and then the tube was declamped and allowed to drain. When the drainage effusion was
      less than 100 ml a day, the chest tube was removed. Any patient whose drainage effusion
      continued for over 2 weeks was withdrawn from the trial and was also judged to be a
      nonresponder.
