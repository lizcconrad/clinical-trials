    <textblock>
      This is a cohort study where families with infants are followed closely for three years. It
      aims to assess if parental weight status (normal weight vs. overweight/obesity), their
      physical activity and eating habit will influence their young children's growth and be
      helpful in childhood obesity reducing.

      The aimed 300 families are invited with half parents in high risk group (one of the parents
      with BMI&gt;=28 or both 28&gt;BMI&gt;=24) and half in low risk group (both parents with BMI&lt;24 or one
      parent 28&gt;BMI&gt;=24) living in Wuhan City. Maternal and paternal prepregnancy weight and height
      are recruited through the Children Systematic Health Management System before the child's
      first birthday. After getting an oral agreement, a later on family visit will be done by
      trained staffs. The home visit contains anthropometrics measurement, including weight,
      height, head circumference, abdominal circumference for both parents and children and blood
      pressure for parents; it also has some questionnaires that have children's condition during
      the first years, the caring status, parents' characteristic information, the eating, physical
      activity and sleeping habits for both parents and children, children's seven day 24 hours'
      sleeping record in the coming week; at the same time, objectively measured physical activity
      for parents and children will be done for seven days with accelerometers. The annual visit
      will range 15 days before or after the children's birthday, and this will begin from the
      children age one and followed up to aged three.
