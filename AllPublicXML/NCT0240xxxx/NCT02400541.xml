    <textblock>
      The aim of research is to test in a randomized clinical trial with active sessions, the
      efficacy of cognitive remediation therapy in children anorexia nervosa compared to a
      controlled group. The investigators want to confirm the efficacy of cognitive remediation
      treatment in children's flexibility problems.

      In this research, the investigators want to evaluate remediation cognitive therapy in
      anorexia nervosa compared to a controlled group (relaxation) based on different factors that
      testified the cognitive improvement of patients: one week after therapy, six months after and
      one year after.

      Those factors are:

      Weight, perfectionism and food symptomatology, temperament, therapeutic alliance and change
      motivation, clinical evolution of anorexia nervosa, self esteem, executive functions,
      neuropsychological performance (flexibility and central coherence).
