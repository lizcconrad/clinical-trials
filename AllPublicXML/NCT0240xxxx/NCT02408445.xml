  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study in infant males with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) will learn more about
      body composition (muscle and fat) and male hormones and look at the effect of testosterone
      shots on body composition. The Investigators know that older boys and men with Klinefelter
      syndrome often have more fat compared to muscle than adults without Klinefelter syndrome, but
      we do not know if this difference is present at birth or develops over time. The
      Investigators will learn if body composition and motor skills are improved with testosterone
      treatment in infants with Klinefelter syndrome.
