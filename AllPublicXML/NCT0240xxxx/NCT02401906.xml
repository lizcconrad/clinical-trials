  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orbital masses develop at the expense of the orbital structures lacrimal glands, oculomotor
      muscles, optic nerve, meningeal spaces, peripheral nerves, bone wall, orbital fat, lymphoid
      structures or vascular structures. These masses can be tumors, benign or malignant, or
      pseudotumor, mainly represented by specific or non-specific orbital inflammation.

      Pathology is of considerable importance for the diagnosis and the treatment of those masses.
      However, biopsy or surgical resection of the orbital masses is sometimes difficult and
      dangerous outside expert centers.

      The identification of a non-invasive technique for distinguishing tumors from pseudotumors,
      thus avoid in some cases a biopsy, would be a major contribution for the patients.

      The MRI assessment performed routinely in a patient with an orbital mass includes
      morphological sequences T1, T2 fat suppression, T1 injected fat suppression, diffusion. This
      exploration requires, regardless of the performed research, a contrast agent injection (0.1
      mg / kg weight of GadobutrolÂ®).

      In this research protocol, during the injection of the contrast agent performed during the
      MRI assessment performed routinely, a DCE perfusion sequence, which consists of a repeated
      acquisition at short intervals of a volume gradient echo T1, will be added. This acquisition
      will be preceded by two short series for calibration. The post treatment will include
      parametric permeability cards (Ktrans) and plasmatic volume (Vp), evaluating one or more
      regions of interest in the tumor, normal lacrimal glands, jaw muscles and nasal mucosa being
      the reference. It will also be added a magnetic susceptibility EPI sequence type. All the
      qualitative parameters (T1, T2, T1 injected, distribution, low signal intensity in
      susceptibility) and quantitative (Ktrans, Vp, relative intensity enhancement, apparent
      diffusion coefficient) parameters will be collected.

      The result of the pathological exam of the biopsy or of the surgical specimen, which is the
      gold-standard, will be collected.
