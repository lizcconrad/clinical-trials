  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a training program in the use of ambulatory
      assistive devices (such as canes, walkers, etc) can reduce falls and increase functional
      mobility and neural connectivity in people with Multiple Sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 people with Multiple Sclerosis, who routinely use ambulatory assistive devices and have
      fallen at least once in the past year, will be randomized into two groups. One group will
      receive a 6-week training program in the use of their assistive device; the other group will
      be wait-listed, and may choose to receive the training after their participation in the study
      is completed. All participants will receive mobility assessments at baseline, 6-8 weeks
      later, and 3 months after that. All participants will record their falls on falls calendars.
      Participants in the training group will receive MRI scans to assess neural connectivity at
      baseline and after completion of the training program.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether participation in the training program
      reduces falls and increases functional mobility when compared to the wait-listed group, and
      also to determine whether any change in neural connectivity, as assessed by MRI scans, is
      seen in those who participate in the training.

    <description>Subjects randomized to this group will receive a 6 week Assistive Device Training program in the use of their assistive device. They will have mobility assessments taken at baseline, after the training program has been completed, and 3 months later. During this time, their falls will be recorded monthly using prospective falls calendars. Members of this group will also receive MRI scans at baseline and after the completion of the training program.</description>
