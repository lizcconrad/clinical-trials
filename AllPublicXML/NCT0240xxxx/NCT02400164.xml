  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, prospective, open label, uncontrolled feasibility study
      enrolling 30 patients with refractory or recurrent ascites and cirrhosis at up to 6 sites.
      Patients will be enrolled during a 6 month enrollment phase after which data will be
      collected for 12months with an initial analysis after 3 months. Extended follow-up for safety
      monitoring purposes will continue for the lifetime of the patient or until the device is
      explanted.
