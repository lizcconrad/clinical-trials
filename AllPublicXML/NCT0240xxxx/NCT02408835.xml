  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of a negative pressure wound therapy device (PICO™, Smith &amp;
      Nephew Healthcare, UK) on clean, closed surgical wounds, in patients who are undergoing
      inguinal lymphadenectomy for metastatic carcinoma of cutaneous origin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients may develop inguinal lymph node metastases from a variety of cutaneous neoplasms. A
      number of factors conspire to cause a high rate of wound breakdown and other complications in
      this patient group. Reported rates of wound healing complications vary in the literature, but
      tend to affect &gt; 40% of patients.

      A new negative pressure wound therapy device is recommended for use in clean, closed surgical
      wounds (PICO™ system, Smith &amp; Nephew Healthcare, UK). Patients will be randomised to receive
      either PICO™ system for up to seven days, or conventional dressings, and then assessed for
      wound healing and other outcome measures.
