  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HF001 is a prospective observational study utilizing non-invasive medical devices that may be
      able to discriminate changes in heart failure while acutely decompensated patients undergo
      routine interventional therapies in a hospital setting. Subjects will be monitored using
      CVInsight™ [CVI] via a finger and/or forehead sensor, while performing an isometric handgrip
      stress test (IHGST). Changes in the CVI signal will be analyzed and correlated to standard
      assessments of heart failure including pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) pressures, blood
      pressure (BP), patient symptoms, and physical exam findings. The results of this study will
      be used to develop a powered study to determine if a new configuration of non-invasive
      monitoring devices can be used to monitor heart failure status more sensitively than current
      non-invasive techniques.
