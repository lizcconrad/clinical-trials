    <textblock>
      Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. The most studied
      and promising intervention is Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and its variations: Behavioral
      Comprehensive Intervention for Tics (CBIT). Group intervention for children with TS has not
      been evaluated. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of CBIT group intervention
      compared with Psycho-Educational-Supportive group in terms of tic severity.

      Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal
      tics, frequently associated with behavioral and functional problems, impacting significantly
      on children's quality of life . Current evidence supports the contribution of individual
      behavioral treatment for TS both for reducing tics and improving children's quality of life.
      The most studied and promising intervention is Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and its
      variations: Behavioral Comprehensive Intervention for Tics (CBIT). One of the developments of
      behavioral treatments is group interventions, supported in various types of psychological
      difficulties, adding benefit of providing peer support. However, group intervention for
      children with TS has not been empirically evaluated.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of CBIT group intervention. We hypothesize
      that CBIT group intervention will be more effective than Psycho-Educational-Supportive (PES)
      group in terms of tic severity, and that both groups will be effective in quality of life
      measures.

    <description>semi-structured clinical interview carried out with parent and child. Questions relate to tic severity over the previous week. Separate ratings are recorded for motor and phonic tics in terms of their number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference on a 6-point Likert scale. Three composite scores are generated which are total motor tic severity (rated from 0 to 25), total phonic tic severity (rated from 0 to 25) and total tic severity overall (rated from 0 to 50).</description>

    <description>Child group: 8 weekly group sessions lasting 90 mins, additional three monthly booster sessions.
During sessions, children create a tic hierarchy from most to least distressing, with more distressing tics addressed earlier in the treatment. Awareness training and competing response training is implemented and practiced. Competing response training is added, involving engagement in a voluntary behavior physically incompatible with the tic, contingent on the premonitory urge or other signs of impeding tic occurrence. Relaxation training addresses situations that sustained or worsened tics, training focuses on developing individual behavioral strategies to reduce the influence of these factor.
Parallel parent-group sessions simultaneously run during first 4 sessions of child-group. parents-group includes psycho-education and use of reward strategies.
Meetings executed by two trained clinicians.</description>

    <description>Child group: 8 weekly group sessions lasting 90 mins each, as well as additional three monthly booster sessions afterwards.
During the educational group sessions, each session will focus on educating the participants in regard to a specific subject: Tourette syndrome, Self-esteem, Anger, OCD (obssesive compulsive disorder), School and bullying, Anxiety, Attention, and a final session Quiz.
Parent group: Parent-group sessions will simultaneously run during the first 4 sessions of the child-group. The parents-group will include psycho-education and the use of reward strategies.
All group meetings will be executed and managed by two trained clinicians.</description>
