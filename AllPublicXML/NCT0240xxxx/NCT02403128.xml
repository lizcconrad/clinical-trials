    <textblock>
      Phase 1, non-randomized, open label, noncomparative trial to study the effect of intravitreal
      injection of aflibercept on eyes with symptomatic macular edema from retinal artery
      macroaneurysms.

      Baseline evaluation will consist of measurement of best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity,
      complete eye exam, including IOP measurement, color photos and intravenous fluorescein
      angiography, spectral domain OCT and vitals. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be
      treated with an intravitreal injection of 2.0 mg aflibercept under usual aseptic precautions.
      Follow up visits will be on Day 7, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180. At each follow-up visit,
      best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity, IOP measurement and central foveal thickness (CFT) by
      SDOCT will be obtained. Color photos and IVFA will be performed at month 3 and 6 visits.

      Retreatment shall be performed no sooner than two months after previous injection for one or
      more the following criteria 1. CFT &gt;310 microns 2. Intraretinal or subretinal fluid on SDOCT
      3. Increase in CFT by 50 or more microns from the lowest value observed after intravitreal
      aflibercept injection 4. Decrease in vision by 5 or more letters frpm the previous visit
      associated with OCT evidence of macular edema. 5. Appearance of new hemorrhage on color
      photographs.

      Final follow-up will be at six months. Data collected will include, change in ETDRS visual
      acuity from the baseline, change in CFT, number of injections, number of eyes completely dry
      by SDOCT, and number of eyes with a thrombosed RAM by IVFA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic macular edema caused by RAM in one of the eyes. If both eyes are involved,
             the eye with worse central foveal thickness will be enrolled in the study.

          2. CFT of 310 microns or more by spectral domain OCT or lipid in the center of the fovea

          3. Best-corrected visual acuity of 73 to 24 letters.

          4. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures.

          5. Willing to provide informed consent -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Media opacity

          2. pre-retinal fibrosis, retinal detachment, vitreo-macular traction
