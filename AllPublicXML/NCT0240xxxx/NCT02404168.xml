      The prior BEEP study involved patients being switched between brand and generic in a very
      structured manner. Other secondary comparisons were also made (i.e. any differences in
      adverse effects and seizure control). Some subjects were more disparate than other, in terms
      of generic being similar to brand. In this follow up study, BEEP subjects that showed
      disparate results will be tested again to assess reproducibility of disparate results.

      This is an double-blind, multiple-dose, full replicate design, pharmacokinetic study of
      lamotrigine in &quot;enriched&quot; patients with epilepsy who previously participated in HP-00048923.
      LAMICTAL 100mg tablets and the most commonly used generic lamotrigine 100mg tablet (from
      Teva) will be compared pharmacokinetically.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is able to provide informed consent and was enrolled in previous BEEP study.

          -  Subject is male or female between 18 and 76 years of age inclusive.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of epilepsy with simple partial seizures and/or complex
             partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization or primary generalized
             seizures

          -  Subject has been maintained on a stable dose regimen of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs),
             including lamotrigine at 200mg, 400mg, or 600mg total daily dosage divided BID for at
             least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 and during the screening period

          -  Subject is willing to be switched between brand and generic lamotrigine

          -  Subject is an acceptable candidate for venipuncture

          -  Subject is willing to stop all OTC medications for 24 hours prior to and during 12
             hour study visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

             trial of an investigational drug or experimental device
