    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a motor disorder that can affect the lower limbs in up to 75% patients with
      cerebral palsy, having a significantly effect on their mobility and quality of life. There is
      much controversy about what is the most appropriate treatment of spasticity The objective of
      the present study is to evaluate the effects of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy
      (rESWT) compared to treatment with botulinum toxin to improve spasticity in patients with
      cerebral palsy

      The number needed of patients is 70 (35 per group). Leaving a period of washout between one
      therapy and the other

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome will be to measure spasticity with passive range of motion of the foot
      (pROM) by muscular extensibility and its traction reflex using goniometryIt will be assessed
      at baseline before the treatment, as well as after 3 weeks, 2 months, 3 months, after the
      washout period (3months), 3 months and 3 weeks, 5 months and 6 months, when the end the
      intervention.

      Secondary outcome includes: 1) Pain will be assessed with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) after the
      first application of each therapy. 2) Ascertain if the type of Gross Motor Functional
      Classification System (GMFCS) has an influence on the improvement of these two treatments; 3)
      Assess whether infiltration of Botulinum Toxin in other muscle groups have influence on the
      results of study; and 4) Undergo a qualitative registration to know the perception and
      experience that patient/family will have during this study, through a satisfaction
      questionnaire.

    <description>A comparative study with patients with spasticity in gastrocnemius and soleus where a group start having shockwave treatment and receive three sessions at weekly intervals, gastrocnemius and soleus applied in 2000 impacts at a frequency of 8hz and energy intensity is proposed between 2.2-2.4 Bars (0,10-0,12mj ). Swiss dolor clast EMS. The other group will receive botulinum toxin Type A in the same muscles. The dose of toxin is in accordance with the weight of each patient, the dose normally used with each user and always with the same brand is always respected, Botox (4-8-12 U/Kg) Patients will be assessed before treatment, after three weeks, two months and three months after three months when the groups exchange the therapy.</description>
