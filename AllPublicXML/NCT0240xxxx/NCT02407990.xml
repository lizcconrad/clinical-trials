        Inclusion Criteria:

             tumor for which no effective standard therapy is available.

               1. For Phase 1A: no specific restriction

               2. For Phase 1B: histology specified below

             excluded) ii. ovarian cancer iii. gastric cancer iv. HCC (Barcelona-Clinic Liver
             Cancer stage C, stage B not amenable to locoregional therapy or refractory to
             locoregional therapy, and not amenable to a curative treatment approach, and
             Child-Pugh A) v. HNSCC vi. esophageal carcinoma vii. TNBC viii. cholangiocarcinoma ix.
             RCC, bladder cancer, melanoma, Merkel-cell carcinoma, sarcoma, GIST, or cuSCC. Or any
             other solid tumors with known MSI-H or dMMR status, such as CRC or pancreatic cancer

          2. Subjects with previously treated brain metastasis (es) that is asymptomatic or
             radiographically/clinically stable and not requiring steroids medications for 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment are permitted.

          3. Subjects must have archival tumor tissues or agree to a tumor biopsy for analysis of
             predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1. (Fresh tumor biopsies are strongly recommended at
             baseline for biomarker analysis in subjects with readily accessible tumor lesions and
             who consent to the biopsies.)

          4. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1.

          5. Male or female and ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1.

          7. Subjects must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory
             values.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mL

               -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN

               -  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs.

          2. Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for tumor for which a

             apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder
             cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast.

          3. Prior therapies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1.

          4. Subjects who fail to meet enrollment criteria for other PD-1 or PD-L1 trials solely

             excluded.

          6. Subjects should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration.

          7. Has history of interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis except for
             those induced by radiation therapies..

          8. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus;

          9. Active infection requiring therapy, positive tests for Hepatitis B surface antigen or
             Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) except in patients with HCC, who meet the following
             criteria:

               -  HBV viral load (VL) &lt;200 IU/mL (approximately 1000 cps/mL)

               -  Subjects with active HBV infection need to be on anti-HBV suppression ≥3 months,
                  throughout treatment and for 6 months after

               -  Subjects HCV-positive after successful treatment (defined as sustained virologic
                  response [SVR] 12 or SVR 24) are allowed as long as 4 weeks have passed between
                  completion of HCV therapy and start of study drug

         10. Use of any vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g., influenza, varicella, etc.)
             within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of study therapy and 60 days after the last
             administration of the study medication.
