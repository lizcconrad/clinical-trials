    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the specific effect that 3D game play has on the control of the
      eyes horizontal movements. It will examine the youngest group of consumers this technology is
      marketed to, 7 to 11-year-olds and no children under 7 years of age will be recruited to this
      study as per Nintendo's hardware guidelines, which recommends that children under 7 years of
      age not play in 3D mode. It will examine the effect of playing in 3D for 30 minutes on
      horizontal fusional amplitudes compared with a control group playing in 2D for 30 minutes.

      This study will be a prospective blind randomised control trial. The participants will be
      randomised into one study group, with participants playing a game in 3D; and a control group,
      with participants playing the same game in 2D. The study is blind due to the use of an
      independent assessor, reducing testing bias by ensuring that the tester does not know the
      randomisation results. The known dependant variables are the total horizontal fusional
      amplitudes at 1/3m and 6m and the independent variable is the use of 2D or 3D game play.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female 7 to 11-year-olds with no prior history of binocular vision / ocular
             motility dysfunction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Corrected visual acuity of less than 0.000 tested with SLT at 3m.

               -  Interocular visual acuity difference of 0.100 (tested with SLT) or greater, which
                  could indicate the presence of Amblyopia.

               -  The presence of any manifest deviation (Tropia).

               -  Presence of any ocular motility dysfunction, which affects primary position.

               -  Reduced binocular convergence of 10 centimetres or less.

               -  Stereoacuity of less than 170&quot; (this may indicate the presence of a microtropia
                  or other undiagnosed pathology).

               -  Any prior or existing medical history of epilepsy or seizures.

               -  Any prior or existing medical history of repetitive strain injury.
