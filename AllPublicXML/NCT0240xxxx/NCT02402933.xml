    <textblock>
      Up to fifty (50) children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) aged 4 to ˂18 years at
      time of enrolment will be selected for inclusion in the study. The target is to obtain
      treatment response and user-experience data following use of AMG504-1 (LY900018) in treating
      episodes of hypoglycemia.

      This study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of nasal glucagon (NG) administered under
      clinical use conditions in treating episodes of hypoglycemia in persons with T1D.

      This study also aims to assess the ease with which caregivers can administer the experimental
      medication in treatment of hypoglycemic events.

    <measure>Number of Participants Awakening or Returning to a Normal Status Within 30 Minutes Following Studied Drug of Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 minutes after each drug administration for an episode of hypoglycemia</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with effectiveness of nasal glucagon administered under clinical use in treating episodes of hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), as defined by clinical recovery following studied drug administration. Responses to questions completed by the caregiver are used to assess this outcome.
An episode of severe hypoglycemia is generally defined as an event associated with severe neuroglycopenia usually resulting in coma or seizure and requiring parenteral therapy (glucagon or intravenous glucose) administered by a third party. In this study moderate hypoglycemia is defined as an episode wherein the child/adolescent with diabetes has symptoms and/or signs of neuroglycopenia and has a blood glucose ≤3.9 millimole per liter (mmol/L) (70 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]) based on a blood sample taken at or close to the time of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Ease-of-use of Dry-Mist Nasal Glucagon by Completion of Questionnaires by the Caregiver</measure>
    <time_frame>After each drug administration for an episode of hypoglycemia</time_frame>
    <description>Assess ease-of-use of intranasally administered glucagon in the hands of caregivers of participants who may be called upon to treat episodes of hypoglycemia.
Measurement for Degree of difficulty: opening the kit, Degree of difficulty: understanding the instructions on how to use the kit, Degree of difficulty: administering the medication into the nostril, Degree of satisfaction is 1 (Very Difficult) to 7 (Very Easy). Measurement for Dry Mist Nasal Glucagon will be easy to teach other caregivers, Nasal formulation of glucagon is less intimidating for caregivers, Dry Mist Nasal Glucagon is easy to carry and would be willing to carry it, Intranasal delivery of glucagon is preferable: level of agreement 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Awakening or Returning to a Normal Status Within 30 Minutes Following Studied Drug of Administration</title>
        <description>Number of participants with effectiveness of nasal glucagon administered under clinical use in treating episodes of hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), as defined by clinical recovery following studied drug administration. Responses to questions completed by the caregiver are used to assess this outcome.
An episode of severe hypoglycemia is generally defined as an event associated with severe neuroglycopenia usually resulting in coma or seizure and requiring parenteral therapy (glucagon or intravenous glucose) administered by a third party. In this study moderate hypoglycemia is defined as an episode wherein the child/adolescent with diabetes has symptoms and/or signs of neuroglycopenia and has a blood glucose ≤3.9 millimole per liter (mmol/L) (70 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]) based on a blood sample taken at or close to the time of treatment.</description>

Proportions based on the total number of participants who had available hypoglycemic events (N=33).

Measurement for Degree of difficulty: opening the kit, Degree of difficulty: understanding the instructions on how to use the kit, Degree of difficulty: administering the medication into the nostril, Degree of satisfaction is 1 (Very Difficult) to 7 (Very Easy). Measurement for Dry Mist Nasal Glucagon will be easy to teach other caregivers, Nasal formulation of glucagon is less intimidating for caregivers, Dry Mist Nasal Glucagon is easy to carry and would be willing to carry it, Intranasal delivery of glucagon is preferable: level of agreement 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).</description>
