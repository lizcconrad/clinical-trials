      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a term used to describe a number of lung
      conditions characterised by irreversible damage to the airways causing airflow obstruction.
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a broad programme that helps improve the health and
      well-being of people with breathing difficulties, most commonly COPD. Participation in PR
      leads to improvements in exercise tolerance and functional ability, as well as a reducing
      breathlessness in everyday activities. It is traditionally an outpatient programme based in a
      hospital or community setting run by a multidisciplinary team, and usually lead by
      physiotherapy and nursing staff. Typically it includes a physical exercise programme, and
      advice and education on managing a chronic lung condition. The purpose of this pilot study is
      to compare a six week web-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme with traditional
      hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation classes for people affected by COPD.

    <description>Participants will undertake web-based PR twice/week for 6 weeks in their own home. They will be given individual log-in details to access the website with access to exercises and education pages. Participants will be provided with a standardised exercise programme at the start of the study. The level of intensity of exercises will be progressed as appropriate on an individual basis for all participants in the group. Participant log-ins and diaries will be monitored remotely and participants will be telephone at weeks 2 and 4 by their physiotherapist to discuss their progress and, at this time, exercises may be progressed by changing the level of difficulty/intensity. This is done remotely by physiotherapy staff.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to this group will undertake hospital-based PR twice per week for 6 weeks in. Participants attend PR classes and complete a circuit based exercise class. The level of intensity of exercises will be progressed as appropriate on an individual basis for all participants in the group. Following each class they will receive educational information about their condition.</description>
