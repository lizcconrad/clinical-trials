  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique that is emerging as a
      prospective therapy for neurologic, psychiatric and addictive disorders. Specifically, anodal
      tDCS applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with improvement
      of cognitive functions and mood. Despite an increased use in clinical settings, tDCS suffers
      from limitations, especially regarding the strength and the duration of therapeutic effects.
      Strategies to optimize the conditions for tDCS application suffer from the lack of knowledge
      about its neurophysiological impact. Moreover, tDCS is increasingly used in private settings
      through commercial apparatus and tutorials to make a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; device delivering tDCS
      now available on the Internet. This private use worries neuroscientists and health
      authorities. Even if the general impression is that, in controlled conditions, tDCS is safe
      with only mild and transient adverse effects, whether and how tDCS could be used for
      enhancing cognition in healthy subjects are needed to investigate in more detail. The
      investigators believe that a better understanding of some neurobiological effects of tDCS is
      crucial to further tailor tDCS for experimental and therapeutic applications and to define
      recommendations for a private use.

      As the cortex is densely connected with basal ganglia areas, including dopaminergic areas,
      tDCS is probably not only capable to target cortical but also subcortical structures remote
      from the stimulation sites. Some studies suggest that cortical stimulation by other
      approaches, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to an increased
      dopaminergic transmission. The involvement of dopaminergic systems in tDCS effects has been
      investigated only indirectly in pharmacological studies. Thus, the direct effect of the DLPFC
      stimulation by tDCS on dopaminergic transmission is still unknown.

      The aim of this project is to reveal the online impact of a single-session of tDCS applied
      bilaterally over the DLPFC in healthy subjects on the dopaminergic transmission measured by
      PET, combined with the [11C]raclopride bolus-plus-continuous-infusion method.
