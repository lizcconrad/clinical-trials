  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect on-label safety and efficacy data where InQu Bone
      Graft Extender is applied to transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and posterior
      lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF).

      It is expected that this study will contribute to the compilation of clinical data required
      to demonstrate the ability of InQu to promote safe, effective and timely spine fusion in
      patients who undergo PLIF or TLIF surgery. The results of this study will lead to further
      analysis (i.e. comparison to historical data of other marketed bone graft products, as well
      as, to local bone alone).

      The purpose of this study is to collect on-label safety and efficacy data where InQu Bone
      Graft Extender is applied to transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and posterior
      lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) at multiple clinical sites.

      Adverse events, time to fusion and Patient Reported Outcomes(PROs) will be recorded through
      12 months follow-up.

        The study population will include patients who have given consent for and who undergo
        standard-of-care single level transforaminal or posterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery
        in which InQu Bone Graft Extender is used on-label.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject may be included if s/he meets the following criteria:

               1. ≥18 years of age;

               2. Able to give appropriate informed consent;

               3. Willing and able to meet the proposed follow-up schedule;

               4. Has documented diagnosis of up to, and including, Grade 1 spondylolisthesis
                  and/or degenerative disc disease;

               5. Has given appropriate consent for, and undergoes, standard-of-care transforminal
                  or posterior lumber interbody fusion;

               6. Use of InQu Bone Graft Extender on-label.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior lumbar fusion surgery;

          2. Requires fusion surgery of more than two adjacent levels;

          3. Has fusion surgery requiring titanium cages;

          4. Has a systemic infection or has infection at the site of surgery;

          5. Has a medical condition or requires post-operative medication that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may interfere with bony/soft tissue healing;

          6. Has any physical, social, psychological or economic condition that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may preclude accurate data collection or evaluation.
