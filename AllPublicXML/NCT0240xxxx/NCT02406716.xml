      This study hypothesis is that Semaphorins 3A and 4D levels are overexpressed in patients with
      heart failure. Study protocol:

      Hospitallized patients with new onset or previously diagnosed heart failure will be recruited
      to the study. Control group will include healthy people with no medical records or chronic
      treatment at the same age range. After signing an informed constent form, full medical
      history and blood samples will be collected. A second blood sample will be collected 8 weeks
      later, assuming the patient was discharged and not hospitalized since than. The blood samples
      will be analyzed by Bnai Zion Medical Center Immunology labs for the above semaphorins levels
      in the heart failure group and control group. Statistical analysis will then commence for
      possible correlatoion with different clinical parameters.

      In few previous published studies, Semaphorins 3A levels are overexpressed in patients with
      heart failure. The aim of our study is the compare semaphorin 3A and 4D in patients with
      acute decompansated heart failure with healthy donors. Second aim is to compare semaphorin
      level in the same patients in time of hospitalization and few weeks later when the heart
      failure presumingly controled. Statistical analysis will then commense for possible
      correlatoion with different clinical parameters like NYHA (new york heart association) status
      of the patient, lenghts of hospitalization and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels at time
      of admition.
