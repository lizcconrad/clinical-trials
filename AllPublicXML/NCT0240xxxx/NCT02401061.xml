  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical and clinical evaluations show that PRTX- 100 has biological activity that may
      lead to improved platelet levels where these are decreased due to immunological pathologies
      and that PRTX-100 has an acceptable safety profile. In vivo treatment with PRTX-100 has been
      shown to raise platelet counts in a mouse model of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The primary
      objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of PRTX-100 in terms of platelet response in
      patients with chronic/persistent ITP.

Intervention levels range from one (1) to 24 micrograms of PRTX-100 per kilogram of patient weight. Patients may receive up to four weekly infusions of PRTX-100 over the study treatment period. PRTX-100 doses ≤ 500 μg will be infused intravenously over 30 minutes. PRTX-100 doses &gt; 500 μg will be infused over 60 minutes. Patients will remain under observation for 4 hours after completion of PRTX-100 dosing for safety management.</description>
