      This will be a single centre, Phase I, open-label, one cohort, one dose level,
      fixed-sequence, drug interaction study in healthy volunteers. The objective of this study is
      to determine the effects of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of ataluren under fasting
      conditions.

    <textblock>
      A total of 15 healthy, adult, male non-smokers, were included in this study. Subjects were
      administered ataluren on Day 1 followed by rifampin from Days 3 to12, and again ataluren on
      Day 11. On Day 11, ataluren was administered before rifampin administration.

      Prior to entering the trial, subjects had a screening visit to establish eligibility within
      28 days before study drug administration. Subjects were confined from at least10 hours before
      the first ataluren dosing on Day 1 until approximately 50 hours postdose(Day 3). Thereafter,
      subjects came back every morning from Days 4 to 10 for rifampin dosing. Then, subjects
      reported to the clinical site at least 10 hours before ataluren dosing on Day 11 (evening of
      Day 10) and remained in the clinical site until after 50 hours post-Day 11 ataluren dose (Day
      13).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male, non-smoker (no use of tobacco products within two years prior to screening), ≥18
             and ≤55 years of age, with Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;20.0 and &lt;30.0 kg/m2 and body weight
             ≥50.0 kg.

          2. Healthy as defined by:

               1. the absence of clinically significant illness and surgery within four weeks prior
                  to dosing. Subjects vomiting within 24 hours pre-first dose of ataluren will be
                  carefully evaluated for upcoming illness/disease. Inclusion pre-dosing is at the
                  discretion of the QI;

               2. the absence of clinically significant history of neurological, endocrinal,
                  cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, immunologic, psychiatric,
                  gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and metabolic disease;

               3. the absence of any known nonsense mutation-mediated disease including Duchenne
                  Muscular Dystrophy.

                  with the exception of the occasional use of acetaminophen (up to 2 g daily);

               3. a depot injection or an implant of any drug within three months prior to the
