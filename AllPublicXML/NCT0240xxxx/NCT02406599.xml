      The study objective is to determine the MarginProbe® System's diagnostic accuracy at the
      margin level and impact on Positive Margin* Presence originating from the Main ex-vivo
      lumpectomy specimen after the initial lumpectomy surgery.

      *A positive margin is defined in this study as a margin microscopically measured and reported
      in the histology report to have cancer within 1 mm or less of the inked surface

      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (1:1), double arm, controlled study, in which
      subjects undergoing breast excision (lumpectomy) for carcinoma of the breast will be
      randomized to either standard of care with additional inspection ('SOC + Additional
      inspection' arm) or standard of care with MarginProbe as an adjunct ('SOC + Device' arm).

      The MarginProbe is an adjunctive diagnostic tool for identification of cancerous tissue at
      the margins (≤ 1mm) of the main ex-vivo lumpectomy specimen following primary excision. It
      will be used by the surgeon during lumpectomy procedures only in patients randomized to the
      &quot;Device+SOC&quot; arm.

      Randomization will take place following the excision of the main ex-vivo lumpectomy specimen.
