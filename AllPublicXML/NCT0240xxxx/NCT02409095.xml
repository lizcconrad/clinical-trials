    <textblock>
      This is a study planned to determine and compare immunogenicity and reactogenicity of
      DTP-HB-Hib vaccine of SIIL delivered either with disposable-Syringe Jet Injector (DSJI) or
      disposable-syringe needle in total 340 Indian infants aged 6 to 8 weeks at the time of
      enrollment.

      It will provide information to aid managers, device regulatory control officials,
      immunization programs, and clinicians who make decisions on safe clinical practice standards.

      This is a randomized, observer blind, non-inferior, parallel group, multi-centre clinical
      study to determine and compare immunogenicity and reactogenicity of DTP-HB-Hib vaccine of
      Serum Institute of India Ltd. delivered either with disposable-Syringe Jet Injector (DSJI) or
      disposable-syringe needle in total 340 Indian infants. Sera samples will be analyzed by ELISA
      for seroconversion / seropositivity for each individual component of vaccine i.e. Diphtheria,
      Tetanus, Pertussis, Hepatitis B (HBsAg) and Hemophilus Influenza B at 28 days after
      administration of a third dose of the vaccine.

         10. History of febrile illness at the time of inclusion is a temporary exclusion
             criterion.

         11. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, endocrine, autoimmune,
             cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by
             medical history, and physical examination tests, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, might interfere with the study objectives

         12. Infant with any other condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator would
             jeopardize the safety or rights of the infant participating in the study or making it
             unlikely the subject could complete the protocol
