    <textblock>
      Pilot study on safety, tolerability and clinical performance/randomized double-blind
      active-controlled pilot-study. Patients are being recruited from patients of the Tinnitus
      Center of Regensburg and groupwise randomized. Control groups are being treated with hearing
      aids without notch-filter. Patients and raters are blinded, only the coworker, who is
      programming the hearing aids, is informed about the group assigned.

      A Hearing aid with notched amplification filters frequencies in a specific manner, depending
      on the individual tinnitus frequency. Through this special filtering the neuronal functional
      changes of the auditory cortex are supposed to be affected therapeutically.
