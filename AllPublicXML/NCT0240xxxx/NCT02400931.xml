  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mask ventilation is a necessary procedure to provide oxygenation before the tracheal
      intubation although the gastric insufflation occurs during the mask ventilation. Sugammadex,
      which is recently introduced, enables the use of high-dose muscle relaxant without concerning
      the delayed recovery of neuromuscular blockade. It seems that there is no need to perform the
      mask ventilation in adults with normal airway if the investigators use high-dose muscle
      relaxant for the anesthetic induction because adequate muscle relaxation can be achieved
      within 1-2 minutes. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that routine mask ventilation
      is not needed in adult patients with normal airway. The investigators will compare the
      incidence of desaturation and gastric insufflation between the patients with mask ventilation
      and the patients without mask ventilation.

    <description>In mask ventilation group, rocuronium of 0.6 mg/kg will be administered after the loss of consciousness. Mask ventilation wil be performed until there is no response on the train-of-four stimulus. No mask ventilation - In no mask ventilation group, rocuronium of 1.2 mg/kg will be administered after the loss of consciousness. Tracheal intubation will be performed after confirmation of no response on the train-of-four stimulus. The mask ventilation will not be performed before the tracheal intubation.</description>
