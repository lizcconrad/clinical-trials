      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal (IVT)
      administration of DE-120 in subjects with treatment-naive active subfoveal choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

             study eye

          -  No evidence of subfoveal fibrosis or subfoveal RPE atrophy in the study eye

          -  At least one lesion in the study eye that meets minimal pathology criteria

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 70 to 25 ETDRS letters in the study eye

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 20/320 or better in the fellow eye

          -  Reasonably clear media and some fixation in the study eye

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma despite anti-glaucoma therapy in the study eye

          -  Evidence of any ocular disease other than AMD in the study eye that may confound the
             outcome of the study

          -  History of vitrectomy in the study eye

          -  Need for ocular surgery in the study eye during the course of the trial

          -  Presence or history of certain ocular or periocular pathology or conditions that could
