    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial with two parallel arms. A total of 60 patients will be
      randomly allocated into the plum-blossom needle group (n=30) and the habit reversal training
      (HRT) group (n=30). 12-week treatment will be given to all patients of each group, follow-up
      will be made at the 12th week after treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the mean
      change from baseline in the total tic score on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) at
      the 12th week. Secondary outcome measures will include the mean changes in score of YGTSS, TS
      Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and the Children and Adolescents' Quality of Life
      Scale from baseline at other time. Safety will also be evaluated.

    <description>Patients randomized into this group will receive plum-blossom needle as treatment. DU 20, DU 16, GB 20, EX-HN5, BL 15, BL 18, BL 23 will be selected as acupoints. Each point will be tapped gently one by one by plum blossom needle until the skin get slightly redness. The treatments will be given two sessions per week, consistently for 12weeks (24 sessions in all).</description>

    <description>Patients randomized into this group will receive habit reversal training (HRT) as treatment. Habit reversal training will consist of the following 4 parts: (1) self-monitoring, (2) competing responses, (3) relaxation training and (4) contingency management. The training will be given weekly in the 12 weeks (totally 12 sessions) by a special rehabilitation therapist, first two sessions 1.5 h, and remaining sessions 1 h for each treatment.</description>

    <description>Plum-blossom needle is a method of shallow insertion with multiple needles. It is made of five or seven stainless steel needles arranged in a pattern like the shape of plum blossom, thus named as 'plum-blossom needle'. Plum-blossom needle treat diseases by tapping specific skin areas or acupoints according to different illness based on the theory of meridian.</description>
