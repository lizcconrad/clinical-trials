      Assess the impact in body composition and handgrip strength of the nocturne supplementation
      by a month with BCAA (Enterex hepatic in patients awaiting liver transplantation)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trial study was make, data were obtained from people awaiting liver transplantation
      and with at least a criteria of protein/energy malnutrition (fase angle &lt; 5.4°, subjective
      global assessment B or C and/or handgrip strength &lt; 30 in men and &lt; 20 in women). The
      investigators make them body composition assessment (weight, height, body mass index [BMI],
      mean arm circumference [MAC], muscle arm area [MAA], tricipital skinfold, Dual X ray
      absorptiometry [fat mass and fat free mass]) and handgrip strength at beginning and after 30
      days of nocturne supplementation with BCAA and standardized diet (35-40 Kcal, 55%
      carbohydrates, 25% lipids and 20% proteins).
