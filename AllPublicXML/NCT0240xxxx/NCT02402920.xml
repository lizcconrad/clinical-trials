  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      pembrolizumab (also called MK-3475) and radiation therapy (either with chemotherapy or alone)
      that can be given to patients with SCLC.

      This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and
      commercially available methods for local control of metastatic and primary tumors.
      Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of unresectable or
      metastatic melanoma. It use in this study is investigational.

      Up to 80 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a part
      and study group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of 3 participants each will
      be enrolled in Part A and up to 80 participants will be enrolled in Part B.

      If you are enrolled in Part A or B, the dose of pembrolizumab you receive will depend on when
      you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of
      pembrolizumab. Each new group will receive a higher dose of pembrolizumab than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest
      tolerable dose of pembrolizumab is found. All participants will receive pembrolizumab during
      radiation therapy. The radiation will be to the chest area. In addition to pembrolizumab,
      participants in Part A will also receive either cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin and
      etoposide.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle.

      If you are in Group A, on Day 1 of Cycles 1-32, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over
      30 minutes. In addition, on Day 1 of Cycles 1-4, you will receive cisplatin by vein over
      about 2 hours and etoposide by vein over 4 hours on Days 1, 2, and 3. If you are unable to
      tolerate cisplatin, you will receive carboplatin by vein over 30 minutes and etoposide by
      vein over 4 hours on Days 1, 2, and 3.

      Study Visits:

      When you are not receiving radiation, you will have these every 3 weeks.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) may be drawn for routine tests.

      Follow Up:

      Every 12 weeks after your last dose of pembrolizumab, you will have CT or PET scans to check
      the status of the disease. You will also have PFTs performed. If you are unable to make these
      visits, you will be contacted by phone to check your health.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 32 doses. You will no longer be able to take
      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         13. Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1),
             anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 2
             (PD-L2), anti-CD137

         14. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies)

         15. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or
             Hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] [qualitative] is
