    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a common, infectious, bacterial disease that is spread when an infected
      person transmits their saliva through the air by coughing or sneezing. Despite the
      availability and effectiveness of affordable six-month treatments for tuberculosis (TB), the
      worldwide control of this disease is currently being impacted by the emergence of multidrug
      resistant TB (MDR-TB).

      MDR-TB refers to TB that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. These are the two
      most powerful first-line drugs used to treat pulmonary TB. MDR-TB usually develops while a
      person is taking TB treatment due to either inappropriate treatment or failure of patients to
      comply with their treatment. This strain of drug-resistant bacteria can also be spread to
      other people through the air.

      MDR-TB leads to a considerable reduction in the effectiveness of standard short-length
      treatments and currently the standard treatments for MDR-TB can last as long as 24 months.
      With the incident rate of MDR-TB on the rise (511,000 new cases in 2007) and the lengthy
      duration of current treatments there is a need to investigate whether a shorter-length
      treatment using effective drugs is a global possibility.

      Three short course regimens of drugs will be evaluated alongside the World Health
      Organisation recommended 24 month regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB.

      A total of at least 1155 participants with MDR-TB will be recruited and followed for a total
      of 132 weeks.

      The STREAM study is an international, multi-centre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised,
      controlled trial in patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) including
      patients with rifampicin-resistant and isoniazid-sensitive TB.

      Background and Rationale:

      The current recommended treatment approach for MDR-TB is based largely on expert opinion and
      there is a lack of good evidence on optimal management. The World Health Organisation (WHO)
      guidelines for the treatment for MDR-TB recommends an intensive phase of treatment based on
      at least four drugs known to be effective and given for a minimum of 20 months. However,
      evaluation of the treatment success of such regimens in 9 countries varied from 25% to 73%.
      Van Deun et al (2010) reported excellent long-term outcomes in a cohort of over 200 patients
      in Bangladesh with MDR-TB who were treated with a regimen given for only nine months.

      Bedaquiline is a novel diarylquinoline antibiotic with bactericidal activity. In a phase II
      trial of patients with MDR-TB time to culture conversion was significantly less in patients
      receiving bedaquiline compared to those receiving an optimised background regimen only
      (Diacon et al (2012). In December 2012 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
      bedaquiline as part of the treatment regimen for MDR-TB when other agents are unavailable.

      Study treatments

      The treatments that are evaluated within the STREAM trial stage 2 are:

      Regimen A The locally-used World Health Organization (WHO) approved MDR-TB regimen.

      Regimen B Regimen B is based on the regimen described by Van Deun et al (2010) which reported
      excellent long-term outcomes in a cohort of over 200 patients in Bangladesh with MDR-TB who
      were treated with a regimen given for only nine months. In STREAM regimen B consists of
      clofazimine, ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide given for 40 weeks, supplemented by
      isoniazid, kanamycin, and prothionamide in the first 16 weeks (intensive phase).

      Regimen C Regimen C is a 40-week all-oral regimen consisting of bedaquiline, clofazimine,
      ethambutol, levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide given for 40 weeks supplemented by isoniazid and
      prothionamide for the first 16 weeks (intensive phase).

      Regimen D Regimen D is a 28-week regimen consisting of bedaquiline, clofazimine,
      levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide given for 28 weeks supplemented by isoniazid and kanamycin for
      the first 8 weeks (intensive phase).

      The primary objectives of the STREAM2 trial are:

        1. To assess whether the proportion of patients with a favourable efficacy outcome on
           Regimen C, the fully oral regimen, is superior to that on Regimen B, the control regimen
           for Stage 2 at Week 76

        2. To assess whether the proportion of patients with a favourable efficacy outcome on
           Regimen C, the fully oral regimen, is not inferior to that on Regimen B at Week 76,
           using a 10% margin of non-inferiority

        3. To assess whether the proportion of patients with a favourable efficacy outcome on
           Regimen D, the shortened regimen, is not inferior to that on Regimen B at Week 76, using
           a 10% margin of non-inferiority.

      The first primary objective, to assess the superiority of Regimen C over Regimen B, is a
      requirement of the US FDA; the second and third primary objectives are of programmatic
      relevance.

      Study Population A total of at least 1155 participants with multi-drug resistance
      tuberculosis (MDR-TB) including patients with rifampicin-resistant and isoniazid-sensitive
      TB, will be recruited from sites in a number of countries. They will be randomised to either
      Regimen A, Regimen B, Regimen C, or Regimen D in a ratio 1:2:2:2 (i.e. 165 allocated to
      Regimen A, 330 allocated to Regimen B, 330 allocated to Regimen C, and 330 allocated to
      Regimen D).

      All patients will be followed up to Week 132. The primary analysis will be based on the data
      accrued to Week 76 and is based on the proportion of patients with a favourable outcome at
      that time point ; the data accrued to Week 132 will be used in secondary analyses.

      Although the STREAM study is an open-label study, wherever possible it will be conducted
      masked to treatment allocation.
