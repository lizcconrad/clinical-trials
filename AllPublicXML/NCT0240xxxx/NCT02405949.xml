  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is directly related to an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality. Weight loss is effective in
      decreasing these risks and to reduce disease severity. Bariatric surgery is an effective
      therapy for sustained weight loss and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission in most of the morbidly
      obese patients. But there is also a significant number of individuals with an inappropriate
      response to bariatric surgery. Two recent retrospective studies assessed the role of genetic
      load as a predictor of this response, but the results are still unelucidated. The aim of this
      study is to assess whether a selection of genetic variants may allow us to identify
      individuals who will have a satisfactory response after bariatric surgery in terms of weight
      loss and T2D remission.

      A retrospective case-control study of 100 women who underwent bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y
      laparoscopic gastric bypass): 50 pacients who were diabetic before surgery: 15 cases with
      less than 40% of the excess weight loss (EWL) and 35 cases with more than 75% EWL, matched
      with 50 non diabetic controles: 15 patients with less than 40%EWL and 35 with more than
      75%EWL after one year. All individuals were analyzed with a genetic score from Nutri inCode.
      The predictive ability was analyzed by discrimination (area under the ROC curve), sensitivity
      and specificity and a score was calculated.

        The trial aimed to recruit a total of 100 female subjects who underwent a gastric bypass in
        our cente with more than one year of monitoring. These 100 subjects were distributed into 4
        subgroups according to the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and the presence or
        absence of type 2 diabetes before surgery:

        15 women with %EWL &lt;40% without diabetes 15 women with &lt;40%EWL with type 2 diabetes 35
        women with a %EWL&gt; 75% without comorbidities 35 women with a %EWL&gt; 75% with type 2 diabetes
