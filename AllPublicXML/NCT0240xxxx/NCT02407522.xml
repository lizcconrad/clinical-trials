    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to thoroughly investigate how the interaction between black rice
      and human gut microbiota affects metabolic diseases, this study will recruit patients with
      Metabolic Syndrome (MS) and provide them with dietary supplementation of black rice (50
      g/day) for 3 months to observe its effect on the development of MS. The focuses of this
      project are to elucidate how black rice consumption affects the composition and metabolism of
      intestinal bacteria as well as the development of MS, and to further analyze whether the
      changes in intestinal bacteria are associated with the changes in MS improvements.

             female

          -  high blood sugar: fasting plasma glucose≥5.6mmol/L (100mg/d L) or individuals
             diagnosed with diabetes and being treated

          -  hypertension: systolic blood pressure≥130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure≥85 mm Hg
             or individuals diagnosed with hypertension and being treated

          -  dyslipidemia: fasting total triglycerides≥1.70 mmol/L(150 mg/d L) or individuals
