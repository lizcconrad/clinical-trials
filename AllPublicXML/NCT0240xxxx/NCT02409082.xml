    <textblock>
      The investigators explore the presence of AD factors beta-amyloid and tau in CSF and plasma
      to verify AD diagnosis in patients with acute hip fracture. Clinical dementia test is
      performed prior to operation. Blood samples and CSF samples are collected at surgery and
      blood samples are collected postoperatively at intervals. Mortality is assessed at 30 days, 3
      months and 1 year. Morbidity is assessed at , 3 months and &gt;1 year. Neuromarkers specifically
      addressing the inflammatory component are to be analyzed and correlated to outcome together
      with AD markers, as above.

      The hypotheses explored in this investigation is that patients being pre-AD or having AD have
      worse prognosis following an acute hip fracture. This has been demonstrated in retrospective
      studies. In this study we admit all patients with a hip fracture planned tro receive a spinal
      anesthesia. Our golden standard of anesthesia in this patient cohort. Preoperatively Clinical
      Dementia Score is assessed after study inclosure. At the performance of the spinal dosage is
      standardized. Prior to giving this 5 ml of CSF is collected and blood is collected. Blood is
      then collected at intervals up until day 3 postoperatively. We plan to analyze beta-amyloid
      and tau in CSF and plasma to verify AD diagnosis in patients with acute hip fracture.
      Mortality is assessed at 30 days, 3 months and 1 year. Morbidity is assessed at, 3 months and
      &gt;1 year. Neuromarkers specifically addressing the inflammatory component are to be analyzed
      and correlated to outcome together with AD markers, as above.
