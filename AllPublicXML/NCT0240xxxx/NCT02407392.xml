  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problem statement Barrett's oesophagus is a pre-cancerous condition affecting 375,000 people
      in the U.K. There is a 0.5-3% yearly risk of progressing to oesophageal cancer, from which
      only 5% of patients will survive for 5 years after diagnosis. Diagnosing the disease at the
      stage of dysplasia (pre-cancerous) and early cancer improves survival. This has led to the
      current surveillance strategy of gastroscopy with non-targeted mapping biopsies taken from
      the Barrett's oesophagus every two years. The large number of biopsies required is time
      consuming and expensive, yet dysplasia and cancerous tissue is still missed due to the
      non-targeted biopsy sampling strategy. Acetic acid has been used effectively in the early
      detection of cervical dysplasia and cancer, and has also been used with success in a high
      risk Barrett's population (patients with suspected dysplasia or previously treated
      dysplasia), but not been studied in the lower risk Barrett's surveillance population. A
      diagnostic study of non-targeted mapping biopsies (current practice) versus targeted biopsies
      (acetic acid) in a surveillance population is needed before widespread adoption of this
      technique is possible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to enable powering of a larger study. The investigators would
      assume a disease detection of 4.5% with acetic acid chromoendoscopy and 1.5% with protocol
      driven mapping biopsies. However, these assumptions are largely driven from a single centre
      cohort study and as such need clarification before they could be used for the purposes of
      powering a study. Based on the historical cohort studies and wide consultation within the
      British Society of Gastroenterology research committee and consultation with experts in the
      field, it is estimated that 200 patients would be reasonable for recruitment to enable the
      reproducibility and generalisability of this data to be established. The purpose of this
      study is not to produce statistically significant data in itself but to establish likely
      event rates and effect size to inform the power calculation for the definitive study.

    <measure>Participant acceptability of trial design</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess participant acceptability of the study design through quantitative measures related to study procedures and in-depth qualitative feedback. Qualitative feedback through semi-structured telephone interviews. Patients will be asked how acceptable they found having two endoscopies and whether they would be willing to undergo a study of similar design. This will measured by responses based on a telephone interview questionnaire.</description>

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To identify the degree of difference in dysplasia (pre-cancerous changes) detection rates between acetic acid gastroscopy (targeted biopsies) and standard gastroscopic practice (non-targeted mapping biopsies) to inform the power calculation for a definitive study. Number of biopsies in each endoscopy required to detect dysplasia.</description>

    <description>Feasibility of training and implementation of acetic acid guided dysplasia detection technique. Online training module with pre and post training examination. Seminar based training day with further examination thereafter and correlation of scores following the above methods. The endoscopists will be tested on a validated video library pre and post training. A further test will be performed following 3-6 months to assess for drop off in ability. Percentage of correct answers will be calculated for each test</description>

    <measure>Clinician's acceptability of using Acetic Acid technique</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To explore the acceptability to clinicians and patients of the concept of using a targeted biopsy technique for surveillance instead of non-targeted, mapping biopsies. Semi-structured qualitative interview to explore clinician's attitude to the use of acetic acid following training and implementation of the study. Clinician's will be asked via a telephone interview on a scale of how confident they would be to use acetic acid alone in the surveillance of Barrett's without performing non-targeted biopsies. Clinical's attitudes will be assessed pre and post training as well as at the end of the study.</description>

Qualitative patient interview for both those enrolled in the study and those who have declined to identify themes that may assist recruitment into a larger study.
