  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metreleptin was approved in the United States as adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to
      treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired
      generalized lipodystrophy in February 2014. The approval was based on results obtained in 2
      open-label, investigator-sponsored studies (Studies 991265 and 20010769) conducted at the
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metreleptin
      treatment in patients with lipodystrophy and 1 treatment IND (FHA101/MB002-002/MB002-002)
      conducted by Bristol-Myers Squibb on behalf of AstraZeneca (BMS/AZ) in patients with diabetes
      mellitus and/or hypertriglyceridemia related to lipodystrophy. These studies enrolled
      patients with lipodsytrophy including both generalized and partial lipodystrophy. Although
      the marketing authorization restricted the indication to patients with generalized
      lipodystrophy, meaningful clinical benefit was achieved in a subset of patients with partial
      lipodystrophy, and these patients from FHA101/MB002-002 form the basis of the request for
      ongoing treatment under expanded access.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leptin is a naturally occurring hormone and an important regulator of energy homeostasis and
      other diverse physiological functions. Circulating levels of leptin closely correlate with
      the amount of adipose tissue present. Metreleptin, a recombinant analogue of human leptin, is
      a 147-amino acid polypeptide that differs from the human leptin sequence by 1 additional
      amino acid, methionine, located at the amino-terminal end. Metreleptin has the same
      physiological effects as leptin, including regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic
      function.

      The patient group covered under this expanded access submission has demonstrated evidence of
      clinical benefit from treatment with metreleptin in clinical study FHA101/MB002-002, and
      needs expanded access to continue treatment without interruption.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Written Informed Consent

             a) Before any program procedures are performed, the details of the program will be
             described to the patient and the patient will be given a written informed consent
             document to read. If the patient agrees to participate in the program, consent will be
             indicated by signing and dating of the informed consent document in the presence of
             program personnel.

          2. Target Population

               1. Ability to comply with visits and procedures required by program

               2. Previously enrolled in study FHA101/MB002-002

               3. Has physician-confirmed partial lipodystrophy and had evidence of benefit with
                  metreleptin treatment based on the following metabolic criteria demonstrated
                  within the last year of metreleptin treatment (if on treatment over 1 year) from
                  baseline values:
