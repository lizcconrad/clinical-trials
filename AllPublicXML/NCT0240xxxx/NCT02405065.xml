      Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows:

        -  To evaluate the anti-cancer effect of HM95573 in solid tumor patients

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of HM95573 after oral administration.

        -  To investigate biomarkers related to the safety and efficacy of HM95573.
