    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols suitable
      for patients with multiple sclerosis using advanced MRI such as rotating frame relaxation
      imaging. In addition, the investigators want to study the correlation between advanced MRI
      parameters and clinical disease progression.

        MS patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS will be recruited from
        amongst the MS patients in the neurological outpatient policlinics in the Hospital District
        of Southwestern Finland.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS made according to the Poser, McDonald's or
             revised McDonald's criteria (Group I) before participating in the study

          -  Initial MS diagnosis of relapsing remitting form of the disease according to the
             criteria as mentioned above, and conversion into the secondary progressive phase of
             the disease as evaluated by the referring neurologist according to the clinical
             evaluation and confirmed by the study physician (Group II).

          -  Mental status: Patients must be able to understand the meaning of the study

          -  Informed consent: The patient must sign the appropriate Ethical Committee (EC)
             approved informed consent documents in the presence of the designated staff

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other autoimmune disease than MS requiring immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive
             medication

          -  High-dose corticosteroid treatment within 30 days before participating in the study

          -  Prior medical history: Patient must have no history of serious cardiovascular, liver
             or kidney disease

          -  Any psychiatric condition that compromises the subject's ability to participate in the
             study

          -  Infections: Patient must not have an uncontrolled serious infection

          -  No contraindications for MRI (cardiac pacemaker, intracranial clips etc)
