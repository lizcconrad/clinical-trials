  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this study is to address the knowledge gap regarding the
      short-term and long-term safety of fecal microbiota transplants (FMT). The design will be a
      prospective, open-label, multi-center longitudinal cohort study to assess the short- and
      long-term safety of FMT as well as the clinical resolution of diarrhea among 150 patients
      with 3 or more episodes of clostridium difficile infection (CDI defined as 3 unformed stools
      over 24 hours for 2 consecutive days and either a positive stool test for CDI or
      pseudomembranes on colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy). Subjects will be adult outpatients referred to
      one of the study centers after at least three recurrent episodes of CDI and previous
      treatment with at least one 10-day course of oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. After FMT by
      colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy or enema, patients will be followed prospectively and monitored for
      clinical resolution and adverse events at: 3 days (telephone), 3 weeks (clinical assessment),
      8 weeks (telephone), 6 months (telephone), and 12 months (telephone) after FMT. Subjects who
      recur will be offered a second FMT by colonoscopy with a different donor. Microbiome analysis
      will be conducted from stool samples at baseline and each of the 5 follow-up intervals.
