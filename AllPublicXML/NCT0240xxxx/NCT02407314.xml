  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study assessing the effectiveness of Ticagrelor on the reduction of
      thrombus burden using optical coherence tomography in patients undergoing peripheral artery
      stenting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized study, comparing ticagrelor + aspirin vs. aspirin monotherapy
      following the 4-week post-procedural combination of Ticagrelor or Plavix with low dose
      aspirin. The investigators will enroll a minimum of 40 patients. Patients will be enrolled if
      they have either claudication and/or critical limb ischemia, and angiographically identified
      superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease requiring intervention, with either total occlusion
      or a significant SFA stenosis with the presence of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) defined
      clot following stent placement.

      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 4 months, 6 and 7 months following SFA
      intervention. At baseline demographic data will be collected, and anthropomorphic and
      physiological variables (body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure). Baseline and
      6-month ankle brachial index (ABI) will be performed. A 6-min walk test will be performed at
      baseline and 6-month follow-up. At 6 month time point patients in both treatment groups will
      return for a peripheral angiogram and repeat OCT imaging of the SFA segments of interest.
      Subject will have a final follow up clinic visit at 7 months.

    <description>This is an established medical imaging technique that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media. The device used is a cardiac catheter with OCT sensors on the tip of it. It will be used to assess the artery vessels after Percutaneous Peripheral Intervention.</description>

    <description>Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], is a salicylate drug, often used as an analgesic to relieve minor aches and pains, as an antipyretic to reduce fever, and as an anti-inflammatory medication. Aspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, which under normal circumstances binds platelet molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels.</description>

    <description>This is a combination of drugs (Aspirin + Ticagrelor). Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], is a salicylate drug, often used as an analgesic to relieve minor aches and pains, as an antipyretic to reduce fever, and as an anti-inflammatory medication. Aspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, which under normal circumstances binds platelet molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Ticagrelor is a platelet aggregation inhibitor due to its properties as an antagonist of the P2Y12 receptor. Ticagrelor is a nucleoside analogue: the cyclopentane ring is similar to the sugar ribose, and the nitrogen rich aromatic ring system resembles the nucleobase purine, giving the molecule an overall similarity to adenosine.</description>
