      This study is being conducted to gather long-term data of the performance of the Miromatrix
      Biological Mesh.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Miromatrix Medical Inc. has developed a new biologic mesh, called MIROMESH®. MIROMESH
      received FDA 510(k) clearance with an indication for reinforcement of soft tissue on March
      31, 2014 under K134033. Miromatrix Biologic Mesh is a non cross-linked, acellular surgical
      mesh that is derived from the highly vascularized porcine liver. This study will serve to
      provide clinicians with high-quality clinical data in order to provide them with a higher
      degree of confidence when selecting MIROMESH for ventral hernia repair.

             separation

          -  hernia classified as CDC class 1 or 2 preoperatively

          -  able and willing to sign the consent form and comply with all study visits and
