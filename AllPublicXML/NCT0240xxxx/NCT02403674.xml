  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the antiretroviral activity of MK-1439A, a
      single-tablet, once-daily (q.d.) fixed-dose combination (FDC) containing doravirine (MK-1439)
      100 mg + lamivudine 300 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, with ATRIPLA™, a
      single-tablet FDC containing efavirenz 600 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg + tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate 300 mg, in treatment-naive participants infected with human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV). The primary hypothesis is that MK-1439A q.d. is non-inferior to ATRIPLA™ q.d. as
      assessed by the proportion of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL
      (by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay) at Week 48.

    <description>The mean change from baseline in CD4 cell counts at Week 48 was assessed using the Observed Failure (OF) approach.
