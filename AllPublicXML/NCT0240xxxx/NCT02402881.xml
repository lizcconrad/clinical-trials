  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently developed a registry of missed doses of VTE prophylaxis that
      includes retrospective data on missed doses of VTE prophylaxis. To decrease rates of VTE
      prophylaxis refusal, the group has developed a patient-centered education bundle that will be
      delivered as an in-person, 1-on-1 discussion session with a nurse educator. Supporting
      education materials include a 2-page education sheet and an educational video.

      The investigators hypothesize that patient refusal of VTE prophylaxis is associated with
      significant knowledge gaps among patients regarding their risk of developing VTE and the
      benefits of VTE prophylaxis and that delivering an education bundle to patients that refuse
      VTE prophylaxis will improve compliance with VTE prophylaxis and decrease rates of VTE.

      Background

      This research group's published pilot study reported that nearly 12% of prescribed doses of
      pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis are not administered and almost 60% of missed doses are due to
      patient or family member refusal. Fanikos et al found that 44% of missed doses of VTE
      prophylaxis were due to patient refusal. In a survey of 500 recently hospitalized patients,
      the National Blood Clot Alliance found that only 28% and 15% respectively had basic knowledge
      of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) despite the fact that 15% of
      participants had a history and 43% had a family history of either condition.

      Given these high rates of patient refusal of VTE prophylaxis and significant knowledge gaps
      regarding VTE, there is an urgent need to educate patients and families on the importance and
      benefits of compliance with VTE prophylaxis.

      The proposed patient-centered education bundle will be delivered as an in-person, 1-on-1
      discussion session with a nurse educator. Supporting education materials include a 2-page
      education sheet and an educational video.

      The investigators hypothesize that patient refusal of VTE prophylaxis is associated with
      significant knowledge gaps among patients regarding their risk of developing VTE and the
      benefits of VTE prophylaxis and that delivering an education bundle to patients that refuse
      VTE prophylaxis will improve compliance with VTE prophylaxis and decrease rates of VTE.

      Objectives

      Primary objective: is to determine the impact of delivering a patient education intervention
      bundle on rates of VTE prophylaxis non-administration.

      Secondary objective: is to determine the impact of delivering a patient education
      intervention bundle on rates of VTE.

      Methods

      The investigators have developed a real-time alert that notifies a member of the research
      team whenever a patient misses their dose of VTE prophylaxis. This interventional study will
      take place on on four hospital floors. Whenever a nurse educator receives an alert from any
      of the included floors indicating that a dose of VTE prophylaxis has been missed, she/he will
      visit the floor, and approach the nurse in charge of that patient to find out the reason for
      the missed dose. If the dose was missed as a result of patient refusal, the nurse educator
      will visit the patient and deliver the education bundle comprised of: 1) a one-on-one
      education session, 2) the patient education sheet and 3) the patient education video
      depending on patient preference. The intervention will be in real time for doses missed on
      business days between 8.00am and 4.00pm and at the start of the next business day for doses
      missed during non-business hours or on weekends. We anticipate that the study will continue
      for 5 years and we anticipate a total of 1000 patients during the study duration
