  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 3 months randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled supplementation trial tested the
      hypothesis that nutritional supplementation with whey protein, essential amino acids and
      vitamin D concurrent with regular, controlled physical activity would increase muscle mass,
      strength, physical functional, quality of life, and decrease the risk of malnutrition and
      inflammation in sarcopenic elderly.

      This 3 months randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled supplementation trial tested the
      hypothesis that nutritional supplementation (32 g) with whey protein, essential amino acids
      and vitamin D concurrent with regular, controlled physical activity would increase muscle
      mass (assessed by DXA), strength (assessed by handgrip dynamometer), physical functional
      (assessed by ADL), quality of life (assessed by SF-36), and decrease the risk of malnutrition
      (assessed by MNA and IGF-I) and inflammation (assessed by C-reactive protein) in sarcopenic
      elderly.
