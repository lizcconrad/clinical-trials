    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of MR-HIFU ablation of breast cancer. Ten patients with
      early-stage breast cancer with a maximum diameter of 3 cm undergo MR-HIFU ablation, followed
      by MRI and surgical resection to evaluate treatment effect. The main purpose of the study is
      to demonstrate the feasibility of total tumor ablation with MR-HIFU. The secondary objective
      is safety assessment.

    <description>Ten patients undergo MR-HIFU ablation with the Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU Breast Tumor Therapy System. According to a treat-and-resect protocol, these patients also undergo breast cancer surgery after 1 tot 2 weeks after MR-HIFU treatment.</description>

    <description>Magnetic Resonance-guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a completely non-invasive treatment technique. HIFU uses focused ultrasound to achieve temperature rise in the targeted tissue. Real time monitoring of the treatment with MR-thermometry is used to ensure optimal safety.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women, aged 18 years and older.

          -  Able to give informed consent herself.

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance score ≤ 2.

          -  Biopsy proven cT1-2 N0-2 MX invasive breast cancer with a size of ≤ 3.0 cm.

          -  Histological type of tumor: invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).

          -  The target breast fits in the cup of the dedicated MR-HIFU breast system.

          -  Patient weight is limited to &lt; 80 kg

          -  The distance of the tumor, including a 5 mm margin around the tumor, from the skin,
             nipple and pectoral wall is at least 1.0 cm measured on MRI.

          -  The tumor is located within the reach of the HIFU beam produced by the transducers in
             the HIFU breast system.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with: neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the past 3 months or radiotherapy
             or thermal therapy or surgery of any kind in the targeted breast.

          -  Discrepancy between biopsy and Mammaprint in patients of ≥ 35 years old, with no
             lymphadenopathy and a tumor of 1-2 cm. I.e. biopsy shows Bloom &amp; Richardson grade I
             and Mammaprint indicates unfavorable prognosis or biopsy shows Bloom &amp; Richardson
             grade II or III and Mammaprint indicates favorable prognosis.

          -  Contraindications to MR imaging according to the hospital guidelines (e.g. pacemaker
             in situ, severe claustrophobia, big metal implants, body size incompatible with MR
             bore).

          -  Contraindications to administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent, including:
             prior allergic reaction to a gadolinium-based contrast agent, kidney disease (e.g.
             nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy) and/or renal failure
             (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1,73m2).

          -  Contra-indications for procedural sedation analgesia with Propofol and Esketamine or
             Propofol and Remifentanil.

          -  Macro calcifications at mammography in or around the targeted tumor.

          -  Extensive intraductal components in the lesion determined by biopsy.

          -  Scar tissue or surgical clips in the HIFU beam path.

          -  Inability to lie in prone position.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Communication barrier with patient.
