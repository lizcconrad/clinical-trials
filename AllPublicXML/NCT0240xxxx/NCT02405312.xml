    <textblock>
      This year, 90,000 Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will die and questions will
      legitimately be raised as to whether terminal treatment and location of death adequately
      represented their preferences. These concerns are linked by a failure on the part of patients
      and staff to discuss prognosis and share in end-of-life (EOL) planning. The rate of hospice
      use among patients dying with ESRD is half that of the national average and one-quarter the
      rate for patients with terminal cancer. In other patient populations when meaningful EOL
      conversation occurs this is associated with increased hospice referral and improved quality
      of the dying.

      Patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) often desire but rarely communicate with staff about
      prognoses, know little about availability of community hospice resources, or how to complete
      advance directives. Nephrologists are not trained to have these conversations, and although
      accustomed to relying on interdisciplinary teams, they are unaccustomed to collaborating with
      community hospices. Our preliminary research began by using focus groups, created and
      validated the first clinically useful HD prognostic tool, and developed a prototype for
      Shared Decision Making and Renal Supportive Care (SDM-RSC). This is a novel multimodal
      intervention that familiarizes patients, families, and dialysis staff with community hospice
      resources, emphasizes dialysis social work support, conveys information about terminal care
      issues, and encourages advance care planning.

      The proposed study tests the central hypothesis that EOL care can be improved by relying on
      patients and stakeholders to enhance SDM-RSC for HD patients who are most likely to die. It
      will test whether an intervention that targets communication deficiencies can alter EOL
      outcomes and achieve the goal of matching patient preferences with terminal treatments.

      This year, 90,000 Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will die and questions will

      represented their preferences. These concerns are linked by a failure on the part of patients

      rate for patients with terminal cancer. In other patient populations when meaningful EOL
      conversation occurs this is associated with increased hospice referral and improved quality
      of the dying.

      Patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) often desire but rarely communicate with staff about
      prognoses, know little about availability of community hospice resources, or how to complete
      advance directives. Nephrologists are not trained to have these conversations, and although
      accustomed to relying on interdisciplinary teams, they are unaccustomed to collaborating with
      community hospices. Our preliminary research began by using focus groups, created and
      validated the first clinically useful HD prognostic tool, and developed a prototype for
      Shared Decision Making and Renal Supportive Care (SDM-RSC). This is a novel multimodal
      intervention that familiarizes patients, families, and dialysis staff with community hospice
      resources, emphasizes dialysis social work support, conveys information about terminal care
      issues, and encourages advance care planning.

      The proposed study tests the central hypothesis that EOL care can be improved by relying on
      patients and stakeholders to enhance SDM-RSC for HD patients who are most likely to die. It
      will test whether an intervention that targets communication deficiencies can alter EOL
      outcomes and achieve the goal of matching patient preferences with terminal treatments.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To determine whether SDM-RSC impacts the use of hospice services, location of death, and
           EOL planning. The RSC intervention will be employed at the HD clinics with patients who
           are in the highest quintile of mortality.

           Hypothesis: SDM-RSC will increase a) hospice use, b) deaths at home (vs. in
           institutions), and c) completion of advance directives.

        2. To determine the effect of SDM- RSC on quality of life/death and caregiver satisfaction
           with patient care in the last week of life. Validated instruments reflecting values and
           priorities of patient and caregiver will be collected by interviewers.

      Hypothesis: SDM-RSC will significantly improve quality of life/death while also increasing
      caregiver satisfaction.

      The proposed work addresses recommendations by the Renal Physician's Association for EOL care
      and the Institute of Medicine for patient-centered healthcare. The novel communication
      intervention is relevant to not only ESRD but also other high-mortality disorders.

      Scope of the Problem:

      A match between patient goals and the care received should be the gold standard for quality
      medical management. Meaningful end-of-life (EOL) conversations are associated with increased
      hospice referral, less aggressive and expensive medical treatment, and improved satisfaction
      on the part of families. However, a survey of ESRD patients reported less than 10% having a
      conversation about any EOL issues with their nephrologist in the previous year, and more than
      90% endorsed that none of their physicians had ever discussed how much time they had to live.
      It is not known whether an intervention that targets deficiencies in communication and
      terminal care planning can improve EOL outcomes. This is an area that has been neglected in
      ESRD research, yet should have tremendous importance to patients, families, and
      policy-makers.

      Over 600,000 Americans have ESRD at a cost to society of more than $42 billion a year, and
      patients over the age of 75 constitute the fastest growing segment of the ESRD population in
      the United States. Up to one-third of these elderly patients have four or more comorbid
      chronic health conditions, and hemodialysis (HD) does not always substantially prolong their
      lives. This year, Wong and associates reported that 49% of elderly long-term HD patients
      spent time in an ICU in their final month of life, compared with 24% of cancer patients,
      suggesting intensity of care at the EOL is substantially higher in ESRD than that received by
      other Medicare beneficiaries with life-limiting illnesses. According to analyses from the
      United States Renal Data System, these decisions may have important economic ramifications.
      This figure demonstrates that the costs of care in the last week of life for those using
      hospice and withdrawing from dialysis was approximately half the cost of those who did
      neither. In light of the substantial prevalence of symptoms, costs, and high mortality rates,
      it is time to reconsider the care, and especially the EOL care, offered to the ESRD
      population with advancing age.

      Communication of prognosis is a key step in EOL planning, but occurs infrequently or
      extremely late in the dying process among patients with ESRD. Most ESRD patients want to
      learn about EOL issues, and according to Davison, the most valued components are being
      informed about prognosis, treatment options (including withdrawal from dialysis) and planning
      for death. In two studies, 95% and 97% of patients with ESRD preferred to be given
      life-expectancy information—even if their prognosis was poor—and patients specifically wanted
      their physician to disclose this information without prompting. Nevertheless, nephrologists
      and dialysis staff infrequently discuss EOL issues with patients and families, although they
      repeatedly face difficult determinations about treatment options, including whether to
      discontinue renal replacement therapies or to consider referral for hospice services. Despite
      national guidelines and an explicit recommendation by the Renal Physicians Association and
      American Society of Nephrology, patients and their family members or surrogate decision
      makers are often not provided with available information. This may help explain why only
      one-in-five dying dialysis patients currently receive hospice care—about half that of
      national figures for overall deaths in the United States and one-fourth that of people dying
      from cancer.

      Both uncertainty regarding individual prognosis and a lack of training in communicating has
      limited EOL discussions between nephrologists and ESRD patients. Instruments to identify
      individuals undergoing maintenance HD who are at highest risk for death have only recently
      been shown to be reliable predictive models for clinical use. Integrated prognostic models
      now take into account laboratory values, comorbidities, changes in comorbidity score over
      time, functional status/fragility, quality of life (QOL), and sometimes either the patient's
      or clinician's prediction of survival. Drs. Cohen and Germain have developed a practical and
      reliable instrument that is available online (http://touchcalc.com/calculators/sq), as a free
      application for mobile devices and it is being increasingly cited for its potential value in
      the literature. In addition to the barriers of providing a reliable prognosis, communication
      has been highlighted as a barrier in a qualitative study of elderly ESRD patients and
      nephrologists.

      Communication of prognosis may be an essential ingredient in the acceptance of life-limiting
      conditions, completion of advance directives, do-not-resuscitate orders, and the delineation
      of goals of care. However, nephrologists and dialysis staff have lacked training to
      meaningfully participate in these complex but much needed conversations. In recent years,
      guidelines have become available to assist medical personnel in communicating 'bad news' and
      introducing hospice and other EOL resources to patients and families in an honest and
      compassionate manner. Patients who talk with their physicians about approaching death are
      more satisfied with care than those who do not, and they also frequently request deaths take
      place at home. These results are consistent with other studies, suggesting that EOL
      communication between patients and physicians is associated with better outcomes, less
      expensive medical care, and decreased anxiety and depression on the part of the bereaved
      survivors.

      We have identified a major barrier in the management of dialysis patients: the dearth of
      communication between staff and patients about prognosis and EOL considerations. Without
      these conversations, this population will continue to receive overly demanding and expensive
      treatments, infrequent referrals for hospice services, and a diminished quality of life and
      death. The extensive preliminary work preceding this study, which began with focus groups
      involving patients and families, has allowed us to develop and validate an accurate
      prognostic instrument for the identification of HD patients with poor short-term survival
      expectancy. The multimodal SDM-RSC intervention takes advantage of the existing
      interdisciplinary team approach that is the bedrock of HD practice, and it empowers the
      social worker to engage in EOL communication with the patients and their loved ones. The
      SDM-RSC intervention is designed to be practical, adaptable to existing staff, and easily
      replicated in dialysis facilities throughout the country. Additional involvement of
      patient-partners from two distinct sections of the country will greatly improve the protocol.

      Renal supportive care holds the promise of becoming an increasingly important and desirable
      aspect of patient-centered care in ESRD. The principal elements of SDM-RSC include:
      identification of high-mortality patients, initiating discussions with them and families,
      sharing decision-making and advance care planning to establish agreed level of care, and when
      appropriate changing the emphasis from curative to palliative treatments, such as withdrawal
      of dialysis and referral for hospice services. This study intends to challenge the current
      paradigm of EOL care of ESRD patients and establish whether delivery of prognostic
      information, encouragement of advance directives, and sensitive discussion of terminal
      treatment options, e.g. hospice services, by nephrologists and dialysis social workers, can
      together meaningfully alter the last remaining portion of patient lives and the care they
      receive. The trial will confront the issue of overuse—when an appropriate service, e.g. HD,
      continues to be provided under circumstances in which the potential for harm may exceed the
      possible benefit. Furthermore, the proposed trial may significantly improve the QOL of
      patients and provide the opportunity for higher quality care.

      Brief Overview of SDM-RSC Study Design:

      The study utilizes a prospective intervention period and a retrospective control period at
      the same dialysis units, in order to balance efficacy, power, and accuracy. The intervention
      will be implemented at the unit level and is intended to impact not only the specific
      patients enrolled in the study but also other patients receiving care in these units. The
      design avoids the contamination effect and inadvertent cross-overs that would be present with
      an individual participant randomization design. Because we expect perceptions and practices
      to be changed among care providers other designs, e.g. cross-over designs, would also be
      unusable. Cluster randomization may also not be practical given the variation between units
      in practice patterns and logistics involved in conducting a study with a sufficient number of
      dialysis to maintain internal validity. The design may be open to potential selection bias
      and secular trends. Adjustments for these are discussed in the data analysis section.

      This study will test whether the SDM-RSC intervention compared to usual care improves EOL
      care, including: increased hospice use, enhanced EOL planning, and improved patient and
      caregiver satisfaction. The multi-modal SDM-RSC intervention communicates prognosis in a
      face-to-face encounter, uses an algorithm-based social work intervention, and provides
      hospice outreach. This study will be recruiting subjects from 16 dialysis units associated
      with 2 clinical centers—Baystate-Tufts (8), University of New Mexico (8). The study sample
      will be selected using a validated prognostic tool to enrich the pool of patients who have a
      high risk of mortality and are most likely to benefit from the SDM-RSC intervention. Subjects
      will be recruited over 6 months and enrolled subjects will be treated and followed for at
      least 18 months.
