    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of fosaprepitant to currently available antiemtic
      treatments of carboplatin chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer patients. Half of the patients will receive fosaprepitant in their first
      chemotherapy cycle, and a placebo on their second chemotherapy cycle. The other half of the
      patients will begin their first chemotherapy cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The addition of aprepitant to 5HT-3 antagonist and steroid is approved for the prevention of
      acute and delayed nausea for highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). The use of oral aprepitant
      3 day regimen has been evaluated in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. However, its use has
      not been explored in carboplatin containing combination regimens in advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). An equivalency study compared fosaprepitant, a 1-day intravenous
      formulation of aprepitant, with oral aprepitant. Findings demonstrate equivalence between the
      agents for complete response and both emesis and nausea control. Fosaprepitant was endorsed
      by the ASCO Update Committee as an acceptable NK1 receptor antagonist. However, there has
      been no evaluation of this iv formulation with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and
      specifically carboplatin containing regimens in NSCLC. Therefore, the investigators propose a
      double-blind, randomized placebo controlled cross-over phase II study assessing the role of
      fosaprepitant in the prevention of nausea and emesis in patients receiving carboplatin based
      chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.

      Patients will be treated with Emend/ placebo administered intravenously on day 1 of cycles 1
      of carboplatin based chemotherapy with crossover to the alternate agent (placebo/ Emend) on
      day 1 of cycle 2 with each cycle being 21 days. Fosaprepitant will be administered
      intravenously on day 1 of either cycle 1 or cycle 2 prior to carboplatin based chemotherapy.
      Placebo will be administered as the alternative agent. Study team and the subject will be
      blinded to fosaprepitant versus placebo.
