      This study will explore the feasibility of initiating a uterine transplant program at UNMC.
      Using the procedural templates established by a successful Swedish team, the investigators
      will identify emotionally and socially stable females of reproductive age with intact ovaries
      who are unable to gestate a child due to congenital or acquired uterine factor infertility
      (UFI). Women will be 21 to 35 years of age upon entry into the protocol, with normal ovarian
      reserve and otherwise healthy for pregnancy. After careful screening, participants will
      undergo egg harvest, in-vitro fertilization, and embryo cryopreservation using standard
      methods. Women who successfully complete in vitro fertilization and cryopreservation of at
      least six embryos will be eligible to receive implantation of a deceased donor uterus. After
      a period of observation to ensure normal menstrual cycling and graft viability, embryo
      implantation will be undertaken. Gestations will be carefully monitored by our high-risk
      pregnancy specialists. Medical research interventions include uterine harvest from a deceased
      donor, surgical implantation of the organ utilizing standard transplant techniques, careful
      post-transplant follow-up including immune suppression therapy tailored to minimize fetal
      compromise, and careful management of pregnancy. After childbearing is complete (at most two
      gestations), the donor uterus will be removed. In addition, open-ended interviews and written
      surveys will be conducted to elicit ethical and psychosocial concerns arising from the
      experience of subjects and their families, health care providers, and the wider community.
      The investigators intent is to monitor outcomes lifelong for transplant recipients and
      live-born infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine transplantation was developed as a surgical/medical procedure to ameliorate the
      condition of absolute uterine factor infertility. As a condition, the congenital or acquired
      state renders fertile-age women the inability to have a child via conventional birth. It is
      estimated that this condition may affect near 1 in 500 women. The alternative, namely
      gestational surrogacy or adoption, can be fraught with legal, ethical, or religious issues.
      Significant research and progress has been obtained in Europe (namely Sweden) in facilitating
      uterine transplantation. Recently, they were able to obtain a successful live childbirth
      using a donated uterus from a living relative. Based on significant background research
      already performed, the aim of this research study is to expand upon their gains by
      successfully establishing a deceased donor uterus transplantation program at UNMC.

      Prior to the success of the Swedish team, two other European/Asian medical research groups
      have attempted deceased donor uterus transplantation. The first resulted in organ failure
      from unclear pathology. The second was a successful transplant, but failed to yield a
      childbirth due to multiple miscarriages. In 2004 however, the team from the Sahlgrenska
      Institute in Gothenburg instituted a rigorous research undertaking in order to study the
      phenomenon and to obtain a childbirth. Using established immunological knowledge, and
      practical experience using animal models, the investigators were able over a course of a
      decade, to start an active transplant program.

      From a medical/obstetrics and gynecology standpoint, potential subjects were screened using a
      rigorous physical and psychosocial evaluation. This involved meeting with multiple members of
      the research team, in addition to independent monitors familiar with the field and the risks
      and benefits of participation. To facilitate success, all women and their partners underwent
      investigation to rule out any sterility factors that could have been related to fertility.
      Next, egg harvesting and embryo transfer was undertaken according to currently accepted
      protocols. Of note, all women who had uterine agenesis had some type of neo-vaginal
      recreation in order to facilitate IVF. Finally, donor and recipient HLA matching was done
      using standard transplantation methods in order to avoid unacceptable matches.

      During surgery, the donor underwent an extensive procedure in order to successfully dissect
      out the artery and venous supply of the organ. The vagina was transected caudal to the
      fornix, thus allowing a donor specimen which was attached by only the vascular pedicles. (The
      process of removing a uterus from a living donor is infinitely more complex than that of a
      deceased donor, hence our initial plan at UNMC is to focus on organs derived from the
      latter.) Once the organ was removed, it was flushed with preservation solution using standard
      transplantation protocols. The recipient surgery was also performed in standard fashion, with
      the donor iliac vessels anastomosed to the recipients. The vaginal rim of the graft was
      sutured to the recipient's vagina in standard fashion. Routine intra-operative examinations
      with Doppler (to assess blood flow) were then performed prior to the termination of the
      operation.

      Maintenance immunosuppression was given to the recipients using standard accepted protocols
      with close monitoring of drug levels. Serial Doppler US were done both during hospitalization
      and in follow up to assess uterine viability. Clinical examination from an obstetrician was
      performed at pre-determined intervals and biopsies of uterine tissue were taken to assess for
      organ viability and to rule out rejection. Those few patients who did have rejection were
      treated with standard transplantation protocols with increased steroids only.

      Embryo transfer was done at approximately 1 year post transplant, in order to ensure
      continued viability and normal menstruation of the organ. Post transfer, hormonal stimulation
      was done using standard reproductive endocrinology protocols. Serial monitoring of the fetus
      was done at routine intervals through the 9 month gestational period. Finally, a caesarean
      section was performed in routine fashion at time of birth.

      Our groups rationale at UNMC is to continue to build on the accepted protocols developed by
      the Swedish team and apply them to deceased donors. The investigators believe our vast
      experience in transplant and obstetrics/gynecology combined with reproductive endocrinology
      facilitates undergoing this exciting new medical and surgical therapy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For transplantation, the criteria are as follows:

               1. Female of reproductive age with intact native ovaries and no medical
                  contraindication to transplantation, including surgical procedure and subsequent
                  immunosuppression, and no medical contraindication to reproduction and gestation
                  in a transplanted uterus. Evaluation for a medical contraindication will be
                  determined by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at UNMC.

               2. Diagnosed with either congenital or acquired uterine factor infertility (UFI) and
                  counseled about alternate options for family building including gestational
                  surrogacy and/or adoption and provided access to these alternate services.
                  Acquired circumstances may include nonfunctional uterus and hysterectomy due to
                  benign disease (uterine fibroids, Asherman's syndrome, pelvic infection,
                  postpartum hemorrhage) or gynecologic malignancy of the uterus or cervix.
                  Additionally, UFI may be a result of congenital anomaly of the uterus and uterine
                  agenesis.

               3. If uterine removal was for uterine or cervical cancer a minimum 5 year
                  recurrence-free time period will be required.

               4. If MRKH Syndrome (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser) or Mullerian agenesis is
                  present, the patient has a negative evaluation for other relevant congenital
                  abnormalities (such as a pelvic kidney). Additionally, women with Mulllerian
                  agenesis who have absence of the vagina must have had neovaginal creation surgery
                  prior to uterine transplant in order to allow for embryo transplantation and
                  monitoring of the organ after transplant.

               5. Ovaries are intact with adequate ovarian reserve as determined by accepted
                  markers including anti-Mullerian hormone level (AMH), astral follicle count
                  and/or early follicular follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.

               6. Desires a biological child and is unable or unwilling to consider gestational
                  surrogacy, and / or seeks uterine transplantation as a means to experience
                  gestation, with an understanding of the limitations provided by the uterine
                  transplant in this respect.

               7. Meets psychological evaluation criteria, e.g.,stable, committed relationship with
                  an individual who supports uterine transplant and intends to co-parent;
                  emotionally mature with good coping skills and no significantly adverse mental
                  health history; normal intellect allowing careful analysis of risks and benefits;
                  no evidence of coercion; no significant evidence of previous noncompliance with
                  medical care; no evidence of frank unsuitability for motherhood (e.g., previous
                  conviction for child abuse).

               8. Likely to comply with medical management, including antirejection immune
                  suppression, frequent follow-up with surgical team, time-sensitive reproductive
                  endocrinology management, high-risk pregnancy management, possible high-risk
                  neonatal management.

               9. Likely to be able to accommodate potential adverse outcomes such as loss of
                  graft, inability to conceive, loss of pregnancy, adverse fetal or neonatal
                  outcome.

              10. Willing to consider transplant hysterectomy or termination of pregnancy if
                  medically necessary.

              11. Willing to undergo oocyte harvest and in-vitro fertilization prior to
                  transplantation, with at least six viable embryos cryopreserved in anticipation
                  of post-transplant implantation.

              12. Financially able to cover anticipated expenses of assisted reproductive services,
                  either through third party coverage or through personal assets.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For transplantation: Exclusions include genetic males, and women who do not meet the
             inclusionary criteria above. Residence in the greater Omaha area during the
             implantation and pregnancy period is required because of the time-sensitive nature of
             transplantation and assisted reproductive technology, as well as the frequent medical
             monitoring which will be required of transplant subjects.
