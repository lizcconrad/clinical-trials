    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilatory lung care is essential for postoperative care in liver transplantation
      recipients, for such patients are under massive fluid challenge and hemodynamic alterations
      perioperatively. Some of the recipients experience difficulty in weaning off from the
      mechanical ventilator due to various causes. This study is to investigate the relationship
      between the inflammatory gene polymorphism, known for acute lung injury, and the duration of
      mechanical ventilatory care for such liver transplantation recipients.
