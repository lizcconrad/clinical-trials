  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Integrated Coping and Awareness Therapy is a novel therapeutic intervention combining
      strategies to improve stress reactivity and increase meaningful coping, as well as a range of
      possible proximal (e.g. immune indices of stress reactivity, symptom severity) and distal
      measures (e.g. relapse, quality of life).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is one of the most devastating disorders that often results in a lack of
      functional recovery. Current treatments focused on remediating symptoms have shown only small
      successes in a return to functioning despite evidence of a dysregulated stress response.
      There is a fundamental gap in understanding the impact of allostatic overload in persons with
      schizophrenia that the investigators theorize is associated with deficits in functioning and
      with an increased vulnerability and relapse risk. The long-term goal is to test an
      intervention aimed at improving stress reactivity. The objective in this application is to
      develop and test the feasibility of a novel therapeutic intervention combining strategies to
      improve stress reactivity and increase meaningful coping. The central hypothesis is that an
      intervention that improves stress reactivity as measured proximally by endocrine, immune, and
      autonomic indices will result in improved adaptive capacity, better role functioning, reduced
      risk of relapse, and decreased likelihood of disability for people in the early stages of
      schizophrenia.

      The rationale for the proposed research is that stress reactivity may be a modifiable risk
      factor underlying functional deficits in schizophrenia. The intervention integrates two
      treatment approaches. The first is based on research showing that mindfulness meditation
      practice is associated with alterations in the neural processing of stressful events and
      targets adaptive responses to stress. The second focuses on providing a buffer against stress
      by using the self-generation of adaptive emotions with a positive psychology intervention,
      which is potentially associated with building protective social resources. These
      complimentary interventions provide a comprehensive synergistic approach for this population
      that could lead to more adaptive coping responses and create a buffer against stress.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Six Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 (no current symptomatology) to 210 (severely ill).</description>

    <description>The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is a semi-structured interview with 7-items that are rated on a 7-point scale with higher ratings reflecting less impaired functioning.</description>

    <description>The PSS is a 10-item, well validated and widely used self-report measure of the degree that situations in day-to-day life are perceived as stressful, unpredictable, uncontrollable, and how overloaded subjects find their lives. The 10 items are rated on a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). The PSS total score consists of the sum of the 10 PSS items and ranges from 0 (no subjective experience of stress) to 40 (overwhelmed with stress).</description>

    <description>A short-version COPE Inventory. Assesses response to stress. 14 scales with two items each; self-distraction, active coping, denial, substance use, use of emotional support, use of instrumental support, behavioral disengagement, venting, positive reframing, planning, humor, acceptance, religion and self-blame. Reliability analyses exceeded alpha=0.60, except for venting, denial and acceptance, all of which exceed alpha = 0.50 (Carver et al 1997) Carver, C. S. (1997).
