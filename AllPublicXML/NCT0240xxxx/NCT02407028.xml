  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this innovative adaptive phase II trial design is to determine the optimal
      combination of hyperbaric oxygen treatment parameters that is most likely to demonstrate
      improvement in the outcome of severe TBI patients in a subsequent phase III trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical investigations strongly indicate that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is
      physiologically active in improving the destructive processes in severe Traumatic Brain
      Injury (TBI). However, prior to a definitive efficacy study, important information is
      required regarding optimizing the HBO2 treatment paradigm instituted in terms of pressure and
      whether NBH enhances the clinical effectiveness of the HBO2 treatment. Preclinical
      investigators working with TBI models have used pressures varying from 1.5 to 3.0 atmospheres
      absolute (ATA). Clinical investigators have used pressure varying from 1.5 to 2.5 ATA.
      However, the lungs in severe TBI patients have frequently been compromised by direct lung
      injury and/or acquired ventilator pneumonia and are susceptible to oxygen (O2) toxicity.
      Working within these constraints, it is essential to determine the most effective HBO2
      treatment parameters without producing O2 toxicity and clinical complications. This proposed
      clinical trial is designed to answer these questions and to provide important data to plan a
      definitive efficacy trial.
