      Phase 3, open-label, study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NBI-98854 administered
      once daily (qd) for a total of 48 weeks of treatment. This study will enroll approximately
      150 medically stable male and female subjects with clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder with neuroleptic-induced TD or mood disorder with
      neuroleptic-induced TD.
