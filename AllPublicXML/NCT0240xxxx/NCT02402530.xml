  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of neridronic acid in the
      treatment of pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I).

      The trial is divided into 3 periods: a 60-day enrollment period, a 12-week trial period, and
      an extended follow-up period with visits at Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12. The extended
      follow-up period will be terminated for all participants after the last participant enrolled
      completes their Month 6 visit (Visit 9). The double-blind will be maintained throughout the
      12-week trial period and extended follow-up period.
