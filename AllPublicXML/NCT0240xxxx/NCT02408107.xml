    <textblock>
      The aim of this current study was to investigate the effects of a pragmatic home-based
      physical activity programme on primarily physical activity levels and secondarily weight
      maintenance, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), insulin resistance (IR) and lipid
      concentrations in post-adjuvant therapy breast cancer survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the prevalence of treatment-related health concerns and increased risk of developing
      metabolic syndrome, recurrence and cardiovascular disease, breast cancer survivors may
      require diagnostic, therapeutic, supportive or palliative services for many years
      post-diagnosis. Encouraging breast cancer survivors to adopt a healthy lifestyle
      post-treatment may reduce the healthcare burden resulting from treatment-related sequelae and
      improve survival. In particular, higher levels of physical activity (PA) may positively
      influence some of these side-effects of treatment, enhance quality of life and reduce risk of
      recurrence and all-cause and breast cancer-related mortality. However, PA levels are
      generally low among breast cancer survivors and many women decrease their PA following
      diagnosis. Therefore, interventions are required to improve the post-diagnosis PA levels of
      breast cancer survivors.

      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have found improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness,
      HRQoL, fatigue and weight maintenance in breast cancer survivors participating in PA
      interventions compared with control groups. However, most of these RCTs utilised
      facility-based interventions, which may limit their patients who have trouble accessing
      exercise facilities due to transportation or time-related difficulties. To overcome these
      problems home-based PA interventions have been investigated and have generally reported good
      adherence and positive effects on health, fitness and HRQoL outcomes. However, there is a
      lack of relevant interventions in the United Kingdom.

    <description>Physical activity (PA) intervention participants received a 30-45 min face-to-face consultation (1st visit), followed by 15-20 min support telephone calls (end of months 1, 2 and 3). During months 4 and 5 patients received reminder leaflets. Consultations were conducted by the primary researcher after baseline measurements and were based on the four core motivational interviewing principles. The topics covered in the consultation (e.g. goal setting, overcoming barriers, health and safety advice) were similar to other trials that incorporated a PA counselling component. The focus of the follow-up phone calls (end of months 1-3) was to prevent relapse and/or improve maintenance of PA. The intervention participants were encouraged to work towards accumulating at least 30min of moderate-intensity PA on 5-7 days/week.</description>

          -  Previous invasive breast cancer (surgically treated DCIS or LCIS is allowed),
