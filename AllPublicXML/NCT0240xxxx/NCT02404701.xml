  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether certain supplements promote excessive
      urinary oxalate excretion and increase the risk for calcium oxalate kidney stones.
      Supplements that enhance urinary oxalate excretion, as a result of their oxalate
      concentration or from some other mechanism (e.g., providing substrate for oxalate
      biosynthesis) will be identified by the investigators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that certain over-the-counter dietary supplements will increase
      urinary excretion of oxalate as measured in 24-h urine collections. The investigators further
      hypothesize that the concentration of oxalate in dietary supplements may not be associated
      with urinary oxalate excretion, suggesting that other nutritional components of the
      supplements may be exerting an influence over oxalate biosynthesis, oxalate absorption in the
      gastrointestinal tract, and/or renal oxalate handling. These other factors include the form
      of oxalate in the supplement (water- vs. non water-soluble) and the supplement's
      concentration of ascorbic acid.

    <description>Eligible participants who provide consent/authorization will report for an orientation visit (1 of 3 visits), during which participants will: provide a medical history and a 24-hour diet recall, have height and weight measured, learn how to collect 24-hour urine, receive instructions on following a standardized diet for 7 days, learn to use a food scale and provide diet records, and receive a 4-day supply of the supplement they were allocated to take along with instructions. After 3 days on the diet (no supplement), participants will return their first (of 2) diet record and 24-hour urine collection. After 4 days on the diet while taking the supplement, participants will return their second (and final) completed diet record and their second (and final) 24-hour urine collection.</description>
