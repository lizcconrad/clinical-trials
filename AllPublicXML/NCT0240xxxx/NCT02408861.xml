      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given with
      ipilimumab in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated classical
      Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to
      treatment, or solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed
      by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may block tumor growth
      in different ways by targeting certain cells. Ipilimumab is an antibody that acts against a
      molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 controls a part of your
      immune system by shutting it down. Nivolumab is a type of antibody that is specific for human
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a protein that is responsible for destruction of immune
      cells. Giving ipilimumab with nivolumab may work better in treating patients with HIV
      associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma or solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate safety and feasibility of ipilimumab and nivolumab at the standard doses of
      drug in solid tumor and relapsed refractory HIV-classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) participants
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection given the possibility of increased toxicity
      based on immune activation, co-morbidity, or interference with highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) therapy. (Dose De-escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab, on immune function (HIV viral load in plasma using conventional assay, CD4+ and
      CD8+ cells). (Dose De-escalation Cohort) II. To preliminarily assess objective response rates
      associated with treatment for commonly represented tumors (Kaposi sarcoma, anal cancer, and
      lung cancer) and relapsed refractory HIV-cHL. (Solid Tumor Dose Expansion and cHL Cohorts)
      III. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab, on immune function (HIV viral load in plasma using conventional HIV assay, CD4+,
      and CD8+ cells). Only single agent nivolumab will be utilized in the cHL cohort. (Solid Tumor
      Dose Expansion and cHL Cohorts)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Understand the immune response to agent in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART), of
      altered immune function, and repertoire due to prior HIV infection.

      II. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab, on intratumor immune cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) such as PD1, programmed
      cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL-1), and others.

      III. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab on circulating cytokine markers by multiplex assay, such as: interleukin (IL)-2,
      IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), chemokine (C-X-C motif)
      ligand 13 (CXCL13), interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble IL-2
      receptor (sIL2R)-alpha, sCD27, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR)1, and sTNFR2.

      IV. To understand the response of human tumor viruses (human papillomavirus [HPV],
      Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV]) to agent.

      V. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab on herpesvirus loads (EBV, KSHV, cytomegalovirus [CMV]) in plasma.

      VI. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab on latent herpesvirus (EBV, KSHV, CMV) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC).

      VII. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab on herpesvirus specific CD8 and CD4 T cells in PBMC.

      VIII. In cases of Kaposi sarcoma, to evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the
      combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on viral transcription in tumor biopsies.

      IX. In cases of anal cancer, to evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the
      combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on HPV types in anal swabs, when feasible.

      X. Understand the response of HIV to agent. XI. To evaluate the effects of single agent
      nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab on latent HIV loads in PBMC using
      outgrowth assay.

      XII. To evaluate the effects of single agent nivolumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
      nivolumab on HIV reactive T cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of nivolumab.

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients in dose
      level 2 also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of every third course of
      nivolumab, and patients in dose level -2 also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1
      of every sixth course of nivolumab. Courses repeat every 14 days for up to 46 courses of
      nivolumab (with ipilimumab if receiving dose level 2 or -2) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 16 weeks or 112 days (based
      on 5 half lives).

                  clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent

               -  cHL Cohort: CD4 cell count of at least 100 cells/mm^3

          -  Participants must be purified protein derivative (PPD) negative; alternatively, the
             QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay can be used; an individual is considered
             positive for M. tuberculosis infection if the IFN-gamma response to tuberculosis (TB)
             antigens is above the test cut-off (after subtracting the background IFN-gamma
             response in the negative control); the result must be obtained within 12 weeks prior
             to enrollment; PPD positive (or Quantiferon assay positive) participants are permitted
             if prophylaxis has been completed prior to enrollment

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; WOCBP should use an adequate method
             to avoid pregnancy for 6 months after the last dose of investigational drug; women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropic [HCG]) within
             72 hours prior to the start of nivolumab; women must not be breastfeeding; men who are
             sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of
             less than 1% per year; men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP
             will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last
             dose of investigational product; women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e.,
             who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not
             require contraception; WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to
             contraception for a period of 6 months after the last dose of investigational product;
             men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to
             adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating
             partner) should inform the treating physician immediately

          -  Participants MUST receive appropriate care and treatment for HIV infection, including
             antiretroviral medications when clinically indicated, and should be under the care of
             a physician experienced in HIV management; participants will be eligible regardless of
             antiretroviral medication (including no antiretroviral medication) provided there is
             no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has been stable for at least 4 weeks
             with no intention to change the regimen within 12 weeks following enrollment

          -  Participants who have hepatitis C (both reactive anti-hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody
             and detectable HCV RNA) and hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive
             and anti-hepatitis B core [HBc]-total positive), may be enrolled, provided total
             bilirubin is =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN, and AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) must be =&lt; 3 X
             institutional upper limit of normal, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid

          -  Ability to understand and to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Criteria for Solid Tumor Expansion and Lymphoma Cohorts:

               -  Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this cohort are the same as above, with the
                  following rule for CD4 count based on tolerability in Phase I; if, participants
                  with lymphocyte T CD4 count between 100-200/mm^3 (Stratum 2) are shown to
                  tolerate treatment in the Phase I dose de-escalation portion at the same dose
                  level as those with CD4 counts &gt; 200/mm^3 (Stratum 1), participants in the
                  expansion cohort with CD4 counts &gt;= 100/mm^3 are permitted; otherwise, the
                  expansion is open to all solid tumor patients except those whose tumors are known
                  not to respond to nivolumab (pancreas, prostate and MSS colon cancer); for the
                  relapsed refractory HIV-cHL cohort, participants with CD4 count &gt;= 100/mm^3 are
                  permitted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have received any other investigational agents within the 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment; concurrent radiation therapy is not permitted, except palliative
             (limited-field) radiation therapy, if all of the following criteria are met:

               -  Repeat imaging demonstrates no new sites of bone metastases

               -  The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion

          -  Participants with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases must be excluded
             unless they qualify for enrollment as described below because of poor prognosis and
             concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; participants with brain metastases
             are permitted if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks or more after treatment is
             complete and within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ipilimumab, nivolumab, or other agents used in study, or history of
             severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody

          -  Participants should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment
             with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks of study drug administration; these drugs
             may interfere with the activity of ipilimumab and nivolumab if administered at the
             time of the first ipilimumab dose; inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement
             doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease; participants are permitted to use topical, ocular,
             intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic
             absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted,
             even if &gt;= 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief course of corticosteroids for
             prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions
             (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is
             permitted; use of anabolic steroids is permitted

          -  Participants with clinical or radiographic evidence of pancreatitis are excluded

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Participants should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1,
             anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti-programmed cell death ligand 2
             (PD-L2), anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting
             T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways; prior immune modulating therapy
             including vaccines may be eligible; prior immune events must be evaluated and the risk
             for new events which may represent continued sub clinical disease or a new process at
             previously damaged site or immune potentiation (e.g. ipilimumab followed by IL2
             causing bowel perforation, ipilimumab followed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase [IDO]
             inhibitor resulting in clinical hypophysitis); please keep in mind that inflammatory
             events may occur weeks to months following the last dose of ipilimumab and possibly
             nivolumab; assessment of potential effects of prior therapy should include:

               -  Immune status

               -  Organ damage

               -  Risk of autoimmunity

               -  Immunopotentiation

          -  The participant has not recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) =&lt; grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except =&lt;
             grade 2 alopecia, neuropathy, and other non-clinically significant adverse events
             (AEs)

          -  The participant has a primary brain tumor

          -  Participant has &gt;= grade 2 diarrhea (participants with grade 1 diarrhea are eligible
             provided stool for ova/parasites and stool cryptosporidium studies are negative)

          -  Opportunistic infection within the last 3 months

          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease or h
