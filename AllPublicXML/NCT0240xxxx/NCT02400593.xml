  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing up in a low-income household has been shown to increase risk for, and susceptibility
      to many illnesses.The purpose of the study is to test an affective intervention for reversing
      biological risk factors, as related to childhood adversity, in midlife.

      Participants will be asked to make two lab visits; attend six weekly, 1-hour meditation
      classes; as well as complete brief online daily surveys for 11 weeks, five biweekly surveys,
      and two 30-minute surveys prior to each lab visit. During the lab visits, participants will
      have their psychophysiology monitored for heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and pulse.
      Participants will also have their blood drawn.

      All surveys and questionnaires inquire about participants' current demographics, family
      history, perceptions about life and well-being, physical health, and monetary choices.
