      This study is designed as a multi-center, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, unblinded, prospective
      clinical outcomes investigation to evaluate the short, mid and long term performance of the
      PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis humeral replacement. The PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder
      prosthesis device configuration will include humeral resurfacing CAP without cement. Patients
      will be selected for recruitment into the study based upon the normally accepted criteria for
      primary shoulder resurfacing arthroplasty.

      The investigation will be conducted by up to 10 International surgeons experienced in HRA.
      387 subjects with PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis arthroplasties will be implanted and
      followed for 10 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients selected for inclusion will present for primary shoulder surface replacement
             or arthroplasty with any of the following diagnoses:

               -  Osteoarthritis

               -  Rheumatoid / Inflammatory Arthritis

               -  Post-traumatic arthritis.

               -  Focal and large (Hill-Sachs) osteochondral defects.

          2. Subject is able to or capable of providing consent to participate in the clinical
             investigation.

          3. Subject agrees to comply with this protocol, including participating in required
             follow-up visits at the investigations site and completing study questionnaires.

          4. Subject is at least 21 years of age and skeletally mature at the time of surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have destruction of the proximal humerus to preclude rigid fixation of the humeral
             component.

          2. Insufficient bone quality as determined by intra-operative evaluation.

          3. Have arthritis with defective rotator cuff.

          4. Have had a failed rotator cuff surgery.

          5. Have loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the
             affected limb rendering the procedure unjustified.

          6. Have evidence of active infection.

          7. Present with a condition of neuromuscular compromise of the shoulder (e.g.,
             neuropathic joints or brachioplexis injury with a flail shoulder joint).

          8. Are unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program or would fail to
             return for the postoperative follow-up visits prescribed by the protocol.

          9. Are skeletally immature.

         10. Have a known allergic reaction to pyrocarbon.

         11. Have other conditions such as central nervous system disturbances, alcohol or drug
             addiction, etc. that may make effective evaluation of the joint replacement difficult
             or impossible.

         12. Are currently participating in another clinical study.

         13. Have known, active metastatic or neoplastic disease.

         14. Are taking &gt; 10mg/day corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) excluding inhalers, within 3
             months prior to surgery.

         15. Are under 21 years of age or over 75.

         16. Require glenoid replacement (Glenoid Classification).
