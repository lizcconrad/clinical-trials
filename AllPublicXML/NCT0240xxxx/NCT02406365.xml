  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A handheld digital colposcope which utilizes flurorescent light is being tested for the rapid
      detection and management of cervical lesions. The handheld research device captures cervical
      images which with the fluorescent light show the regions of cervical tissue that
      autofluoresce. The investigators will study the relationship between the level of
      fluorescence and the samples of tissue (biopsies) obtained from the patient as part of her
      routine care. The investigators will also compare the efficacy of the hand held device with
      the data being collected from the other research devices being tested by the team, i.e. the
      multispectral digital colposcopes.

    <description>Eligible patients who are referred to the colposcopy clinic for a diagnosis following an abnormal Pap smear will be asked to participate in the study. All participating women will receive their standard of care colposcopy as usual. In addition to their routine care, the handheld imaging research device will also be used to capture cervical images. The images will be analyzed and compared to the biopsies obtained. The imaging device will not be used to make a diagnosis. As part of the research study, one or two additional biopsies will be obtained if the patient agrees. These additional biopsies will serve as the control tissue, since they will be taken from tissue that appears normal through the colposcope.</description>

    <description>Eligible patients who consent to participate in the research study will receive their standard of care colposcopy or treatment with the Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP). Additionally, cervical images will be taken using the diagnostic imaging aid. The cervical images will be compared to the histopathology from the biopsies taken as part of the patients' standard of care for colposcopy. If the patient is presenting for the LEEP procedure, then she will be asked if one or two biopsies can be obtained prior to the procedure but after anesthesia has been administered.
The imaging device is not being used to make a diagnosis, but rather to develop an algorithm to make more efficacious and timely diagnoses of cervical neoplasias in the future.</description>
