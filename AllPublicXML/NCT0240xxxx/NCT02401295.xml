    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability associated with the
      combination of ATRA/celecoxib/itraconazole as maintenance therapy given after an autologous
      stem cell transplant in relapsed multiple myeloma patients.

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate safety and tolerability associated with the combination of ATRA/
      celecoxib/itraconazole given after a salvage transplant for relapsed myeloma in 25 patients
      in a cycle schedule consisting of three weeks of treatment followed by a rest period of two
      weeks for a total of five cycles. Subjects will be evaluable only if they have received at
      least one dose of maintenance treatment. The salvage transplant is not part of this study.

      Secondary objective:

      To explore changes in frequency and molecular signature in the multiple myeloma stem cell
      (MMSC) fraction based on flow-cytometric assays and gene expression profiling before and
      after the experimental treatment and to correlate outcome with expression levels of RARα2 at
      time of relapse.

    <description>All maintenance drugs will be given on days 1-21 of each cycle, followed by 14 days off treatment. Cycles will be repeated every 35 days (+/- 3 days) for a total of five cycles.
Each patient enrolled will receive ATRA 20mg twice per day by mouth. Dose modifications are not allowed unless excessive toxicity occurs. In this case, ATRA will be de-escalated by 50% to 10mg twice per day by mouth.
The dose of celecoxib for all patients enrolled will be 400 mg twice per day by mouth. If creatinine level increases to more than 2 mg/dl and cannot be corrected by increased oral fluid intake or other measures, the dose of celecoxib will be decreased by 50%. If creatinine level does not drop below 2 mg/dl on the reduced dose, celecoxib will be discontinued.
The dose of itraconazole for all patients enrolled will be 200 mg twice per day by mouth. Dose modifications are not allowed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of relapsed multiple myeloma

          -  Recent salvage transplant (≤ 6 months but ≥ 45 days post-transplant prior to study
             enrollment) for relapse

          -  18-75 years of age at the time of study entry

          -  Platelet count ≥70K/mm3 un-transfused

          -  Resolution of all transplant-related toxicity to ≤ grade 2 per CTCAE v.4

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by ECHO or MUGA should be ≥ 40%

             document to verify this
