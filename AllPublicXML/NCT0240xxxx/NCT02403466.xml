  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because communication and handoff failures are a root cause of two-thirds of &quot;sentinel
      events&quot;- serious, often fatal preventable adverse events in hospitals improving handoffs has
      been identified by AHRQ and the Joint Commission as a priority in nationwide efforts to
      improve patient safety. Comparative Effectiveness Research on handoff tools and processes has
      identified specific strategies to improve handoffs and reduce medical errors: 1) team
      training; 2) verbal mnemonics; and 3) use of written/computerized tools to supplement verbal
      sign-outs. To accelerate residents' use of CER-based handoff practices and improve patient
      safety, the investigators are implementing the three inventions above as a Resident Handoff
      Bundle (RHB) in eight pediatric hospitals in the United States and Canada.

      The I-PASS Study was initiated in response to mounting evidence that communication and
      handoff failures are a root cause of two-thirds of &quot;sentinel events&quot; - serious, often fatal,
      preventable adverse events in hospitals. The Agency on Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
      and Joint Commission have identified improving handoffs in care as a priority in nationwide
      efforts to improve patient safety. Research on handoff tools and processes has identified
      team training, introduction of verbal mnemonics, and use of written or computerized tools as
      strategies to improve handoffs and reduce medical errors. This study was designed to evaluate
      the effect of a resident handoff bundle (RHB) comprised of these three strategies in
      addressing medical errors, verbal and written miscommunications, and resident workflow and
      satisfaction.

      The US Department of Health and Human Services granted $3 million in funding, with additional
      support provided by member institutional and private foundations. A total of nine hospitals
      in the United States and Canada will serve as data collection sites for the study (see list
      below). Staggered six-month waves of baseline data collection of medical errors and resident
      workflow, satisfaction, and miscommunications began in January 2010. Each site has a
      six-month wash-in period to implement the RHB intervention before embarking upon an
      additional six months of post-intervention data collection. Analysis and dissemination will
      begin upon completion of data collection at the last wave of sites in April 2013.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study will also include direct observation of house staff residents on the medical
             service. While implementation of the RHB itself is a QI protocol, the observation and
             collection of data from residents is research. We will therefore obtain informed
             consent from residents for participation in the research related to the effects on
             their care processes and experiences of implementation of the RHB. Participation will
             be voluntary.

          -  All resident physicians rotating through study teams during the two 6 month periods of
             data collection will be included in the study if informed consent is granted. No
             resident physicians will be excluded on the basis of age, gender, ethnicity, race, or
             other demographic features. We anticipate enrolling a maximum of 70 resident
             physicians per site. This number may be significantly less due to the fact that
             certain residents may rotate through data collection study units more than once during
             the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The only exclusion criteria will be residents who do not rotate through study units
             during the data collection periods
