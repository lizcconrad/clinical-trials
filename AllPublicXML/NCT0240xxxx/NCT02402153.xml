      To evaluate safety issues related to implantation and use of the Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm
      device

      The objective of this pilot trial is to demonstrate the safety and the performance of the
      Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm device before conducting clinical trials in type 1 diabetes
      patients.

      1.1.1 Safety The safety related objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence and
      severity of all adverse events. The primary safety parameter is the number of adverse events
      related to the device implantation and any other study related procedures from the time of
      device implantation until the end of the study (peri-operative complications including
      bleeding and infection, allergic reactions, occurrence of harm, tension or pressure on
      surrounding tissue etc.) 1.1.2 Performance To evaluate the technical stability of the
      Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm device during everyday activities.

      1.1.3 Efficacy Since this is a study in healthy subjects no efficacy measures are recorded.
      Episodes of false alarms will be recorded in order to improve the algorithm for hypoglycaemia
      detection.

      1.1.4 Usability The ability of the subjects to carry the device during every-day activities
      and sleep and the subject experience with respect to pain and discomfort will be evaluated.
