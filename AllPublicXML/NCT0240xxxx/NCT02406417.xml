    <textblock>
      Early detection and management of pituitary dysfunction reduces the morbidity that ensues as
      a consequence of missed or delayed diagnosis of this condition, and which may result in
      life-threatening events and increased mortality.

      The investigators study will explore the use of reflex strategies within the laboratory in
      capturing suspicious pituitary function test results from Primary Care patients and following
      these up with appropriate reflective testing. Subsequently patients identified from these
      results to have a possible underlying piuitary dysfunction will have an alert sent to their
      family physician prompting referral to the Endocrine team for further investigation and
      management.

    <description>Further investigation for pituitary dysfunction by blood tests, dynamic function tests and pituitary imaging e.g. CT Scan with contrast. Patients identified as being at high risk of having pituitary dysfunction based on preliminary blood tests will have further tests added. If these results point to a likely pituitary dysfunction, the patient will be referred to the Endocrine team for further investigations including dynamic function tests and/or imaging.</description>
