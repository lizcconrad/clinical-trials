  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if salsalate, an Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) mediated
      inflammation inhibitor, or carvedilol, an α- and β-blocker, will protect against free fatty
      acid induced hypertension, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and
      oxidative stress, and autonomic dysfunction in obese normotensive subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During postprandial lipemia, dietary triglycerides transported by intestinal chylomicrons are
      hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase lining the vascular bed, with subsequent release of FFA for
      transport across the endothelium. Whether the intermittent flux of FFA has the same impact as
      the i.v. lipid infusion will be examined. Decreased endothelial function has been reported
      after a single or long-term dietary high fat load in normal subjects; however, others have
      found no effects on brachial artery vasoreactivity. Our preliminary studies indicate that
      high oral fat loads (60 g) resulted in higher FFA levels and BP changes, and reduced FMD
      compared to low fat load (25 g).

    <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of free fatty acids at baseline and 6 weeks after the Intralipid 20% infusion. FFA levels were determined by colorimetric method. Current guidelines identify normal range of FFA level as less than 0.72 mmol/L. Elevated plasma levels of FFA indicate a greater rate of insulin resistance.

        <title>Change in Systolic Blood Pressure</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure the heart generates when pumping blood through the arteries to the body. Current guidelines identify normal systolic blood pressure as lower than 120 mmHg. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with a manual cuff prior to and every 4 hours during the 24-hour infusion with subjects in supine position. Change is the difference in systolic blood pressure at the baseline visit from pre-dosing with Intralipid to 4 hours during Intralipid infusion.</description>

        <title>Change in Systolic Blood Pressure</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure the heart generates when pumping blood through the arteries to the body. Current guidelines identify normal systolic blood pressure as lower than 120 mmHg. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with a manual cuff prior to and every 4 hours during the 24-hour infusion with subjects in supine position. Change is the difference in systolic blood pressure at the baseline visit from pre-dosing with Intralipid to 16 hours during Intralipid infusion.</description>

          <title>Change in Systolic Blood Pressure</title>
          <description>Systolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure the heart generates when pumping blood through the arteries to the body. Current guidelines identify normal systolic blood pressure as lower than 120 mmHg. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with a manual cuff prior to and every 4 hours during the 24-hour infusion with subjects in supine position. Change is the difference in systolic blood pressure from at Week 6 from pre-dosing with Intralipid to 8 hours during Intralipid infusion.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of free fatty acids at baseline and 6 weeks after the Intralipid 20% infusion. FFA levels were determined by colorimetric method. Current guidelines identify normal range of FFA level as less than 0.72 mmol/L. Elevated plasma levels of FFA indicate a greater rate of insulin resistance. Change is the difference between 6-week FFA levels from baseline FFA levels.</description>
