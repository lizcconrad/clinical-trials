  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ASSERT-III study aims to determine the incidence of sub-clinical (silent) atrial
      fibrillation (AF) among elderly patients with hypertension and at least one other risk factor
      for AF. This will be accomplished by monitoring with a wireless external loop monitor for 30
      to 60 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be eligible for inclusion if they meet all of the following:

          1. Age ≥ 80 years

          2. History of hypertension OR a blood pressure of ≥ 140/90 mmHg

          3. Attending a primary care clinic, OR ambulatory resident of a chronic care facility

          4. At least one of the following additional risk factors for developing AF:

               1. Diabetes

               2. Body mass index ≥ 30

               3. History of smoking

               4. Documented Obstructive sleep apnea

               5. Cardiovascular disease

               6. Heart Failure

               7. Left ventricular hypertrophy (on ECG or echocardiography)

          5. Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. ECG documented history of AF or atrial flutter, with an episode duration ≥ 6 minutes

          2. Existing implanted pacemaker or defibrillator

          3. Patients considered by the investigator to be unsuitable for study follow-up because
             the patient:

               1. is unreliable concerning the requirements for follow-up during the study and/or
                  compliance with the use of the external loop recorder

               2. has a life expectancy less that the expected study duration due to concomitant
                  disease

               3. has a condition which in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow current
                  chronic treatment with anticoagultion -
