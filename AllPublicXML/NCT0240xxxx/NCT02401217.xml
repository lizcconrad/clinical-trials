    <measure>Stool consistency measured by Mean Rank Stool Consistency (MRSC) using parent reported diaries</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Study Day 1 to Study Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>MRSC will be calculated from data recorded on daily stool records during the study. Stool consistencies will be assigned the following: 1=watery, 2=loose/mushy, 3=soft, 4=formed, 5=hard.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percentage of stools representing each stool consistency and color using parent reported diaries</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Study Day 1 to Study Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Mean percentage of each recorded stool consistency (watery, loose/mushy, soft, formed, hard) and stool color (yellow, brown, green, black) will be calculated for each infant and then used to calculate for each group from daily data recorded on daily stool records during the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean predominant stool consistency and color measured using parent reported diaries</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Study Day 1 to Study Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Mean predominant stool consistency and color for each infant calculated from data recorded on daily stool records during the study will be used to calculate the mean predominant stool consistency and color for each group.</description>

    <measure>Average number of stools per day measured using parent reported diaries</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Study Day 1 to Study Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Average number of stools/day will be calculated for each group from data recorded on daily stool records during the study.</description>

    <measure>Mean percentages of feedings associated with spit-up and/or vomit measured using parent reported diaries.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Study Day 1 to Study Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Mean percentages of feedings associated with spit-up and/or vomiting will be calculated for each group from data recorded on daily formula intake records during the study.</description>
