    <textblock>
      Using a pulse oximeter, the investigators have developed an algorithm that assesses central
      volume status. Pregnant women present some unique opportunities for us to investigate the
      algorithm under different circumstances. The investigators want to specifically investigate
      an algorithm with women who undergo regional anesthesia such as epidurals, with women who
      undergo fetal surgery, and with women in labor and giving birth (and the recovery time
      following delivery). This will help the investigators understand the central volume status
      changes that women experience in these unique circumstances. The Investigators also want to
      put the pulse oximeter on the fetal hand when possible during certain maternal fetal
      interventions. The Investigators would like to examine the algorithm with data from the
      fetuses.

      The Investigators hypothesize that the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) algorithm will help
      to guide fluid management in women undergoing regional anesthesia, giving birth, and/or
      undergoing maternal fetal intervention surgery.

      Specific aims:

      Collect noninvasive physiological waveform data from patients undergoing regional anesthesia
      and either fetal intervention surgery or labor and delivery at Children's Hospital Colorado
      in order to:

        1. Determine how regional anesthesia influences CRI algorithm calculations

        2. Determine if the CRI algorithm is able to detect changes in central volume status
           associated with fetal surgery.

        3. Determine if the CRI algorithm is able to detect changes in central volume status
           associated with labor and childbirth specifically at the time of delivery, when most
           women experience some amount of bleeding.

        4. Examine CRI associated with induction of regional anesthesia and determine if there is a
           minimal CRI below which one can expect hypotension and if there is a trend down in CRI
           following induction of regional anesthesia that could anticipate/predict hypotension.

        5. Determine if there is a correlation between fetal heart rate abnormalities and CRI.

        6. Examine CRI associated with fetal monitoring.
