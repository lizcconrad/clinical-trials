  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two methods, safety curriculum
      in addition to online training alone, for teaching patient safety to surgery residents.
      Despite multiple studies evaluating educational safety curricula, the best methods for
      teaching residents about patient safety is unknown. It is hypothesized that empowering
      surgery residents to actively engage in behaviors to increase patient safety may lead to a
      higher quality perioperative care and communication.

    <description>Residents randomized to the control group will only participate in the Breakthroughs in Patient Safety (BIPS) online training (Education - BIPS course). All residents in the comparison arm will receive evaluations on their non-technical skills, but the results will not be fed back to them until after the study has been completed.</description>

    <description>Those in the intervention group will participate in a formal safety education curriculum in addition to the currently required Breakthroughs in Patient Safety (BIPS) online training. The intervention will have three components: (1) the mandatory online BIPS course (Education - BIPS course), (2) the formal safety curriculum, and (3) ongoing evaluation and feedback of operating room performance.</description>

    <intervention_name>Education - BIPS course</intervention_name>
    <description>The guiding principles behind the BIPS program include: (1) explaining how complex systems cause human error and how human error can lead to patient harm in complex systems; (2) diagnosing human error and identifying a prevention behavior for each of the three types: skill, rule, and knowledge; and (3) preventing error by promoting safety behaviors, such as having attention to detail, communicating clearly, having a questioning attitude, and speaking up for safety</description>
