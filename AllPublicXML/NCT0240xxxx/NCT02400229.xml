  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that computertomography (CT) is superior to invasive coronary
      angiography (ICA) concerning the primary endpoint MACE (MACE = major adverse cardiovascular
      event; defined as at least one of the following: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial
      infarction, and nonfatal stroke) after a maximum follow-up of 4 years, in other words, that
      CT will result in a significantly lower rate of MACE. Secondary outcomes include MICE (MICE =
      minor cardiovascular events), procedural complications, cost-effectiveness, radiation
      exposure, cross-over to CT or ICA, gender differences, and health-related quality of life.

      The primary objective of this prospective pragmatic randomised controlled trial (PRCT) in
      3546 patients is to evaluate the possible superiority of a CT-based patient management over
      an ICA-based management strategy in stable chest pain patients with intermediate pretest
      probability (10-60%) of coronary artery disease. The primary outcome measure is the
      occurrence of MACE (MACE = major adverse cardiovascular events; defined as at least one of
      the following: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke)
      after a maximum follow-up of 4 years after CT or ICA. Secondary outcomes include health
      related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, cross-over to ICA/CT. Procedural complications
      are classified into major and minor. Major procedural complications are a composite end-point
      and include death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and further complications
      prolonging hospitalization by at least 24 hrs. Possible procedural complications: Hematoma at
      the puncture site, secondary bleeding at the puncture site, bradycardia, angina without
      infarction, allergoid contrast agent reaction, stent migration, hypotension requiring
      treatment, headache, hyperthyreodism, skin tissue and nerve injuries, extravasate, cardiac
      arrhythmia, contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), infections, femoral arterial occlusion (or
      arterial access vessel) or dissection, new requirement for dialysis, DVT/pulmonary embolism,
      closure or injury of vessels, injury of the heart (e.g. valve or myocardium), cardiac
      tamponade, perforation, retroperitoneal bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, genital-urinary
      bleeding, other major bleeding, red blood cell (RBC)/whole blood transfusion,twisting or
      rupture of the catheter part, other equipment mishaps (e.g. retained foreign body guidewire
      fracture), development of arterio-venous fistula(s), development of pseudo aneurysm at
      puncture site, dissection, permanent edema (e.g. due to lymphatic congestion at puncture
      site), embolisation of central or peripheral vessels due to thromboembolis, acute closure of
      coronary vessels, stent infection, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, wrong patient or wrong
      procedure and other.

      This study is a European multicentre study conducted at 20 clinical centres in 15 European
      countries and is methodologically based on the single-centre CAD-Man trial conducted by
      Charit√© (NCT00844220). The pragmatic approach of the study ensures generating practical and
      usable outcomes for clinical decision-making according to comparative effectiveness research
      methodology.

      In a preceding pilot study, data for cost-effectiveness analyses and image-quality analyses
      are collected and methods are defined for implementation in the main PRCT. Also appropriate
      instruments for health related quality of life are being chosen. DISCHARGE receives funding
      from the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission (EC-GA 603266).

    <measure>Comparison of population of pilot study between the different European clinical sites</measure>
    <time_frame>up to a maximum of 2 years after completion of pilot study at all sites</time_frame>
    <description>The pilot study is not a prospective randomised trial. Inclusion of patients with a pretest-likelihood greater than 60% was allowed due to retrospective calculation of pretest likelihood. Thus, the population in the pilot study differs from the population being included in the DISCHARGE main trial.
As cost-effectiveness data will be calculated using data from the pilot study, controlling for age, gender, pretest-likelihood, and quality of live related parameters and others is essential. The prevalence of coronary artery disease will be assessed by site.</description>

    <description>Previous cardiac examination results will be assessed in the pilot study, reflecting the routinely performed tests before referral to Computed Tomography Angiography and Invasive Coronary Angiography.

    <description>Composite outcome: Group (CTA vs ICA) differences in health-related QoL instruments (SF-12 self-rated health item, SF-12 physical component summary score, EuroQol 5d-3L and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Hypothesis: There will be no group differences in QoL at 1 year and final follow-up. We will analyse sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical predictors of changes in QoL (SF-12 physical component and VAS) between baseline and 1 year / final follow-up, separately for men and women. Important clinical predictors include significant CAD findings during the course of the study, changes in chest pain severity (Angina class), occurrence of MICE / MACE as well as baseline risk factor status (BMI, diabetes, smoking, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol intake).</description>
