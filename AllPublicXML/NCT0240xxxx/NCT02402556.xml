  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Mother Child Education Program (MOCEP)—a group-based early childhood
      development parenting education program—is to provide school-readiness and parenting skills
      to mothers of young children who do not have access to preschool education services. The
      MOCEP intervention also provides a setting in which caregivers can model pro-social behaviors
      and practice conflict resolution techniques directly with young children.

      The purpose of the evaluation study is to rigorously evaluate the impact of MOCEP on child
      and parent outcomes among Palestinian refugees in Beirut, Lebanon. This evaluation employs an
      innovative, mixed-methods bio-behavioral approach to investigate the associations among
      social contexts; maternal, child and family functioning; and reduction in violence through
      the promotion of harmonious family relationships. The results of this study have implications
      for improving the lives of and reducing violence for the hundreds of thousands of families
      with young children living in fragile contexts. We hypothesize that when MOCEP is implemented
      with fidelity (i.e., delivered as intended by design), participating families will experience
      reduced violence in their homes and have better individual and intra-family outcomes than
      families who do not participate in the program.

    <description>For ethical reasons, no one recruited will be excluded from the opportunity to benefit from the intervention. MOCEP group will be the primary intervention group and the second group will act as the wait-listed control group. Although the families in the wait-listed control group will start out as a control group (not receiving the intervention), they will have the opportunity to participate in the intervention in a later round of implementation, after the intervention group has completed the program.</description>
