  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib/II, multi-center, open-label study of IMCgp100 as a single agent and
      in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and/or tremelimumab in metastatic cutaneous
      melanoma. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of IMCgp100 in combination
      with durvalumab (MEDI4736, programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] inhibitor), tremelimumab (CLTA-4
      inhibitor), and the combination of durvalumab with tremelimumab compared to single-agent
      IMCgp100 alone. The study will enroll patients who have metastatic melanoma that is
      refractory to treatment with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor as well as patients naive to therapy in
      the metastatic setting.

      Recent biologic evidence indicates that optimal responses to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)
      directed therapy require the presence of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment and thus
      therapies such as IMCgp100 that recruit these effector cells to the tumor may overcome
      pre-existing resistance to checkpoint blockade. This emerging biology of checkpoint inhibitor
      resistance suggests the combination of IMCgp100 with checkpoint inhibition may have enhanced
      activity in patients with pre-existing resistance.

             requiring medical intervention, per institutional protocol. Testing for HBV or HCV
             status is not necessary unless clinically indicated or the patient has a history of

             treated hepatitis is not exclusionary

         11. Malignant disease, other than that being treated in this study. Exceptions to this
             exclusion include the following: malignancies that were treated curatively and have
             not recurred within 2 years after completion of treatment; completely resected basal
             cell and squamous cell skin cancers; any malignancy considered to be indolent and that
             has never required therapy; and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type

         12. Any medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, prevent the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns, compliance with
             clinical study procedures or interpretation of study results

         13. Systemic anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment. For
             cytotoxic agents that have major delayed toxicity and any prior immunotherapy
             approach, 4 weeks is indicated as washout period

         14. Presence of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (NCI CTCAE) ≥ grade 2 toxicity (except alopecia, peripheral neuropathy and
             ototoxicity, which are excluded if ≥ NCI CTCAE grade 3) due to prior cancer therapy

         15. Chronic systemic corticosteroid use (ie, prednisone &gt; 10 mg QD or the equivalent of
             longer duration than 8 weeks for any medical condition) or history of chronic
             corticosteroid use (longer than 8 weeks duration) within the past 6 months; treatment
             for well-controlled and asymptomatic adrenal insufficiency is permitted, but
             replacement dosing is limited to prednisone ≤ 10 mg QD or the equivalent, and patients
             must have no history of adrenal crisis. Local steroid therapies (eg, otic, ophthalmic,
             intra-articular or inhaled medications) are acceptable

         16. Use of any live vaccines against infectious diseases within 4 weeks of initiation of
             study treatment. Non-live vaccination (eg, influenza) are permitted anytime during
             treatment

         17. Major surgery as defined by the investigator within 2 weeks of the first dose of study
             treatment (minimally invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy, tumor biopsy, insertion
             of a central venous access device, and insertion of a feeding tube are not considered
             major surgery)

         18. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug, with the exception of
             palliative radiotherapy to a limited field, such as for the treatment of bone pain or
             a focally painful tumor mass

         19. Use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (eg, G-CSF, GMCSF, M-CSF) ≤ 2
             weeks prior start or study drug. Patients must have completed therapy at least 2 weeks
             before the screening period begins with any hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth
             factors. An erythroid stimulating agent is allowed as long as it was initiated at
             least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and the patient is not red
             blood cell transfusion dependent

         20. Pregnant or lactating women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after
             conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG
             laboratory test

         21. Women of child-bearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male
             partner, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless
             they are using highly effective contraception from screening throughout study
             treatment, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 6 months after the
             final dose of investigational product; cessation of birth control after this point
             should be discussed with a responsible physician. Highly effective methods include the
             following:

               -  Total abstinence from sexual relations for the duration of the treatment when
                  applicable to the lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
                  acceptable methods of contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, this applies only when the reproductive status of
                  the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to Screening). For female patients on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient

               -  The combination of any 2 of the following methods when both are used
                  simultaneously:

                    1. Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) when used with spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or
                       used of a spermicidal vaginal suppository Women of child-bearing potential
                       must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening. Otherwise, female
                       patients must be post-menopausal (no menstrual period for at least 12 months
                       prior to Screening), or surgically sterile.

         22. Male patients must be surgically sterile or use double barrier contraception method
             from enrollment through treatment and for 6 months following administration of the
             last dose of study drug.
