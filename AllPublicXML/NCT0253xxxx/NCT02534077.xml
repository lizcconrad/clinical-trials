  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Critically ill infants with either a known anatomic short gut (greater than 50% of the
             bowel removed) or known severe dysmotility of the gut reflecting non-functional gut
             similar to anatomic short gut will be offered Omegaven® when their direct bilirubin
             reaches 2 mg/dL. Infants who do not meet the above criteria for anatomic or
             dysfunctional short gut will be allowed to receive Omegaven® when their direct
             bilirubin reaches 4 mg/dL. The qualifying measurements of 2 mg/dL or 4 mg/dL direct
             bilirubin must be consecutive and obtained at least 24 hours apart.

          2. Be expected to require intravenous nutrition for at least an additional 28 days

          3. Patient must have documented failure of or ineligibility for the following therapies
             to prevent progression of PNALD:

               -  Reduction of Intralipid® to 1 g/kg/day

               -  Limiting trace minerals including copper and manganese

               -  Initiation and use of Ursodiol

               -  Cycling of parenteral nutrition

               -  Advancement of enteral feedings

          4. Parental informed consent must be signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a congenitally lethal condition (e.g. Trisomy 13).

          2. Have clinically severe bleeding not able to be managed with routine measures.

          3. Have evidence of a viral hepatitis or primary liver disease as the primary etiology of
             their cholestasis.

          4. Have other health problems such that survival is extremely unlikely even if the
             infant's cholestasis improves.

          5. Has culture positive sepsis
