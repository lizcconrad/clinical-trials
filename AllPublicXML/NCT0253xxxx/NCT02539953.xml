  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in ten patients on rivaroxaban therapy have dizziness and reductions in blood pressure.
      The investigators intend to monitor the ambulatory blood pressure of such patients in order
      to assess whether this is a true haemodynamic effect.

             and twice daily dosing can be included

          -  Have measurable rivaroxaban levels on at least one occasion (this will be in line with
             standard of care, there will be no extra blood samples for the study)

          -  Not taking concomitant medication that can affect rivaroxaban metabolism (including
             amiodarone, dronedarone, -azole antifungals, protease inhibitors)

          -  On no antihypertensive or vasoactive medication

          -  Have a baseline BP recording taken in clinic

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide written, informed consent

          -  Presence of concomitant medication that may alter rivaroxaban levels and confound
             results (see above)

          -  Unwilling to undergo ambulatory blood pressure monitoring

          -  Contraindication to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
