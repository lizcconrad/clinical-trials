  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medtronic is sponsoring the Micra Registry to further confirm safety and effectiveness of the
      Micra Transcatheter Pacing System (Micra system) when used as intended, in &quot;real-world&quot;
      clinical practice, following commercial release.

      The Micra Registry is conducted within Medtronic's Product Surveillance Registry.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Micra Registry is a global, prospective, observational, multi-site registry. Patients
      enrolled in the Micra Registry will be prospectively followed for a minimum of 9 years
      post-implant or until registry closure, patient death, patient exit from the registry (i.e.,
      withdrawal of consent), or unless patient is participating in an acute performance sub-study
      of the Micra Registry*.

      Enrolled patients will have scheduled follow-up visits at least annually or as prompted by
      reportable adverse events; however, all Micra system follow-up patient visits are to be
      reported. Therefore, if more frequent scheduled visits occur per a provider's standard care
      practice, those visits are reported. The total estimated registry duration is 11 years.

      *Patients contributing to an acute performance sub-study of the Micra Registry do not
      contribute to the FDA-regulated Post-Approval Study which includes a long-term (minimum
      9-year) patient follow-up period.

    <description>The Micra system is a miniaturized single chamber pacemaker system that is delivered via catheter through the femoral vein and is implanted directly inside the right ventricle of the heart. The Micra implantable device is a self-contained, hermetically enclosed, miniaturized single chamber pacemaker. The device is fixated via four electrically inactive nitinol tines, located on the distal end of the device.</description>

      <textblock>
        Patients intended to be implanted with a Micra system are eligible for enrollment and all
        patients must be consented prior to the Micra system implant. As such, only geographies
        with regulatory approval for the Micra system are eligible to enroll patients (see
        locations section).

        All patients enrolled and successfully implanted with a Micra system will be followed for a
        minimum of 9 years, unless a patient is exited from the registry due to an unavoidable
        reason such as death, physician discretion, or patient withdrawal of consent, or unless the
        patient is participating in an acute performance sub-study of the Micra Registry. If a
        Micra system is not successfully implanted, patients will be exited from the registry
        unless a Micra System and/or implant procedure related event is identified, for which the
        patient will be followed until the event is resolved or no further actions need to be
        taken.
