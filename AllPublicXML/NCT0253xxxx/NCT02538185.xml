      The study is planned as a single-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled,
      comparative Phase I, first-in-man study to assess the safety and tolerability of the
      NanoJect™ device, and the immunogenicity of the rabies vaccine &quot;Vaccin rabique Pasteur®&quot;
      delivered with the NanoJect™ device by ID route.

      This study will enroll 66 volunteers randomly assigned to one of the three study arms. Each
      volunteer will receive three injections at each of three vaccination visits. Total study
      duration per volunteer is 2 months.

             updated contact information as necessary, and has no current plans to move from the
             study area for the duration of the study.

          -  Agrees to avoid elective surgery for the duration of the study.

          -  For female subjects: agrees to avoid pregnancy through the duration of the study.

          -  Is in good general health, confirmed by medical history, physical examination and
             screening laboratory tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             Normal (ULN) or &gt;10% below Lower Limit of Normal (LLN)) and abnormal biochemistry
             values from blood collected at screening (&gt;10% above ULN or &gt;10% below LLN). Analysis
             can be repeated upon request of the clinician.

          -  History or evidence of autoimmune disease.

          -  History or evidence of any past, present, or future possible immunodeficiency state,

             antibodies or anti-hepatitis C antibodies.Participation in any other investigational
             study during the study period.

          -  Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 90 days prior to study visit 2.

          -  Received any investigational drug therapy or investigational vaccine within 180 days

             investigator, may compromise the safety of the subject (Notably: allergy to active

          -  Medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, will make it unlikely that the subject will comply with the
             protocol.

          -  History or evidence of any brain disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             interfere with the vaccine and compromise the safety of the subject.

          -  Abnormal urinalysis at the screening visit that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             is clinically significant.

          -  Skin coloration (skin color, tattoo, freckles) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could interfere with injection reactogenicity assessment.

             immunization.
