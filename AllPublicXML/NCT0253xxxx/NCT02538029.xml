  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the proposed project is to characterize dual tasking (DT) deficits to
      improve motor, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes in individuals with Parkinson's
      disease (PD). Phase 1 of the intervention will involve an in-depth gait analysis on 15
      individuals with PD. This gait analysis will utilize the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation
      Environment (CAREN) system, a virtual reality system with a fully integrated 3-D motion
      capture system. The purpose of Phase 1 is to generalize characteristics of gait and postural
      control during specific DT conditions. Phase 2 (N=20) involves the clinical translation of
      these findings. This phase will involve creating a clinical intervention based on the
      objective information gathered the CAREN system. The intervention will take place 3x/week for
      a total of 8 weeks. Interventional groups will include: 1) DT clinical group (N=10) and 2)
      Single task group (N=10). Outcome measures will be used at the beginning and end of the
      intervention to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention.
