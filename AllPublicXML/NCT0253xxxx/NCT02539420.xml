  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though BiPAP is an increasingly common tool used by pediatric critical care physicians and
      there is promising data suggesting a role for BiPAP in the management of status asthmaticus,
      more information is needed to more definitively clarify the extent of its benefit, as well as
      when during an asthma exacerbation and in whom it is the most beneficial. In this study,
      which is among the first randomized studies of BiPAP use for status asthmaticus in the
      pediatric population, the investigators hope to better elucidate these issues to help guide
      clinicians' future management decisions.

             pressure ventilation

          -  Intracranial problems (such as in the setting of head injury) that may be negatively
             affected by positive pressure ventilation

          -  Respiratory compromise for which emergent endotracheal intubation or non-invasive
             positive pressure ventilation is warranted as determined by the on-service attending
