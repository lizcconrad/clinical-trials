  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is the evaluation of system accuracy following ISO 15197:2013
      (E), clause 6.3 in which accuracy requirements and applicable test procedures for blood
      glucose monitoring systems intended for self-monitoring of blood glucose by patients are
      stipulated. In this study, system accuracy evaluation will be performed with CE-marked BGMS
      (BGMS = Blood Glucose Monitoring System) common among insulin pump users - Accu-Chek Aviva
      Nano and Accu-Chek Performa Nano (Roche Diagnostics), FreeStyle Lite (Abbott Diabetes Care),
      OneTouch Verio IQ (LifeScan) Contour Next Link 2.4 (Bayer Healthcare Diabetes Care) and
      Accu-Chek Mobile with three different reagent system lots for each BGMS.

      The study will be performed in 2 parts. Each part will comprise testing of 3 BGMS.

    <description>System accuracy criteria
Following ISO 15197:2013 (E), the BGMS shall meet both of the following criteria:
Criterion A: 95 % of the measured glucose values shall fall within either ± 15 mg/dl (0.83 mmol/l) of the average comparison measurement result at glucose concentrations &lt; 100 mg/dl (5.55 mmol/l) or within ± 15 % at glucose concentrations ≥ 100 mg/dl (5.55 mmol/l).
Each lot shall pass acceptability criterion A.
Criterion B: 99 % of individual glucose measured values shall fall within zones A and B of the Consensus Error Grid (CEG) for type 1 diabetes.
Applying ISO 15197:2003 accuracy criteria:
95 % of the measured glucose values shall fall within either ± 15 mg/dl (0.83 mmol/l) of the average comparison measurement result at glucose concentrations &lt; 75 mg/dl (4.2 mmol/l) or within ± 20 % at glucose concentrations ≥ 75 mg/dl (4.2 mmol/l).</description>
