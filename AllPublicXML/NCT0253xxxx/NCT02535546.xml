  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly get
      exacerbations of their illness which have many potential triggers including infection. The
      most common cause of lung infection/pneumonia is an organism named Streptococcus pneumoniae.
      In Ireland a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV-13) was recently introduced into
      the childhood vaccination programme. This study aims to investigate the carriage rate of S.
      pneumoniae in COPD patients over one year and to determine if isolates of S. pneumoniae found
      within the COPD population would be covered by the PCV-13 vaccine.

      This study aims to determine the potential contribution of S. pneumoniae to the morbidity of
      patients with COPD in Ireland and if the PCV-13 has potential for reducing infective
      exacerbations in this cohort. A group of 150 COPD patients are being monitored at quarterly
      intervals over one year. At each study visit patients report changes to COPD-related
      medication, recent hospitalisations and exacerbations and provide a sputum sample (or
      pharyngeal swab if not possible) which is assessed for the presence of S. pneumoniae.

      The specific objectives of the study are:

        1. To monitor the carriage rate of pneumococci in a cohort of Irish patients with COPD
           during and outside periods of acute exacerbation over a one year period.

        2. To assess the COPD exacerbation rate amongst this group of patients.

        3. To monitor changes in the proportion of patients positive for pneumococci carriage over
           a full season and to document those patients intermittently or permanently colonised.

        4. To characterise S. pneumoniae isolates carried by COPD patients in terms of their
           genetic evolution, comparison with strains in other countries, and antimicrobial
           susceptibility.

        5. To assess the proportion of colonised COPD patients that would be covered by current and
           future pneumococcal vaccines.

    <description>COPD patients are met with at quarterly intervals over one year. At each meeting patients report recent COPD exacerbations, hospitalisations and medication use, as well as scores for disease severity. This data is being used to determine if there is a correlation between disease severity and the seasons in COPD patients.</description>
