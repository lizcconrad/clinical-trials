      The aim is compare and correlate skeletal muscle and erythrocytes fatty acids (FAs) profiles
      in adult healthy human after caloric restriction and acute exercise in order to validate
      erythrocyte FAs profile as marker of changes in muscle fatty acid composition.

      The study was performed with 11 healthy sportsmen participating in a caloric restriction
      trial for 1 month. The participants follow a caloric restriction, 30-40% respect to the usual
      diet of each participant, three alternate days weekly along 4 weeks. After the caloric
      restriction period the participants realized an exercise stress test. For each participant
      one blood sample and muscular biopsy were obtained after acute exercise and caloric
      restriction intervention. All the participants were informed of the purpose and demands of
      the study before giving their written consent to participate. The study protocol was in
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for research on human participants and was
      approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Consell Català de l'Esport.

    <description>Muscular biopsy was obtained from vastus lateralis of the quadricipitalis muscle. The dermis was cut for to display muscular aponeurosis (&lt;2.5 cm) after clean and sterilize the biopsy zone. Next the aponeurosis was cut and a puncture with Vacora® device (Bard Biopsy Systems, Tempe, AZ, USA) was realized. The injury was cleaned and sutured, and the muscular sample was stored at -80ºC until FA analyses..FA composition of skeletal muscle were determined by gas chromatography.</description>

    <description>Venous blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein of participants with vacutainers containing EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) as anticoagulant (6 mL) to purify erythrocytes following an adaptation of the method described elsewhere (Boyum, 1964; Sureda et al., 2006). Erythrocyte fraction was obtained after centrifugation (900 x g, 30 min, 4ºC). Then, erythrocytes were cleaned with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged (900 x g, 20 min, 4ºC) and lysed with water at initial blood volume. Cell lysates were stored at -80ºC until FA analyses. FA composition of erythrocytes were determined by gas chromatography.</description>
