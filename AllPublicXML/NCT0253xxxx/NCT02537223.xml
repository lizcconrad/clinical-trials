  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study (the first step in testing a new drug or combination, to see how safe
      the drug and/or combination are) of investigational agent BYL719 in patients with locally
      advanced head and neck cancer (LA-SCCHN) in combination with standard radiation and
      chemotherapy (cisplatin).

      BYL719 is a new drug that is able to bind (attach to) and block a protein called PI3K-alpha.
      PI3K-alpha is part of an important pathway called EGFR/PI3K/Akt. A pathway is a series of
      chemical reactions among proteins in the cells that are involved in the support of normal
      cellular function. If the pathway is too active, due to changes in those proteins, the
      pathway can lead to tumor cell growth, survival and invasion. BYL719 has been shown to stop
      cancers in laboratory and animal studies.

      This study is the first time BYL719 will be combined with radiation and chemotherapy.

      Participants will be screened for eligibility within 30 days of the intended start of the
      study treatment. Procedures for research purposes done during screening include archival
      tumor tissue collection for pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarker research and optional
      HPV status (if not already known).

      Eligible participants will take BYL719, by mouth, once a day, starting one week prior to
      start of radiation and chemotherapy, for 8 weeks. The starting dose of BYL719 is 200 mg.
      Participants will be asked to record their doses on a study drug diary. Participants will
      also receive radiation therapy every day from Monday to Friday for 7 weeks.

      Chemotherapy (cisplatin) will be given intravenously on Monday of weeks 1, 4, and 7 (48 hour
      window during weeks 4 and 7).

      While receiving the study treatment, participants will have tests and procedures done once
      every week for safety purposes.

      After the end of the study treatment, participants will be asked to visit the centre every 2
      weeks up to week 8 for additional tests and procedures for safety purposes. Between week 8-12
      after completing the study treatment, participants will have tumor measurements done to
      assess efficacy.

      Participants will continued to be followed every 3 months up to 1 year, then every 6 months
      for 2 years (total of 3 years).
