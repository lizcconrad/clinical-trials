  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a multi-organ systemic disease characterized by
      activation of immune cells, which results in vascular dysfunction (vasculopathy) and
      subsequent scarring (fibrosis). SSc has a higher than expect prevalence in the US military.
      On a national level there are 5,766 SSc patients (ICD-9 710.1) presently cared for in the
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA). While there is no cure for SSc, studies of therapeutics
      that can help slow disease progression are valuable to our Veterans. This proposal addresses
      the solicitation for projects with attention to SSc requested by President Obama after
      reviewing potential contamination of water at Camp Lejeune. This proposal is a
      patient-centered outreach for our Veterans with SSc to inform and prevent catastrophic
      endstage vascular abnormalities, including digital ulcers, pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (PAH) and scleroderma renal crisis in SSc. The study proposes a novel application of a
      therapeutic for this disease. A better understanding of the initiating insult and natural
      progression of SSc vasculopathy is needed in order to develop therapeutics with a goal of
      curing/treating the underlying disease. This project has the potential to impact not only
      Veterans with SSc, but also those with vascular abnormalities including digital ulcers, PAH,
      and renal crisis. This proposal represents a potential major therapeutic advance for our
      Veterans with SSc.

    <textblock>
      Although SSc is heterogeneous in the extent of organ involvement and prognosis, it is
      accepted that all SSc cases have a progressive and usually devastating course. Since
      vasculopathy precedes fibrosis in this disease, a focus on understanding its natural history
      and preventative measures for vascular dysfunction has profound implications. This pilot work
      suggests that measurement of endothelial dysfunction with flow mediated dilatation (FMD)
      holds promise as novel method to assess disease progression as well as the therapeutic
      efficacy of the pharmacologic compound tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in SSc. The investigators
      believe that BH4, which targets the endothelium, has great promise to reduce SSc-related
      tissue hypoxia, end organ damage, and potentially may impact underlying disease progression.
      The first aim will adopt an integrative approach and validate a novel, non-invasive
      technique, FMD to define vasculopathy in SSc. The second aim will examine if BH4 is effective
      in ameliorating vascular dysfunction in patients with SSc. The third aim will determine the
      role of oxidative stress in BH4-mediated improvements in vascular function in patients with
      SSc. The overarching goal of these aims is to improve vasculopathy detection and management
      in Veterans with SSc.

    <description>Validate a non-invasive vascular measurement technique (FMD) through evaluation of vasculopathy in patients with SSc and predict end-stage vasculopathy development (i.e., DU, PAH, and/or SRC), in patients with SSc without previous complications.
Routine health assessments and patient reported outcomes (PRO) will be captured and FMD testing will be performed at baseline and at 6 mo intervals during clinic visits. The pilot data suggests FMD may predict patients at risk for DU. The goal is to use the predictive value of FMD to understand the development of SSc vasculopathy complications. The impact of this research will address the current challenge in clinical practice of monitoring and targeting SSc vasculopathy.</description>
