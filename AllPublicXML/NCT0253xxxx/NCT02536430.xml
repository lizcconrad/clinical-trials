      The aim of this study was to determine whether combining an intraoral injection of a non
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Ketorolac), in association with conventional inferior
      alveolar nerve block, would improve the success rate in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.
      Forty adult volunteers with including criteria has been randomly divided into two groups
      (n=20). All patients received standard inferior alveolar nerve block injection. After
      achieving the lip numbness, one group received a buccal infiltration of Ketorolac and the
      other one received a buccal infiltration of Normal Saline as placebo. Any pain during root
      canal treatment has been recorded using analog visual scale. The success was considered as
      none or mild pain during treatment. The data have been analyzed using Mann-U-Whitney and
      chi-squared tests.

      Objectives:

      The aim of this study was to determine whether combining an intraoral injection of a non
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Ketorolac), in association with conventional inferior
      alveolar nerve block, would improve the success rate in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

      Design: Randomized double blind clinical trial

      Setting and conduct: Forty adult volunteers will randomly divide into two groups (n=20). All
      patients will receive standard inferior alveolar nerve block injection of 4% Articaine with
      1:100000 epinephrine and supplemental buccal infiltration of 0.9 mL 4% Articaine with
      1:100000 epinephrine. After five minutes when the lip numbness was achieved, one group
      received supplemental buccal infiltration of 30 mg/mL of Ketorolac Tromethamine and other
      group received buccal infiltration of normal saline. Endodontic access preparation initiated
      after 15 minutes of initial IANB with two negative responses to the electric pulp test. Pain
      during caries and dentin removal, access cavity preparation and canal length measurements has
      been recorded using visual analog scale (VAS). The success was considered as none or mild
      pain during the treatment. The data have been analyzed using Mann-U-Whitney and chi-squared
      tests.

      Participants including major eligibility criteria: all patients with symptomatic irreversible
      pulpitis (Heft Parker VAS ≥54) of a mandibular molar tooth without systemic diseases; non
      smoking; without any medicine consumption or analgesic and sedation Intervention: Ketorolac
      infiltration

      Main outcome measures : Pain during caries and dentin removal , access cavity preparation and
      canals length measurements using VAS.
