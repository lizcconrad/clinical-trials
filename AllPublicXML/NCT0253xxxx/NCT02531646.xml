  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the imaging performance of Dual Energy and Digital
      Tomosynthesis (DE-DT) application against the commercially available predicate devices.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acquisition system will consist of using site equipment including the CARESTREAM
      DRX-Evolution x-ray system, and the predicate CARESTREAM DRX Plus detector and the
      investigational DE-DT application.

      DE Study Design Thirty to forty (30-40) patients will receive a DR standard of care chest
      exam using the DRX Plus detector and a DE exam. Each DE patient exam includes high energy and
      low energy image exposures using the investigational device. These images are used by the DE
      console software to generate additional DE images (e.g. bone and soft tissue).

      DT Study Design Fifteen to twenty (15-20) patients will receive a DR standard of care chest
      exam using the DRX Plus detector, and a DT exam. Each DT patient exam includes a scout image
      (chest PA) and a DT scan using the investigational DT SW. The DT scan is used by the DT
      console software to generate tomographic images.

      11 phantoms of various anatomy will be imaged with linear tomography (LT) as predicate and DT
      for investigational.

    <description>1-1.9-Non-diagnostic Unacceptable for diagnostic purposes. Little or no clinically usable diagnostic information (e.g., gross underexposure, system failure or extensive motion artifact). Almost all such imaging should be repeated. 2-2.9-Limited Acceptable, with some technical defect (motion artifact, body habitus/poor x-ray penetration, or patient positioning may limit visualization of some body-regions but still adequate for diagnostic purposes). Not as much diagnostic information as is typical for an examination of this type, but likely sufficient. 3-3.9-Diagnostic Image quality that would be expected routinely when imaging cooperative patients. 4-Exemplary Good, most adequate for diagnostic purposes. Image quality that can serve as an example that should be emulated.</description>

Little or no clinically usable diagnostic information (e.g., gross underexposure, system failure or extensive motion artifact). Almost all such imaging should be repeated. 2-2.9-Limited Acceptable, with some technical defect (motion artifact, body habitus/poor x-ray penetration, or patient positioning may limit visualization of some body-regions but still adequate for diagnostic purposes). Not as much diagnostic information as is typical for an examination of this type, but likely sufficient. 3-3.9-Diagnostic Image quality that would be expected routinely when imaging cooperative patients. 4-Exemplary Good, most adequate for diagnostic purposes.

Little or no clinically usable diagnostic information (e.g., gross underexposure, system failure or extensive motion artifact). Almost all such imaging should be repeated. 2-2.9-Limited Acceptable, with some technical defect (motion artifact, body habitus/poor x-ray penetration, or patient positioning may limit visualization of some body-regions but still adequate for diagnostic purposes). Not as much diagnostic information as is typical for an examination of this type, but likely sufficient. 3-3.9-Diagnostic Image quality that would be expected routinely when imaging cooperative patients. 4-Exemplary Good, most adequate for diagnostic purposes.
