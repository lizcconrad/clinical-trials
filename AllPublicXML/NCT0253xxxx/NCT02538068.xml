  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about psychosocial factors that contribute to adopting
      physical activity. The goal of this study is to improve upon existing theories of behavior
      change in order to help other people become more physically active.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between personal life meaning and
      purpose and physical activity maintenance in a group of previously sedentary adults starting
      new exercise programs. Participants complete questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12
      weeks after starting an exercise program. Participants are randomly assigned to complete
      questionnaires about daily meaning, mood, and activity for the first 4 weeks or to complete 8
      random questionnaires about daily activities over the first 4 weeks. It is hypothesized that
      personal life meaning and purpose will be related to greater exercise participation at 12
      weeks.

Participants complete a YMCA 3-minute step test for cardiovascular fitness (assessment of resting heart rate and recovery heart rate), a sit-and-reach test for flexibility, and a grip strength test for strength. Participants objective scores on these tests will be categorized on scales from 1 (poor fitness) to 5 (excellent fitness) based on age and gender and combined for a total fitness score (ranging from 4 to 20).</description>
