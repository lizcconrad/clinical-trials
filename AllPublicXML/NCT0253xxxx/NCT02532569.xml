      A multi-center, open, phase 4 clinical trial to assess the long-term immunogenicity and
      safety of fourth administration of Boryung Cell-Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine inj.
      and to conduct an exploratory investigation on vaccine interchangeability in Korean children
      aged 6 years who received primary 3 doses with ENCEVAC® or Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine-GCC®
      inj.

      This is a follow-up study of KD287-BR-CT-301 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01150942), a
      phase 3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of a cell-culture Japanese encephalitis
      vaccine (ENCEVAC®) compared with that of a mouse brain-derived Japanese encephalitis vaccine
      (Japanese Encephalitis vaccine-GCC® inj). Subjects participated in KD287-BR-CT-301 study were
      to receive 3 doses of Japanese encephalitis vaccine (JEV) assigned by randomization from the
      age of 12 months and those subjects who completed the 3 doses of JEV are the target
      population in this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term
      immunogenicity and safety of the booster (fourth) dose of JEV, which will be given as Boryung
      Cell-Culture Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine inj, proven to be same with ENCEVAC® but
      manufactured by a different manufacturer.
