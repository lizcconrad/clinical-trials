      The purpose of this study is to use a new imaging drug called 11C-choline that is used with a
      PET/CT scan to see prostate cancer when it cannot be seen well on other scans, such as bone
      scans, CT or MRI.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate initially treated with
             curative intent (surgery and radiation therapy are most common treatments but other
             treatments are also eligible).

          -  Biochemical recurrence defined as any of the following:

               1. PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL in at least two sequential tests for patients treated with
                  surgery.

               2. PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL above the post therapy nadir for patients treated with radiation
                  therapy, brachytherapy or cryotherapy.

               3. PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml above the most recent therapy nadir for patients who have
                  received additional treatment in the recurrent setting

          -  Patient must have undergone standard-of-care restaging that does not clearly identify
             site(s) of active disease, or such prior studies must show equivocal findings for
             which further work-up is considered necessary to make clinical decision. Standard
             staging examinations may include one or more of the following: CT or MRI, bone imaging
             (either Tc-99m bisphosphonate scintigraphy MDP or F-18 sodium fluoride PET), FDG PET,
             or In-111 capromab pendetide scintigraphy no older than 3 months of consent date.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patient must be able to tolerate PET/CT imaging.

          -  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not have claustrophobia that would preclude PET/CT imaging or other
             contraindications to CT imaging.
