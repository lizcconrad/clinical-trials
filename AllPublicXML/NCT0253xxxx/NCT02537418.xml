      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of durvalumab or of durvalumab with
      tremelimumab that can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects when receiving
      standard chemotherapy and to see what effects the study drugs has on this type of cancer.
      Patients may receive durvalumab alone or in combination with tremelimumab.

      The researchers doing this study are also interested in looking for markers that will help
      predict which patients are most likely to be helped by the study drugs, durvalumab and
      tremelimumab. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the one that does not cause side
      effects in animals. Participants are given durvalumab alone or durvalumab together with
      tremelimumab and are watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure
      the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then new participants
      will be given a higher dose of durvalumab together with tremelimumab. Participants joining
      this study later on will get higher doses of durvalumab together with tremelimumab than
      participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe
      but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.

      The second purpose is to see if there are any differences in the side effects and the way
      durvalumab and tremelimumab are handled in your body when durvalumab is given together at the
      same time with tremelimumab compared to when durvalumab is given after tremelimumab. This is
      called dose level five.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed cancer that is
             advanced / metastatic / recurrent or unresectable and for which no curative therapy
             exists.

               -  Patients must be considered suitable candidates for and eligible to receive one
                  of the regimens (including durvalumab and tremelimumab alone (dose level 5)
                  included in this protocol and which is open to accrual. For each regimen,
                  specific criteria for registration may be applicable to the cohort/dose level to
                  ensure tolerability in the planned phase II or III trials. Centres must confirm
                  that the planned cohort is open to accrual and whether there are any restrictions
                  on tumour types prior to approaching patients.

               -  For etoposide/carboplatin regimen, patients must have untreated small cell lung
                  cancer (SCLC).

               -  If a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from their primary or
                  metastatic tumour) is available, patients must have provided informed consent for
                  the release of the block. All patients must have provided informed consent for
                  correlative studies.

               -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. All radiology
                  studies must be performed within 28 days prior to registration (within 35 days if
                  negative). Patients ideally should have measurable disease.

               -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (0 or 1 for untreated
                  SCLC enrolled to etoposide/carboplatin). Patients with PS 2 must be considered
                  fit for first line cytotoxic or immune based therapy and discussed with CCTG
                  prior to enrolment.

        Previous Therapy

        • Cytotoxic Chemotherapy:

        All Cohorts Except Etoposide-Carboplatin:

        • Patients should not have received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Exceptions may
        be made for selected patients and regimens. Patients planned for dose level 5 may have
        received one line or prior chemotherapy. Consult CCTG before approaching patients.

        Notes: Patients planned for cisplatin regimens should have received no more than 250mg
        mg/m2 prior to cisplatin.

        Etoposide-Carboplatin Cohort:

        • For dose levels 0-3, patients with untreated SCLC must have received two cycles of their
        first etoposide carboplatin regimen prior to registration to that chemotherapy cohort. For
        dose level 4, SCLC patients planned for the etoposide/carboplatin cohort may not have had
        prior chemotherapy regimens and do not have to have their first two cycles of
        etoposide-platinum prior to study entry.

        Other Systemic Therapy:

          -  Patients may have received other prior therapies including immunotherapy, angiogenesis
             inhibitors, PARP inhibitors or signal transduction inhibitors. Patients who have
             received other treatment with PD-L1 / PD-1, CTLA4 or other antibodies must not have
             had intolerable toxicity or required steroids to manage toxicity.

          -  Patients must have recovered from all reversible toxicity related to prior
             chemotherapy or systemic therapy and have adequate washout as follows:

        Longest of one of the following:

          -  5 half lives for investigational agents

          -  Standard cycle length of standard therapies

        Radiation:

        • Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have
        elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of registration. Exceptions may be made
        for low-dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy after consultation with CCTG. Concurrent
        radiotherapy is not permitted. Patients planned for concurrent chemotherapy-radiation are
        not eligible. Patients with curative doses of radiation to marrow-bearing areas may not be
        eligible. Consult CCTG.

        Surgery:

        • Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have elapsed
        between any major surgery and date of registration, and that wound healing has occurred.

          -  Patients must have recovered from any treatment related toxicities prior to
             registration (unless grade 1, irreversible, or considered by investigator as not
             clinically significant).

          -  Hematology:

        Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to registration
             in the trial and prior to tests which are considered to be study specific to document
             their willingness to participate.

        Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those
        physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the study.
        Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the document
        signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be provided with a
        full explanation of the study before consent is requested.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non
             sterilized male partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception
             while on study and for 6 months after the last dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab or
             for 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab alone and consult product monograph for
             standard chemotherapy. Male partners of a female subject and non-sterilized male
             patients who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must
             use male condom plus spermicide while on study and for 6 months after the last dose of
             durvalumab and tremelimumab or for 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab alone
             and consult product monograph for standard chemotherapy. Female partners of a male
             subject must use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible
             physician.

          -  Male patients should also refrain from donating sperm.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this

             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, response assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.
