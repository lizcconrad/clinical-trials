  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to identify positivity rates to three novel
      surfactants (ingredients used in soaps, detergents, and other cleansers that serve to lower
      the surface tension of the skin and remove debris) and co-reactivity with other surfactants
      in patients with known surfactant sensitivity on skin patch testing. The investigators
      hypothesize that subjects who previously tested positive to known allergenic surfactants
      (cocamidopropyl betaine, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, dimethylaminopropylamine, coconut
      diethanolamide, oleamidopropyl dimethylamine, and decyl glucoside) may demonstrate
      co-reactivity to the three novel surfactant sensitizers (sodium lauroyl sarcosinate,
      isostearmidopropyl morpholine lactate, and disodium lauroamphodiacetate) on skin patch
      testing.
