      Primary Objective:

      To assess the local and systemic safety and tolerability of ascending repeated topical doses
      of SAR366234 monotherapy in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension
      (OHT) as compared to latanoprost.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the pharmacodynamic activity of ascending repeated topical doses of SAR366234 in
      patients with OAG or OHT as compared to latanoprost.

      The total study duration for one patient is up to 11 weeks, including a screening period of
      up to 6 weeks run-in (depending on washout requirements), a 4-week treatment period, and a
      1-week follow-up period.

      The study design is also a parallel cohort study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacodynamic activity of SAR366234.

          -  Any corneal abnormalities preventing reliable applanation tonometry.

          -  Closed/barely open anterior chamber angle or a history of acute angle closure in

             in either eye.

          -  Advanced optic nerve abnormality or history of visual field loss in either eye based
             on the assessment of the Investigator which could put the patient at risk of glaucoma
             progression by participating in the study.
