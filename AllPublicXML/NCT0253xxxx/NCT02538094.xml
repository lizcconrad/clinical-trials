  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) can improve certain mental abilities in individuals with multiple sclerosis or
      encephalitis. Participants will be asked to come in daily for two full weeks during which
      time they will undergo cognitive testing and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans. In
      this research, a very weak electrical current is administered to the surface of the scalp
      while participants complete cognitive tasks. The investigators' aim is to find out whether
      tDCS will improve task performance in adults with multiple sclerosis or encephalitis.

      Participants enrolled into this study may be asked to do the following:

        -  Come to the investigators' testing office at the Johns Hopkins Hospital where the tDCS
           equipment is located for 10 study visits.

        -  Grant permission for the researchers to view medical records associated with the
           participant's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or encephalitis (if applicable) and
           general state of health.

        -  Complete a questionnaire and provide a health history in order to verify eligibility to
           participate and be able to safely undergo the experimental procedures.

        -  Complete several computerized, written, and/or aural tasks (i.e., saying words out loud)
           that assess different cognitive functions such as attention, memory, language, or
           processing speed.

        -  Wear electrodes that will be placed on the scalp with a large rubberized band. These
           electrodes will administer very weak electrical current (tDCS) for 30 minutes.

        -  Participate in several study conditions. The exact conditions and their order will be
           randomized. That is, they will vary by chance (like the flip of a coin). Under some
           conditions, the participant might receive active stimulation (tDCS) and under other
           conditions, the participant might receive placebo (or sham) stimulation. Placebo
           stimulation is similar to active tDCS but lasts only a few seconds. However, all groups
           will wear the electrodes for the same length of time to prevent the participant from
           knowing whether they are receiving active tDCS or sham stimulation. The study doctor and
           research staff will know which group the participant is in.

        -  Permission to audio and/or video-tape test sessions for later scoring and observation.
           These tapes will not be viewed by anyone not affiliated with the study without the
           participant's consent.

        -  Have structural, resting-state and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans as a part
           of the study.
