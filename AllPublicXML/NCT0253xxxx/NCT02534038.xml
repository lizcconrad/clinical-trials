  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Disorder and
      must exhibit disinhibition syndrome of sufficient severity to warrant treatment.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study
      consisting of two 6-week treatment periods.

      Approximately 12 participants will be enrolled at approximately 2 centers in the United
      States.

      Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible
      participants will be randomized into the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of a Neurodegenerative Disorder including frontotemporal
             dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal
             degeneration (CBD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DBL), vascular cognitive disorders, or
             Huntington's disease, at least 3 months prior to Baseline

          -  The participant has behavior from 2 of the 3 categories of disinhibited behavior from
             the definition of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia

          -  The behavioral changes are not due to a pre-existing major psychiatric disorder (e.g.,
             schizophrenia, bipolar disease, etc.) and are not due to the direct effect of systemic
             illness, drug action, or substance use

          -  Disinhibition scale score of â‰¥4 on the 3 core disinhibition items of the Frontal
             Behavioral Inventory (FBI) at Screening and Baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with symptoms of disinhibition that is not secondary to Neurodegenerative
             Disorders

          -  Participants with myasthenia gravis

          -  Participants with co-existent clinically significant or unstable systemic diseases
             that could confound the interpretation of the safety results of the study (e.g.,
             malignancy [except skin basal-cell carcinoma or untreated prostate cancer], poorly
             controlled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension, unstable pulmonary, renal or
             hepatic disease, unstable ischemic cardiac disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, or
             unstable valvular heart disease)
