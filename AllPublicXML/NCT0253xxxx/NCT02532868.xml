  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of MK-0457(VX-680), an
      Aurora kinase inhibitor, in participants with advanced solid tumors. Bioavailability of the
      oral formulation will also be assessed. The primary study hypothesis is that administration
      of MK-0457 is sufficiently safe and tolerated to permit further study.
