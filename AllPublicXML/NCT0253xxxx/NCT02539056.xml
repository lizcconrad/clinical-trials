      A clinical trial to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of a CHONDRON (Autologous
      cultured Chondrocyte) for 48weeks, and additional 96weeks in patients with cartilage defects
      in their knees.

      This is an open trial, involving a total of 24 subjects. Subjects who give consent will be
      screened and those who meet trial criteria will receive CHONDRON (Autologous cultured
      Chondrocyte) by transplant. During the trial period, subjects must follow the instructions
      given by principal investigator. Subjects will make 8* hospital visits on a regular basis
      inclusive of hospitalization. During these visits subjects will be examined. For the
      evaluation of safety and efficacy of CHONDRON, examination with doctors, blood samples,
      x-ray, MRI tests, observation with the naked eyes and arthroscopy will be performed. *If
      tissue samples can be collected at screening visit, there will be only 7 visits.

             decision).
