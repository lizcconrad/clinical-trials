  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available in rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) strategy an emerging question is the definition of remission in RA. Today some
      criteria were already proposed and the last one was proposed in 2011.

      All these criteria integrated only clinical criteria without imaging assessment. In this
      context, ultrasound joint is daily performed without definition of remission. A discrepancy
      exists between clinical remission and persistence of active disease with ultrasound joint
      presence of a Doppler effect indicating inflammation and the risk of progression of joint
      damage. A definition of remission in RA could include erosions regression in subchondral bone
      (at best measured by high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT)).

      The main hypothesis is that the reduction of erosion size assessed by HR-pQCT will be
      observed only in the absence of local inflammation measured by Doppler ultrasound in the
      erosion.

      Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blockers have strongly improved RA therapy outcome in terms of
      clinical improvement and structural damage (progression of radiographic lesions). Recent data
      showed that there could be joint bone rebuilt in case of inflammation suppression. HR-pQCT is
      a new technique emerging for bone erosions assessment in RA. Erosions size and volume could
      be reduced with anti-TNF, but with a large interindividual variability. There was no
      correlation between the activity of clinical or ultrasound synovium and evolution of erosion
      HR-pQCT.

    <description>The Xtrem CT scanco device is a HR-pQCT. It was initially used to measure bone density and quantify the bone architecture to 3D at the extremities of the human body.
For the study, the device will be used to measure changes in erosion at the 2nd or 3rd metacarpal head. Only the patient's hand will be in contact with the medical device, the acquisition time will be 3 minutes.</description>
