  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to confirm the superiority of intra-articular collagen
      injection in patients with knee joint pain compared to the control group. 100mm VAS is used
      to measure the pain of the subjects 24 weeks after the procedure.

      This study is a double-blind clinical trial. Two hundred subjects has participated in it. The
      study is explained to the subjects, and they voluntarily choose to participate in it. Their
      eligibility to participate in the study is checked, and they are randomized either into the
      intra-articular collagen injection group or the normal saline (placebo) injection group based
      on a randomization table. They are asked to follow the guidelines of the investigators during
      the study and to visit the hospital five times, including for screening. At each visit, the
      subjects will undergo an examination with doctors, a medical examination by interview, and a
      blood test only when it is necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the injection.

      (*If the subjects performed the screening during the first visit on, the total number of his
      or her additional visits is four.)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Adult patients aged 19 or older 2. Patients with knee joint pain due to
             chondromalacia, osteoarthritis (OA), or traumatic arthritis (TA) 3. Patients with 3 or
             lower score in the Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4. Patients with 40 mm or higher scores in
             the 100 mm VAS pain scale 5. Patients without significant pathological tests at their
             screening visit 6. Patients whose medication is confirmed within one week from their
             study enrolment and who agreed to maintain the medication dose during the study period
             if they need to keep taking it 7. When combination drugs are administered, considering
             the period of the drugs remaining in the body, patients who take the drugs stably for
             2 weeks prior to participating in the trial (based on the screening, if it is
             confirmed that the patients took the drugs stably for 1 week prior to the screening,
             at the enrollment for injection, it should be assessed again, and the patients who are
             confirmed to have taken the drugs stably for 2 weeks prior to the trial could be
             registered).

             8. Patients who, after taking drugs for anesthetic purposes (provided to the subject
             after the injection) within one week after the intra-articular injection, agreed to
             take anti-inflammatory agents for no more than 5 consecutive days and for no more than
             10 days in a month, and could stop taking the drugs within 2 days after the next visit
             even if the pain in the observation site becomes severe and thus additional drugs are
             required.

             9. Patients who agreed to use only the non-drug treatments (i.e., physiotherapy,
             osteopathy, and chiropractic therapy) allowed by the study investigators (Acupuncture
             is not allowed.) 10. Patients who agreed to receive the injection only in one knee
             when they feel pain on both knees (The other knee can be treated with prescribed
             drugs, but articular injections are not allowed.) 11. Patients or their representative
             (for adults) who agreed to participate in the study and signed the informed consent
             form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients or their family members with a history of or an ongoing autoimmune disease

             with grade 4 in the Kellgren-Lawrence grade 6. Patients with severe effusion 7.
             Patients who were injured severely or received injection in their affected knee within
             six months, which would make evaluation of the knee difficult 8. Patients with
             inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, rupus arthrosis, or psoriatic
             arthritis 9. Patients who have gout or calcium pyrophosphate (pseudogout) disease that
             started within six months from the screening visit 10. Patients with a history of
             radiation therapy or cancer treatment within two years 11. Patients with diabetes 12.
             Patients with an infection that required hospitalization for antibiotics or the
             administration of antiseptic agents 13. Patients who have been undergoing
             adrenocortical hormone therapy 14. Patients with liver, heart, or kidney disease 15.
             Patients who had been infected with a virus 16. Patients who have a serious health
             condition that may affect the study results 17. Patients who are pregnant,
             breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant 18. Patients who are considered
             inappropriate for participation in this study due to their condition (e.g., a mental
             illness) based on the investigator's judgment 8-15: The investigator can decide
             whether or not the patient will be administered the injection.
