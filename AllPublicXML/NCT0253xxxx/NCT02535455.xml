  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Innovative approaches are needed to optimize the benefits of treatment as prevention (TasP)
      among HIV+ substance users, who experience profound health disparities that amplify onward
      transmission risk. This project will systematically develop, refine and conduct an open pilot
      to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a two-phase emotion regulation intervention
      that targets emotional barriers to HIV-related self-care among individuals who endorse active
      substance use. Emotional barriers such as shame and internalized stigma have been identified
      as barriers to optimal HIV care among individuals struggling with HIV and substance use. To
      effectively implement TasP, strategies for addressing these barriers are needed. Utilizing
      transdiagnostic approaches (e.g., positive affect-focused emotional regulation, mindfulness
      and self-compassion) investigators will develop, refine and pilot a two-phase emotional
      regulation intervention that requires only 5 face-to-face hours and can ultimately be
      implemented by a case-management-level staff person or trained peer educator. The first phase
      of the intervention will be a multicomponent in-person intervention targeting emotional,
      cognitive and behavioral barriers to HIV self-care behaviors among HIV+ substance users. The
      second phase of the intervention will extend the intervention benefits by sending
      personalized positive self-reappraisal text messages in response to text message queries
      about participants' mood. This phase will use an innovative personalized bi-directional
      platform, which will leverage an existing text message delivery system. This project will be
      instrumental in developing a relatively low-resource intervention strategy to address unmet
      emotional barriers to optimal HIV-care among individuals who are actively using substances.
      This work will provide the necessary pilot data for a subsequent grant submission to assess
      the preliminary efficacy of the intervention. The resulting intervention has the potential to
      address emotional barriers to self-care along the HIV care cascade: including retention in
      care, antiretroviral treatment adherence and persistence, and ultimately viral suppression.

      Investigators will develop and refine a two-phase emotion regulation intervention. This
      process will involve 5 steps: 1) conducting 5-8 key informant interviews, including obtaining
      feedback on a drafted manual and materials from providers and case managers, 2) integrating
      the qualitative data, 3) running 2 participants through a condensed version of the
      intervention and obtaining feedback on the content, language, and text message interface, 4)
      integrating the additional feedback, and 5) conducting an open pilot with 20 participants to
      assess feasibility and acceptability of the revised intervention. The pilot will include 4
      research assessment visits which will involve completion of self-report questionnaires using
      Qualtrics at baseline, within one week of completion of phase 1, within one week of
      completing phase 2, and 4-months following the completion of phase 1. Viral load (VL) and CD4
      tests will be assessed at baseline and VL will be assessed again at the 4-month follow up.

      Qualitative interviews. The investigators will conduct 5-8 semi-structured qualitative
      interviews with providers and case managers. Interviews will inquire about unmet
      psychological barriers to HIV-care, perceptions of proposed domains and text message
      questions and response options. All interviews will be recorded, transcribed and analyzed
      using thematic analysis. Prominent themes and suggestions brought up in the interviews will
      be integrated into the intervention materials and implementation.

      Trial run of pilot. After integrating the feedback from the key informant interviews,
      investigators will recruit two participants to complete a condensed version of the
      intervention. After each of the 5 sessions, participants will be asked to complete perceived
      usefulness surveys. Both participants will then be interviewed to obtain feedback on the
      intervention. These interviews will be recorded, transcribed and analyzed using thematic
      analysis. Prominent themes and suggestions brought up in these interviews as well as logistic
      challenges will be integrated into the intervention materials and implementation procedures.

      Text messages. Investigators will use questions adapted from a previously published
      personalized bi-directional text message intervention involving HIV+ substance users (TxText)
      to assess mood, adherence and substance use. Each participant will receive 3 texts/week
      inquiring about current mood over the course of the intervention. Additionally, in phase 2
      each participant will receive weekly texts asking about their medication adherence. Given the
      stigmatized nature of substance use, investigators will use a coded query, adapted from
      TxText, which assess substance use in the form of a weather question. This coded query
      strategy has demonstrated feasibility and acceptability among a similar population of HIV+
      active substance users. All participants will be reminded of the meaning of this question
      during phase 1. During the last in-person intervention visit, participants will identify 5
      positive self-reappraisal statements and link them to response options to the mood query
      based on when they feel each would be most helpful in regulating their emotions. Throughout
      phase 2, participants will then receive their linked positive-self reappraisal statements in
      response to mood queries. Participants will then be asked to respond on a 6-point scale
      indicating how helpful the positive self-reappraisal was (0=extremely unhelpful to 5=
      extremely helpful), which will be used to assess engagement in phase 2 of the intervention.

      HIV disease markers. Blood samples of 35mL peripheral venous blood sample will be obtained at
      baseline and the final follow-up visit to assess viral load. CD4 count will be assessed at
      baseline to provide personalized feedback on HIV-related self-care. A total of 44 blood
      sample will be obtained, 2 for each participant in the pilot.
