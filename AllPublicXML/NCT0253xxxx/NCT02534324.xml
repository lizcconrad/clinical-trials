  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current guideline of asymptomatic severe hypertension (ASH) treatment in emergency
      department (ED) recommends through low level of evidence that the patients should not be
      rapidly decreased their BP in ED but instead receive oral antihypertensive treatment and
      close outpatient follow-up is needed. Unfortunately, there was some ambiguity in the time
      point of BP measurement in ED described in the past literature because high BP on ED
      admission may significantly decrease within hours without any medications. The importance of
      pre-ED discharge BP, which can still be critically high, that may affect the follow-up
      outcome has never been investigated. The study aim of this study is to evaluate the
      physicians' treatment strategies as well as immediate clinical outcomes between patients with
      severely- and moderately-elevated pre-discharge BP after management of ASH its in ED during
      the recent recommendation. The secondary outcome is to compare the BP at follow-up in these
      two groups.

      The investigators will follow the patients with asymptomatic severe hypertension who attend
      ED of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH), an urban, 1,500-bed,
      university-affiliated, tertiary care hospital as well as treatment strategies. A management
      strategy whether to start the drugs in ED with or without a period of observation or
      immediately after discharge without any observation depends on the treating physicians'
      judgment. The investigators predefined the pre-discharge BP at ED into two groups; high BP
      (pre-discharge SBP &lt; 180 mmHg) and severely high BP (pre-discharge SBP &gt;= 180mmHg) groups.
      Every eligible patient was scheduled for the internal medicine clinic for continuous care of
      the high blood pressure within 3-7 days after discharge. Medical records were retrieved for
      the follow-up BP, compliance and associated adverse events at the clinic. The investigators
      will make telephone follow-ups to the participants or their contact personnel in every case
      at 10 days after ED presentation to identify the deceased cases or those with major morbidity
      as well as the compliance to their medications.
