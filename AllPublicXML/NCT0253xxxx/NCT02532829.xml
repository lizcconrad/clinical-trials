      The HIPER-1 study is a single centre cross sectional study in which a total of 240
      participants (in different metabolic states and surgical models) will receive an Oral Mixed
      Meal Tolerance Test (OMTT). At baseline and after 30, 60 and 120 minutes the PYY levels,
      GLP-1 levels, glucose and insulin sensitivity will be measured. The primary endpoint of the
      study will be the area under the GLP-1 and Peptide - YY curves and insulin sensitivity
      following the OMTT.

    <textblock>
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing worldwide, thus reaching pandemic
      proportions. Diet, exercise and medication remain the cornerstones of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus treatment. But, apart from studies demonstrating promising results in some of the
      developed countries; the long-term success rates of lifestyle and drug modifications are
      disappointing. In cases where classic strategies proved to be inadequate, broad type of
      gastrointestinal (GI) surgery methods offer new alternatives to treat obesity and T2DM. The
      variable levels of incretin stimulation (especially GLP-1) and improved glycaemic control in
      those with diabetes have been shown following various bariatric techniques.

      Therefore, investigators aimed to analyze the levels of GLP-1 and Peptide YY hormones
      together with indices of insulin sensitivity in participants with various health conditions
      and in participants who underwent different surgical options including sleeve gastrectomy,
      minigastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy with ileal transposition and sleeve gastrectomy with
      transit bipartition.
