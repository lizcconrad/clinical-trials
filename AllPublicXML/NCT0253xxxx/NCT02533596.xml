  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is an established treatment modality for the acute removal
      of pathophysiological relevant mediators in various diseases. Adipokines have recently been
      found to play an important role in a variety of immunologic diseases. However, in many of
      these disease states cardiac and inflammatory involvement is common and biomarkers are
      routinely used for diagnosis or assessment of therapeutic success. The effect of TPE on
      biomarkers used in the clinical routine has not been investigated. The aim of this study is
      to determine adipokine and cardiac biomarker removal during TPE therapy.

      We performed a observational prospective single-centered study. Every patient received two
      consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) sessions during the study. Plasma exchange
      therapy was performed using either the Spectra Optia® or the Octo Nova® apheresis system.
      Anticoagulation was applied either by heparin or citrate. The prescribed dose of exchange
      volume of every TPE treatment was 1.1-times the individual calculated total plasma volume,
      using the Nadler-Allen equation. A substitute fluid with 5% albumin concentration was used in
      every treatment. Blood samples for measurement of different adipokines (resistin, leptin,
      soluble ICAM-1, soluble CD40 ligand, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), soluble
      tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNF-R) as well as cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and
      routine chemistry were drawn before (pre-TPE) and at the end (post-TPE) of the first and
      second TPE session.
