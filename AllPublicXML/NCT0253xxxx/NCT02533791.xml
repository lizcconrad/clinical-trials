  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since its first outbreak occurred in 1976, Zaire Ebola virus have been associated with 14
      outbreaks reported up to 2014. The Zaire Ebola virus in 2014 causing the most serious
      outbreak was considered to be a new epidemic strain, with GP homology of the gene was only
      97.6%, compared to the GP gene of the strain in 1976. This investigational Ad5-EBOV vaccine
      was developed according to the 2014 epidemic Zaire strain and formulated as freeze-dry
      products which could be stored at 4℃.

      In 2014, a single center, double-blind, placebo control, dose-escalation phase 1 clinical
      trial was performed in Taizhou, China. Our findings show that the Ad5-EBOV vaccine is safe
      and robustly immunogenic. One shot of the high dose vaccine could mount glycoprotein-specific
      humoral and T-cell response against Ebola virus in 14 days. The investigators intent to
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of the recombinant Ebola adenovirus
      vector vaccine (Ad5-EBOV) in healthy adults after primary immunization in this add in study.
      The investigators expect that the boosting immunization with a same vaccine for primary
      immunization is possible and could confer a longer-lived protection when needed.

      The phase I trial has been unblind 28 days after the primary vaccination, but all the
      subjects are still kept blind as well as the laboratory staffs. Therefore, this booster
      vaccination trial will be conduct in single blind.
