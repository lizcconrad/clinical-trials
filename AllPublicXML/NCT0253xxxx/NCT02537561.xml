  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study the investigators will combine gemcitabine and cisplatin with
      talazoparib to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of this combination regimen.
      After determination of the RP2D patients with lung cancer whose tumors carry molecular
      alterations in DNA repair pathway genes will be enrolled to an expansion cohort to determine
      anti-tumor efficacy. Tissue samples of patients with confirmed partial response, complete
      response, and non-responders will be obtained for whole exome, and transcriptome sequencing
      to characterize the genetic alterations associated with response to therapy.

    <description>Dose levels of the drugs will be dependent on which dose level the participants is enrolled.
