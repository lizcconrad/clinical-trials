    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Established diagnosis of primary femorotibial OA in the target knee for at least 6
             months (clinical and radiographic [x-ray] criteria)

          -  Radiographic [x-ray] disease Stage 2 or 3 in the target knee according to the
             Kellgren-Lawrence grading of knee OA

          -  Screening pain visual analog scale (VAS) score in the required range for the target
             knee while on oral symptomatic treatment (if required) at study start

          -  Total WOMAC score in the required range for the target knee while on symptomatic oral
             treatment (if required) at study start

          -  Willingness to omit the following for 24 hours prior to all Study Visits, excluding
             the Screening Visit:

               1. Pain medications

               2. Medications or supplements for the treatment of OA

               3. Participation in a formalized in-office and/or supervised OA disease program
                  (e.g., a prescribed patient education program, physiotherapy, etc.)

          -  Full understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with all

          -  Use of electrotherapy or acupuncture for OA within 4 weeks prior to study start

          -  Any known active infections, including suspicion of intra-articular infection,

             system such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Subjects taking prescription medications for OA who have not maintained a stable
             therapeutic regimen for a minimum of 3 months prior to study start

          -  Subjects requiring the chronic use of the following medications:

               1. Opioids, both oral (e.g., tramadol) and transdermal (e.g., fentanyl patches)
