    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate safety and effectiveness of the UriCap-F, a non-invasive urine
      collection device for women, in hospitalized patients who would otherwise be treated with an
      indwelling catheter, pads or diapers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following various disease conditions such as trauma, orthopaedic surgery, and infections
      etc., patients may be bedridden and unable to void in a bedpan or to make their way to the
      toilet. For lack of a better solution for urinary management, indwelling catheter and diaper
      use is common in hospitalized patients. There is no externally applied urine collection
      device on the market today for women. In such situations an indwelling catheter is often
      placed to relieve patients while they are incapacitated, despite lack of urinary retention.
      Indwelling catheters, although effective, are associated with discomfort, pain, and urinary
      tract infections. In other cases diapers or absorbent pads may be used. These may be
      associated with skin irritation and infection.

      The study will evaluate the UriCap-F, non-invasive urine collection devices for women, in
      hospitalized patients who are able to void or who are incontinent of urine

    <description>The UriCap-F is an FDA cleared Class I device intended for urinary management in women.
The device is comprised of a multiple use unit and a single use unit. The multiple use unit is intended to be reused by the same patient for up to 30 days. It is removed every 24 hours, rinsed under running water, dried and re-applied.
The UriCap is held in position by means of a single-use medically approved adhesive tape.</description>
