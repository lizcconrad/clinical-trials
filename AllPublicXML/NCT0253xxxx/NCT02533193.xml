      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical value of enhanced recovery after
      surgery protocal in laparoscopic hepatectomy by assessing its outcomes and hospital stay days
      comparing with traditional care .

      The ERAS programs has been proved to be a useful solutions in patients undergoing colorectal
      surgery in terms of significantly reduced postoperative complications and shorter length of
      hospital stay, compared to the patients of conventional treatment.

      But few studies reported about the ERAS programs in the laparoscopic hepatectomy.
