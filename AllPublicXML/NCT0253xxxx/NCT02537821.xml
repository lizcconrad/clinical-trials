  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary goal of this study is the analysis of HLA (Human leucocyte antigen) formation in
      severly burned patients. Potential HLA triggers in the treatment of severely burned patients
      are blood products, assist devices or temporary allogeneic skin. Besides that, inflammatory
      markers, such as WBC (white blood cell count), CRP (C-reactive protein), PCT (Procalcitonin)
      and two novel biomarkers (PSP (pancreatic stone protein), ST2) are to be investigated in
      severely burned patients.
