    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of applying low level laser light therapy to individuals with
      mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease to see if it may improve their memory, thinking and
      behaviors. Half of the participants will receive the real treatment with the laser device and
      the other half of the participants will receive a placebo treatment (not active laser).

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive type of dementia that causes problems with memory,
      thinking and behavior that gradually worsen over time. With an aging population, AD is an
      escalating problem, currently affecting an estimated 35 million people worldwide, with this
      number expected to grow to 65 million by 2030 and over 115 million by 2050. It is the sixth
      leading cause of death in the United States.

      AD is a fatal degenerative disease of the brain that causes brain cells to die which as a
      result causes the memory failure, personality changes, problems carrying out daily activities
      and other symptoms associated with AD. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of beta
      amyloid (Î²-amyloid), a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques and tangles
      that accumulate over time, and are associated with significant loss of neurons and synaptic
      activity in the brain.

      Patients with AD typically first present with impaired memory and language dysfunction, with
      visuospatial dysfunction, impaired ability with calculations and complex tasks, behavioral
      and/or psychiatric symptoms developing as the disease progresses. The most common signs and
      symptoms of AD as the disease progresses are: memory loss that disrupts daily life,
      challenges in planning or solving problems, difficulty completing familiar home, work or
      leisure tasks, confusion with time or place, difficulty understanding visual images and
      spatial relationships, new problems with words in speaking or writing, misplacing things and
      losing the ability to retrace steps, decreased or poor judgment, withdrawal from work or
      social activities, changes in mood, personality and behavior.

      There is presently no cure for Alzheimer's disease or its progression. Current available
      treatments can help to lessen or stabilize symptoms for a limited period of time. The FDA has
      approved two types of medications to treat the cognitive symptoms (memory loss, confusion,
      and problems with thinking and reasoning) of AD: cholinesterase inhibitors such as Aricept,
      Exelon, Razadyne, Cognex and memantine (Namenda). Side effects include nausea, dizziness,
      confusion, vomiting, headache, loss of appetite, constipation, increased frequency of bowel
      movements, and possible liver damage. Current alternative treatments include Vitamin E.

      There are no medications approved specifically to treat behavioral and psychiatric AD
      symptoms. However, antidepressants; anxiolytics and antipsychotics are sometimes prescribed.

      As currently available treatments for AD are minimal and of limited short-term effectiveness
      in mild symptom management at best, and have potentially serious associated side-effects, low
      level laser therapy is being evaluated in this study as a simple, non-invasive side-effect
      free alternate means of improving cognition and behavior symptoms in patients with mild to
      moderate AD.

      The underlying condition of AD is the degeneration and death of nerve cells responsible for
      memory and cognition with identified genetic contributions. Application of low level laser
      therapy (LLLT), with its coherent emission of photons, has been shown to modulate cellular
      metabolism and alter the transcription factors responsible for gene expression to produce
      cell regeneration translating to a beneficial clinical effect. It is therefore hypothesized
      that through this mechanism, application of LLLT to individuals with AD will effect
      improvement in the expression of symptoms of AD. Prior Erchonia Corporation LLLT trials have
      shown beneficial clinical effects for other neurodegenerative and neurodevelopment disorders
      such as Parkinson's Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder.

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) is a validated psychometric instrument to evaluate the following aspects of cognitive function: memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, ideational praxis and constructional praxis. Scores on the ADAS-cog range from 0-70 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Therefore, a decrease in the ADAS-cog score from baseline to study endpoint indicates improved cognitive functioning and is positive for study success; whereas an increase in the ADAS-cog score from baseline to study endpoint reflects potential cognitive deterioration and is negative for study success. The minimal clinical important difference (MCID) on the ADAS-cog has been established as a 4 point change (decrease).</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Co-Operative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Co-Operative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) is a validated tool to assess instrumental and basic activities of daily living (i.e. functional performance) of AD based on a structured interview of the study partner. Scores on the ADCS-ADL range from 0-78 with lower scores indicating greater impairment; Therefore, an increase in the ADCS-ADL score from baseline to study endpoint indicates improved functioning and is positive for study success; whereas a decrease in the ADCS-ADL score from baseline to study endpoint reflects potential functional deterioration and is negative for study success. The minimal clinical important difference (MCID) on the ADAS-ADL has been established as a 2 point change (increase - improvement).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) tool evaluates five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. It is an 11-item tool with a maximum attainable score of 30. A total score of 23 or lower indicates cognitive impairment.
Lower scores indicate progressively greater impairment. Therefore, an increase in the MMSE score from baseline to study endpoint indicates improved cognition and is positive for study success; whereas a decrease in the MMSE score from baseline to study endpoint reflects potential cognitive deterioration and is negative for study success.</description>

    <measure>Study Partner Satisfaction With Overall Outcome Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's study partner is asked to indicate how satisfied he or she is with any change observed in the subject's day-to-day functioning following the study procedure administration phase. Responses are recorded on a 5-point scale from 'Very Satisfied' to 'Not at All Satisfied'. Higher ratings indicate greater satisfaction with the study outcome and are positive for study success. Lower ratings indicate lesser satisfaction with the study outcome and are negative for study success</description>
