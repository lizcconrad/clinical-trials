    <textblock>
      This exploratory study is designed to help develop a clinical model to measure the earlier
      stages of dietary acid medicated enamel loss. The study will use fluoride as positive control
      to explore the validity of this design.

    <measure>Change From Pre-acid Challenge (Baseline) Tooth Impression Grading Score Immediately Following an Acid Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes post dietary acid challenge</time_frame>
    <description>The impressions of the tooth surface were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate changes in the enamel surface topography to determine degree of early stage enamel erosion. Interrogation of the tooth surface via impressions using SEM followed by visual image analysis was used to investigate the enamel surface topography.
The Images were graded as follows:
- No signs of surface erosive wear (no evidence of the &quot;lock and key&quot; structure)
- Early signs of erosive surface changes
- Mild signs of erosive surface changes (early signs of the &quot;lock and key&quot; structure).
- Moderate signs of erosive surface changes
- Severe signs of erosive surface changes (&quot;lock and key&quot; structure and enamel &quot;pits&quot;) X - Not evaluable</description>

             restorations, abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, full crowns or

        <title>Change From Pre-acid Challenge (Baseline) Tooth Impression Grading Score Immediately Following an Acid Challenge</title>
        <description>The impressions of the tooth surface were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate changes in the enamel surface topography to determine degree of early stage enamel erosion. Interrogation of the tooth surface via impressions using SEM followed by visual image analysis was used to investigate the enamel surface topography.
The Images were graded as follows:
- No signs of surface erosive wear (no evidence of the “lock and key” structure)
- Early signs of erosive surface changes
- Mild signs of erosive surface changes (early signs of the “lock and key” structure).
- Moderate signs of erosive surface changes
- Severe signs of erosive surface changes (“lock and key” structure and enamel “pits”) X - Not evaluable</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes post dietary acid challenge</time_frame>
        <population>The Per Protocol (PP) population was defined as those subjects in the ITT (intent to treat) population who have at least one assessment of efficacy considered unaffected by protocol violation. Assessments of efficacy considered affected by protocol violation were excluded from PP analyses. The primary population was the PP population.</population>

          <description>The impressions of the tooth surface were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate changes in the enamel surface topography to determine degree of early stage enamel erosion. Interrogation of the tooth surface via impressions using SEM followed by visual image analysis was used to investigate the enamel surface topography.
The Images were graded as follows:
- No signs of surface erosive wear (no evidence of the “lock and key” structure)
- Early signs of erosive surface changes

        <description>Saliva was collected and stored at 0 - 20°C. A Saliva-check Buffer Kit was used to determine the buffer capacity. The colourimetric assay yielded a coloured pattern on a paper diagnostic using a 0-12 scale where 0-5 was deemed to be very low, 6-9 was deemed low and 10-12 was deemed normal-high.</description>

        <population>The PP population was defined as those subjects in the ITT population who have at least one assessment of efficacy considered unaffected by protocol violation. Assessments of efficacy considered affected by protocol violation was excluded from PP analyses. The primary population was the PP population.</population>
