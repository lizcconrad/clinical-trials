  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) regarding the conservative treatment of chronic
      ankle instability (CAI) with an impairment based rehabilitation program. Individuals with CAI
      have deficits in neuromuscular control and altered gait patterns. Ankle destabilization shoes
      are used clinically and may improve neuromuscular control by increasing lower extremity
      muscle activation, which may improve gait patterns. The investigators' purpose is to
      determine whether a 4-week rehabilitation program that includes ankle destabilization shoes
      (experimental) has beneficial effects on self-reported function and ankle gait kinematics
      compared to traditional rehabilitation without destabilization shoes (control) in CAI
      patients. In addition, the investigators will compare ankle strength and balance between CAI
      patients and healthy individuals with no history of ankle injury prior to the 4-week
      rehabilitation. The investigators hypothesize the experimental group will have greater
      improvement in self-reported function and frontal and sagittal plane kinematics during
      walking compared to the control group. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that
      patients with CAI will have a decrease in ankle strength and balance when compared to healthy
      individuals. The design is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Forty CAI patients
      will complete baseline self-reported function questionnaires and walking gait trials and then
      be randomized into control and experimental groups. Both groups will complete 4-weeks of
      supervised rehabilitation with or without destabilization shoes and then repeat the
      questionnaires and walking trials.
