      Background:

      - The blood-brain barrier separates the brain from the rest of the body. Epilepsy is a
      neurological disease that causes seizures. It can affect this barrier. Researchers think a
      contrast agent called mangafodipir might be better able to show areas of the brain that
      epilepsy affects.

      Objective:

      - To see if mangafodipir is well tolerated and safe. To see if it can show, on an MRI, areas
      of the brain that epilepsy affects.

      Eligibility:

        -  People ages 18-60 who:

        -  Have epilepsy not controlled by drugs

        -  Are enrolled in protocol 01-N-0139

        -  Healthy volunteers

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Participants will have up to 6 visits in 1 3 months. Those with epilepsy will have an
           inpatient stay lasting 2 10 days. Visits may include:

        -  Video-EEG monitoring for participants with epilepsy (not for healthy volunteers)

        -  An IV catheter put in place: a needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.

        -  Getting mangafodipir through the IV.

        -  5 MRI scans over a 10-day period: a magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the
           brain. Participants lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder. They are in the
           cylinder for 45 90 minutes, lying still for up to 10 minutes at a time. The scanner
           makes loud knocking sounds. Participants will get earplugs.

        -  A final MRI at least 2 weeks after receiving mangafodipir. Gadolinium is given through
           an IV catheter.

      Objective: The primary goals of this pilot study is to determine if (1) administration of
      mangafodipir is well tolerated by healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy and if (2)
      peri-ictal administration will allow focal entry of mangafodipir through the
      blood-brain-barrier and manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) visualization
      of seizure foci.

      Secondary objectives are further exploration of MEMRI properties in patients with epilepsy
      and comparison with healthy volunteers.

      Study population: 16 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and up to 16 healthy controls.

      Design: Screening of enrolled participants will include a medical history, physical exam,
      blood and urine laboratory testing. Patients and healthy volunteers will be imaged
      interictally with a gadolinium enhanced MRI session. For patients, the administration of
      mangafodipir will be done as an inpatient during long-term video EEG recording, to ensure
      administration in the peri-ictal period. Patients and controls will receive a baseline MRI
      scan, iv mangafodipir injection and will then be serially scanned with non-contrast MRI
      scans.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes are (1) clinical safety parameters of mangafodipir
      administration, and (2) the difference between T1-weighted signal intensity in the brain
      measured after mangafodipir administration in the seizure onset zone identified by standard
      clinical, EEG, and imaging studies, and the homologous contralateral region.

          -  Age 18-60.

          -  Able to give written informed consent directly.

          -  Drug resistant epilepsy participants will be defined as having clinically documented
