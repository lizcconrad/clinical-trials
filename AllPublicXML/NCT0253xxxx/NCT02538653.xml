      This study aimed at determining the 4-hours postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses
      to the ingestion of cereal product differing by their SDS content. It is a laboratory-based
      research study with an open cross-over design, including 20 healthy non-smoking voluntary
      subjects, aged from 18 to 45 years. 2 test sessions per subject are included in the study.
      Foods are consumed in a random order according to a randomisation list.

          -  Subject currently taking part in another clinical trial or being in the exclusion
             period of another clinical trial.

          -  Subject undergoing general anaesthesia in the month prior to inclusion.

          -  Subject in a situation which in the investigator's opinion could interfere with
