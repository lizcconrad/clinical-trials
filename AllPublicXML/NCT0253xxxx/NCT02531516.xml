  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if apalutamide plus gonadotropin releasing hormone
      (GnRH) agonist in participants with high-risk, localized or locally advanced prostate cancer
      receiving primary radiation therapy results in an improvement of metastasis-free survival.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of apalutamide plus
      GnRH agonist compared with GnRH agonist among participants with high-risk, localized or
      locally advanced prostate cancer receiving primary radiation therapy (RT). The study will
      include a Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, a Posttreatment Phase, and a Long-term Follow-up
      Phase. Participants will either receive either apalutamide (experimental) or bicalutamide 50
      milligram (mg) capsule plus placebo as control group. Safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
