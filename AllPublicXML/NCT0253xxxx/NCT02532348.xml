  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is associated with an immune activation and an inflammatory response - despite
      an active antiretroviral therapy - which may lead notably but not exclusively to
      cardiovascular diseases. It has been shown that the use of Protease Inhibitors (PI) instead
      of Non Nucleosidic Inhibitors (NNRTI) may increase the risk of myocardial infarction.
      Platelets may play a role in the occurrence of the inflammatory state: they contain big
      amounts of chemokines, growth factors, and adhesion proteins. Today, the contribution of
      platelets to the inflammatory state associated with HIV infection has been little studied.
      Thus, it has been shown that platelets in HIV patients are able to release interleukin
      (IL)-18. The group has shown with others that the platelet function could be altered during
      HIV infection. Inversely, it doesn't know how antiretroviral therapy interacts with
      platelets.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate, according to the antiretroviral therapy, the impact on
      the platelets activation markers.
