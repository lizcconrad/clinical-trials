      This study evaluates the long-term (9-months) safety of the Bimatoprost Ocular Insert in
      subjects with Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension. All the subjects will receive Bimatoprost
      Ocular Insert and will wear it for approximately 3 months (12 weeks), then will have a that
      Insert removed and a new Insert placed for another 24 weeks (approximately 6 months).
