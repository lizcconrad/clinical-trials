  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed prospective study will evaluate whether a novel exercise approach, seated
      vibration therapy, can improve function in the target population of older adults. Therefore,
      the primary aim of this pilot is to examine the effect of vibration therapy on muscle
      function (balance, muscle power and strength) and muscle mass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are four study visits; screening/baseline followed by eight weeks of training three
      times a week, visit 1 at eight weeks followed by 4 weeks of washout, Visit 2 at 12 weeks
      followed by eight weeks of training three times a week, and a final Visit 3 at 20 weeks.

      At the screening visit, volunteers will be asked to perform tests included in the short
      physical performance battery (SPPB) (gait speed, chair rise, balance). If the participants
      score is ≤ 9 or ≤ 2 in any of the three tests included in the SPPB they will be eligible for
      the intervention phase. At the baseline visit several questionnaires will be obtained and
      participants then will proceed with muscle function tests (SPPB, jumping mechanography, grip
      strength, timed-up-and-go test).

      Participants will then be randomized into one of two groups. The first group will receive
      vibration + loading treatment for the first 8 weeks, the second group will receive sham
      treatment (loading only). After 8 weeks both groups will go through a 4 week wash-out period
      and then crossover will occur. The first group will now receive sham treatment (loading only)
      while the second group will receive vibration + loading treatment. The participants will
      train for 10 minutes, 3 times a week, during the active 16 total weeks.

    <description>The primary aim of this pilot is to examine the effect of vibration therapy on muscle function (balance, muscle power and strength) and muscle mass. Weight corrected jump power will be the main outcome variable. Countermovement jumps are performed on a Leonardo force plate (Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany) following standard procedures. Jumping mechanography uses maximal countermovement jumps to quantitatively measure muscle strength in the legs. Participants will be asked to perform three countermovement jumps. Participants are asked to try to jump as high as possible using both legs. Three jumps are performed; the jump with the highest jump height is used for analysis. The software computes instantaneous power by multiplying force and velocity. Vertical velocity is calculated by integrating acceleration over time and jump height by integrating vertical velocity over time. The acceleration is the result of dividing measured force and the participants body weight.</description>

Vibration intensity will initially be set to 0.2 g and will increase by 0.2 g every other week, as tolerated by the subject, and max out at 1.0 g.</description>

    <description>Vibration Training The VibeTech One Rehab Chair allows vibration exercise while seated. A force is applied on a footplate that simulates the weight of standing or partial bodyweight. The participants will train for 10 minutes 3 days per week. In the &quot;loading + vibration group&quot; (intervention group) vibratory acceleration will be 30Hz and the applied load will be 50% of body weight up to a device maximum applied load of 100 lbs. Vibration intensity will initially be set to 0.2 g and will increase by 0.2 g every other week, as tolerated by the subject, and max out at 1.0 g.</description>
