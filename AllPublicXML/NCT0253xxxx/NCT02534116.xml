  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes between incisional negative-pressure wound
      vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy versus conventional dressings following abdominal
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively compare rates of wound complications using incisional negative
      pressure wound therapy versus conventional dressings following abdominal reconstruction.

      Patients will undergo abdominal surgery (panniculectomy, abdominoplasty, ventral hernia
      repair, or autologous flap reconstruction using abdominal donor tissue). Following closure of
      the incision, patients will either have a gauze dressing placed over the incision (control
      group), or incisional vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy. The dressing will be removed
      over a time period of 2 to 5 days after surgery. The gauze dressing will be removed at 2 days
      and the wound VAC will be removed at 5 days. After this time, the wound will be assessed for
      signs of infection, seroma, hematoma, skin and fat necrosis, skin dehiscence, and hernia
      during the follow-up appointments.

    <description>Post-operative wound complications (infection, seroma, hematoma, skin and fat necrosis, skin dehiscence, and hernia) will be assessed at 2 days for gauze patients and at 5 days for VAC patients. This outcome will be assessed based on the clinical examination by the surgeon following removal of the wound dressing. There is no defined assessment tool for this outcome as clinical observation is the standard in these procedures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients included in this study are patients undergoing abdominal reconstruction,
             which includes panniculectomy, abdominoplasty, ventral hernia repair and patients
             undergoing autologous flap reconstruction using abdominal donor tissue.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from study if they have an actively infected wound involving
             the incision, abdominal malignancy, a history of enteric fistula formation, or a
             bleeding disorder.
