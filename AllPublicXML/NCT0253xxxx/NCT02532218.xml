  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ARI-3037MO compared to
      placebo in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in subjects with
      dyslipidemia.

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical
      trial. The study will compare two arms: ARI-3037MO 3 g BID vs. placebo.

      Subjects who sign informed consent will be enrolled and will undergo all Visit 1 assessments.
      Following evaluation of Visit 1 laboratory assays, eligible subjects will receive a phone
      call (Visit 2) during which they will be instructed to begin the lifestyle modification and
      enter a 4- to 6-week lead-in period (6-week wash-out period for subjects to wash out of
      non-statin lipid-lowering therapy [subjects may remain on statins during this period], 4
      weeks for subjects receiving statins only or not receiving any lipid-lowering therapy),
      followed by a qualifying fasting LDL-C measurement at Visit 3. After the lead-in period, if
      the LDL-C level at Visit 3 is not ≥ 100 mg/dL, an additional week will be allowed for another
      qualifying measurement at a subsequent visit (Visit 3.1). If performed, the LDL-C level at
      Visit 3.1 must be ≥ 100 mg/dL in order for the subject to continue participation in the
      study. Qualifying subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner at Visit 4 to one of two arms
      of the double-blind, 24-week efficacy and safety assessment phase. Randomization will be
      stratified by background statin therapy status at Visit 1 (yes/no). Baseline lipid levels
      will be defined as lipid levels at Visit 4. End-of-study lipid levels will be defined as the
      lipid levels at Visit 7 (Week 24).

      A final closeout and safety assessment visit will be held at 26 weeks post randomization
      (Visit 8).

             methods of birth control. Females who are postmenopausal must have been postmenopausal
             for &gt; 1 year if they wish not to use contraceptives. If postmenopausal status is
             questionable, the subject's follicle-stimulating hormone level must be elevated and
             consistent with postmenopausal levels (i.e., &gt; 40 IU/L); otherwise these subjects must
             agree to use contraceptives listed above.

          3. Male subjects with sexual partners of childbearing potential must be surgically
             sterile or using an acceptable method of contraception from the time of screening
             through 12 weeks after last dose of study drug to prevent pregnancy in a partner.

             postmenopausal status) must have a negative pregnancy test prior to dosing.
