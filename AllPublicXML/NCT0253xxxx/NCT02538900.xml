  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study will determine whether an exercise intervention that avoids continuous
      supervision and exercise-related ischemic pain improves walking performance at 52-week
      follow-up in people with PAD. Our intervention directly addresses two aspects of current
      practice guidelines that are major barriers to exercise for patients with PAD: 1) the
      recommendation for supervised exercise and 2) the recommendation for high intensity
      ischemic-pain inducing walking exercise.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will randomize 305 PAD participants to one of three parallel arms: Group 1: Low-intensity,
      self-paced walking exercise; Group 2: Standard high intensity, ischemic pain-inducing walking
      exercise; Group 3: Non-exercising attention control group. The low and high intensity
      exercise groups will attend center-based exercise sessions once per week for four weeks
      followed by transition to an entirely home-based exercise program for an additional 48 weeks
      (52 weeks total). The low and high intensity exercise interventions will use identical
      self-regulatory and support strategies. However, the low intensity exercise group will be
      instructed to exercise with minimal to no ischemic leg discomfort and the high intensity
      group will be instructed to exercise to maximal ischemic leg pain. These two distinct
      exercise prescriptions will be reinforced during 48 weeks of home-based exercise, using a
      well-validated behavioral coaching model that can be delivered by telephone once weekly. Our
      primary outcome is change in six-minute walk distance at 52-week follow-up. If our hypotheses
      are correct, millions of people with PAD will benefit from this alternative exercise regimen
      which will be accessible to most of the 8 million people in the U.S. who suffer from PAD.

    <description>Our attention control group controls for the possibility that regular contact with the study team may improve outcomes in participants randomized to the intervention. Participants randomized to the control group will attend weekly one-hour educational sessions at Northwestern University for the first four weeks of the intervention (Phase I). These sessions are on topics of interest to the typical PAD patient and are led by physicians and other health care workers. Topics include Medicare Part D, nutritional supplements, and cancer screening. During Phase II (weeks 5-52), the attention control group will receive weekly telephone calls, lasting 5-15 minutes, with information on a health-related topic.</description>
