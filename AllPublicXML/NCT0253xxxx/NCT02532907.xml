  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to obtain and store samples of serum and liver tissue in HCV (HepC
      Virus)-infected patients being treated with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, and to
      determine the effect of new DAA therapies on HCV-related responses in the liver and
      peripheral blood.

      The introduction of new DAAs regimens that do not include IFN provides unique and novel
      opportunities to examine whether successful treatment-induced eradication of viral antigen
      results in reconstitution of T cell immunity. serum and liver tissue samples will be
      collected and stored in hopes of improving treatment and outcomes for future patients.

      This study is designed to obtain and store samples of serum and liver tissue in HCV-infected
      patients being treated with DAA therapy.

      A liver biopsy will be performed pre-treatment for research reasons. A small liver sample
      that is not required for pathologic analysis will also be stored. Patients will undergo
      another liver biopsy at either 4 or 12 weeks after initiation of DAA therapy.

      Any patients with HCV-related liver disease (age &gt; 18) will be considered for this study.

      Patients will have a 120 ml blood draw for research purposes at baseline and 12 weeks after
      stopping DAA treatment along with a 60 ml blood draw at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.

      The liver biopsy at baseline and then either at 4 or 12 weeks will be examined using
      molecular techniques to measure transcription of key genes involved in the antiviral
      response.

        Recruitment of patients will primarily occur through the Hepatology clinic, so non-veterans
        will be recruited. A total of 20 HCV-positive patients who will be treated with
        FDA-approved treatments as covered by the patient's insurance. Half of the patients will be
        treatment-na√Øve prior to enrollment and half will be treatment-experienced with either null
        response or relapse, i.e., persistent viremia. An equal proportion in each group will be
        biopsied at 4 versus 12 weeks after first dosing of DAA. Patients will be subjected to two
        biopsies during the life of the study.
