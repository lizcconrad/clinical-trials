      To determine the activity of lenalidomide in the treatment of pediatric subjects with
      relapsed/refractory AML (with second or greater relapse or refractory to at least 2 prior
      induction attempts) measured by morphological complete response defined as either a CR or CRi
      within the first 4 cycles of treatment.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2, Simon's Optimal two-stage design
      study, with an Optional Extension Phase (OEP), that will assess the activity, safety and
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of lenalidomide in pediatric subjects from 1 to ≤ 18 years of age with
      second or greater Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (rrAML). A total of 43
      evaluable subjects (18 subjects in Stage 1 and an additional 25 subjects in Stage 2) are
      required for assessment of the primary endpoint. To allow for subjects found to be
      unevaluable for the primary endpoint due to an incorrect diagnosis, not having a disease
      assessment post screening, or who discontinued prior to receiving lenalidomide, up to 4
      additional subjects may be enrolled for a maximum of 47 evaluable subjects across
      approximately 70 sites. Approximately 50% of enrolled subjects will be younger than 12 years
      of age to provide adequate PK data for this age subset.

      If during Stage 1, at least 3 of 18 subjects achieve a morphologic complete response (either
      CR or CRi) within the first 4 cycles of study treatment, then the study will proceed to Stage
      2; otherwise, the study will be terminated. Similarly, if at the final analysis, at least 8
      of 43 evaluable subjects across Stages 1 and 2 achieve a response (CR/CRi) within the first 4
      cycles of study treatment, it will be concluded that lenalidomide has sufficient activity in
      pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) to warrant subsequent study.

      The optional extension phase (OEP) will allow subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit, as
      assessed by the Investigator at the completion of 12 cycles of lenalidomide therapy, to
      continue receiving oral lenalidomide until they meet the criteria for study discontinuation.
      In the OEP, only safety, dosing, concomitant medications/procedures, and second primary
      malignancies (SPMs) will be monitored.

             pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL must be conducted in
             FCCBP/FCBP, including those who commit to complete abstinence*. FCCBP/FCBP must have
             two pregnancy tests (with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL) prior to starting
             treatment with lenalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 - 14
             days prior to the start of lenalidomide treatment and the second pregnancy test must

        at the discretion of the investigator, for any FCCBP/FCBP who has high acuity disease
        requiring immediate treatment with lenalidomide. The pregnancy test within 24 hours prior
        to the first dose of lenalidomide is required to be performed.

        The subject may not receive Investigational Product (IP) until the Investigator has
        verified that the results of these pregnancy tests performed on Cycle 1 Day 1 are negative.

        for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at
        study Treatment Discontinuation Visit, and at Day 28 following IP discontinuation. If
        menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28
        days and then every 14 days while on study, at study Treatment Discontinuation Visit, and
        at Days 14 and 28 following IP discontinuation.

             approved and effective contraceptive methods simultaneously. The two methods of
             reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one additional
             effective (barrier) method (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive;
             tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or
             vasectomized partner) without interruption, 28 days prior to starting lenalidomide
             treatment, throughout the entire duration of study treatment including dose
             interruptions and 28 days after the end of study treatment.

          -  All male and female subjects must follow all requirements defined in the Pregnancy

             pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the
             study, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following lenalidomide
             discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy or practices complete
             abstinence.
