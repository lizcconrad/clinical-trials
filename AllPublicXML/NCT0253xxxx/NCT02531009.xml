    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the change in systemic sclerosis
      (SSc)-associated gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms over a 1-year period in participants
      with SSc.

      No study treatment will be administered. Study participants will continue to be treated by
      their respective physicians according to standard clinical practice. Data on concomitant
      therapy and procedures, administered as part of standard of care, will be collected at
      baseline and at each study visit.

    <measure>Change in University of California at Los Angeles Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium GI Tract (UCLA-SCTC GIT) instrument score in participants with SSc</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>This participant-reported assessment is a 34-item instrument designed to measure GI tract involvement in participants with SSc. The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 has 7 multi-item scales: Reflux, Distension/Bloating, Diarrhea, Fecal Soilage, Constipation, Emotional Well-being, and Social Functioning and a total GIT score. All scales are scored from 0 [better health-related quality of life (HRQOL)] to 3 (worse HRQOL) except the diarrhea and constipation scales (ranges 0-2 and 0-2.5, respectively). The Total GIT Score, is developed by averaging 6 of 7 scales (excluding constipation) with lower scores indicating better HRQOL.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy volunteers

          -  Must be in good health as determined by the Investigator, based on medical history,
             physical examination, and vital signs.

        Participants with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc):

          -  Must fulfill the 2013 classification criteria for SSc of the American College of
             Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).

        Participants with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc):

          -  Must fulfill the 2013 classification criteria for SSc of the ACR and EULAR.

          -  Subjects with lcSSc must have disease duration of less than 5 years.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant medical condition that can interfere with the
