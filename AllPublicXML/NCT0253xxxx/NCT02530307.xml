    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group outpatient study that
      will utilize standard stroke rehabilitation outcome measures, as well as fMRI techniques in a
      subset of subjects, to evaluate the effect of HT-3951 on motor recovery and behavior in
      medically stable subjects following ischemic stroke.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age range between 21 to 85 years, inclusive, at the Screening Visit

          -  Subjects who have experienced an ischemic stroke documented by CT or MRI resulting in
             an upper extremity deficit that, in the opinion of the Investigator, warrants the need
             for rehabilitation therapy

          -  Medically stable subjects who are able to be randomized to study medication beginning
             between ≥ 2 and ≤ 52 weeks post-stroke

          -  Subjects who have initiated, are undergoing, have completed or agree to begin physical
             or occupational rehabilitation for at least 2 weeks prior to study Day 1.

          -  Mild to moderate unilateral upper extremity motor impairment characterized by FMA-EU
             score of &gt; 18

          -  Modified Rankin Scale score of 1 to 4

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of stroke within 6 months prior to the subject's current episode of ischemic
             stroke (History of transient ischemic attacks or ischemic stroke (nonhemorrhagic) more
             than 6 months prior to the current ischemic stroke are acceptable.)

          -  Subjects with unresolved upper or lower motor deficits (e.g., range of motion or
             strength deficits) from any prior stroke

          -  Significant hemorrhagic stroke

          -  Any history of seizure disorder or a spontaneous seizure that had occurred at any time
             after the stroke

          -  Apraxia that, in the Investigator's opinion, would likely reduce the ability of the
             subject to participate in the study or confound study outcome measures

          -  Moderate to severe aphasia and/or severe language deficits

          -  Severe sensory loss in affected hand

          -  Moderate to severe hemispatial neglect or anosognosia involving the affected arm

          -  Absent proprioception at the elbow or shoulder joints

          -  Excessive spasticity in the affected elbow, defined as a score of greater than or
             equal to 3 on the Modified Ashworth Spasticity scale (MAS)
