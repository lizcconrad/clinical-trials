    <textblock>
      As a special type of breast cancer, the triple negative breast cancer has the characteristics
      of high recurrence rate (2 years after surgery), high distant metastasis rate, poor prognosis
      and short survival time. No matter at home or abroad, the clinical researches of the triple
      negative breast cancer are mainly focused on finding new drugs and new treatment strategies
      in order to reduce its recurrence and distant metastasis rate. The DC/CIK cell immunotherapy
      combined with chemotherapy in the clinical study of metastatic triple negative breast cancer
      has already confirmed benefit. This study is based on the theory that the optimal timing of
      cellular immunity is while the host tumor load is under the smallest state. Put forward the
      hypothesis that the DC/CIK cell immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy may improve the
      disease-free survival and overall surviva after the triple negative breast cancer operation.
      The investigators intends to use the RCT, observing the clinical significance of cellular
      immune adjuvant therapy of triple negative breast cancer in 340 patients with TNBC. Do the
      safety evaluation of cellular immunity in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer treatment,
      explore the clinical strategies for breast cancer immunotherapy.
