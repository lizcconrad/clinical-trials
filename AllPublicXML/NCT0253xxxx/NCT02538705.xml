      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) is effective in
      the treatment of ulcers related to diabetic foot syndrome

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a open clinical trial assessing the therapeutic efficacy of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen)
      in treating ulcers related to diabetic foot syndrome. Each patient will undergo several
      intramuscular injections with a treatment dose of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in calf of
      affected extrimity.

      Study participants at the first study visit will complete study questionnaires, their foots
      will be assessed clinically for ulceration. After this initial assessment, the patients will
      undergo intramuscular injections of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in a calf altered with ulcers
      due to diabetic foot syndrome.

      At three month post-injection, the patient will complete study questionnaires, their foots
      will be assessed clinically for ulceration, and their foots will undergo non-invasive
      transcutaneous oximetry measurement. At six months post-injection, the patient will again
      complete study questionnaires, their foots will be assessed clinically for ulceration and
      will undergo non-invasive transcutaneous oximetry measurement.
