  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several attempts have been made to refine selection criteria for cardiac resynchronisation
      therapy (CRT) in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Previously
      proposed parameters probably do not sufficiently reflect the underlying mechanical
      dyssynchrony of the left ventricle (LV). Earlier work of our research group suggests that
      better candidate selection can rely on the direct observation or measurement of this LV
      mechanical dyssynchrony by means of non-invasive imaging. In this study apical rocking and
      other non-invasive measures of LV mechanical dyssynchrony will be applied to evaluate
      regional myocardial workload and metabolism, and determine their predictive value in CRT
      response.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subject is eligible for CRT implantation according to current European Society of
        Cardiology guidelines of 2013.

          -  The patient should receive guideline-directed optimal medical therapy for heart
             failure and left ventricular (LV) function must be severely depressed (LV ejection
             fraction ≤35%).

          -  The patients should be in NYHA functional class II, III or ambulatory IV.

          -  The patient should present a left bundle branch block (LBBB) with QRS duration of
             &gt;120ms or a non-LBBB with QRS &gt;150ms.

          -  Also patients with conventional pacemaker in NYHA functional class III and ambulatory
             IV if high percentage of ventricular pacing, are eligible for CRT implantation.

          -  Subject is in stable sinus rhythm at the time of CRT implant and during the last 2
             weeks prior to inclusion.

          -  Subject is 18 years or older and able and willing to consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Impossible to obtain LV volumes by echocardiography.

          -  Right bundle branch block.

             investigator's discretion) of receiving a LVAD in the next year.

          -  Severe aortic stenosis (with a valve area of &lt;1.0 cm2 or significant valve disease
             expected to be operated on within study period).
