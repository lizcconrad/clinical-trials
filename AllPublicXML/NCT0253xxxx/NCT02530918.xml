  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test DS-7080a, a monoclonal antibody, as a new treatment for
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). The
      hypothesis of the study is that DS-7080a is safe and shows preliminary efficacy in patients
      with these conditions either alone or in combination with ranibizumab. This study is
      organized into 3 Parts: Part 1 Dose Escalation in AMD participants, Part 2 Dose Expansion in
      AMD participants, and Part 3 Dose Expansion in DME participants.

      In Part 1, participants will be enrolled into 3 sequential, ascending dose-level cohorts in
      non-randomized uncontrolled manner with the main purpose to determine the recommended dose.

      In Part 2, participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms of either monotherapy with DS-7080a
      or monotherapy with ranibizumab, which is an active control, or combination therapy of
      DS-7080a plus ranibizumab (ranibizumab will be administered 30 minutes prior to DS-7080a).

      In Part 3, subjects with DME will be assigned to 1 of 2 arms of either monotherapy with
      DS-7080a or monotherapy with ranibizumab. DS-7080a or ranibizumab will be administered 3
      times: on Baseline/Day 1, Day 29, and Day 57.

      Both Parts 2 and 3 will consist of 8 visits including a 14-day screening phase, an 84-day
      treatment period, and a 28-day follow-up period.

    <description>Visual acuity of both eyes will be assessed at all study visits using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter score. The patient starts are the top of the chart and begins to read down the chart. The patient reads down the chart until he or she reaches a row where a minimum of three letters on a line cannot be read. The patient is scored by how many letters could be correctly identified. Added to the score for the last row where the participant could read all five letters correctly are scores for each additional letter that could be read correctly in the next row. This is the BCVA score. A higher score means better visual acuity (sharpness of vision).</description>
