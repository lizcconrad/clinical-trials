    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (echocardiographic criteria: AV
             effective orifice area (EOA) of &lt; 1 cm2, mean AV gradient of &gt; 40 mmHg, or AV peak
             systolic velocity of &gt; 4.0 m/s; NYHA-class II or greater, angina pectoris, or syncope)

          2. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has
             provided written informed consent.

          3. The subject agrees to comply with specified follow-up evaluations and to return to the
             investigational site where the procedure was performed.

          4. Patients are technical and anatomical eligible for interventions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following which cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated:

             Aspirin Heparin (HIT/HITTS) and bivalirudin Nitinol (titanium or nickel) Ticlopidine
             and clopidogrel Contrast media

          2. Subject refuses a blood transfusion.

          3. Other medical, social, or psychological conditions that in the opinion of an
             Investigator precludes the subject from appropriate consent.

          4. Native aortic annulus size &lt; 20 mm or &gt; 29 mm per the baseline diagnostic imaging.

          5. Life expectancy is less than one year
