  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the theory of embodied cognition, which focuses on the influence of sensory and
      motor processes on cognition, researchers propose to study the influence of the action on
      memorization and inhibition in patients suffering from schizophrenia, using a directed
      forgetting paradigm. The directed forgetting paradigm is used, composed of two lists of
      action verbs. The instruction &quot;to forget&quot; is given at the end of learning the first list (To
      Be Forgotten (TBF)), following a simulation of a computer bug. Therefore a second list is
      presented to be learned and remembered (To Be Remembered (TBR)). A recognition task is
      performed at the end. The action verbs had to be encoded using four conditions: action
      performed, mimed, imagined action, action with a contextual word, reading the action verb
      only. 48 schizophrenic patients were included in this study. Patients were randomized to have
      10 participants per condition. 48 controls matched by age, gender, laterality and education
      are also included and randomized in the same modality. This study aims to show that the
      encoding of sensory-motor components, more than providing a context could improve the
      inhibitory capacities but also memory in schizophrenia, and possibly be used in remediation
      cognitive.
