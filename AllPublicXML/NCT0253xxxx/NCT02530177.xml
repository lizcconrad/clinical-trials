  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how many patients develop hair, skin and nail changes due
      to cancer treatments. The investigators would like to study the clinical factors, genetic
      markers, and impact on patients' health-related quality of life to learn more about who is at
      greater risk. We trust that the study will improve our understanding of how cancer patients
      feel about their skin, hair, and nail conditions. This information will help us determine the
      burden on breast cancer patients and survivors. It will also help us learn how to prevent
      these conditions and it may improve the way we treat them and counsel patients.

    <description>Participants will undergo study related assessments and the appropriate HRQoL questionnaires will be administered. Baseline and follow-up clinical assessments will be performed, preferably when the patient presents to the clinic for (clinically indicated) standard-of-care visits. Initially, these visits will be coinciding with the appropriate chemotherapy dosing cycles (as applicable to select study cohorts), and subsequently they will be performed during the standard-of-care follow-up visits.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo study related assessments and Medical and Personal History Questionnaire data collection forms and the appropriate HRQoL questionnaires, will be administered. Baseline and follow-up clinical assessments will be performed, preferably when the patient presents to the clinic for standard-of-care visits.
