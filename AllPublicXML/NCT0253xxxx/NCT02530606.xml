  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well photoacoustic imaging works in detecting ovarian
      or fallopian tube cancer. Photoacoustic imaging is an imaging method that uses lasers to
      light up tissue, and then converts the light information into ultrasound images.
      Photoacoustic imaging can provide images of the structure of tissues, as well as their
      function and the levels of molecules, such as the flow of blood in blood vessels and the
      level of oxygen in the blood. Photoacoustic imaging may help doctors determine whether a mass
      is benign (non-cancerous) or cancerous based on the molecular differences between cancer and
      normal tissue. It may be more accurate and less expensive than other imaging methods, and
      does not expose patients to radiation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the performance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in detection of ovarian cancer in
      a clinical setting and to help improve the design of the next generation hand held PAI probe.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate vasculature and oxygen saturation in lesions based on PAI-measurements.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo PAI over 15-30 minutes prior to the ovarian excision.

    <description>Descriptive statistics (proportions, means) will be used to summarize depth of lesion.

The area under the ROC curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval based on the .632 bootstrap estimated error rate.</description>
