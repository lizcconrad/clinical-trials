      To evaluate the tolerance and safety of cinobufacini injection intraperitoneal treatment on
      digestive system cancer patients with malignant ascites, and propose dosage regimens for
      future clinical trials. A single-arm, non-randomized, open, drug tolerance trial will be
      conducted. The clinical trial is divided into two parts, including single and successive
      administration.The single administration includes 7 groups, dose is escalated from 15ml to
      180ml, with 2-6 patients per dose level. Central venous catheters will be preserved for
      drainage of ascites, after the drainage of most of ascites, we will slowly inject a dilute
      concentration of cinobufacini injection with escalated dosage through the catheters. This
      treatment will be given only once, and the volunteers will be observed for 24 hours. Then we
      will evaluate the observation indexes, including adverse events, vital signs,
      electrocardiogram, blood routine, urine routine, hepatic and renal function, etc. The
      successive administration includes 2 groups, according to the result of single
      administration, choose the second largest tolerance dose to conduct the 1st group of
      successive administration. If there are significant adverse effects, then drop to a lower
      dose to conduct the 2nd group; if the trial shows no adverse effects, it upgrades to a higher
      dose (the maximum tolerated dose) to conduct the 2nd group. The treatment will be given 3
      times a week, 2 weeks as a period. Adverse effects will be evaluated during and after
      treatment.

    <description>Cinobufacini injection is extracted from a traditional Chinese medicine Bufo toad skins, it's something cold and poisonous with damp evil. On one hand it can kill the cancer cells direct; on the other hand it has the ability to contract blood vessels and inhibit the formation of tumor new vessels. It has been widely used in the treatment of various malignancies.</description>
