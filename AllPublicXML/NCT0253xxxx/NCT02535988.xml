    <textblock>
      Patients with colorectal cancer that had metastatic lesions after been treated with
      definitive surgery or chemoradiotherapy are being asked to participate in this study.

        1. To observe immunity-mediated tumor response outside the radiation field (abscopal
           effect) after chemoradiotherapy of a metastatic site in metastatic colorectal cancer
           patients.

        2. To induce the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of therapy,
           chemoradiotherapy and thymalfasin for heavily pretreated, metastatic esophageal cancer
           patients;

        3. To explore the role of PET/CT scanning to assess tumor response/abscopal effect.

      This study will help find out what abscopal effects (good or bad) the combination of
      radiotherapy and thymalfasin has on metastatic esophageal cancer.

      1. To observe immunity-mediated tumor response outside the radiation field (abscopal
           effect) after chemoradiotherapy of a metastatic site in metastatic colorectal cancer
           patients.

        2. To induce the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of therapy,
           chemoradiotherapy and thymalfasin for heavily pretreated, metastatic esophageal cancer
           patients

        3. To explore the role of PET/CT scanning to assess tumor responses/abscopal effect.

      Eligible are patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have achieved stable disease or
      have disease progression after systemic therapy (surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy) and
      have at least three separate measurable sites of metastatic lesions. Extent of metastatic
      disease is recorded both at CT and PET/CT scanning. Radiation is given during combined
      therapy to one of the lesions, 35Gy in 10 fractions over a two week interval, conformally to
      maximally spare normal tissue or organ. Thymalfasin treatment is given twice a week with an
      interval of 3-4 days each week. At day 22 radiation is re-started and the same radiation dose
      is delivered to a second metastatic site, again with thymalfasin. Abscopal response is
      evaluated by assessing clinical and PET/CT response in the non-irradiated measurable
      metastatic sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum two-stage Phase II Simon
      design is used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be treated in Stage one; if
      there are no abscopal responses, the trial will be terminated. If there are one or more
      abscopal responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an additional 19 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer which is persistent and
             metastatic or recurrent and metastatic;

          4. Metastatic disease measurable on a CT/MRI scan. The primary tumor is not considered
             measurable disease. Metastatic lesions within a prior radiation field are acceptable

             imaging.

          5. ECOG performance status: 0-1;

          6. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.

             neutrophil count greater than 1500 cells per μL, platelet concentration of greater
             than 50 000 per μL, total bilirubin less than 1•5 times the upper limit of normal
             (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase less than 2•5 times the
             ULN, and serum creatinine less than 1•5 times the ULN;

             lesions are not eligible as target or non target lesion;

          5. Anticipated patient survival under 3 months;

          6. Active severe infection or known chronic infection with HIV, hepatitis B virus, or
             hepatitis C virus;

          7. Cardiovascular disease problems including unstable angina, therapy for
             life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke or congestive
             heart failure within the last 6 months;

          8. The subject has had another active malignancy within the past five years except for

             the skin;

          9. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to: active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities;

         10. Patients with any other concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for participation in the study.
