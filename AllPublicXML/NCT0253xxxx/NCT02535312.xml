      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of methoxyamine when given
      together with cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium and to see how well it works in treating
      patients with solid tumors or mesothelioma that have spread to other places in the body and
      usually cannot be cured or controlled with standard treatment (advanced), or mesothelioma
      that does not respond to pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin or carboplatin (refractory).
      Methoxyamine may shrink the tumor and may also help cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium work
      better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving methoxyamine together with cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium may be a
      better treatment for solid tumors or mesothelioma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for
      the combination of TRC102 (methoxyamine) with pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) and cisplatin
      in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Arm A) II. To describe the toxicities of TRC102
      combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin at each dose studied. (Arm A) III. To assess
      preliminary safety and activity in an expansion cohort of chemotherapy-naive advanced
      unresectable malignant mesothelioma patients. (Arm A) IV. To describe responses to the drug
      combination at each dose level. (Arm A) V. To detect activity of the combination of TRC102
      and pemetrexed, as evidenced by tumor response in patients with advanced malignant
      mesothelioma previously treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin. (Arm B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe pharmacokinetic parameters of TRC102 given concurrent with pemetrexed and
      cisplatin.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic parameters of TRC102 given concurrently with pemetrexed
      and cisplatin.

      III. To explore the feasibility of establishing pleural and peritoneal effluent-derived cell
      lines and to evaluate the response of cultured pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma cells to
      cisplatin, pemetrexed, and TRC102.

      IV. To document all objective clinical responses to TRC102 in combination with pemetrexed and
      cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of methoxyamine followed by a phase II
      study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive methoxyamine orally (PO) on days 1-4, pemetrexed disodium
      intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue methoxyamine and pemetrexed disodium beyond
      course 6 if the patient continues to benefit from treatment at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      ARM B: Patients receive methoxyamine PO on days 1-4 and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue methoxyamine and
      pemetrexed disodium beyond course 6 if the patient continues to benefit from treatment at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks.
