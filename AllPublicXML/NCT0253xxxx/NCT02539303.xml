      This is a feasibility pilot study to evaluate the impact of local delivery of Yamani-15/5
      (combination of L-Lactic acid 15% and D-Gluconic acid 5%) on vascular calcification of lower
      extremities in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who were deemed to have
      unreconstructable arterial disease and who have already been scheduled to undergo limb
      amputation (below knee or above knee amputation).

        knee amputation).

        Exclusion:

          -  Patients who will be undergoing amputation of the limb because of infection,
             osteomyelitis or cancer.

          -  Patients with unstable angina or history of myocardial infarction in the last 3
             months.

          -  Patients with sepsis, respiratory failure, hypovolemic shock or cardiogenic shock.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.
