          1. Male or female, 18-55 years of age (both inclusive).

          2. Have a body mass index of 18-30 kg/m2 (both inclusive) calculated as weight
             (kg)/height (m2).

          3. Medical history without any major pathology/surgery in the last 6 months prior to
             screening.

          4. Resting supine blood pressure of 90-139 (systolic)/40-89 (diastolic) mmHg and a
             resting pulse rate of 40-100 beats per minute.

          5. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥80 mL/min

          6. Computerized 12-lead ECG recording without signs of clinically significant pathology
             and showing no clinically significant deviation as judged by the Principal
             Investigator.

          7. Males willing to use double-barrier contraceptive measures and to not donate sperm
             until 90 days after the follow-up visit.

          8. Females should not be pregnant or breast feeding (pregnancy will be confirmed by a
             urine pregnancy test at screening with confirmation by a serum pregnancy test at
             admission) or of non-childbearing potential at screening.

          9. Females must be either post-menopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile
             (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or practicing 1 of the acceptable methods of
             birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History/evidence of clinically relevant pathology.

          2. History of clinically significant food or drug allergy, including known
             hypersensitivity to cefepime or any other related drugs.

          3. A positive screen result for drugs of abuse/alcohol at admission to the study center.

          4. Use of prescription medications (with the exception of oral contraceptives and hormone
             replacement therapy) including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or sucralfate or
             herbal preparations.

          5. Positive screen result for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
             at screening.

          6. Any strenuous activity within 4 days prior to admission to the study center. Strenuous
             being defined as any hard labor or exercise outside of a subject's usual behavior.

          7. History of blood donation of more than 500 mL in the last 2 months prior to screening.

          8. Current use or has used tobacco- or nicotine-containing products.
