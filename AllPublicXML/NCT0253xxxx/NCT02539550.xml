        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy female subjects of non-childbearing potential and/or male subjects who, at the
             time of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is
             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests. Female subjects of
             non-childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following criteria:

               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses
                  for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or
                  physiological cause; and have a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level
                  confirming the post-menopausal state;

               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

               3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including
                  females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be of childbearing potential.

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          5. Subject must be willing to avoid direct sunlight exposure or any high intensity
             ultraviolet light exposure, from the first day of dosing with study medication and
             until the follow-up visit; and to apply sun cream/lotion with a high sun protection
             factor, as appropriate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          3. A positive urine drug screen.

          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study medication (whichever
             is longer).

          6. Screening supine blood pressure &gt;140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If blood pressure (BP) is &gt;140 mm Hg
             (systolic) or &gt;90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the
             average of the three BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          7. Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec.
             If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility.

          8. Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat, if deemed necessary:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic aminotransferase
                  (SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic aminotransferase

               -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN; subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may
                  have a direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided
                  the direct bilirubin is &lt;ULN.

          9. Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; male subjects with partners
             currently pregnant; male subjects able to father children who are unwilling or unable
             to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the
             duration of the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational
             product or longer based upon the compound's half-life characteristics.

         10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. As an
             exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of &lt;1 g/day. Limited use of
             non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor. Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be
             discontinued at least 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication.

         11. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 56 days prior to dosing.

         13. Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle Guidelines described in this
             protocol.

             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of
             the study.

         15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

         16. Any subject considered at risk of suicide or self harm based on investigator judgement
             and/or the details of a risk assessment.
