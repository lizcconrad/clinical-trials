  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual impairment can affect up to 70% of stroke survivors, but many do not have their vision
      adequately assessed in hospital. An unidentified visual defect can cause significant problems
      for recovery and quality of life. The Stroke Vision app (an application currently scaled for
      a 10&quot; Android tablet) has been developed to act as a screening tool for visual problems in
      stroke survivors; to help identify visual problems earlier and thereby improve rehabilitation
      outcomes. The app includes a suite of tests for assessing the patient's acuity, their visual
      fields and to aid in the identification of visual neglect / inattention. Furthermore, it
      includes educational information on visual stroke in order to better educate staff, patients
      and their carers. This study seeks to validate the novel digital assessments included in the
      Stroke Vision app against the current methods used for screening (clinical examination by
      confrontation field testing). Both screening measures will be compared with the gold standard
      methods for visual assessments, Octopus perimetry for fields and paper-based methods for
      visuospatial neglect

    <description>Visual field will be captured either by the Stroke Vision App or by confrontation. Visual field will be reported by assessors (blinded to referral and comparator assessment) as either defect present, no defect present or unable to test. Agreement between visual field assessment supported by the Stroke Vision App and visual field assessment to confrontation in standard clincial practice will be quantified by the Kappa statistic. Accuracy metrics of sensitivity/specificity/predictive values will also be reported.</description>
