  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paradoxical fetal and maternal results of studies have led to inconsistent use of
      antihypertensive drugs or no treatment at all in mild to moderate gestational hypertension in
      the Netherlands. However, none of the studies have taken the individual maternal circulatory
      state or the contemplated blood pressure response into account. Hypertension may be
      accompanied by high (hyperdynamic vasodilated profile), normal (normodynamic profile) of low
      (hypodynamic vasoconstrictive profile) cardiac output, and preeclampsia is not restricted to
      one circulatory profile. Therefore antihypertensive drugs should be viewed upon as correctors
      of the hemodynamic state rather than solely reducers of blood pressure. Without taking the
      maternal hemodynamic profile and condition into account, generic antihypertensive treatment
      can be expected to result in disappointing, inadequate and paradoxical results. The
      investigators hypothesize that in mild to moderate hypertension, personalized hemodynamically
      guided antihypertensive therapy (with target systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      &lt;130/80mmHg), prevents the progression to severe hypertension and/or preeclampsia compared to
      no treatment, without the alleged side-effects.
