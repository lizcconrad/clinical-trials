      Atopic dermatitis(AD) is one of manifestation in atopic march. The prevalence of AD is
      increased. In 1998, the investigators found the prevalence of AD about 15 % in Thailand. AD
      is diagnosed by clinical as Hanifin and Rajka criteria. There are 3 group of severity defined
      by SCORAD(Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) : mild (&lt;25), moderate (25-50) and severe (&gt;50). The
      natural history of AD was mentioned in 3 groups: complete remission, persistent and
      intermittent. Atopic march is the progression of atopic disease that has atopic dermatitis as
      the first manifestation then patients will have allergic rhinitis or asthma in the future.
      The investigators do a retrospective study to understand the natural history of AD as well as
      it associate with atopic march. That might be a predictive factor of AD and atopic march

      Retrospective review from out patient record. Collect the demographic data, onset of atopic
      march, sensitization of allergen and treatment that given to patients.

      For patients who have current follow up at Allergy clinic, the current symptom was collect in
      that visit.

      For patients who didn't have follow up visit, telephone interview was done. If they have
      symptom, investigators will ask them to come in for investigation and proper treatment.

      Patient was recruited in this study with parental permission. The data will collect and use
      statistical analysis.
