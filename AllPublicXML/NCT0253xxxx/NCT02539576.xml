  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The abacavir (ABC)/dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC) 600 milligrams (mg)/50 mg/300 mg
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet is currently approved in the United States (US) and
      Europe. Although the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of ABC/DTG/3TC FDC
      tablets have been extensively studied in subjects not of Japanese heritage, these parameters
      have not been exclusively assessed in Japanese subjects. To support the marketing application
      in Japan, this single-dose, open-label study will characterize the PK, safety and
      tolerability of ABC/DTG/3TC FDC tablet in adult Japanese healthy subjects. A maximum of 12
      subjects will be enrolled such that approximately 10 evaluable subjects complete the study.
      The study will consist of a screening, treatment phase (single oral dose under the fasted
      state) and follow-up visit (within 7-14 days of the last PK sample collected). The total
      duration of the study for each subject will be approximately up to 48 days.

             being studied may be included only if the investigator documents that the finding is

             (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Male or female

        Females- A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed
        by a negative serum or urine [according to the sites standard of practice] human chorionic
        gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions
        applies:

          1. Non-reproductive potential defined as: pre-menopausal females with one of the
             following: Documented tubal ligation Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion
             procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion Hysterectomy
             Documented bilateral oophorectomy; Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.

          2. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the
             modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of
             reproductive potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication
             and until 2 weeks after dosing with study medication and completion of the follow-up
             visit.

        The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use
        these methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in the protocol which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in
             the protocol.

          -  Documentation that the subject is negative for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
             B*5701 allele.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  QTcF &gt;450 millisecond (msec)

        NOTES:

        The QT duration corrected for heart rate (QTc) is the QTcF machine-read or manually
        over-read.

        The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
        individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words,
        several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject
        and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial.

        For purposes of data analysis, QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula
        (QTcB), QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will
        be used as specified in the reporting and analysis plan (RAP).

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including
             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) medical monitor the medication will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One unit is

             ounces (150 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical
             monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

             excess of 500 mL within 56 days

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.
