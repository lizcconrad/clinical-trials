  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to establish a genetic registry of patients with early-onset motor
      neuron and neuromuscular diseases. The investigators will collect samples from patients with
      a motor neuron or a neuromuscular disorder and their family members. The samples to be
      collected will be obtained using either non-invasive (saliva and buccal swabs) or minimally
      invasive (whole blood) means. The research team will then extract high quality genomic DNA
      from these samples and use it to identify and confirm novel gene mutations and to identify
      genes which regulate the severity of motor neuron/neuromuscular diseases.

    <textblock>
      Diseases affecting the motor unit--which is composed of the motor neuron, its myelin sheath
      and its innervated muscle fibers--are a diverse, heterogeneous group having heterogeneous
      clinical presentations and genetic causes. Many of these disorders have a inherited
      component. In some cases, the genetics underlying a given neuromuscular/motor neuron disease,
      like spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) or Duchenne muscular dystrophy, are well characterized.
      There are, however, disorders whose genetic basis has yet to be determined or genetically
      characterized diseases which harbor novel mutations. The purpose of this genetic registry is
      to catalogue early-onset motor neuron and neuromuscular disorders and to determine their
      genetic bases. With samples obtained from this registry, the investigators will be able to
      provide a genetic diagnosis for a specific neuromuscular/motor neuron disease which will lead
      to better care for those patients affected by these diseases.

      Many of these disorders have a wide spectrum of phenotypic variability. For example, the
      severity of SMA is quite variable even though it is caused by the loss of a single gene, i.e.
      survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1). The number of copies of the duplicated gene survival motor
      neuron 2 (SMN2) dictates phenotypic severity in SMA. In this study, the research team will
      also identify potential modifiers of phenotypic severity for specific disorders like SMA and
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. With the identification of novel modifier genes, the
      investigators will be able to more accurately predict disease outcomes and the investigators
      will also have novel targets for the development of therapeutic agents for these diseases.
