    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a common psychiatric illness, with severe prognosis (5% mortality)
      that has changed little over in half a century. One of the forms is the restrictive anorexia
      nervosa (ANR). It consists of a phobia of weight gain and food with a massive food
      restriction. This pathology is studied in psychology but not using the theories of embodied
      cognition in which &quot;perception and action&quot; interact through sensorimotor processes. They are
      the source of attitudes (unconscious) towards certain stimuli and influence our
      interpretation (conscious).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that food restriction behavior is the result of two
      processes. One automatic and not conscious, which is an attraction toward food and manifests
      itself in the motivational attitudes of approach, and the other controlled and conscious,
      which prevents attraction to this type of stimuli and is manifested by motivational attitudes
      avoidance. These processes of attraction and avoidance are observed in embodied cognition
      paradigms because the answers induce movement of approach or avoidance of stimuli. The
      validation of these assumptions could lead to reconsideration of the respective roles of
      automatic and controlled processes in food behaviors of anorexics patients and to complete or
      refocus psychological techniques of care.

    <description>The Test of Everyday Attention (TEA) measures the reaction time of the participant during the occurrence of an expected stimulus.
The Grober Test with 16 words to learn and to remember, measures the episodic verbal memory long term.
The Task 1 consists of a stimulus that moves on the screen. The response of the patient is done on the keyboard. It is composed on two conditions: one is fast (without conscious), the other consists in assessing words (conscious). It includes food and non-food words.</description>
