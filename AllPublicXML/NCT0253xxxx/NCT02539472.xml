  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycosis fungoides (MF) is an epidermotropic cutaneous T cell lymphoma characterized by the
      accumulation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the skin. Early MF presents as erythematous patches
      and/or infiltrated plaques. The diagnosis of early MF is a major diagnostic challenge and the
      differential diagnosis with inflammatory dermatoses is often very difficult. The
      histopathological diagnosis is also difficult and delayed. Therefore, it is important to
      develop biomarkers and/or a combination of biomarkers in order to improve the early
      diagnostic of MF.

      In a previous trial, investigators included 490 patients in a study aiming at identifying
      skin biomarkers of early MF. Several activating and inhibiting KIRs were found to be
      interesting for the skin diagnostic of MF, mainly KIR2DL4 and KIR3DL2. Investigators later
      evaluated blood biomarkers in patients with erythrodermic MF and Sezary Syndrome (SS). This
      French institutional study demonstrated that the identification by PCR of a combination of 4
      blood markers (CD158k/KIR3DL2, PLS3/T-Plastin, Twist and NKp46) allowed a reliable diagnosis
      of lymphoma in erythrodermic patients. This previously published study interestingly showed
      that 30% to 50% of patients with early MF expressed at least one of these biomarkers in the
      blood (unpublished data). Other groups also recently showed that TOX can be a diagnostic tool
      for MF.

      The aim of this study is to establishing an accurate blood diagnosis for early suspected MF
      by demonstrating that newly identified biomarkers or their combination [5 cutaneous KIR
      receptor markers (KIR2DS1, KIR2DS3, KIR3DL1, KIR2DL4, KIR3DL2) and 5 blood biomarkers (TOX,
      Twist-1, PLS3/T-plastin, KIR3DL2, NKp46)] are differentially expressed by patients with MF
      and patients with inflammatory dermatoses closely resembling MF lesions.

      Statistical analysis will establish the best combination of blood biomarkers allowing the
      differentiation between the two groups of patients, combination that could represent a
      suitable diagnostic tool for early MF.
