    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of recurrent caries around the different
      types of restorative materials (composites, amalgam, ceramics, crowns, etc.) and to better
      characterize recurrent caries lesions in terms of location and size of the lesions and type,
      material and age of the restoration.

      The data will be collected from patients who are visiting the dental clinic for a check-up.
      These data will be retrieved in the patient records. In particular the clinical (mouth) exam
      and the radiographic images ('RX-bite-wings'), which are routinely taken during these
      check-up consultations, will be used for the evaluation of recurrent caries. Information
      regarding medical background, oral hygiene, sugar eating habits and possible parafunctional
      activities will also be gathered from the patient files. In addition, caries risk of the
      patients will be assessed using commercial kits for analysis of their saliva (Saliva-Check
      Buffer, GC, Tokyo, Japan) and dental plaque (Tri Plaque ID Gel, GC, Tokyo, Japan), which are
      a part of the routine care of the patients at the clinic.

    <description>Caries risk of each patient will be assessed based on scoring of several parameters such as: number of new caries lesions in the last 3 years (from patients' files), presence of relevant systemic disease (from patients' files), sugar consumption (from patients' files), oral hygiene (from patients' files) and results of the Saliva-check test and Tri plaque ID test.</description>
