      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) refers to the patients in the central nervous
      system complications after general anesthesia and clinical manifestations of mental disorder,
      anxiety, personality changes, impaired memory, personality, social skills and cognitive
      function after surgery for this decline is called postoperative cognitive dysfunction.Due to
      the lack of effective clinical treatments, how to prevent and solve the postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction has become a difficulty and a focus of research in the field of
      anesthesia.Methylprednisolone is a new type of cortical hormone, because of its strong
      anti-inflammatory effect, less adverse reactions, is widely used in clinical
      anesthesia.Electric acupuncture as a kind of traditional treatments, after years of clinical
      application and achieved good curative effect in practice.In this paper by comparing brain
      oxygen saturation, blood biochemical indexes, Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MOCA) on
      cognitive function in patients with grade indexes, such as observation of methylprednisolone
      combined electric acupuncture treatment of elderly patients with general anesthesia early
      after the operation, the influence of cognitive function.

      Through comparing the operation of cerebral oxygen saturation, blood biochemical indexes,
      Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MOCA) on cognitive function in patients with grade
      indexes, such as observation of methylprednisolone combined electric acupuncture treatment of
      elderly patients with general anesthesia early after the operation, the influence of
      cognitive function.

      Choose descending colon cancer radical general anesthesia, 80 cases of patients, ASA Ⅱ ~
      level III, aged 65 ~ 75, were randomly divided into two groups: anesthesia method selects the
      tracheal intubation general anesthesia.All Diprifusor propofol used in patients with TCI
      system, with the initial plasma concentration of 2.0 ug/ml start TCI, and intravenous
      sufentanil injection 0.15 ug/kg, propofol 1 ug/ml every 1 minute.After the BIS value &lt; 75,
      start the fentanyl TCI system, maintaining the plasma concentrations of 4 ng/ml, vein to the
      interaction between rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg, insert the endotracheal intubation after mechanical
      ventilation.Adjust the propofol infusion control electrical double-frequency index between 45
      to 55.The experimental group to give intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/sack.And 1 mg/kg
      * d continuous application to the third day after surgery.

      1 day before the surgery, postoperative 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 7 days the MOCA scale to
      assess cognitive function after surgery for the patient.(T0) prior to the induction and bi
      (T1), 24 h after surgery (T2) and 48 h after surgery (T3) extraction in patients with venous
      blood, adopts the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) determination of serum IL - 1
      beta, IL - 6, Aβ1-42, p- Tau concentration.In rSO2 intraoperative continuous monitoring, and
      calculate the average rSO2, intraoperative rSO2 down the biggest percentage compared with
      basic value rSO2 % of Max.And record the occurrence of adverse reactions to special
      circumstances.
