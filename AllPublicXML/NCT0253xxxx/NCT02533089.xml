    <textblock>
      Task shifting of less complex healthcare tasks to lay health workers (LHWs) is increasingly
      employed strategy to address the global shortage of skilled health workers. Despite
      availability of effective treatment, tuberculosis (TB) remains an important cause of
      mortality with 1.3 million lives lost globally to TB in 2012. The greatest proportion of new
      TB cases occurs in Africa and over 95% of TB deaths occur in low income countries (LICs). In
      response to the combined high TB burden and severe healthcare worker shortages in these
      settings, outpatient TB care is among the tasks commonly shifted to LHWs.

      LHWs are community members who have received some training but are not healthcare
      professionals. Randomised trials show LHWs improve access to basic health services and TB
      treatment outcomes, however, insufficient training and supervision are recognized barriers to
      their effectiveness.

      The investigators' goal is to improve TB care provided by LHWs in Malawi by implementing and
      evaluating a knowledge translation (KT) strategy designed to facilitate incorporation of
      evidence into LHW practice. The investigators will employ a mixed methods design including a
      pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness of the strategy and
      qualitative methods to understand barriers and facilitators to scalability and sustainability
      of the program.
