  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is open-label, single-arm, two-stage phase II trial of olaparib in patients with
      relapsed/refractory metastatic germ cell cancer. The primary objective is to evaluate the
      preliminary activity of Olaparib in GCT tumors. The secondary objective is to evaluate the
      safety of Olaparib in patients with cisplatin-refractory GCT.

    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of principle open-label, single-arm, two-stage phase II trial of olaparib 300
      mg twice daily in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic germ cell cancer. The study
      will recruit 10 patients, if no response is seen the study is terminated. If one or more
      responses are observed, further 19 patients (for a total of 29 patients) will be enrolled. If
      4 or more of the first 29 evaluable patients have achieved objective response, further
      studies in patients with metastatic germ cell cancer are warranted.

      The main inclusion criteria are:

        -  Patient with metastatic gonadal GCT or extragonadal GCT originating from retroperitoneum
           or mediastinum.

        -  Disease progression during cisplatin-based chemotherapy or disease progression or
           relapse after high-dose chemotherapy or disease progression or relapse after at least 2
           different cisplatin-based regimens

        -  At least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed by CT/MRI/plain x-ray) at
           baseline and follow up visits.

      The study will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Secondary parameters will be analyzed
      exploratively for the intent-to-treat population.

      Correlations between with biomarkers (PAR, poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase
      (PARP-1), PTEN, XPA, ERCC1-3, XPF, FanD2, γ-H2AX) expression in paraffin-embedded tumor
      samples and clinical outcome will be performed in an exploratory intent. Plasma samples will
      be collected at baseline and at response/progression for possible retrospective biomarkers
      study.
