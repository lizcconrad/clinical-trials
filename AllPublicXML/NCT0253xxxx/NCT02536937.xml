      Primary Objective:

      To study the effect of mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of eliglustat.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the tolerability of eliglustat tartrate given as a single dose in subjects with
      mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment in comparison with matched subjects with normal
      renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total study duration from screening period is approximately 31 days. In stage 1, only
      subjects with severe renal impairment and normal renal function will be enrolled. Subjects
      with mild and moderate renal impairment may be enrolled in stage 2 if the results in subjects
      with severe renal impairment show a substantial effect of reduced renal function on
      pharmacokinetics.
