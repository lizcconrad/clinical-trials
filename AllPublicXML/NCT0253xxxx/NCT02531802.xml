  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the ETEC vaccine ETVAX with and without dmLT
      adjuvant is safe and immunogenic in adults, children, toddlers and infants in Bangladesh.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II trial will serve to assess whether ETVAX is safe and provides mucosal as well
      as systemic immune responses against the key protective antigens when tested in different
      age-groups in Bangladesh. This study provides an opportunity to test the safety profile of a
      mucosal adjuvant, double-mutant LT (dmLT), in adults and children, as well as provide the
      opportunity to potentially assess the ability of dmLT to further enhance the mucosal and
      systemic antibody responses to key antigens in the ETVAX vaccine among age groups in
      developing country sites, like Bangladesh, that have proved refractory to oral immunization
      with enteric vaccines. In addition, this study also allows for the evaluation of the
      potential dose-sparing effect of dmLT when combined with a lower dose of vaccine. Finally,
      this clinical trial is considered an essential study along the critical path of the overall
      clinical development plan before determining whether the vaccine can be tested for protective
      efficacy in children in developing countries.
