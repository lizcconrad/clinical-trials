  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a two-arm prospective cohort and pharmacokinetic study comparing
      levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetics in HIV-positive women taking
      antiretroviral regimens that include ritonavir to those in women who take regimens known not
      to interact with combined oral contraceptives. In addition, the prevalence of ovulation will
      be measured in each group. Participants will take a combined oral contraceptive containing
      levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol for 21 days, during which they will undergo twice-weekly
      serum progesterones. On the final day, they will complete a pharmacokinetic study. The
      investigators hypothesize that levonorgestrel levels, as measured by area-under-the-curve
      from 0 to 72 hours, will be increased in women on ritonavir, while ethinyl estradiol levels
      will be decreased and ovulation, defined by a serum progesterone of at least 3 ng/mL, will be
      unchanged.

      This study will be the first to evaluate the effects of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of
      a combined oral contraceptive containing the progestin levonorgestrel. In addition, no
      previous studies have rigorously assessed ovulation in women taking protease inhibitors and
      combined oral contraceptives. As a result, this study will provide new information
      correlating pharmacokinetic changes with effects on ovulation.
