      The NeST registry is a pro-active industry-academic collaboration to assess the use and
      safety of NeuroAiD in the real world setting. An online entry system was set up to allow easy
      data entry and retrieval of clinical information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NeST Registry is designed as a product registry that would provide information on the use
      and safety of NeuroAiD in clinical practice. An online NeST Registry was set up to allow easy
      entry and retrieval of essential information including demographics, medical conditions,
      clinical assessments of neurological, functional, and cognitive state, compliance,
      concomitant medications and side effects if any, among patients on NeuroAiD. Participation is
      voluntary. Data collected are similar to information obtained during standard care and are
      prospectively entered by the participating physicians at baseline (before initialization of
      NeuroAiD) and during subsequent visits. The follow up visits are timed with clinical
      appointments. Anonymized data will be extracted and collectively analyzed. Initial target
      sample size for the registry is 2000.

        The NeST Registry is a product-specific and safety outcome registry that includes patients
        who are taking NeuroAiD. Participation is entirely voluntary and an agreement will be
        obtained before inclusion. The decision on the use of NeuroAiD should be made following a
        discussion between participant and physician and only then will the option of participation
        in the registry be considered.
