    <description>CLUE- The Contact Lens User Evaluation (CLUE)™ questionnaire is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20) with a range of 0-120, where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response (Wirth, RJ. Et al. August 2016). Keratometry measurements of major keratometric meridians (diopter [DK]) and their location (degrees) was collected at baseline for both eyes. The correlation between CLUE comfort and maximum Keratometry measurements of the two eyes within each subject and the correlation between CLUE comfort and the minimum Keratometry measurements of the two eyes within each subject were reported.</description>

August 2016). Corneal diameter (horizontal visible iris diameter [HVID]) was collected at baseline for both eyes using a slit lamp reticle, measuring to the nearest 0.05 mm.The maximum (or minimum) measurements of HVID between the two eyes of each subject were used for correlation analyses between subjective CLUE comfort score and corneal diameter.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          -  The subject must be no less than 18 and no more than 45 years of age with no
             presbyopic add.

          -  The subject must be willing and able to adhere to the instructions set out in the
             protocol.

          -  The subject must be an adapted soft contact lens wearer in both eyes.

          -  The subject must be willing to wear the study contact lenses up to 14 hours/day.

          -  The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the
             range of -1.00 Diopters (D) to -6.00 D in each eye.

        <description>CLUE- The Contact Lens User Evaluation (CLUE)™ questionnaire is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20) with a range of 0-120, where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response (Wirth, RJ. Et al. August 2016). Keratometry measurements of major keratometric meridians (diopter [DK]) and their location (degrees) was collected at baseline for both eyes. The correlation between CLUE comfort and maximum Keratometry measurements of the two eyes within each subject and the correlation between CLUE comfort and the minimum Keratometry measurements of the two eyes within each subject were reported.</description>
