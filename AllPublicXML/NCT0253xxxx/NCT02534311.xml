  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to prospectively evaluate RA activity using the
      assessment of change in DAS28 under local conditions in Slovakia in participants who are
      treated with subcutaneously administered tocilizumab pursuant to the recommendations of the
      Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic in order to better assess the disease activity and
      impairment of the joint function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with age greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 18 years

          -  Participants with moderate to severe active RA (DAS28 &gt;=3.2) who did not respond
             sufficiently to or did not tolerate previous treatment with one or several
             disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), irrespective of whether they were of
             biological or synthetic nature

          -  Participants eligible for the treatment with subcutaneously administered tocilizumab,
             as decided by the doctor in accordance with summary of product characteristics (SPC)
             and standard therapeutic procedures, who were not previously treated with tocilizumab
             and did not receive any other biological treatment for RA in the past either

          -  Assignment of participants for observation using the treatment described above is
             clearly separated from the physician's decision to prescribe the treatment to the
             patient.

          -  Pulmonologist's consent for chest X-ray and quantiferon test with commencement of
             biological treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg,) hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) positivity

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic responses to human or humanized murine
             monoclonal antibodies

          -  History of intestinal ulcerations or diverticulitis

          -  Active hepatopathy with more than threefold increase of alanine transaminase (ALT) or
             aspartate transaminase (AST)

          -  Thrombocytes &lt;100,000 per cubic milliliters (/mm^3), less than (&lt;) 3,000 mm^3,
             absolute neutrophil count &lt; 2,000 mm^3

          -  Women of childbearing age (without medically confirmed sterility, e.g. following
             hysterectomy, ovariectomy, menopause lasting 2 years) who do not accept the use of a
             suitable form of contraception (e.g. barrier methods of contraception in the
             participant and partner, contraceptive pills or patches, hormonal implants,
             spermicidal agents in combination with barrier method of contraception, intrauterine
