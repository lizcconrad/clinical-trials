  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders remain a significant public health problem. The pharmacological
      facilitation of behavioral treatment represents a promising strategy for addressing
      disordered drinking. Alcohol use disorders are recognized to be associated with various
      vulnerabilities that complicate the course of treatment and that may be amenable to glutamate
      modulators. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial is to test various
      glutamate modulators in conjunction with motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for alcohol
      use disorders.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals diagnosed with alcohol dependence will be randomized to receive a single infusion
      of glutamate modulators during week 2 while engaged in a 5-week course of MET. They will meet
      with staff twice weekly, except for week 2 during which they will present to the clinic three
      times. Clinic visits include MET sessions, psychiatric monitoring, assessments, and study
      procedures (e.g., medication administration).
