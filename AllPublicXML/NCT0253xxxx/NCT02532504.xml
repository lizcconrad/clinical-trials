    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to deliver CBT based intervention called &quot;Change your life with 7
      Sheets of paper&quot; to women with mild to moderate postnatal depression (PND) through trained
      traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Participants will be recruited from low income area in
      Karachi Pakistan. Edinburg Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) will be used to screen mothers
      having children between birth till 12 months. Group intervention will be delivered through
      trained TBAs.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence rate of PND in Pakistani women and its effect on the growth and development of
      young children and child mortality is very high. Despite availability of interventions to
      improve maternal health, the major issue in implementation of those interventions is because
      of limited availability of trained health professionals . Therefore the aim of this study is
      to train TBAs in delivering Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based intervention called
      &quot;Changing your life with seven sheets of paper&quot;. Participants will be recruited from low
      income area in Karachi. Total 36 participants will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups;
      intervention and Treatment As Usual (TAU) group. Total 8 sessions will be delivered by
      trained TBAs over the period of 3 months.
