  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of two types of group exercise classes on the
      health and functional status in inactive adults age 18-65 with neurological conditions
      including Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, and spinal cord injury (SCI). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of three groups; Movement to Music, Adapted Yoga, or a waitlist
      group who will complete a home-based exercise intervention of either Movement to Music or
      Adapted Yoga.

    <measure>Balance as measured by the Timed Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed to Up and Go test is performed using a chair with arms. The participants stand up from the chair, walk to a mark measured three meters from the chair then return back to the seat. A score of greater than or equal to 14 seconds (average) has been shown to indicate a high risk of falling.</description>

    <measure>Balance as measured by Repeated Chair Stands</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The repeated chair stands test is performed by asking participants to stand up and sit down 5 times as fast as possible. A score of greater than or equal to 14 seconds (average) has been shown to indicate a high risk of falling.</description>
