  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the acute effect of consuming milk and butter fortified with
      either vitamin D3 or 25 (OH) D3 on serum/plasma vitamin D status in humans. In addition, the
      effect of vitamin D3 or 25 (OH) D3 in milk and butter on certain CVD risk markers and
      cognitive function will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is mounting evidence to show that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of many
      common and serious diseases, including osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, some cancers and
      type 1 diabetes (Holick and Chen, 2008). Hypovitaminosis D is now prevalent in the UK general
      population. Due to diet and lifestyle changes and the use of sun block products most people
      do not endogenously synthesise sufficient vitamin D from sunlight exposure (Hyppönen and
      Power, 2007). Therefore, vitamin D intakes from dietary sources have become very important,
      however this is limited as there are only a few foods naturally rich in vitamin D.

      Some countries (e.g. USA, Canada) fortify milk with vitamin D which results in milk being the
      major contributor to vitamin D intake. Vitamin D3 is the most common form used for the
      fortification of currently fortified foods. However, there is now some evidence that 25(OH)D3
      can increase vitamin D status of humans more effectively than vitamin D3 (Bischoff-Ferrari et
      al, 2012; Cashman et al, 2012). To our knowledge, very few human intervention studies have
      compared the efficacy of 25(OH)D3 versus vitamin D3 to increase vitamin D status, and there
      has been no acute human study to examine the effect of the both forms of vitamin D fortified
      dairy products on vitamin D status in humans.

    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT) will be used for cognitive test, which can provides information on visual search, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, and executive function. The TMT consists of two parts: TMT-A requires a participant to draw lines sequentially connecting 25 encircled numbers distributed on a computer screen, whilst in the TMT-B the participant must alternate between numbers and letters (e.g., 1, A, 2, B, 3, C, etc.). TMT-A and TMT-B will be administered using a laptop computer. Results from this two tasks reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task (completion time). The longer time spent reveal greater cognitive impairment.&quot;</description>
