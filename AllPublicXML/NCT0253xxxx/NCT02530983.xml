      The Mayo Clinic Conduit Report Card Questionnaires have been created in order to have a
      consistent evaluation tools for patients undergoing esophagectomy or esophageal
      reconstruction in order to standardize and validate outcome measures. Data will be used to
      establish the validation of the Mayo Clinic Conduit Report Card Questionnaires. Data will
      also lead to the establishment of &quot;normal&quot; or expected scores for patients undergoing each
      type of esophagectomy procedure

      The Mayo Clinic Conduit Report Card Questionnaires are a compilation of standard
      questionnaires and questions that have been created specifically for this study some of which
      are patient report and others that are administered by the provider or study staff. It
      includes the Promis Global Health Score, modified Mayo GER Score questions, modified
      Dysphagia Questionnaire-30 Day questions, and Zubrod Score. It also includes a 10-point scale
      to grade postoperative pain, milk assessment, Modified Mayo Reflux Score adapted from the
      Mayo Clinic Reflux Score, Dumping Score adapted from Sigstad's Scoring System, Simple
      Dysphagia Score adapted from Mellows and Pinkas, Stricture Score adapted from Blackmon, et
      al., Pyloric Spasm Score, and Conduit Emptying Score abstracted from Vaezi, Baker, Achkar,
      and Richter. We will also be collecting information on their demographics, operation,
      nutritional status, laboratory values, testing results and clinical outcomes. Patients will
      be asked to complete the Mayo Clinic Conduit Report Card Questionnaires at their one month
      surgical follow up visit and then every three months for 1 year after surgery, then with each
      surveillance clinic visit or a minimum of once per year for their lifetime. The questionnaire
      can be completed at their clinic visit, over the telephone, or by mail. The patient's medical
      record will also be reviewed to gather any other contributing information.
