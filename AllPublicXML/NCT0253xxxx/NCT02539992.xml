      This study will be a prospective, randomized evaluation of the ShapeMatch Cutting Guide for
      primary total knee replacement (TKR) in a consecutive series of patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria. Forty-eight cases enrolled will receive the Triathlon® Cruciate
      Retaining Total Knee System (Triathlon® CR) in a procedure using patient-specific cutting
      guides to reproduce the natural kinematic alignment of the knee. Another forty-eight cases
      enrolled will receive the Triathlon® CR device in a procedure using patient-specific cutting
      guides modified to provide neutral overall limb alignment of the knee. And the last
      forty-eight cases will receive the Triathlon® CR device in a procedure using traditional
      instrumentation intended to achieve a neutral overall limb alignment.

    <measure>Assessment of Better Functional Performance of Total Knee Replacement (TKR) Using a Kinematic Aligned ShapeMatch Cutting Guide by Means of Fluoroscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate by means of fluoroscopy that TKR's performed using a kinematic aligned ShapeMatch Cutting Guide provides better short term kinematic and functional performance compared to those TKR's performed with ShapeMatch cutting guides modified to provide neutral overall limb alignment or with conventional instrumentation intended to achieve neutral overall limb alignment.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With the Get-up and go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Get-up-and-go test uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.
One source suggests that scores of ten seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11 - 20 seconds are within normal limits for frail elderly and disabled patients, and greater than 20 seconds means the person needs assistance outside and indicates further examination and intervention. A score of 30 seconds or more suggests that the person may be prone to falls.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Patient Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales: Pain, other symptoms, function in daily living , function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) Patient Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The FJS consists of 12 questions and focuses on the patients' awareness of their joint replacement during a range of day to day and recreational activities. The score has a range of 0-100. High scores indicate good outcome, i.e., a high degree of being able to forget about the affected joint in daily life.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With the EuroQuol-5 Dimension Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D index has an upper bound equal to 1 that indicates full health (indicated by &quot;no problem&quot; in all domains), whereas 0 represents death. Negative values are allowed, and the lower bound varies depending on country-specific value set used. UK time Trade Off (UKTTO) indicates the patient status compared to the normal state of the UK population.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With the Short Form - 36 Health Survey (SF-36).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a 36-item patient completed questionnaire to measure general health and well-being. It includes a physical and mental status component score; each ranging from 0-100. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good health state.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Better Performance of TKR Using a Kinematic Aligned ShapeMatch Cutting Guide by Functional Evaluation With Knee Society Score (KSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, Range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

One source suggests that scores of ten seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11 – 20 seconds are within normal limits for frail elderly and disabled patients, and greater than 20 seconds means the person needs assistance outside and indicates further examination and intervention.

          <title>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) Patient Questionnaire.</title>
          <description>The FJS consists of 12 questions and focuses on the patients’ awareness of their joint replacement during a range of day to day and recreational activities. The score has a range of 0-100. High scores indicate good outcome, i.e., a high degree of being able to forget about the affected joint in daily life.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to early study termination, there was limited data available for analysis and therefore insufficient power to provide robust, meaningful results for our primary or secondary analysis.</limitations_and_caveats>
