      This is a multicenter study in Japan. Eleven sites which have already participated in the
      investigator-initiated clinical study (Early Access Program) will participate in this
      study.The objective of this study is to gain further information on the safety and efficacy
      of treatment with asfotase alfa.

      The primary objective of this study was to collect data on the safety of repeated
      subcutaneous (SC) injections of asfotase alfa. There were no secondary objectives.
      Exploratory objectives related to the efficacy of asfotase alfa are not being reported.

    <description>Adverse events are any unwanted adverse medical occurrence in patients who are treated with a medicinal drug, whether or not considered drug-related. This includes events observed in patients administered with asfotase alfa between the first dose of asfotase alfa and the completion of patient's last visit for the clinical study.</description>

             the performance of any study-related procedures and must be willing to comply with
             study procedures. Where appropriate and required by local regulations, patient assent
             for participation must also be obtained.

          2. Patient has completed the investigator-initiated clinical study (HPPJEAP-01) protocol
             for asfotase alfa

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a documented form of rickets caused by a condition other than HPP,
             including, but not limited to, rickets caused by 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency

          2. Patient has serum calcium and/or phosphorus levels below the normal range

          3. Patient is pregnant or lactating

          4. Patient received treatment with bisphosphonates within 2 years prior to the Screening
             visit

          5. Patient has a documented sensitivity to any of the components of asfotase alfa

          6. Patient is currently enrolled in any other program or clinical study involving an
             investigational new drug, device, or treatment for HPP (eg, bone marrow
             transplantation)

          7. Patient has clinically significant other disease in the opinion of the Investigator,
             defined as any other non HPP-related condition for which the patient is considered
             medically unstable.

At the Investigator’s discretion, patients were continued on the dose established in the Investigator-initiated studies, receiving either 1 mg/kg asfotase alfa 6 times per week or 2 mg/kg asfotase alfa 3 times per week.</description>

          <description>Adverse events are any unwanted adverse medical occurrence in patients who are treated with a medicinal drug, whether or not considered drug-related. This includes events observed in patients administered with asfotase alfa between the first dose of asfotase alfa and the completion of patient’s last visit for the clinical study.</description>
          <population>All patients who met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were defined as the enrolled population, which was also the analysis population.The safety set comprised all patients who received at least 1 dose of the investigational drug.</population>
