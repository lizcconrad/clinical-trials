  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Patient Centered Virtual Multimedia Interactive Informed Consent tool (VIC) will be
      developed as a patient-centered web-based mobile application and will be able to run on
      mobile devices. The development of VIC is to create a reusable infrastructure for integrating
      the informed consent process into clinical care and the clinical workflow in a way that
      enhances patient comprehension while improving the efficiency of obtaining patient consent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The informed consent process protects patients and ensures ethical conduct of research. For
      patients to fully understand the content of the informed consent process, it should clearly
      explain the purpose, process, risks, benefits and alternatives to medical procedures or
      clinical research as well as a patient's rights and responsibilities. Patient safety and
      quality of care are at risk if the informed consent process is not delivered in a way that
      assures patient comprehension.

      Adoption of methods that allow researchers to conduct brief and virtual interviews with
      participants to complete the informed consent process using tablet computers (e.g. iPads)
      with a comprehensive multimedia library (e.g. video clips, animations, presentations, etc.)
      to explains the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the clinical care will enhance patient
      comprehension.

      The goal of this project is to help make the conduct of patient centered outcomes research
      (PCOR) more efficient and more widely implemented by engaging key stakeholders, including
      patients, through the development and evaluation of a new mobile health (mHealth) informed
      consent tool to disseminate PCOR findings in informed consent research.

      This study will be conducted over a 15 month period and will consist of 6 parts: (1)
      Front-End Focus Groups, (2) User Requirements Analysis, (3) Screen Prototypes Usability Focus
      Groups, (4) Design and Implementation, (5) Before Launch Usability Evaluation, (6) After
      Launch Usability Evaluation. Given the steps in the process and the changing (i.e. different)
      subjects/participants in each component of the development process, this study registration
      record primarily summarizes the final step in the development of VIC.

    <description>Asthma Patients will use the VIC to complete the informed consent on an iPad. Following 3-5 weeks of use, 8-10 users will be selected to take part in a focus group to evaluate the usability of VIC. The intent of this post-launch focus group, will be to gather opinions, beliefs, and attitudes about VIC. The focus group data will be used to arrive at themes that are common among the focus group participants. This feedback will be used to assess the completed VIC tool and inform further development of such tools.</description>

    <description>Researchers will conduct a focus group to evaluate VIC after it has been developed and used by patients. Six asthma patients will comprise this post-launch focus group, with the goal of gathering opinions, beliefs, and attitudes about VIC. We will use this information to enhance the generalizability of the VIC approach.</description>

        The target population for this study includes patients from the Yale Center for Asthma and
        Airway Disease (YCAAD) clinic. Participants for the VIC study will be recruited from the
        large and diverse asthma population that the YCAAD GenEx 2.0 trial accesses for enrollment.
