  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, recurrent, and frequent chronic disorder.
      Treatment is often challenging; an estimated 20-40% of patients do not benefit sufficiently
      from existing antidepressant interventions including trials of medication and psychotherapy.
      A 15-25% of patients manifest a chronic, treatment-resistant course of illness, resulting in
      a need for additional treatment options. Brain stimulation techniques are considered as a
      promising therapeutic approach in affective disorders like MDD. Transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been largely
      investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been
      proposed as novel treatment in MDD. In the largest 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial
      in MDD to date, Brunoni et al. (2013) have shown that tDCS combined with an Selective
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline) resulted in an antidepressant efficacy
      superior to placebo treatment, tDCS alone and sertraline alone.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the sustained efficacy and tolerability of repeated
      tDCS for the treatment of MDD. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS in combination with an
      SSRI will provoke an antidepressant effect while antidepressant medication alone (sham tDCS)
      did not. This will be measured by the change from baseline in the Montgomery Åsberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores after 6 weeks of treatment.

      In this randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial (5 centers involved) patients with a
      diagnosis of MDD receive a 6-weeks treatment with prefrontal tDCS (anode over electrode
      position F3, cathode over F4, 5 sessions/week for 4 weeks followed by 2 sessions/week for 2
      weeks, 24 treatments in sum, 30min/day, 2mA intensity) or sham tDCS (frequency and duration
      correspondent active tDCS, ramp in and ramp out periods only without intermittent
      stimulation), as adjunctive treatment with a SSRI. Follow-up per patient is 3 and 6 months
      after the last tDCS treatment session. Before, during and after the treatment period
      different assessment scales will be conducted to record neuropsychological features and the
      course of the individual symptomatology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women 18-65 years of age.

          -  Primary DSM-5 diagnosis of Major Depression as assessed by the Structured Clinical
             Interview for DSM-5 Axis I Disorders, Research Version (SCID-5-RV) with a single or
             recurrent episode with the additional requirements of a current episode with a
             duration of ≥4 weeks.

          -  Current depressive episode is less than 5 years duration (the definition of an episode
             is demarcated by a period of ≥2 months in which the patient did not meet full criteria
             for the DSM-5 definition of major depressive episode).

          -  Total HDRS-21 ≥15 at the screening visit.

          -  The patient did not respond to at least one antidepressant treatment, i.e., a minimum
             of 1 and a maximum of 4 antidepressant drug trials, of adequate dose and duration
             (defined as a minimum level of 2 on the ATHF) in the current episode.

          -  Patient is taking a SSRI of adequate dose and ≥4 weeks (defined as a minimum level of
             2 on the ATHF) in the current episode.

          -  Capable and willing to provide informed consent.

          -  Negative pregnancy test and willingness to use contraceptive measures during study

          -  High degree of therapy resistance defined as &gt;4 sufficient treatment attempts in the
             current episode (each attempt with an ATHF score of &gt;3).

          -  Treatment with electroconvulsive therapy in the present episode.

          -  Treatment with deep brain stimulation or vagus nerve stimulation and/or any other
             intracranial implants (clips, cochlear implants).
