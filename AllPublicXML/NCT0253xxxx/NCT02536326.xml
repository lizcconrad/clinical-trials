      resistant hypertension in Chinese patients in a prospective cohort study.

      Currently, considerable data on RDN have been obtained from Western populations, while the
      clinical outcomes of RDN in East Asian populations are seldom reported. Therefore, the
      purpose was to evaluate 6-month outcomes of RDN for the treatment of resistant hypertension
      in Chinese patients.In a prospective single-center cohort study, 50 Chinese patients with
      resistant hypertension would be recruited to undergo RDN by LEPU Renal denervation system,
      which was similar to Symplicity the Symplicity renal-denervation system (Medtronic). The
      primary effectiveness endpoint was change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at six
      months as measured by office-based blood pressure assessment and 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring following therapeutic renal denervation compared to baseline. The primary
      safety endpoint was the incidence of Major Adverse Event (MAE) through 6 months , including
      severe renal artery dissection/stenosis(&gt;60%) that required stenting or surgery,
      cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, death.
