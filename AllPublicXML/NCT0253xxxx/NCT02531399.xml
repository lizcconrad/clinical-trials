  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurovascular coupling or functional hyperemia is defined as an essential physiologic
      mechanism in the brain, which is necessary for the local adaption of blood flow to altered
      metabolic demands of the tissue. It has been shown that also in the eye, blood flow is
      considerably coupled to retinal neural activity. The current concept of functional hyperemia
      is that visual stimulation, as flicker light, effectuates increasing neural activity in the
      retina, which elevates the metabolic needs of the retinal tissue for oxygen and glucose and
      consequently induces dilatation and augmented blood flow in the retinal vasculature. In
      several studies, stimulation with flicker light has been shown to induce an increase of blood
      flow in major retinal arteries and veins as well as an increase of optic nerve head blood
      flow. Up until now, flicker induced changes in blood flow were measured solely in the major
      retinal arteries and veins with systems such as the commercially available dynamic vessel
      analyzer (DVA) by Imedos and with laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV).

      In the present study, the investigators propose to measure the response of total retinal
      blood flow to diffuse luminance flicker stimulation with bi-directional Fourier Domain
      Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography (FDOCT) as well as with Laser Speckle Flowgraphy (LSFG)
      in healthy subjects by assessing vessel diameter, blood velocity and blood flow of all
      retinal vessels. For comparative reasons, the investigators will furthermore assess the blood
      flow of major retinal arteries and veins with the dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA) and laser
      Doppler velocimetry (LDV).
