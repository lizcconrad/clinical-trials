    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of metacognitive group therapy on depression compared to
      mindfulness groups and supportive groups. The participants, all with a history of depression
      and with current symptoms of depression, will be randomized to one of the three group
      interventions.

      Metacognitive therapy (MCT) show promising results in alleviating depressive symptoms and
      reducing relapse of depression. However studies of MCT as a group intervention is limited and
      higher quality studies of the effectiveness of MCT is warranted. The present study aim to
      produce more conclusive evidence on the effect of MCT comparing MCT in groups with both and
      active control group and mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which together with
      pharmacotherapy is currently one of the preferred treatment choices. Currently
      pharmacotherapy, cognitive therapy and MBCT seem to help 40-58% of the patients efficiently.
      The current studies of MCT indicate that this intervention may help a higher proportion of
      the patients.
