  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare anatomical differences, quality of life and sexual
      function and complications rate between apical support with one anterior vaginal mesh versus
      repair with two separate meshes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the presence of stage 3 anterior wall prolapse (cystocele) with second stage apical
      prolapse (uterine or vault prolapse) there are 2 optional ways to repair with vaginal mesh:
      (a) to use 2 separated meshes: anterior mesh to correct the anterior compartment and
      posterior mesh to correct the apical prolapse to the sacrospinous ligament (SSL). (b) To
      correct both anterior compartment and the apical prolapse with the same mesh while using the
      posterior arms of the mesh to fix the apical prolapse to the SSL. Each way has its advantages
      and disadvantages. The first way was described at the beginning of mesh use and might be more
      anatomical then the second newest way. The addition of apical support to the anterior mesh
      might theoretically shorten the vagina. There are several recent studies describing the
      anatomical outcomes both for anterior compartment and apical compartment with a single mesh.
      Mesh-related complications, which can be also related to the amount of vaginal meshes, can
      potentially decrease with one mesh as compare with 2 meshes.

      The aim of the study:

      If the anatomical results, vaginal length and quality of life, will be with no significant
      differences between the two groups, the investigators will recommend to use a single mesh, in
      order to avoid / minimize potential complications of vaginal mesh.

      If there will be no differences in complications in both groups but will be a significant
      difference in vaginal length and sexual function, the investigators will recommend using two
      meshes.
