      The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a CBT-based smoking cessation treatment
      enhanced with transdiagnostic skills for the management of anxiety and fear-based avoidance
      behaviors (CBT-A) relative to a standard CBT-based smoking cessation treatment (CBT-S) for
      smokers with elevated PTSD symptoms who were exposed to the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster.
      The investigators hypothesized that the CBT-A treatment would yield more favorable outcomes
      with regard to smoking abstinence as well as improvements in PTSD and respiratory symptoms
      over a 6-month follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory illness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the primary health sequelae
      of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster on September 11th 2001 and are often comorbid.
      Cigarette smoking is a modifiable health behavior associated with both lower respiratory
      symptoms (LRS) and PTSD. Smoking cessation programs are considered the crucial front-line
      intervention for smokers with pulmonary problems. Unfortunately, trauma exposed smokers with
      elevated PTSD symptoms have greater difficulty quitting, are more likely to fail standard
      cessation programs, and are more likely to relapse than smokers with other anxiety disorders
      and those without mental illness. Interventions that concurrently target mechanisms thought
      to maintain the comorbidity between PTSD and LRS (e.g., anxious reactivity to nicotine
      withdrawal, smoking to reduce negative affect) may offer a means of improving smoking quit
      rates in trauma exposed populations. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy
      of a combined CBT smoking cessation treatment enhanced with transdiagnostic skills for the
      management of anxiety and fear-based avoidance behaviors (CBT-A). The investigators
      randomized 90 WTC disaster exposed daily smokers with elevated PTSD symptoms to either CBT-A
      (N=44) or a standard CBT-based smoking cessation program (CBT-S; N=46). Participants were
      followed up to six months post-treatment.

    <description>CBT-A was an 8-session (1.5 hours/session) group treatment for quitting smoking comprised of an optimized protocol that incorporated all elements of the CBT-S treatment plus skills for reducing PTSD/anxiety symptoms and improving tolerance to withdrawal. The CBT-A intervention included skills based on a transdiagnostic approach: (1) repeated interoceptive exposures to feared bodily sensations (e.g., dizziness, racing heart); (2) corrective information about anxiety and cognitive restructuring of catastrophic misinterpretations of somatic sensations (e.g., &quot;I will lose control.&quot;); and (3) use of graduated in-vivo exposure to feared and avoided situational experiences related to anxiety, WTC-related PTSD triggers, and smoking (e.g., going to lower Manhattan; driving without smoking).</description>

    <description>CBT-S was an adapted group-based CBT smoking cessation treatment delivered in 8 sessions (1.5 hours/session) based on the most recent clinical practice guidelines from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. Standard cessation elements included psychoeducation on reasons for smoking and barriers to quitting, enlisting social support, monitoring and tapering cigarette use, and counseling regarding high-risk smoking situations and unhelpful ways of thinking about smoking and abstinence. The treatment was similar to protocols used in other smoking cessation research.</description>
