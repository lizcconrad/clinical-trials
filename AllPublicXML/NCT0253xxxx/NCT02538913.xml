  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer treatments often cause acute toxicity during treatment, and late toxicity after
      treatments have ended. Bowel dysfunctions, incontinence (anal and urinary) and dysfunction
      are late side effects associated with cancer treatment in general, and patients treated for
      pelvic malignancies are at a higher risk. In Norway, the incidence of rectal cancer was 1329
      in 2010. Advances in the treatment during the past few decades have led to fewer local
      recurrences and increased long-term survival, and today the relative survival is 66% for
      women and 64% for men. More patients are having sphincter-preserving surgery with low
      colorectal or ultralow coloanal anastomoses, and low anterior resection (LAR) is done in 70%
      of the patients with curative surgery. Unfortunately, many patients experience altered bowel
      function after LAR. Frequent bowel movements, urgency, evacuatory difficulties and fecal
      incontinence are common and distressing complications. These functional disturbances are seen
      in up to 50-60% of the patients, and most frequent when surgery is combined with neoadjuvant
      therapy. Urinary incontinence and decreased sexual function is also common in both men and
      women following rectal cancer treatment.

      In many surgical settings, patients with higher preoperative physical fitness rehabilitate
      more quickly and have fewer operative complications compared with patients who are less
      physically fit. Additionally, specific strength training of the pelvic floor muscles builds
      up muscle volume, elevates the location of the pelvic floor muscles and pelvic organs, and
      closes the levator hiatus thus providing improved structural support for the pelvic floor as
      well as more optimal automatic function. The aim of the present trial is to investigate
      whether exercise training including pelvic floor muscle training during preoperative
      radiotherapy can reduce symptoms of bowel, urinary and sexual dysfunction and affect the
      physiology of the anal sphincter muscle after LAR. In addition quality of life,
      cardiopulmonary parameters and postoperative complications will be studied.
