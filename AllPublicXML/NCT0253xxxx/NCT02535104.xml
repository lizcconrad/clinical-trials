    <textblock>
      Ranpirnase in topical formulation is an antiviral drug being evaluated for the topical
      treatment of anogenital warts. The aims of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of a topical formulation of ranpirnase in subjects with genital warts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of the evaluation of 4 weeks exposure to the study product; designed as
      randomized, double blinded, against vehicle to study the effects of 1 mg/ml concentration of
      ranpirnase on anogenital warts.

      The dermal reaction are scored on a scale that describes the amount of erythema, edema, and
      other features indicative of irritation.

      The clinical response are be scored on the basis of the percentage of the reduction of the
      lesions in size and number.
