    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a/1b study of SC-003 as a single agent and in combination with ABBV-181 in
      patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. SC-003 is an antibody-drug
      conjugate (ADC) comprised of a monoclonal antibody linked to a potent chemotherapy. ABBV-181
      is a humanized, recombinant, mAb that binds to cell surface expressed programmed cell death 1
      (PD-1).

    <textblock>
      Phase 1a is a dose escalation study in patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed
      ovarian cancer that are platinum-resistant or refractory. Phase 1b is an expansion study
      where patients will be enrolled and treated at recommended dose and schedule based on the
      Phase 1a.
