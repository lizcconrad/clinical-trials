  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a modified microfracture using
      collagen, and to compare them with those of a simple microfracture to prove the
      non-inferiority of the modified microfracture using collagen in patients with cartilage
      defects in their knees.

      This study was an open-trial study. One hundred subjects participated in it. The study was
      explained to the subjects and they voluntarily agreed to participate in it. Their eligibility
      to participate in the study was checked, and they were randomized either into the simple
      microfracture group or the modified microfracture group using collagen based on a centrally
      controlled randomization table. They were asked to follow the guidelines of the investigators
      during the study and to visit the hospital six times*, including for screening. At each
      visit, the subjects underwent an examination with doctors, a blood test, an X-ray procedure,
      an MRI, an observation with the naked eyes, and arthroscopy to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the procedure. (*If the screening date overlaps with the procedure date, the
      number of his or her visits would be five.)
