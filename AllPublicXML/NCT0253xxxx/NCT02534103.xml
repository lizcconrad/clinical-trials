    <textblock>
      As considering the close relationship between systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction,
      the EAS index e'/(a' x s') including systolic and diastolic function could be expected to
      predict hemodynamic changes during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery(OPCAB). Exposure
      of the grafting site during OPCAB needs displacement of the heart, resulting in hemodynamic
      instability.

      Therefore the investigators are going to evaluate EAS index with preoperative Transthoracic
      echocardiography(TTE) and want to know the relationship between preoperative EAS index and
      intraoperative hemodynamic changes in patients undergoing OPCAB, in a prospective
      observational study.

    <description>Mixed venous oxygen saturation(SvO2) reflects the balance of oxygen supply and demand immediately. Cardiac index(CI) also is a useful marker of how well the heart is functioning. Both variables can show the hemodynamic instability. With the comparison of EAS index and variables including SvO2 and CI, Investigator may draw the predictable value of the EAS index for predicting hemodynamic instability during OPCAB.</description>
