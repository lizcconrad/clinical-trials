    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of Do-It-Yourself studies in
      pregnant women to detect changes in health parameters by assessing compliance and user
      experiences of participants. Besides, the measured health will be analysed to increase
      insight in physiological development in pregnant women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open, parallel, do-it-yourself, explorative, two-group study.
      Subjects are women who are pregnant for approximately 3 months at the start of the study.
      Subjects will be included between week 12 and 15 of their pregnancy (T=-1). Week 16 is the
      start of the study (T=0). In the first group obese pregnant women (BMI â‰¥ 30) will be
      included; the second group will consist of lean pregnant women (BMI 18,5 - 25).

      The women will be requested to assess physiological parameters at regular intervals from
      three months pregnancy until giving birth (week 40). The assessment after giving birth, until
      three months after giving birth (total study duration of approximately nine months), is
      optional.

      Health parameters are known to be subject to change in pregnant women; the self-monitoring
      devices should be able to show these changes. Included subjects will be provided with the
      do-it-yourself devices, manuals and the study protocol. During the nine-month study, the
      subjects will use these do-it-yourself devices to self-monitor multiple health parameters in
      an at-home setting. They will be reminded to perform these tests via SMS. There are two
      frequency intervals defined (two week interval and eight week interval).
