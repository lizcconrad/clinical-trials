      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of niclosamide when given together
      with enzalutamide in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer that has
      spread from the primary site to other places in the body. Androgens such as testosterone can
      cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs like enzalutamide block androgens from
      driving tumor growth; however, when androgen receptor splice variants are present, these
      drugs may not be effective. Niclosamide may decrease the amount of androgen receptor splice
      variant present within tumor cells, thus promoting the anti-tumor effects of enzalutamide.
      Giving niclosamide together with enzalutamide may be a better treatment for prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of three-times-daily (TID) oral niclosamide combined
      with enzalutamide in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that has progressed
      on abiraterone (abiraterone acetate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of niclosamide plus enzalutamide on androgen receptor splice variant
      (AR-V) expression as determined by quantitative
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR).

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of three-times-daily (TID) oral niclosamide in men
      with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that has progressed on abiraterone.

      III. Determine the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate (i.e. proportion of subjects
      with &gt;= 50% decline in PSA from pre-study baseline) after 28-days of niclosamide plus
      enzalutamide.

      IV. Determine the effect of niclosamide plus enzalutamide on protein expression and the
      transcriptional program of circulating tumor cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of niclosamide.

      Patients receive niclosamide orally (PO) TID and enzalutamide PO daily. Treatment continues
      for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 58 and 88.
