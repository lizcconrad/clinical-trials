                transportation costs, lost income patients; Adverse drug reactions cost: the cost
                of treatment due to adverse drug reactions.

             -  Effect Evaluation:Symptoms and signs score, physical examination, the incidence of
                complications.

        5. Number of participants 600 participants will be divided into two groups, the
           experimental group (n=300)and the control group (n=300).Each group will be stratified
           into three layers according to fever, sore throat, fever and sore throats. 100 patients
           will be included in each level.

        6. Dose regimen

             -  treatment group: Jinyebaidu granule, blunt, 10g/time, three times a day; Compound
                Shuanghua granules placebo, blunt, 6g /time, 4 times a day.

             -  Control group: Compound double flowers particles, blunt, 6g/time, 4 times a day;
