      The purpose of this study is to compare effectiveness of short-term radiotherapy with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy(Experimental group) with preoperative long-term
      chemoradiotherapy(Control group) in locally advanced rectal cancer. The hypothesis is 3-year
      disease-free survival in Experimental group was non-inferior to that in Control group.

      The study is a prospective phase III randomized multicenter trial. The purpose of this study
      is to compare short-term radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy(Experimental group) with
      preoperative long-term chemoradiotherapy(Control group) for middle-lower locally advanced
      rectal cancer. The primary endpoint is 3-year disease-free survival, and the secondary
      objectives are 3-year local recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival and
      overall survival. Furthermore, the late toxicity profile and quality of life (QoL) after 3
      years follow-up are secondary endpoints.

      The STELLAR-trial has been designed by Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,
      and the hypothesis is 3-year disease-free survival in Experimental group was non-inferior to
      that in Control group.

    <description>The intervention of Experimental group is Short-course radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which consists of a short-course radiotherapy (SCRT, 5 Gy x 5 alone), then after 7-10 days of radiotherapy completed, patients will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, given in 3 week cycle of capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily, day 1-14 combined with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 once. In total, 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are prescribed preoperatively, then followed by a total mesorectal excision(TME) and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. If patients are eligible for postoperative chemotherapy this should consist of 4 cycles, which are the same as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>The intervention of Control group is long-term chemoradiotherapy(CRT), which consists of a long-term chemoradiation (2 Gy x 25 with capecitabine) preoperatively, followed by a total mesorectal excision(TME) and then postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The radiotherapy is given in combination with capecitabine in a dose of 825 mg/m2 twice daily on days when radiotherapy, excluding weekends. If patients are eligible for postoperative chemotherapy this should consist of 8 cycles of capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily, day 1-14 combined with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks.</description>
