  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is characterized by a permanent and abnormal dilatation of a part of the
      bronchial tree. An accumulation of mucus in the respiratory tract ensues, resulting in
      frequent bacterial infections and eventual destruction of the lungs. Clinically, patients
      present with a chronic productive cough and episodes of acute respiratory exacerbations.
      Chronic respiratory failure can follow. Although its prevalence is largely unknown,
      bronchiectasis is considered to be a rare and orphan disease. There are numerous causes for
      this disease: sequelae of respiratory infections, immunodeficiency, genetic diseases like
      cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia….The focus of this study will be on non cystic
      fibrosis bronchiectasis in children.

      Due to a lack of pediatric clinical trials, the management of children with this disease is
      widely based on the management of adults or patients with cystic fibrosis or
      pan-bronchiolitis. The treatment is based on respiratory physiotherapy, prevention of
      infections, administration of inhaled corticosteroids and anti biotherapy for acute
      exacerbations.

      Recently, some studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a family of antibiotics, the
      macrolides, in the treatment of cystic fibrosis or pan-bronchiolitis in children. Indeed,
      taken 3 times a week during a long period of time, the macrolides, and specifically the
      azithromycin have shown some anti-inflammatory and tissue repairing properties, in addition
      to their antimicrobial properties.

      Moreover, several studies conducted in the adult population have shown that the use of
      azithromycin has led to significant reduction in the frequency of respiratory exacerbations
      as well as an improvement in the quality of life.

      The efficacy of azithromycin in these respiratory diseases has led to enlarge its use for the
      long term treatment of bronchiectasis. Yet, this type of treatment has no marketing
      authorization application.

      No studies have been conducted in children, but individual examination of patients with
      bronchiectasis treated with azithromycin suggests an improvement of their symptoms.

      Thus, the use of azithromycin in the treatment of bronchiectasis in children seems to be a
      promising therapy. However, its efficacy needs to be demonstrated by clinical trials led on a
      pediatric population with an adequate number of patients and a strong methodology in order to
      ensure validity and reliability of the results.

      Therefore the investigators decided to conduct a comparative, prospective multicenter
      randomized study in this population.

      This study intends to include 100 patients already treated by azithromycin for at least 6
      months. After inclusion, they will be randomized in two groups of 50 patients each. The first
      group will continue the treatment and the other one will discontinue it.

      The patients will be followed from the inclusion period (M0) until the onset of the first
      exacerbation for a maximum of 6 months (M6), with an intermediate health care visit after 3
      months (M3).

      In case of exacerbation, a health care visit will be scheduled; the patient will receive the
      appropriate treatment and he will be suspended from the study.

      The duration of follow up for each patient is dictated by the occurrence of the first
      respiratory exacerbation, a maximum of 6 months .The total inclusion period is 12 months and
      the total duration of the study is 18 months.

    <description>Exacerbations are defined by a combination of major and minor clinical criteria (Kapur et al, 2012) and the need for an antibiotic therapy for lower respiratory tract in case of acute infection. These criteria are evaluated by parents with the help of a daily diary; respiratory exacerbation is confirmed by a clinical examination.</description>
