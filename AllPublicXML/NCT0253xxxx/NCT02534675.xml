  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about personalized cancer therapy including
      response to treatment and side effects. Information from the patient's medical record
      regarding the tests and treatments they have received, or will receive, for their cancer will
      be collected. Genomic testing on tissue from the primary tumor or metastases will be used to
      match therapy recommendations. Patients in which there is no appropriate matched therapy will
      receive systemic chemotherapy according to their treating physician's discretion. This
      information will be used to describe whether or not patients respond better when their
      physicians choose to treat them according to the genetic makeup of their tumor.

      This is a prospective, open label navigational investigation to evaluate the feasibility of
      using molecular profile-based evidence to determine individualized cancer therapy for
      patients with incurable malignancies. This is a non-randomized, histology-agnostic trial.
      While it is known that individual histologies are composed of a heterogeneous mix of genomic
      alterations, it is not clear that one case mix is better or worse than another. Thus, a
      strategy of molecular matching that may apply across cancers is being tested. All eligible
      and consented patients will have their tumor tissues genomic profiled by Foundation
      Medicine's FoundationOne genomic analysis. Patients will be stratified into Group 1
      (treatment naïve, unresectable/medically unfit for surgery), Group 2 (treatment naïve,
      metastatic), and Group 3 (prior treated), respectively. Following analysis for genomic
      alterations, matched therapy, if available, will be recommended by the Study Committee or
      Molecular Tumor Board. If the patients received the matched therapy, they are designated as
      in Arm A. Otherwise, if the patients received the unmatched therapy (i.e., treating
      physician's choice of traditional systemic chemotherapy), they are designated as in Arm B.
      The study feasibility will be measured by the ability to enroll patients, the acceptable
      turnaround time and the actionable information obtained from the genomic profiling, and the
      viability of identifying and delivering the matched therapy. The treatment efficacy will be
      determined among the patients groups and treatment arms. The safety profile of the treatment
      will also be assessed.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with incurable malignancies with ≥50% 2-year cancer-associated mortality (as
             estimated by 2 physicians and where appropriate according to 2014 National Cancer
             Database).

          -  Patients must have at least one of the following for diagnosis/disease status:

               -  Unresectable disease

               -  Metastatic disease

               -  Medically unfit for surgical resection but with an expected survival of &gt;3 months

               -  Disease where no conventional therapy leads to a survival benefit &gt;6 months

               -  Actionable alterations determined by FoundationOne assay

          -  For Groups 1 or 2, treatment naïve for newly diagnosed malignancies; patients must not
             have been treated with anti-tumor agents.

          -  For Group 3, ≥1 prior unmatched systemic therapy regimens (no prior matched therapy is
             permitted as immediately prior therapy). Patients must be off other anti-tumor agents
             for at least 5 half-lives of the agent or 4 weeks from the last day of treatment,
             whichever is shorter.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease for solid tumors.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 - 1.

          -  New York Hearth Association (NYHA) Functional Classification I - II.

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Disagreement of two oncologists on prognosis or resectability.

          -  Severe or uncontrolled medical disorder that would, in the investigator's opinion,
             confound study analyses of treatment response.
