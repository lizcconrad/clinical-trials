  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inherent with intricate allocation of brain resource and attention shift,
      postural-suprapostural task is defined as postural control takes place while the other
      concurrent task is being performed. Recent studies have indicated that attentional focusing
      alters attention allocation in the brain as well as motor performance of a
      postural-suprapostural task. Also, most studies have demonstrated benefits of inducing an
      external focus relative to internal focus for motor performance. However, postural difficulty
      might be a critical factor for choosing an appropriate focusing strategy, and the strategy
      used in a particular difficulty level do not always generalize to other difficulty levels.
      Besides, despite a lot of studies have been done, current findings are confined to behavioral
      observations in young healthy adults for lacking direct neural evidence. With the uses of
      H-reflex, event-related potential and behavioral measures, the purpose of the 3-year research
      project is to investigate the differences in performance quality and intrinsic neural
      mechanisms of a postural-suprapostural task for older adults and patients with Parkinson's
      disease, by adopting external and internal strategies for suprapostural task under different
      posture difficulties. In the first year, the investigators will characterize suprapostural
      focusing effect on reciprocity of a postural-suprapostural task, with a special focus on
      modulation of motoneuron excitability in sitting and standing posture for healthy young and
      older adults using H-reflex technique. In the second year, the adaptive selection of
      suprapostural focusing strategy will be investigated for patients with Parkinson's disease by
      varying the standing surface (stable/unstable surface). In the third year, the investigators
      will investigate suprapostural focusing effect on brain resource allocation for patients with
      Parkinson's disease, in light of event-related potential and movement-related potential. The
      present project is expected to have significant contributions not only to gain a better
      insight to neural correlates of concurrent postural and motor suprapostural tasks with
      internal/external focusing strategy under different posture difficulty, but to optimize
      treatment strategy for older adults and patients with Parkinson's disease with balance or
      multi-tasking disturbances.
