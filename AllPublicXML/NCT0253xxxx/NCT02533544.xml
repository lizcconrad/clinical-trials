             or greater than 2 years post-menopausal).

          3. Documented evidence of chronic HBV infection (e.g. HBsAg positive for more than 6
             months)

          4. Chronic hepatitis B with the following:

               -  HBeAg-positive and HBeAb negative at Screening

               -  Screening HBV DNA ≥ 1x 105 copies/mL

               -  Screening serum ALT level ≥ ×ULN(80 IU/L) and ≤ 10 ×ULN (by center laboratory
                  range) OR

               -  HBeAg-negative and HBeAb positive at Screening

               -  Screening HBV DNA ≥ 1x 104 copies/mL

               -  Screening serum ALT level ≥ ×ULN(80 IU/L) and ≤ 10 ×ULN (by center laboratory
                  range) OR

               -  Cirrhosis at Screening

               -  Screening HBV DNA ≥ 1x 104 copies/mL in HBeAg negative or

               -  Screening HBV DNA ≥ 1x 105 copies/mL in HBeAg positive

               -  Screening serum ALT level ≥ ×ULN and ≤ 10 ×ULN (by center laboratory range)

          5. A patient who treating with TDF as a treatment-naïve for Hepatitis B. Treatment naïve
             subjects defined as no history of antiviral therapy or &lt; 12 weeks of oral antiviral
             treatment with any nucleoside or nucleotide analogue, including lamivudine or
             adefovir, clevudine, telbivudine, entecavir

          6. Decompensated liver cirrhosis defined based on a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score ≥ 7
             (Child B and C) or presence with at least one episode of ascites, jaundice, hepatic
             encephalopathy or variceal bleeding

          7. Any previous treatment with interferon (pegylated or non-pegylated) must have ended at
             least 6 months prior to the baseline visit

          8. Must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study.

          1. Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding or who believe they may wish to become
             pregnant during the course of the study.

          2. Co-infection with HCV, HIV

          3. Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g. α-fetoprotein&gt; 50 ng/mL or as evidenced by
             recent ultrasound or other standard of care measure)

          4. Malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of specific cancers
             that are cured by surgical resection (basal cell skin cancer, etc). Subjects under
             evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible

          5. Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere
             with subject compliance

          6. Currently receiving therapy with cytotoxic agent, nephrotoxic agents, or agents
             capable of modifying renal excretion

          7. Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with
             dosing requirements.
