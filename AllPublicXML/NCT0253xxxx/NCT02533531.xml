  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to assess the feasibility and usability of the 1 Lead Patch as a
      whole, on patients outside the hospital, in the out-patient setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-phase evaluation of the use of a 1 Lead Patch System to monitor
      electrocardiogram (ECG) data and send the data to the LifeWatch Service Center, in the same
      manner as the existing ACT ambulatory telemetry system. It will be used in parallel with the
      standard 3 Lead ACT testing equipment used to monitor ECG outside the hospital. This study
      will not address safety or effectiveness and no comparator groups will be used. This study
      will not be treating any particular disease or condition and no randomization or blinding is
      required. Subjects will be selected in conjunction with their need for current outpatient
      telemetry monitoring.

    <description>Successful acquisition of ECG data by the 1-Lead patch with transmission to the central database via the gateway. Each patch includes a 'brain' that collects the ECG data and then transmits it to a cellular device called the 'gateway'. The gateway uses the cellular network to transmit the data to the central database. This is a composite outcome measure. Data were not collected.</description>

    <description>Successful performance of the 1-Lead Patch adhesive throughout the study period for each subject. Subject skin irritation will be assessed upon initial placement of the 1-Lead Patch by the clinical caregiver. Subjects will be asked to self-assess skin irritation and to report to the clinician at the end of the trail period. Data were not collected.</description>
