  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a phase I study to assess the pharmacodynamics of AZD9977 following
      single-dose administration to healthy male subjects. It is a single-blind (with regards to
      AZD9977 and AZD9977 Placebo), randomized, four-treatment, four-period crossover design, with
      a potential 5th and 6th randomized cross-over treatment period. In this study eplerenone is
      used as a positive control and fludrocortisone will be used as a challenge agent. In addition
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics will be assessed.

    <description>Clinically significant blood pressure values (if available) were recorded for all participants.
The systolic blood pressure (mmHg) and diastolic BP (mmHg) was obtained after each subject had rested in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and was performed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments of study protocol.
Abnormal findings in blood pressure after 10 minutes resting in the supine position was defined as following:
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 90 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg

    <description>Clinically significant pulse rate (if available) was recorded for all participants in the study.
The pulse was obtained after each subject had rested in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and was performed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments of study protocol.
Abnormal findings in pulse rate, after 10 minutes resting in the supine position, was defined as following:
• Pulse &lt; 45 or &gt; 85 beats per minute (bpm)</description>

A 12-lead ECG was obtained after each subject had rested in the supine position for at least 10 minutes and was performed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments of study protocol.
The investigator judged the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal. If abnormal, it would have been decided as to whether or not the abnormality was clinically significant and the reason for the abnormality would have been recorded. The investigator could add extra 12-lead resting ECG safety assessments if there were any abnormal findings of if the investigator considered it was necessary for any other safety reason. These assessments would have been entered as an unscheduled assessment.</description>

The complete physical examinations included an assessment of the general appearance, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, head, and neck (including ears, eyes, nose, mouth and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal and neurological systems. The brief physical examinations included an assessment of the general appearance, skin, abdomen, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The results of the physical examination were listed by body system for each subject. Body weight was listed by participant and time-point. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment were reported as an adverse event (AE).</description>

    <description>Clinically significant safety laboratory test values included hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis and urine chemistry, including urine creatinine and uric acid measurements. Viral serology and urine drugs of abuse, alcohol and cotinine were assessed for eligibility. If deterioration in laboratory value was associated with clinical symptoms and/or signs, the symptom or sign were reported as an adverse event and the associated laboratory result was considered as additional information. Laboratory results were listed and summarized according to change from baseline and repeat/unscheduled measurements. Any out of range laboratory results were flagged in the individual listings.</description>

             Note: Subjects consented and screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous
             phase I study, are not excluded.

A 12-lead ECG was obtained after each subject had rested in the supine position for at least 10 minutes and was performed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments of study protocol.
The investigator judged the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal. If abnormal, it would have been decided as to whether or not the abnormality was clinically significant and the reason for the abnormality would have been recorded. The investigator could add extra 12-lead resting ECG safety assessments if there were any abnormal findings of if the investigator considered it was necessary for any other safety reason.

        <description>Clinically significant safety laboratory test values included hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis and urine chemistry, including urine creatinine and uric acid measurements. Viral serology and urine drugs of abuse, alcohol and cotinine were assessed for eligibility. If deterioration in laboratory value was associated with clinical symptoms and/or signs, the symptom or sign were reported as an adverse event and the associated laboratory result was considered as additional information. Laboratory results were listed and summarized according to change from baseline and repeat/unscheduled measurements. Any out of range laboratory results were flagged in the individual listings.</description>
