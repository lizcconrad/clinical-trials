      Objectives: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of two recall intervals on caries
      incidence (primary outcome) in preschool children with high caries risk. The level of
      anxiety, oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL), time and cost (secondary outcomes)
      according to each interval will also be assessed. Methods: The sample will consist of 224
      children between 3-5 years of age, of both genders, with high caries risk according to the
      clinical criteria adapted from the Municipal Health Secretary of São Paulo. Children will be
      randomly allocated into two study groups: Group 1 (G1) - oral clinical examination +
      orientation for oral health and diet in return for 4 months; and Group 2 (G2) - oral clinical
      examination + orientation for oral health and diet in return for 8 months. An examiner
      calibrated and blinded to the study groups and the secondary outcomes will perform the
      clinical examinations, which consist of: gingival bleeding index, dental plaque index,
      detection of caries and its activity according to the ICDAS (International Caries Detection
      and Assessment System) and the clinical features of active and inactive caries lesions will
      be associated with the criteria discribed in ICDAS Commitee manual. An external dentist will
      conduct the assessment of the anxiety levels assessed by the Facial Image Scale, the OHRQoL
      measured by B-ECOHIS, the time and costs. All groups will be followed for an initial period
      of 16 months, totaling four follow-up visits for G1 and two follow-up visits to the G2. All
      analyzes will be performed by intention to treat (ITT) and considering the sensitivity
      analysis to assess the differences between the ITT analyzes and analyzes of complete cases.
