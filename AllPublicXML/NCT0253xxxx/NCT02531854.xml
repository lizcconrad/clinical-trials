          4. Patients with documented/confirmed intra-tumor positivity for HPV

          5. Patients with no major existing co-morbidities or medical conditions that will
             preclude administration of therapy, in the opinion of the Investigator

          6. Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1

          7. Patients will use contraception during the study

          7. Patients with inadequate recovery from any previous surgical procedure, or patients
             having undergone any major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to the start of
             study treatment

          8. Patients with evidence of inadequate organ function as defined in protocol

             (Alimta® or equivalent), or any of the excipients used in its formulation

         12. Patients with a history of an autoimmune disorder requiring systemic treatment within
             the past 3 months, or a documented history of a clinically severe autoimmune disease
             or a syndrome that requires systemic steroid or immunosuppressive agents

         13. Patients with a known immunodeficiency including patients: with HIV infection, who
             have undergone previous organ transplantation and require immunosuppressive therapy or
             long-term immunosuppressive therapy for any other reason

         14. Patients with interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis, active
             or prior documented inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative

             (e.g., elevated troponin or creatinine; uncontrolled diabetes), significant organ
             system dysfunction, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality, which in the
             opinion of the Investigator would either compromise the patient's safety or interfere
             with evaluation of the study treatment

         17. Patients with a psychiatric disorder, substance abuse disorder, or altered mental

         18. Patients with a history of or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or
             laboratory abnormality that might: confound the results of the trial, interfere with
             the patient's participation in the trial, or suggest that participation in the trial
             is not in the best interest of the patient, in the opinion of the treating
             investigator
