  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The supraclavicular block can provide effective surgical anesthesia of the forearm and hand.
      There have been many different approaches to ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial
      plexus block (US-SCBPB) according to the needle injection site (e.g. corner pocket approach,
      cluster approach) or number of needling (single or double injection). Numerous studies
      demonstrates good results (e.g. faster onset time) when using double injections rather than
      single injection. But double injection does not guarantee complete sensory block because
      ulnar nerve tends to be spared by its anatomical location.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that double injection in different plane (we call this new
      approach as a 2 plane-2 injection approach;2P2I) would overcome the weakness of the existing
      double injection in same plane (we call this approach as a 1 plane-2 injection approach;1P2I)
      like &quot;ulnar nerve sparing effect&quot;, and could have a good results (e.g. shortening the onset
      time or increasing rate of all four nerves block). Because 2P2I can achieve an effect of a
      &quot;tridimensionally administered LA&quot;, rather 1P2I only achieve an effect of a &quot;
      two-dimensionally administered LA&quot;.

    <description>subcutaneous injection is done widely. A nerve stimulating needle (Stimuplex insulated needle; D Plus B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) attached to a nerve stimulator (Stimuplex HNS12; B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) is advanced via an ultrasound in-plane approach. After the needle is penetrated the nerve sheath with a direction of downward, the nerve stimulator is then turned on. If hand muscle twitching is observed even at 0.3 mA, LA 15 mL (lidocaine mixed with epinephrine) is injected. After that, the stimulating needle is re-advanced at the behind site of the initial puncture site. And the needle is penetrated the nerve sheath with a direction of upward, and then the same process is performed and LA 15 mL is injected.</description>
