  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HPV vaccine coverage among adolescents in the US is suboptimal. This is particularly true
      among traditionally underserved adolescents. Few parent-targeted interventions have focused
      on the parental decision-making process. Self-persuasion, generating one's own arguments for
      engaging in a behavior, may be an effective means to influence parents' motivation to
      vaccinate their children. In a three-phase study, investigators are using quantitative and
      qualitative research methods to develop and refine a tablet-based self-persuasion
      intervention for parents who are undecided about the HPV vaccine. This clinical trial
      submission focuses on the second phase of the study. The results of the second phase will
      inform the third phase of the trial (also registered in clinical trials).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that HPV vaccination is recommended for male and female adolescents, HPV
      vaccine 3 dose coverage among adolescents is poor (38% for girls, 14% for boys). HPV-related
      cancers are a significant burden on the US healthcare system and could be prevented through
      adolescent vaccination. Rates of vaccination are suboptimal among underserved populations
      (uninsured, low-income, racial and ethnic minorities) often seen in safety-net clinics. Few
      interventions have been designed that target decision-making among parents of unvaccinated
      adolescents. Self-persuasion, generating of one's own arguments for a health behavior, may be
      an effective means of influencing HPV vaccination behaviors among undecided or ambivalent
      parents. Through three stages, investigators will identify and develop a self-persuasion
      intervention strategy to promote adolescent HPV vaccination in safety-net clinics. The
      current trial, Stage 2, is a four-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), using a 2x2
      factorial design, in which investigators will assign participants to one of four
      self-persuasion intervention conditions that vary by cognitive processing level (verbalize
      vs. listen to arguments) and choice of argument topics (parents choose vs. are assigned
      topics) to identify which intervention condition is optimal. Conducted in a laboratory
      setting, investigators will identify and select the optimal intervention condition through
      quantitative analysis of the effects on parents' vaccination intentions and qualitatively by
      exploring parental experiences with the self-persuasion tasks.
