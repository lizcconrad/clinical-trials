  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilation-associated pneumonia is the main site of healthcare-associated infections in the
      severe trauma patient, with a mean incidence rate of 35%. Ventilator-associated pneumonia
      increases morbi-mortality, length of stay in intensive care and overall management costs. As
      was recalled by the jury of the 2008 SFAR-SRLF consensus conference on the prevention of
      nosocomial infections contracted in intensive care, success in this preventive endeavour
      depends on a number of measures: orotracheal intubation route, maintaining tube cuff pressure
      between 25 and 30 cm H2O, maintaining a semi-seated position ≥30°, nasal and oropharyngeal
      care at regular intervals, striving to avoid unscheduled extubation, and use of a written
      sedation-analgesia algorithm allowing for early weaning from ventilation.

      Devices ensuring continuous pneumatic control of tube cuff pressure are more efficient in
      maintaining tracheal balloon pressure than intermittent adjustments using a hand-held
      manometer. In one study, these devices clearly facilitated diminution of microaspiration of
      gastric contents and of ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence density (9.7 vs. 22
      VAP/1000 days of mechanical ventilation; p = 0.005).

      The investigators are putting forward the hypothesis that by adjoining a device providing
      continuous pneumatic regulation of tube cuff pressure to an overall strategy aimed at
      ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention (including semi-recumbent position ≥30°,
      oro-nasal-pharyngeal care at regular intervals and reduced risk exposure) can decrease VAP
      incidence by 50% in severely traumatised patients whose condition necessitates mechanical
      ventilation of an expected duration exceeding 48h.

      Ours is the first large-scale study to evaluate the interest of an innovative technology
      bundle on decrease of ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence in one of the intensive care
      populations the most at risk, namely severe trauma patients, a population presently
      benefiting from the other recommended preventive measures.
