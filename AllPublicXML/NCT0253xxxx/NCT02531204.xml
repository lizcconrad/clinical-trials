      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence between ASP1585 granules and
      ASP1585 capsules after repeated oral administration of ASP1585 granules or ASP1585 capsules
      under open-label conditions in non-elderly healthy male subjects. In addition, the safety of
      these products is assessed.
