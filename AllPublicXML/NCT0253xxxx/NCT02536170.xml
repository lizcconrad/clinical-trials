  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether giving extra arginine, a simple amino acid, to
      patients with sickle cell disease seeking treatment for a pain crisis (vaso-occlusive painful
      events (VOE) will decrease pain scores, decrease the need for pain medications or decrease
      length of hospital stay or emergency department visit. Funding Source - FDA OOPD.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of IV L-arginine hydrochloride therapy
      in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and vaso-occlusive pain events (VOE).
      Specifically, the impact on total opioid use (mg/kg) over the duration of their emergency
      department (ED) visit and hospital stay will be evaluated.
