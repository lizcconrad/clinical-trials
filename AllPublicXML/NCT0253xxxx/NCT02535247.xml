    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open label 2-stage phase 2 study exploring monotherapy
      with the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab (or MK-3475) given intravenously at a fixed dose of
      200mg every 3 weeks for up to 36 cycles for patients with relapsed or refractory Peripheral
      T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL), who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy. The primary
      endpoint of the study is progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes are overall survival
      and response rate. Patients will be assessed for response with PET CT or CT every 12 weeks
      using the revised Cheson criteria. Correlative endpoints will be exploratory and assess PD-1
      expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes; peripheral blood T-cell and NK-cell functional
      assays; PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on tumor tissue; and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as
      prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

         14. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         15. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
