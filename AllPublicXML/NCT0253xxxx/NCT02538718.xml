  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ritodrine is the conventional and the only approved tocolytics in Korea(by KFDA), although it
      was withdrawn from the US market more than 10 years ago. As already known well, ritodrine has
      many side effects such as tachycardia, hyperglycemia, pulmonary edema and so on. When such
      complications of ritodrine appears, clinicians consider of using MgSO4 as substitute, but its
      use is off-the-label yet in Korea. Facing this discrepancy, the investigators want to compare
      the efficacy and safety of MgSO4 with ritodrine and prove that MgSO4 is not inferior to
      ritodrine as tocolytics. For the singleton and twin pregnancies between 24+0weeks and 34
      completed weeks whose uterine contraction is more than 4 during 20 minutes period with their
      cervical ripening is more than 25%, the investigators randomise them in Ritodrine group or
      MgSO4 group. Then, the investigators will check the change of their interval of uterine
      contraction, degree of pain and the appearance of any side effects or treatment failure sign.
