      This study is to determine the feasibility and safety of magnetic-controlled capsule
      endoscopy system in examination of human colon under the real time monitoring by colonoscopy
      in the clinical application.

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the Western
      world. The screening tests include flexible sigmoidoscopy, optical colonoscopy (OC),
      double-contrast barium enema , or CT colonography . Such screening can reduce CRC incidence
      and mortality but its effectiveness depends on its quality, ease of use, and patient
      adherence .Colon capsule endoscopy(CCE) is being actively evaluated as an emerging
      complementary or alternative procedure for evaluation of the colon. magnetic -controlled
      capsule endoscopy system is a new ingestible colon capsule robot provided by Chongqing
      Jinshan Science &amp; Technology. While Screening the colon, the capsule is drove by
      magnetic-manipulator outside the body, which means it can move from the cecum to anus step by
      step under the control of the doctor. However, there's little data report on this colon
      capsule robot system in clinical application. The investigators plan to conduct this
      prospective study to determine the feasibility and safety of magnetic-controlled capsule
      endoscopy system in examination of human colon under the real time monitoring by colonoscopy.

    <time_frame>From the MCCES examination began until the capsule excreted, an expected average of 24h</time_frame>
    <description>The Maneuverability was defined as the rotation, somersault, Bird's-eye view, worm's eye view of the capsule, and completing any motion would gain 1 point, eventually ,4 point was good,2-3 point moderate,0-1point poor.</description>

    <measure>Migration length of anus direction</measure>
    <time_frame>From the MCCES examination began until the capsule excreted, an expected average of 24h</time_frame>
    <description>Migration length of anus direction was defined as how long was the distance the capsule controlled by the Magnetic-manipulator moved from cecum to anus in 25 minutes.</description>

    <measure>The movement of mouth direction</measure>
    <time_frame>From the MCCES examination began until the capsule excreted, an expected average of 24h</time_frame>
    <description>The movement of mouth direction was defined as if the capsule controlled by the Magnetic-manipulator could move from any point of the colon towards mouth direction.</description>

    <description>The cleanliness of the colon was graded as excellent (No more than small bits of adherent feces),good(Small amount of feces or dark fluid,but not enough to interfere with the examination ),fair(Enough feces or dark fluid present to preclude a completely reliable examination),poor(large amount of fecal residue).</description>

    <description>A magnetic-controlled capsule endoscopy(MCCE) included camera,magnet,batter and high polymer material shell.
The MCCE would be turned to sleeping mode capturing picture at a rate of 0.5 frame per second after being swallowed.
While reaching cecum, the MCCE would be turned to a working mode capturing picture at a rate of 2 frame per second.
The MCCE would be controlled by the Magnetic-manipulator out of body to finish the motion of e rotation, somersault, Bird's-eye view, worm's eye view from cecum to anus.</description>
