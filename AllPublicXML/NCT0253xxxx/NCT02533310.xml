    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy as a
      treatment for specific phobia (spiders). A gamified virtual reality simulation of one-session
      therapy (VR-OST) will be compared to the gold-standard treatment in the form of traditional
      one-session phobia treatment (OST) using in-vivo stimuli. This study was powered to detect a
      non-inferiority margin of a 2-point difference between groups.

    <intervention_name>OST treatment with in-vivo spiders</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects are exposed to phobic stimuli with the aid of a trained psychotherapist during a session of maximum 3 hrs duration. The intensity of exposure is increased in four sequential steps, 1. learning to catch a spider with a glass and paper, 2. touching a spider, 3. letting a spider walk on your hand, 4. letting a spider walk on your body. These stages repeat with increasingly larger spiders. The goal of therapy is not absolute symptom reduction but sufficient reduction to allow the individual to expose themselves in everyday situations.</description>
