      NOTE THAT THE STUDY IS LED BY SOUTH AFRICA NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WORLD BANK WITH
      SUPPORT FROM BOSTON UNIVERSITY. The South Africa National Department of Health (NDOH) intends
      to launch its newly developed National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases (HIV, TB and
      NCDs) throughout South Africa in the coming year. Early implementation of the &quot;minimum
      package&quot; of interventions described in the Adherence Guidelines for HIV patients will take
      place at 12 primary health clinics and community health centres in four provinces starting in
      July 2015. To maximize the learning potential of this early implementation stage, NDOH will
      match the intervention clinics with 12 comparison clinics and randomly allocate intervention
      or comparison status within the pairs of clinics. This will allow the outcomes of the
      interventions to be evaluated using a cluster-randomized design and generate data on the
      costs of implementation and the potential need for adherence support for the other diseases
      addressed in the guidelines (tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes). This protocol is for
      the evaluation, which will generate information on the effectiveness of minimum package
      interventions and help improve the design, implementation, and budgeting of the guidelines.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the effectiveness of five interventions in the minimum package: 1) Fast
      track initiation counseling for patients eligible for antiretroviral therapy; 2) Enhanced
      adherence counseling for unstable patients on HIV treatment; 3) adherence clubs for stable
      patients on HIV treatment; 4) decentralized medication delivery for stable patients on HIV
      treatment; and 5) early tracing of all patients who miss an appointment by two weeks. This
      study will also estimate for each study site an overall &quot;adherence guideline impact&quot; to
      provide an indication of the effectiveness of the package as a whole.

      In addition, the study will estimate the cost of each of the interventions listed above
      compared to standard of care. Finally, the study will describe the cascade of care for
      tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes, three other chronic diseases for which little
      information currently exists. To evaluate these interventions the study team will work with
      the National Department of Health (which will implement the interventions) to randomize 24
      clinics in 4 provinces 1:1 to receive the interventions or continue standard of care. All
      evaluations will use data routinely collected by the clinics, with no study interaction with
      subjects. A total of 8,256 patients will be enrolled and followed for up to 20 months to
      estimate short- and long-term outcomes.
