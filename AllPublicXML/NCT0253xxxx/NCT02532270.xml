    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether continuous non-invasive arterial pressure
      (CNAP) monitoring is beneficial to maintain maternal hemodynamic stability and improve the
      outcomes of maternal and fetal comparing with intermittent oscillometric non-invasive
      arterial pressure (NIAP)measurement during spinal anaesthesia for cesarean section .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peri-operative hypotension and fluctuation of arterial blood pressure (BP) during spinal
      anaesthesia are common. Hypotension causes maternal side-effects such as unconsciousness,
      dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. The potential fetal side-effects are caused by a reduction
      in the uterine blood flow with consequent reduced oxygen supply and acidosis reflected by
      impaired blood gas analyses and impaired Apgar scores. Because of the potential harm to the
      fetus and the dependency of fetal oxygenation on maternal arterial pressure (AP), it has been
      strongly recommended to closely monitor mother's arterial pressure and to treat hypotension
      immediately. Non-invasive arterial pressure (NIAP) measurement is a common method for
      monitoring in clinical. These hypotension episodes probably would be detected with delay by
      NIAP measurement on account of its discontinuous. A monitor for continuous non-invasive
      arterial pressure monitoring (CNAPTM Monitor 500, CNSystems Medizintechnik AG,Graz, Austria)
      using the volume-clamped method. It can monitor timely and provide beat-to-beat value of
      arterial pressure.
