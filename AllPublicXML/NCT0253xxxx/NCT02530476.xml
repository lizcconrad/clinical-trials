      There are 2 parts to this study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion).

      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerated dose of
      the combination of selinexor (KPT-330) and sorafenib (Nexavar) that can be given to patients
      with FLT3-ITD and -D835 mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or FLT3-mutated high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn if the dose found in Part 1 can help to control
      the disease.

      The safety of the drug combination will also be studied in both parts of this study.

      This is an investigational study. Sorafenib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat hepatocellular cancer. Selinexor is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes only. The combination of selinexor and sorafenib
      to treat FLT3-mutated AML and high-risk MDS is investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 52 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of up to 6 participants will be
      enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up to 40 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of selinexor and sorafenib you receive will depend on
      when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the starting dose
      combination level. If no intolerable side effects were seen, the next group will receive a
      higher dose of selinexor and sorafenib than Group 1. If intolerable side effects are seen,
      the next group may receive a lower dose level of selinexor and/or sorafenib. This will
      continue until the highest tolerable combination dose is found.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive selinexor and sorafenib at the highest
      tolerable combination dose or most effective combination dose found in Part 1.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days. However, the study cycles may be 3-12 weeks long, depending on
      if/how the disease responds to the treatment, how your bone marrow reacts to treatment, and
      what the doctor thinks is in your best interest.

      You will take selinexor tablets by mouth 2 times each week (Monday/Wednesday or
      Tuesday/Thursday or Wednesday/Friday) for 3 weeks. You must take your dose of selinexor
      within 30 minutes after eating, with at least 4 ounces of fluids (either water, milk, juice,
      and so on). You must swallow the tablets whole. Do not crush them. If the powder comes into
      contact with your skin, you may have an increased chance of skin-related side effects.

      You will take sorafenib by mouth 2 times a day, every day. Depending on how the disease
      responds to the study drugs, the number of days you receive the study drug may change. Your
      doctor will discuss this with you. You must take your dose of sorafenib at least 1 hour
      before or 1 hour after eating.

      You will be given a drug diary and asked to write down what time you take the study drugs
      every day. You must bring in the study drug diary and any unused study drugs and bottles to
      each study visit.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-4 and then every 1-3 cycles after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      The study doctor will tell you how often you will have these tests after Cycle 4.

      One time each week during Cycles 1-3, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine
      tests. After Cycle 3, you will have this blood draw 1 time every 2-4 weeks. If the doctor
      thinks it is needed, blood may need to be drawn more often or more than 1 tablespoon of blood
      may need to be drawn.

      After Cycle 1, you may be able to have these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic
      that is closer to your home. The results of the testing will be sent to MD Anderson for
      review. The study doctor or study staff will discuss this option with you.

      On Day 28 of Cycles 1 and 3 (+/- 7 days) and then every 1-3 cycles after that, you will have
      a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      Every 3 months (+/- 14 days), if you can become pregnant, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) or
      urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      If you stay on study for more than 6 months and you are not having side effects, you may have
      some of the above tests more or less often. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse,
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      If you stop taking the study drugs before the end of Cycle 24:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the
           status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days (+/- 7) after your last dose of study drugs, you will have a physical exam. You
      may have this exam at MD Anderson or a local clinic near your home. If you have this exam at
      a local clinic, the results of the exam will be sent to MD Anderson for review.

      If you cannot come to MD Anderson or a local clinic, you will be called by a member of the
      study staff and asked if you have had any side effects and/or started any new treatment(s).
      This call should last about 5 minutes.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      If the disease appears to get better and you are responding well to the study drug, you will
      return to MD Anderson every 3-6 months for up to 5 years after your last dose of study drugs
      for the study staff to check how you are doing.

      If you cannot return to MD Anderson for these visits, you may be called by a member of the
      study staff. The call should last about 10 minutes.

             Patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (defined as having &gt;/= 10%
             blasts in the bone marrow) or patients with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)
             (having &gt;/= 10% blasts in the bone marrow) may also be eligible after discussion with
             Principal Investigator (PI). The patients should have one of the following features:
             1. Patients with AML should have failed any prior induction therapy or have relapsed
             after prior therapy. 2. Patients with high-risk MDS or high-risk CMML should have
             failed any prior therapy for the MDS or CMML. 3. Patients with MDS or CMML who
             received therapy for the MDS or CMML and progress to AML are eligible at the time of
             diagnosis of AML regardless any prior therapy for AML. The WHO classification will be
             used for AML.

          8. Patients must provide written informed consent.

          9. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to
             time of initiation of selinexor and sorafenib administration will be at least 2 weeks
             for cytotoxic agents or at least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents. The
             use of chemotherapeutic or anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during the study with
             the following exceptions: (1) intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled
             CNS leukemia at the discretion of the PI and with the agreement of the Sponsor.
             Controlled CNS leukemia is defined by the absence of active clinical signs of CNS
             disease and no evidence of CNS leukemia on the most recent 2 simultaneous CSF
             evaluations. (2) Use of one dose of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m2) or hydroxyurea for
             patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study
             therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy. These medications will be recorded in
             the case-report form.

         10. Baseline ejection fraction must be &gt;/= 40%.

         11. Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment.

         12. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception
             during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the
             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception
             include: Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
             Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

         13. (Continued from Criteria 12) Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to
             screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be
             the sole partner for that patient Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c
             or b+c) Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
             forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
             example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) Barrier methods of
             contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository

         14. (Continued from Criteria 13) In case of use of oral contraception, women should have
             been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives
             are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception
             due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction. Women are considered post-menopausal
             and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)
             amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
             vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy
             alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
             hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.
