  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, with or
      without azacitidine, are safe to give to patients with MDS. Researchers also want to learn if
      the study drug combinations can help to control the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are not FDA approved or
      commercially available for the treatment of MDS. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are each approved
      for the treatment of melanoma. Their use in MDS is investigational. Azacitidine is approved
      by the FDA for the treatment of MDS. The use of these drugs in combination is
      investigational.

      Up to 120 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 6
      study cohorts, based on when you join this study and on what treatments you have already
      received. Participants who have already received treatments called hypomethylating agents
      will be in Cohorts 1-3. Participants who have not received treatment will be in Cohorts 4-6:

        -  If you are in Cohort 1, you will receive nivolumab.

        -  If you are in Cohort 2, you will receive ipilimumab.

        -  If you are in Cohort 3, you will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab.

        -  If you are in Cohort 4, you will receive azacitidine and nivolumab.

        -  If you are in Cohort 5, you will receive azacitidine and ipilimumab.

        -  If you are in Cohort 6, you will receive azacitidine, nivolumab, and ipilimumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Study cycles for Cohorts 1-3 will be 3-4 weeks long. Study cycles for Cohorts 4-6 will be 4
      weeks long.

      If you receive nivolumab, you will receive it by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1 and 15. If
      you receive ipilimumab, you will receive it by vein over about 90 minutes on Day 1. If you
      receive azacitidine, you will receive it by vein over about 10-40 minutes for 5 days every 4
      weeks, then receive the other drug(s) as described above on Days 6 and/or 20 of each cycle.

      If you are in Cohorts 1-3 and the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may begin to
      receive azacitidine after Cycle 6.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) time each week during Cycle 1, and then one time during every cycle after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      These tests may be done more often if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, on Day 21 or 28 of Cycles 1 (depending on to which cohort
      you are assigned) and then every 3 months, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check
      the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing.

      If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine or blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test
      every 6 weeks.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug(s) for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-up Visits:

      If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine or blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test
      30 and 70 days after you have stopped taking the study drugs.

      There are additional laboratory research studies that you may be eligible for that may help
      researchers learn more about the disease. You will be given separate consent forms for these
      studies that explain their goals and risks.

             untreated; b. Previously treated with HMA agent. Patients need to have relapsed or
             progressed after any number of cycles of HMA therapy. Patients that do not respond to
             HMA therapy will also be allowed in the study. Relapse or progression will be measured
             by IWG 2006 criteria. No response will be lack of clinical benefit after at least 6
             cycles of HMA therapy.

          2. Age 18 years or older.

          3. Adequate organ function: creatinine &lt;/=2.0 x ULN; serum bilirubin &lt;/=2.0 x ULN; AST

             avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo

             hypertension; chronic renal failure; or active uncontrolled infection) which, in the
             opinion of the investigator could compromise participation in the study.

          4. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

          5. History of pneumonitis.

          6. Patients who are on high dose steroid (equivalent of prednisone more than 10 mg a day)
             or immune suppression medications.

          7. Patients with autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive

             ulcerative colitis.

          9. Patients known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen expression or with
             active hepatitis C infection (positive by polymerase chain reaction or on antiviral
             therapy for hepatitis C within the last 6 months). Patients with history of HIV
             disease are also excluded from the study.

         10. Current therapy with other systemic anti-neoplastic or anti-neoplastic investigational
             agents.

         11. Females who are pregnant or lactating.

         12. For hypomethylating failure cohorts, treatment for MDS with any other drug not being
             an HMA with the following exceptions: Prior treatment with growth factors and/or
             lenalidomide is allowed for any cohort.

         13. For hypomethylating failure cohorts only, more than 4 months since last cycle of HMA.

         14. Prior treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
