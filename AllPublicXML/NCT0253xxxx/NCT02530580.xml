  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain.
      For years, drugs that enhance its effects (e.g., benzodiazepines such as diazepam/Valium)
      have been used to treat various diseases such as epilepsy, insomnia, anxiety or movement
      disorders. However, the use of these medications is often compromised because of their side
      effects, such as sleepiness, memory problems, and addiction.

      Therefore, effort has been made to develop drugs that act more selectively in the brain to
      exert the positive therapeutic effects and are devoid of the unwanted side effects. AZD7325
      is one of these drugs. It has been tested in more than 700 people and so far proved to be
      generally well tolerated. Positron emission tomography (PET) study in humans demonstrated
      that AZD7325 binds to GABA A receptors in the brain after a single dose. Early clinical
      studies have shown that it has less sedative and cognitive adverse events as compared with a
      benzodiazepine lorazepam.

      The investigators now wish to evaluate if effects of AZD7325 can be objectively measured in
      healthy volunteers and to establish which of the drug's outcomes could be utilised for
      further studies in patients with neurological diseases.

      The investigators are especially interested in the effects of AZD7325 on manual dexterity and
      skin sensation of the hand. This can be assessed by a number of simple non-invasive tests of
      object manipulation and detection of different sensory stimuli such as touch, vibration, or
      temperature. Recent studies show that healthy individuals who performed better in similar
      tasks had more GABA in relevant areas of their brain. If performance in these tasks in
      healthy volunteers can be improved by enhancing GABA effects in the brain with AZD7325, this
      would create the grounds for the use of this medication to treat symptoms of certain
      neurological disorders in which motor control and sensation of the hand is impaired (e.g.,
      polyneuropathy).
