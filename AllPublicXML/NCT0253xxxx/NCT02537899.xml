      SATURN investigates the promising role of NeuroAiD in patients with spinal cord injury and
      will provide important information on the feasibility of conducting larger controlled trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SATURN is a prospective cohort study of patients with moderately-severe to severe spinal cord
      injury, defined as American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A and B, who are
      treated with open-label NeuroAiD for 6 months in addition to standard care and followed for
      24 months. Anonymized data will be prospectively collected at baseline and months 1, 3, 6,
      12, 18, and 24 using a secured online system and will include information on demographics,
      main diagnostics, neurological and functional state, treatment compliance, concomitant
      therapies, and side effects, if any.
