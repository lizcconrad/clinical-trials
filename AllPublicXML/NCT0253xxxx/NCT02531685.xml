  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many infectious pathogens, like ETEC, initiate infection by first interacting with the gut
      mucosal surfaces of their human host. Consequently, vaccination strategies that can better
      stimulate protective mucosal immunity are needed if we are to effectively control the large
      number of intestinal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality in humans. The LT toxin of
      ETEC is a unique antigen in that it also has inherent mucosal adjuvant properties for
      co-administered antigens. Thus, this protein has the potential to be both a stand-alone
      vaccine as well as a mucosal adjuvant for other co-administered vaccine antigens. The primary
      objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when administered in three
      doses intradermally over a range of dosages in healthy adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, single site outpatient Phase 1 study in healthy adults
      to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an ETEC candidate vaccine, attenuated
      recombinant dmLT from ETEC, administered by the ID route. The sample size has been determined
      based on the historic sample, not on power calculations. The study will involve 99 subjects
      (83 vaccinees and 16 placebo controls) in 4 consecutive cohorts of 16 individuals each (13
      vaccinees and 3 placebo controls) and the final cohort of 35 (31 vaccinees and 4 placebos)
      subjects. A total of 16 subjects (to retain 10 vaccinees and 1 placebo evaluable subjects) in
      each cohorts 1-4 will initially be recruited, 13 subjects each will receive three separate
      doses of dmLT intradermally at 1, 22 and 43-day, and 3 subjects in each cohort will receive
      three doses of a placebo (saline) in a blinded fashion. As this is an outpatient study,
      subjects will receive their vaccinations and remain in clinic for observation for a minimum
      of 30 minutes. Safety data will be reviewed by Safety Monitoring Team or Committee. Subjects
      may be replaced to ensure 10 evaluable subjects in each single cohort, as defined by
      receiving all 3 vaccine doses. If replacement subjects will be included if needed and they
      will be randomized per cohort as a single group to include 1 subject to receive placebo to
      maintain the blind and ensure there are one placebos in each cohort. Final confirmatory
      cohort will include up to 35 vaccinees randomly selected to receive either 1, 2 or 3 vaccine
      doses or placebo. The study duration is approximately 1.5-2 years, including 6 months of
      follow-up and approximately 9 months for subject duration. The Primary Objective is to assess
      the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when administered in three intradermal doses over
      a range of dosages levels in healthy adult subjects. The Secondary objectives assess
      long-term safety follow-up from immunization through Month 6 months post last vaccination,
      following three ID doses of dmLT vaccine over a range of dosages levels evaluate
      dmLT-specific immune response by assays.
