      Lowering intraocular pressure remains the mainstay of therapy in the management of glaucoma.
      The effect of ocular massage on intraocular pressure in patients with acute primary angle
      closure was the important thing.This was a prospective study, in which 20 eyes from 20
      patients had acute angle closure. When they went to the hospital, ocular massage was
      performed without any medication. Intraocular pressure was detected by Goldmann tonometer,
      and Lenstar LS900 optical biometry observed changes of anterior chamber depth before and
      after ocular massage. Anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber angle and ciliary body were
      observed by Ultrasound biomicroscopy after massage, and anterior chamber angle was also
      checked by gonioscope after massage.

      Background: Primary angle closure glaucoma is still the most common type in Asia. Lowering
      intraocular pressure remains the mainstay of therapy in the management of glaucoma, since it
      has been shown to be effective in reducing optic nerve damage and loss of vision. The
      objective of this study was to evaluate to assess the effect of ocular massage on intraocular
      pressure in patients with acute primary angle closure.

      Methods : This was a prospective study, in which 20 eyes from 20 patients had acute angle
      closure. When they went to the hospital, ocular massage was performed without any medication.
      Intraocular pressure was detected by Goldmann tonometer, and Lenstar LS900 optical biometry
      (Lenstar LS900) observed changes of anterior chamber depth before and after ocular massage.
      Anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber angle and ciliary body were observed by Ultrasound
      biomicroscopy (after massage, and anterior chamber angle was also checked by gonioscope after
      massage.
