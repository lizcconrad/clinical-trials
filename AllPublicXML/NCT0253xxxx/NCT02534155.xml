      The study is comparing MitraClip® to Surgical therapy in high and intermediate risk patients,
      who should be older than 18 years, and shall evaluate safety and efficacy of MitraClip® vs.
      surgery in high or intermediate risk patients. The patients will be randomised (MitraClip® or
      Surgery). The Study Follow-Up includes 4 visits after procedure (hospital discharge, 1, 6, 12
      months post-procedure).

      Two-arm, multi-centre, randomised prospective study comparing MitraClip® to Surgical therapy
      in high and intermediate risk patients. Patients should be older than 18 years and high and
      intermediate risk is defined by a score (for MV repair) &gt;= 3% and &lt;= 10% or as determined by
      the local Heart Team (which should include a surgeon and a cardiologist), based on the
      evidence that STS risk calculator may not identify all possible risk factors. Patients are
      selected upon clinical conditions and severity of MR. Anatomical feasibility is assessed by
      ECHO, according to the IFU (information for use).

      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy of MitraClip® vs. surgery in high
      and intermediate risk patients with DMR. Study Follow-Up includes the following visits after
      procedure: Hospital discharge, 1, 6, 12 months post-procedure.

      Primary Endpoints are the 30-day safety superiority (ITT analysis) and the 12-month efficacy
      non-inferiority (ITT analysis) of the MitraClip®. The overall rate of Serious Adverse Events
      (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Device Events (SADEs) until 12 months and the MR Severity
      reduction at 6 and 12 month in the MitraClip® and Surgery groups are Secondary Endpoints

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The study is powered to show superiority for safety of an endovascular treatment strategy with the MitraClip® as compared to a surgical treatment strategy. The primary safety endpoint is a Major Adverse Event Composite (MAE) including all-cause death, prolonged ventilation (&gt;48h), renal failure, stroke and need for non-elective cardiovascular or thoracic surgery (defined as any kind of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery performed within 30 days from the index procedure and non anticipated prior to the procedure). The analysis of the primary safety endpoint is a test of superiority for the proportion of subjects free from the composite of safety events in the Device vs. the Surgery group at 30 days.</description>

    <description>The study is powered to show non-inferiority for clinical efficacy of an endovascular treatment strategy with the MitraClip® as compared to a surgical treatment strategy. The primary effectiveness endpoint is a test of non-inferiority for the proportion of responders in the Device vs. the Surgery group at 12 months. Patients are defined as responders if they are alive with at least a 1-grade improvement in NYHA Functional Class at 12 months over baseline and have not experienced a HF hospitalization within 12 months of randomization (MitraClip® procedure or Surgery).</description>

    <description>MitraClip® system is a CE marked medical device, which consists of two parts (Clip Delivery System and Steerable Guide Catheter). It is a single sized, percutaneously implanted mechanical Clip. The MitraClip® device grasps and coapts the mitral valve leaflets resulting in fixed approximation of the mitral leaflets throughout the cardiac cycle. The procedure is performed in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory with echocardiographic and fluoroscopic guidance while the patient is under general anaesthesia.</description>
