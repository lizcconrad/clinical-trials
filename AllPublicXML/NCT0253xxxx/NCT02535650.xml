  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platinum-based chemotherapy is now regarded a standard first-line treatment for patients with
      advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, patients who failed to response or experienced
      progression after platinum-based chemotherapy have a grim prognosis and a standard salvage
      treatment is not available.

      UC is known to harbor multiple mutations. In the investigators' own high-throughput molecular
      profiling study, the most commonly observed mutations included TP53, FGFR3(fibroblast growth
      factor receptor 3 ) and HRAS. Since RAS signaling can be attenuated using selective farnesyl
      transferase (FTase) inhibitors, tipifarnib, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of FTase,
      was proposed to be an effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of UC.
