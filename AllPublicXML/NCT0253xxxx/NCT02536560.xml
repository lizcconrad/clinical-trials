    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational cohort study the potential clinical consequences of
      antibiotic use in early life and perturbations in the gastrointestinal microbiota composition
      due to that antibiotic use are studied. It is hypothesized that altered microbiota may be an
      important underlying mechanism for impediments in the developing immune system.

      Differentiation will be made between a group of neonates who received antibiotics in the
      first week of life, and control infants who were not exposed to antibiotics in the neonatal
      period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy newborns born in the hospital, observed for low probability of neonatal infection
      will be compared to newborns exposed to antibiotic therapy in early life (first 1-2 weeks).

      Infants are recruited from the maternity wards and neonatal wards of four teaching hospitals
      in the Netherlands. In total 150 infants, treated with antibiotics because of (a high
      suspicion of) a perinatal infection during the first week of life, will be recruited. The
      control group comprises 300 healthy newborns, born in the hospital and needing clinical
      observation for 24-48 hours for several reasons like maternal comorbidity, low probability of
      neonatal infection, blood sugar monitoring, meconium containing amniotic fluid, or delivery
      by caesarean section.

      Differences in clinical outcomes between antibiotic treated infants and controls are
      investigated. Incidence of atopic dermatitis (eczema), food allergy, upper respiratory tract
      infections (URTI), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), gastrointestinal infections
      (GITI) and excessive crying are evaluated, prospectively assessed by parental reports and
      retrospectively assessed by doctor's diagnoses. The clinical endpoints will be linked to the
      developing intestinal microbiota during the first year of life.

      Potential differences in intestinal fecal microbiota composition and diversity can be
      determined at eight time points during the first year of life, as sampling moments include:
      day one (T1), day two (T2), one week (T3), two weeks (T4), one month (T5), three months (T6),
      six months (T7), one year (T8).
