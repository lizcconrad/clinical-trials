      In the presently planned multicentre Phase III trial the two therapies will be compared:
      Patients will be randomized after intensified induction treatment with 4 cycles rituximab,
      methotrexate, cytarabine and thiotepa (MATRix) between first-line high-dose chemotherapy
      against conventional consolidating therapy with 2 cycles of conventional chemotherapy with
      R-DeVIC (rituximab, dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, carboplatin).

      Trial purpose and rationale Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a highly
      aggressive disease with rising incidence over the past 30 years. Similar to other
      hematological diseases, the rationale for consolidation in PCNSL is the elimination of
      minimal residual disease. The efficacy of WBRT, which is the current standard for
      consolidation after HD-MTX-based systemic treatment, is being compared to HDT-ASCT in the
      ongoing IELSG-32 trial.

      High-dose chemotherapy with carmustine or busulfan and thiotepa followed by autologous stem
      cell transplantation has been shown to be feasible and highly effective in newly diagnosed
      eligible patients, but also in the salvage situation.

      The question we aim to answer is whether HDT-ASCT is superior to conventional therapy as
      consolidation after intensified immunochemotherapy in newly diagnosed PCNSL.

      Rationale for this study:

      Based on previously obtained good results from the treatment of recurrent or refractory PCNSL
      the DeVIC protocol was chosen for conventional consolidation treatment. This protocol,
      originally designed as a salvage protocol for aggressive NHL, crosses the blood-brain barrier
      and consists of multidrug resistant unrelated agents.

      Treatment plan and procedure

      Interventions

      Induction treatment 4 cycles (every 3 weeks), stem-cell harvest after 2nd cycle:

        -  Rituximab 375 mg/m²/d i.v. (d 0,5)

        -  Methotrexate 3,5 g/m² i.v. (d1)

        -  Cytarabine 2 x 2 g/m²/d i.v. (d2-3)

      Patients with PD after two cycles, SD/PD after four cycles of induction therapy or
      insufficient stem-cell harvest after three cycles are ineligible for randomization.

           instead:

        -  Busulfan 3,2 mg/kg/d (d-8-(-7))
