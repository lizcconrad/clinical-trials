      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if receiving atezolizumab and abraxane
      (nab-paclitaxel) in combination before surgery and atezolizumab alone after surgery can help
      to control breast cancer. The safety of this study drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational stYou are being asked to take part in this study because you have
      breast cancer that has not responded to chemotherapy, and your doctor thinks it is unlikely
      to respond to additional standard chemotherapy when given before surgery.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 21 days. You will receive the study drugs in 2 sets of 4 cycles (4 cycles
      before surgery and 4 cycles after surgery).

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive atezolizumab by vein over about 60 minutes.

      On Day 1 of each later cycle before and after surgery, if you tolerated the first infusion,
      you will receive future infusions of atezolizumab by vein over 30 minutes.

      You will receive nab-paclitaxel by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles
      1-4 before surgery.

      If you have side effects, the study doctor may decide to lower your dose of study drugs or
      have you stop taking the drugs. You may be able to restart the study drug later at the same
      or a lower dose. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 3, you will have an ultrasound of your breast(s) before surgery. Additional
           imaging may be done as part of your routine care, if the doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  During Cycle 3, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn before surgery and at
           the time of surgery.

      On Days 8 &amp; 15 of Cycles 1-4, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

      Within 6 weeks after you have received 4 cycles of study drugs, you will have surgery as part
      of your standard of care and part of the tumor tissue that is removed during surgery will be
      collected for biomarker testing. You will be given a surgery consent form that describes the
      procedure and its risks.

      On Day 21 of Cycle 8, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine and biomarker
      testing.

      Additional Research Testing:

      If there is any tumor tissue left over after study procedures, part of this tumor tissue will
      be sent to the sponsor (Genentech) for further biomarker and immune system testing. Before
      your samples are sent to the sponsor for banking, your name and any personal identifying
      information will be coded to protect your privacy. The sponsor will not have access to the
      codes that link the samples to your identity. MD Anderson will not have oversight of any
      leftover samples that will be banked by the sponsor for additional research. The tissue
      samples sent to the sponsor for this additional research will be used up during this planned
      testing.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the study drugs for about 4 cycles before your surgery and about 4 cycles
      after your surgery (8 cycles total). You will no longer be able to take the study drug, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. You may be
      able to continue taking the study drugs if the disease gets worse if the doctor thinks it is
      in your best interest.

      Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 6 months for up to 3 years, you will either have a clinic visit or you will be called
      by a member of the study staff and asked how you are doing. If you are called, each call
      should last about 15-20 minutes.
