  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to chronic airflow obstruction, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD) suffer from skeletal muscle dysfunction which is a prominent and disabling
      feature and also an independent determinant of survival. Muscular impairment involves loss of
      muscle oxidative phenotype (OXPHEN: a slow-to-fast shift in fibre types and reduced oxidative
      capacity). Since hypoxia obviously is a key feature of COPD, the aim of this study is to
      elucidate the role of hypoxia in loss of muscle OXPHEN.

      Thus, OXPHEN and expression levels of its key regulators will be determined in the baseline
      biopsies for association with the degree of hypoxemia. In addition, expression levels of the
      key OXPHEN regulators will be measured in pre/post exercise biopsies.
