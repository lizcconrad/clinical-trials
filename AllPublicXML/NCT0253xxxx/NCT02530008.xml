    <textblock>
      This is a cohort study of women with suspected or confirmed recurrent breast cancer, with
      accessible tumor by standard clinical biopsy, prior to starting a new therapy for recurrent
      metastatic disease. Study participants will be ascertained from the population of all persons
      greater than eighteen years of age receiving care at the clinical practices of the Rowan
      Breast Center (RBC) at the University of Pennsylvania. The overarching goal of this study is
      to identify the genetic and molecular markers of molecular evolution identified in patients
      who have progressed from a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to recurrent, metastatic
      disease. As an observational study, this study seeks to gather data regarding the molecular
      and genetic changes that a primary cancer undergoes as a patient's cancer recurs and
      ultimately progresses. We anticipate enrolling 50 women with recurrent breast cancer who meet
      eligibility requirements for this study. Participation in this study will include the
      following: a biopsy and blood collection, completion of the study questionnaire, an optional
      bone marrow aspiration, and repeat collection of blood, offer of a research biopsy and a
      optional bone marrow aspirate collection at each progression time point. The study
      participants' medical information will be updated and changes in disease status will be
      captured on a regular basis.
