  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postprandial blood glucose concentration is an important risk factor for development of
      cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Previous studies have shown that one bout of moderate
      or light post-meal physical activity effectively blunts the postprandial increase in blood
      glucose after carbohydrate intake. Pre-meal exercise does not generate such effect. Thus, the
      effect of exercise on postprandial glycemia depend on the timing of exercise. Even very light
      physical activity decreases postprandial glycemia when performed in the postprandial period.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether such activity performed each day for 12
      weeks would influence blood variables related to glycemic control.

      METHODS 40 subjects being ethnic Norwegians or of South Asian origin were randomized into an
      intervention or a control group. They were previously diagnosed as hyperglycemic, or with
      high risk of type 2 diabetes according to Ramachandran's risc score.

      Control subjects were told to maintain their usual physical activity patterns during the
      study period, while the intervention subjects were instructed to undertake a minimum of 30
      minutes of daily post-meal physical activity in addition to their usual activity patterns.

      Venous blood samples were taken before and after the 12 week intervention period. Plasma was
      analyzed for HbA1c and for fasting and 2hour (OGTT) values of glucose, insulin and c-peptide.
      The subjects kept a physical activity diary, answered questionnaires and used accelerometers
      to determine the level of physical activity.
