  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia (&quot;lazy eye&quot;) and strabismus (misaligned eyes) are medical eye conditions that
      combine as the leading causes of preventable vision loss in children. They are irreversible
      if not detected and corrected by the age of seven, however half of all cases are missed
      because the conditions do not always manifest themselves and pediatricians are unable to
      reliably detect the conditions. The current health care system badly needs an accurate and
      effective approach toward detecting amblyopia and strabismus in preschool children.

      The study will be conducted in busy, ethnically and racially diverse primary care sites
      operated by the Kaiser Permanente system and compare the outcomes of testing with a Pediatric
      Vision Scanner with outcomes the current standard of care.

    <description>The Pediatric Vision Scanner (PVS) performs a 3-second, non-invasive scan of both eyes simultaneously while a child looks at a single target. The scan will measure the frequency of the light waves that reflect off of the participants' eyes to determine the fixation state of the eye.</description>
