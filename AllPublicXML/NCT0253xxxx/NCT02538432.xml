    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial of (RQ-07) in advanced solid tumors in advanced prostate, breast or
      lung cancer. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether the administration of the
      study drug RQ-07 can decrease circulating tumor cells in advanced prostate, breast or lung
      cancer. Additionally, the study will evaluate whether the study drug may improve outcome in
      advanced prostate, breast or lungs cancer either by itself or when combined with gemcitabine,
      a standard chemotherapy drug. The combination of with gemcitabine will only be investigated
      after disease has worsened with the study drug RQ-07 by itself and only in patients with
      prostate or lung cancer.
