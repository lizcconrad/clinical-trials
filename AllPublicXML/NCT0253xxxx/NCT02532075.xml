  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of performing a breathing muscle warm
      up before exercise in patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The
      main aim is to see whether performing a breathing muscle warm up can improve distance walked
      in a 6 minute walk test and also decrease perceptions of effort and breathlessness.

    <textblock>
      The study will follow a counter-balanced repeated measures design involving six visits to the
      exercise laboratory. Following pre-screening and familiarisation (visits 1 and 2),
      participants will perform inspiratory warm up, expiratory warm up, combination warm up and
      control trials (visits 3 - 6) in a counter-balanced order separated by at least 48 hours
      between trials.

      The four separate sessions will contain: lung function measurements assessed by performing
      breathing manoeuvres through a mouthpiece (spirometery or body plethysmography) before
      performing a breathing muscle warm up by breathing against a resistance through a small
      handheld device (PowerLung). Participants will then be asked perform a second set of lung
      function measurements and will then be asked to perform a 6 minute walk test wearing a face
      mask and a portable device (gas analysis), a small device clipped to a finger (pulse
      oximeter) and wearing a heart rate monitor. During this 6 minute walk test participants will
      also be asked to rate their perceived effort and level of breathlessness at 60m intervals.
      Following the test there will be a period of seated rest wearing the face mask and portable
      device for up to 20 minutes with one more set of lung function measurements.
