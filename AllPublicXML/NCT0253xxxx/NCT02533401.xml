    <time_frame>Up to 5 years (from Baseline until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response was monitored throughout the study and assessed using standardized criteria. Disease progression was defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following: greater than or equal to (≥) 50 percent (%) increase in the longest diameter of at least two enlarged lymph nodes, increase in spleen and/or liver size by at least 2 centimeters (cm) from Baseline as determined by measurement below the costal margin, or ≥50% increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes. The percentage of participants with death or documented disease progression at any time during the study was calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years (assessed every 3 months during 6-month treatment period, every 2 months during 6-month safety follow-up, then every 3 months during 3-year safety follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response was monitored throughout the study and assessed using standardized criteria. CR was defined as hemoglobin ≥11 grams per deciliter (g/dL), lymphocytes less than (&lt;) 4000 cells per cubic millimeter (cells/mm^3), neutrophils greater than (&gt;) 1500 cells/mm^3, platelets &gt;100,000 cells/mm^3, bone marrow (BM) biopsy with &lt;30% lymphocytes with no lymphocytic infiltrates, no evidence of lymphoid nodules on physical exam, and performance status of 0. PR was defined as &gt;50% decrease in size of enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, with peripheral counts meeting the same criteria as CR or ≥50% improvement from pre-treatment values. Participants with lymphoid nodules on BM biopsy who otherwise met CR criteria were considered nPR. The percentage of participants with each level of best overall response was calculated.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive rituximab (375 milligrams per meter-squared [mg/m^2] intravenously [IV]) on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by fludarabine (25 mg/m^2 once daily IV) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m^2 once daily IV) for Days 2 to 4 of Cycle 1. Then rituximab (500 mg/m^2 IV) will be administered on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6, followed by IV fludarabine (25 mg/m^2 once daily IV) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m^2 once daily IV) on Days 1 to 3 of Cycles 2 to 6. Each cycle will be 28 days or 4 weeks in length, and the overall duration of treatment will be approximately 6 months.</description>

Disease progression was defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following: greater than or equal to (≥) 50 percent (%) increase in the longest diameter of at least two enlarged lymph nodes, increase in spleen and/or liver size by at least 2 centimeters (cm) from Baseline as determined by measurement below the costal margin, or ≥50% increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes. The percentage of participants with death or documented disease progression at any time during the study was calculated.</description>
