      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate long term skeletal response to eliglustat in adult patients who successfully
      completed one of the Phase 2 or Phase 3 eliglustat studies.

      Secondary Objective:

      Evaluate the safety of eliglustat (by [serious] adverse event [AE] continuous monitoring),
      the quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36]) and biomarkers of Gaucher disease
      type 1 (GD1) (chitotriosidase, plasma glucosylceramide [GL-1] and lyso glucosylceramide
      [lyso-GL-1]) in adult patients who successfully completed one of the Phase 2 or Phase 3
      studies.

      Study duration will be of minimum 2 years and up to 4 years. If after 4 years since the
      beginning of the study eliglustat is not approved and available to patients in participating
      country, patients in this country may continue to receive study treatment until eliglustat is
      available to patients through the compassionate use (expanded access) program or is approved
      and available through reimbursement, whichever comes first.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

          -  The patient must have successfully completed the Phase 2 (GZGD00304) or a Phase 3
             study (GZGD02507, GZGD02607 or GZGD03109). Successful completion is defined as
             patients enrolled in one of the above mentioned studies who received eliglustat
             through the end of the study and completed the end-of-study visit without having
             discontinued or been withdrawn prematurely.

          -  The patient is willing and able to provide signed informed consent prior to any
             protocol-required procedures being performed.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy
             test prior to enrollment and while they are receiving eliglustat treatment.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to practice true abstinence
             in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle, or use a medically accepted form of
             contraception (either a barrier method, such as condom or diaphragm + spermicide, or a
             non-barrier method such as oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods, or an
             intra-uterine device or system ) while receiving eliglustat.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The patient is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  The patient has received an investigational product (other than eliglustat) within 30
             days prior to enrollment.

          -  The patient has received miglustat within the 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  The patient has documented prior esophageal varices or liver infarction or current
             liver enzymes (alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase) or total bilirubin &gt;2
             times the upper limit of normal unless the patient has a diagnosis of Gilbert
             Syndrome.

          -  The patient has any clinically significant disease, other than Gaucher disease,
             including cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic,
             endocrine, metabolic (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), or psychiatric disease, other
             medical conditions, or serious intercurrent illnesses that may preclude participation
             in the study.

          -  The patient is known to have any of the following: cardiac disease (congestive heart
             failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, heart block, ventricular
             arrhythmia), long QT syndrome, or current treatment with Class IA (eg, quinidine) or
             Class III (eg, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products.

          -  The patient has tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody,
             hepatitis C antibody, or hepatitis B surface antigen.

          -  The patient has a history of cancer within 6 months of enrolment, with the exception
             of basal cell carcinoma.

          -  Patient is CYP2D6 intermediate (IMs), extensive (EMs) or ultra-rapid (URM) metabolizer
             taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong or moderate
             CYP3A inhibitor.

          -  Patient is CYP2D6 poor metaboliser (PM) taking a strong CYP3A inhibitor within 2 weeks
             prior to enrolment.

          -  If a female patient of childbearing potential has a positive pregnancy test (blood
             β-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin [β-HCG]) or is breast feeding prior to first dosing of
             eliglustat in this study, the patient cannot enroll in the study at this time, but may
             be rescreened after the end of the pregnancy, and/or when she is no longer breast
             feeding, provided rescreening takes place before the end of the enrollment period.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to be tested for
             pregnancy.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
