      This study will use a randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based
      physical activity program using wearable devices and financial incentives. All participants
      in will establish a baseline step count during the first two weeks and then proceed to a
      16-week intervention period and 8-week follow-up period.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Among patients
      that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been
      demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause
      mortality. However, despite cardiac rehabilitation being a Class I (standard of care)
      recommendation in multiple American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guidelines,
      more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive appropriate cardiac rehabilitation and much
      of this is due to challenges in access to these programs. Recent innovations in technology
      allow us to passively monitor an individual's physical activity using wearable devices.
      Incentives designed using insights from behavioral economics have been demonstrated to
      motivate device engagement and behavior change. A remotely-monitored cardiac rehabilitation
      program could improve access for many individuals and potentially be more cost-effective
      because it is less resource- and personnel-intensive. The objective of this study is to use a
      randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based physical activity
      program using wearable devices and financial incentives.

    <description>Participants will be given a wearable device to monitor daily step counts with automated daily feedback on goal attainment via text message or email. A baseline step count will be calculated for each participant (weeks 1-2) and then they will be given a daily step goal with an increase of 15 percentage point each week during the 8-week ramp-up period (weeks 3-10) with a maximum goal of 10,000 steps. Then they'll be asked to maintain that step count (maintenance period). During the ramp-up and maintenance period they'll have a financial incentive of $14 allocated each week and $2 taken away each day the goal is not achieved. They'll be followed up for 8 weeks without incentives</description>
