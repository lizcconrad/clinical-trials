      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of belinostat
      that can be combined with standard chemotherapy drugs (rituximab, cisplatin, cytarabine, and
      dexamethasone) in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are eligible for an
      autologous stem cell transplant (a transplant of the patient's own stem cells). The safety of
      the study drug will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a
      dose level of belinostat based on when they join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of
      belinostat will be tested. Between 3-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The
      first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of belinostat is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of the standard chemotherapy drugs.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Participant will receive belinostat with standard chemotherapy for up to two 21-day cycles.

      Participant will receive belinostat by vein on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. The infusions will
      last 24 hours.

      Participant will receive rituximab and cisplatin by vein on Day 2 of each cycle. Participant
      will receive cytarabine by vein on Day 2 or 3 of each cycle, depending on when they join this
      study. Rituximab will be given over 4-5 hours, cisplatin will be given over 3-4 hours, and
      cytarabine will be given over 1 hour.

      Participant will take dexamethasone once a day by mouth on Days 2-5 of both study cycles.

      Blood (about 5 tablespoons) and bone marrow will be collected about 10 business days
      (Monday-Friday) before participant begins receiving belinostat. The blood and bone marrow
      will be used for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) testing. This testing is designed
      to learn if participant will respond to treatment. To collect a bone marrow biopsy, an area
      of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is
      withdrawn through a large needle.

      Participant will also receive filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, SMX, valacyclovir, ciprofloxacin and
      fluconazole to reduce side effects. Participant's study doctor will discuss with them when
      and how they will take these drugs.

      If participant's doctor thinks it is necessary, they will also have a bone marrow biopsy and
      aspirate performed to check the status of the disease within 4 weeks before they begin
      receiving belinostat. To collect a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of the hip or other
      site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn
      through a large needle.

      Study Visits:

      Within 5 working/business days before the start of each cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      One (1) time a week after the completion of therapy during each cycle, blood (about 4-6
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn on Days 1,2, 3, and 21 (+/- 72 hours) of Cycles 1
      and 2 for PBMC testing.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue taking belinostat combined with chemotherapy for up to 3 cycles.
      Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Dosing Visit:

      Within 3 weeks after the start of the last cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and PBMC testing.

        -  Participant will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If participant's doctor thinks it is necessary, they may have a bone marrow biopsy and
           aspirate to check the status of the disease

        -  If participant's doctor thinks it is necessary, they may have a core needle biopsy to
           check the status of the disease. To perform a core biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed
           using a hollow core needle that has a cutting edge.

      This is an investigational study. Belinostat is FDA approved to treat T-cell lymphoma. Its
      use in this study is investigational. The standard chemotherapy drugs are commercially
      available and FDA approved to treat DLBCL.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>MTD defined as the highest dose level in which 6 patients have been treated with less than 2 instances of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT defined as an adverse event at least possibly related to study treatment:
Any grade 3 or higher non-hematological toxicity possibly related to study medications per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0, with exclusion of grade 3 diarrhea lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 creatinine elevation lasting less than 48 hours
Any non-hematological toxicity requiring a delay of next cycle of therapy for greater than 14 days;
Grade 4 neutropenia which persists for 14 or greater days despite growth factor support.
Neutropenic fever incidence closely monitored, but will not be considered a DLT due to known high rate of neutropenic fever with dose adjusted RDHAP (20 - 30%).</description>

             considered a separate prior therapy. Radiation administered for potential recurrent or
             relapsed disease will be considered a separate prior therapy.

          3. Patient or durable power of attorney (DPA) for healthcare must be able to understand
             and voluntarily sign an IRB-approved informed consent form.

          4. Age 18-80 years at the time of signing the informed consent.

             ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40, active infection, active hemorrhage, or
             psychiatric illness that, in the investigators opinion places the patient at

             if in remission (including prostate cancer patients in remission from radiation
             therapy, surgery or brachytherapy), not actively being treated, with a life expectancy
             &gt; 3 years.

         10. Significant neuropathy (Grades 3 - 4, or Grade 2 with pain) within 14 days prior to
