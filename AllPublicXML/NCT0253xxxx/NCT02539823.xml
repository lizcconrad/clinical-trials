  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the current available therapies for opioid-dependent patients, most patients relapse.
      This research project focuses on the development of a novel compound, cannabidiol, to
      modulate opioid craving in humans based on animal models showing its selective effectiveness
      to inhibit drug-seeking behavior. The development of a targeted treatment for opioid relapse
      would be of tremendous medical and public health value.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been an epidemic rise in heroin abuse and overdose in recent years. Of the more
      than one million people suffering today from opiate dependency, less than a quarter of such
      individuals receive treatment. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches traditionally have targeted mu
      opioid receptors since heroin and its metabolites bind with highest affinity to this receptor
      subtype. Although such treatment strategies have improved substance abuse outcomes, they do
      not effectively block opiate craving and thus are still associated with high rates of
      relapse. Using a strategy of indirectly regulating neural systems to modulate opioid-related
      behavior, our preclinical rodent studies consistently demonstrated that cannabidiol (CBD), a
      nonpsychoactive component of cannabis, specifically inhibited cue-induced heroin-seeking
      behavior. CBD's selective effect on drug-seeking behavior was pronounced after 24 hrs and
      endured even two weeks after the last drug administration following short-term CBD exposure.
      The fact that drug craving is generally triggered by exposure to conditioned cues suggests
      that CBD might be an effective treatment for heroin craving, specially given its protracted
      impact on behavior. CBD has already been shown in Phase I of our study and in various
      clinical studies to be well tolerated with a wide safety margin in human subjects. CBD thus
      represents a strong candidate for the development as a potential therapeutic agent in humans
      for opioid craving and relapse prevention. Preliminary pilot study showed CBD decreased
      craving. It is the goal of the current study to more fully characterize the effects of CBD
      administration on cue-induced craving in drug-abstinent heroin-dependent subjects using a
      random double blind design during a post-acute (greater than 6 days since last use) heroin
      withdrawal period. Study participants will be administered CBD during 3 test sessions and
      studied for the effects on cue-induced craving during those sessions as well as one week
      after the final CBD administration on the final test day (session 4).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Cue-Induced In-Clinic Craving (from baseline to post-cue (30 minutes), and from test visit 1 through test visit 4 (1 week)) - via the Visual Analog Scale for Craving (VASC)</measure>
    <time_frame>VASC: test visits I, II and IV - at arrival, baseline for cue 1 and 2, post-cue 1 and 2, before discharge (approximately 2.5 hours from session start on average); test visit III: at arrival and discharge (approx. 2.5 hours from session start on average)</time_frame>
    <description>The VASC will be administered to assess potential variations in the subjective craving effects associated with heroin. Following the administration of the investigational drug, craving induced in response to the cue sessions in the clinic will be measured. In this way, changes in craving from baseline (pre-cue to post-cue within each test visit), as well as changes in cue-induced craving over the short-term (test visit 1 through test visit 4 a week later) will be monitored and measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Out-of-Clinic Craving (from pre-dose to approximately 4-6 hours post-dose; and from test visit 1 to test visit 4 or 1 week) - via the Heroin Craving Questionnaire (HCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>HCQ: once in clinic pre-dose at each test visit, and once at home after each test visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete the short version of the HCQ on their own time at home and bring it with them when they return for their next visit. Upon arrival to the clinic, subjects will also complete an HCQ with the coordinator to assess daily baseline cravings. This questionnaire will help us assess changes in craving generated outside of the clinical laboratory session from test visit 1 through test visit 4 (1 week later).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vital Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>At drug/placebo admin, baseline for cue 1, 10 min post-cue I, 30 min post cue I, baseline for cue 2, 10 min post cue II, 30 min post cue II or prior to discharge approximately 2.5 hours from session start on average (no cue sessions in test visit III)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (in mmHg), heart rate (in beats/min), temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit), respiratory rate (in breaths/min), and O2 saturation and pain will be monitored throughout the time course of the study and changes from baseline will be studied across the various time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>CBD Effects on Cognitive Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>2 times: once at pre-screening (visit 1) and once at test session 4 (visit 5), within 2 weeks of each other.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete a battery of performance tests conducted to examine subtle changes in mental acuity, learning and memory, and other aspects of performance that will provide insight about cannabidiol's effects on cognitive behavior. The battery will comprise the Continuous Performance, Digit Span Backwards, and Digit-Symbol Substitution tasks.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Test visit I, II and IV: on arrival, baseline for cue sessions 1 and 2, post-cue sessions I and 2 (30 min from baseline), prior to discharge (approximately 2.5 hours from session start on average); Test visit III: on arrival and prior to discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires will be used to measure subjective responses. Anxiety will be assessed using a visual analog scale for anxiety (VASA).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule(PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline for cue sessions 1 and 2, post-cue sessions I and 2 (30 min from baseline) during test visits I, II and IV.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires will be used to measure subjective responses. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule will allow us to obtain positive and negative affect measures and observe their changes from baseline over the course of the cue-induced craving session.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physiological Response to Stress - Salivary Cortisol Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Test visit I, II and IV: at drug/placebo admin, baseline for cue session 1, 10 min post-cue I, 30 min post cue I, baseline for cue 2, 10 min post cue II, 30 min post cue II</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to chew on a cotton swab, each time providing us with a saliva sample from which we can detect free cortisol levels and extrapolate serum levels of the stress indicator affected by the video cues. Thus, the physiological stress of craving will be monitored and measured across the multiple time points to observe any changes from baseline.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Effects - SAFTEE</measure>
    <time_frame>Test visit I, II, III and IV: at the end of visit prior to discharge. Average time point: approximately 150 minutes into the session.</time_frame>
    <description>Before being sent home, subjects will be asked to complete the Systematic Assessment for Treatment of Emergent Events (SAFTEE) to ensure that they are not experiencing any negative effects of the treatment. There will also be a debriefing period at the end of each session aimed to minimize any potential increase in craving beyond the clinical laboratory session. At the end of the last study, subjects will be assessed and offered appropriate resources and guidance for seeking help for substance abuse or cravings should they need it after participation in the study has concluded.</description>
