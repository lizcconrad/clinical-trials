    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether optimal patient turning, strictly every 2 hours
      with at least 15 minutes of tissue decompression, reduces the occurrence of hospital acquired
      pressure ulcers.

    <textblock>
      This single site, open label, two arm randomized control trial aims to evaluate whether
      optimal patient turning, strictly every 2 hours with at least 15 minutes of tissue
      decompression, reduces the occurrence of hospital acquired pressure ulcers. Optimal turning
      procedures will be obtained with the use of a patient monitoring system (Leaf Healthcare,
      Inc.) and compared to standard preventative care practices.

      Sensors were placed on all participants as they were admitted to ICU. A nurse's user
      dashboard was turned on for participants in the Optimal Turning Group, but was not turned on
      for participants in the Standard Care group.

Stage 1: Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin
Stage 2: Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis
Stage 3: Full-thickness skin loss
Stage 4: Full-thickness skin and tissue loss
Unstageable: Obscured full-thickness skin and tissue loss
Suspected deep tissue injury: Persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon or purple discoloration</description>
          <population>Per protocol population according to treatment received (met minimum monitoring period (&gt;2h) and did not receive both interventions)</population>
