  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the so call &quot;honey moon&quot; period, motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) become
      difficult to control with dopaminergic treatments alone. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the
      subthalamic nucleus and internal globus pallidus helps to treat fluctuating parkinsonian
      patients restoring a decent quality of life. However, DBS need a long, complex and invasive
      surgery to succeed. Thus, there is a critical need to develop alternative treatments, more
      accessible and less invasive. Thoracic posterior spinal cord stimulation has been used for
      decades to treat chronic neuropathic pains. Safety and efficacy have already been
      demonstrated in neuropathic pain. Experimentally, SCS has also demonstrated to improve
      locomotor activity in two different rodents' models of parkinson's disease. The purpose of
      this study is to determine whether thoracic SCS is safe and could induce a benefit motor
      parkinsonian symptoms without any impact on cognitive function and axial disability.

      The present pilot study will enroll 6 patients suffering from advanced Parkinson Disease
      (PD). Investigator will assess the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation
      (SCS) with frequencies of 50, 100 and 130 Hz in a shuffle randomized for each patient.
      Briefly, each frequency will be evaluated immediately after and 4 weeks following SCS
      initiation with UPDRS-III, pain scales, and Hauser's diary. The best frequency for each
      patient will be then selected and maintained activated for 12 additional weeks. At the end of
      these 12 weeks, new assessment including UPDRS, visual pain scale, &quot;SAINT-ANTOINE&quot; Pain
      Questionary, PDQ-39 (quality of life), daily L-dopa equivalent dose, MDRS (cognitive status),
      LARS (apathy status) and MADRS (depression status) will be compared to the inclusion data of
      each patient. Primary endpoints include the safety of thoracic SCS by collected the number of
      adverse event and the efficacy by measuring the UPDRS-III OFF med/ON stim at 30 weeks.
