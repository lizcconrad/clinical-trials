  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This planned pilot study is a monocentric, prospective, double-blind randomized and placebo
      controlled clinical study. The SOS-LVAD Trial can be assigned to the clinical Phase III.

      The aim of the present trial is to provide the scientific rationale for a large multicenter
      clinical trial, investigating the effects of perioperative high dose selenium supplementation
      in high-risk cardiac surgical patients undergoing complicated open heart surgery with
      prolonged time on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and LVAD Implant. The investigators
      hypothesize that the therapeutic strategy tested in this randomized trial may contribute to a
      faster independency from life-sustaining technologies in the ICU and a decrease of
      postoperative morbidity and mortality. Before proceeding to the large-scale, definitive
      trial, the investigators propose to conduct a pilot study of the definitive randomized trial,
      to determine the feasibility of the study protocol.

    <description>As primary outcome, the investigators have chosen a composite outcome. This allows to assess the postoperative process of the included patients irrespective of extrinsic sources of irritation (e.g. daily routine, clinic based processes). The independency from specific ICU procedures is taken as a primary target (time is taken from postoperative admission to ICU after implantation of LVAD until the end of the characteristic ICU procedures):
