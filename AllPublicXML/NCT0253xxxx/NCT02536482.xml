  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the children will be followed-up during the treatment with the new
      formula for Cow`s Milk Allergy. They will have monthly doctor`s appointment, when the weight,
      height and symptoms will be evaluated, by a questionnaire and a physical examination.

    <measure>Study to assess the allergic symptoms, using a questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The allergic symptoms were assessed every month, by using a questionnaire. The parents, during the medical appointment, answered &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; according to the presented symptoms: cutaneous (atopic dermatitis and urticaria), gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea constipation and bloody stools ) and respiratory. At the end of the study the children were evaluated if they tolerated the formula, it was observed by the symptoms remission.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight assessment, using a digital infant scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Every medical appointment the doctor measured the weight, by using a digital infant scale. The values were plotted in the software WHO Anthro. A curve weight/age was obtained and the children`s weight were compared to the standard population`s weight, by the z-score.</description>

    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Every medical appointment the doctor measured the height by using a digital infant scale. The values were plotted in the software Anthro. A curve height/age was obtained and the children`s height were compared to the standard population`s height, by the z-score.</description>
