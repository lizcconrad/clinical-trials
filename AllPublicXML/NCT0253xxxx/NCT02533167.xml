  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early skin to skin contact has beneficial effects and is part of the Healthy Birth
      Initiative. Positive effects on breast feeding, cardiorespiratory status, blood glucose
      control, and temperature has been demonstrated. It is the standard of care for vaginal
      deliveries but surgery is a barrier in its initation in the operating room. This study is
      evaluating initiating skin to skin contact as soon as feasible in the operating room.
      Informed consent will be obtained from scheduled/non emergent cesarean sections who are of
      EGA.37 weeks who are ASA I-II and receiving the standard spinal anesthetic. Skin to skin
      contact will be initiated after delivery as soon as apgars and newborn assessment has been
      completed. Goal is a minimum of 60 minutes of skin to skin contact between the mother and the
      newborn, with the only interruption being upon movement from the OR table to the stretcher
      when leaving the OR. Subjects seen post delivery day 1 for assessments of pain and maternal
      satisfaction utilizing a sliding 100mm VAS assessment tool.

    <textblock>
      Initiation of skin to skin contact between the mother and the baby will be done in the
      operating room during surgery rather than waiting until the recovery room as is our standard
      of care. After assurance that both mom and newborn are stable, the newborn will be placed
      across the mother's chest and covered with a blanket to help maintain body temperature. The
      skin to skin contact is maintained throughout the remaining surgical time and then continued
      into the recovery room. The subjects are seen post delivery day 1 for evaluation of their
      pain and satisfaction with care using a 0-100mm sliding VAS scale, with 0=not satisfied at
      all or no pain at all through 100 = total satisfaction and most severe pain ever.
