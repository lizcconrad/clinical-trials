      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (VTS-270) in
      patients with neurologic manifestations of Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) Disease. Approximately
      two-thirds of patients will receive the study drug, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD),
      while the remaining study participants will receive sham control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-clinical studies and a Phase 1 clinical trial suggest that intrathecal administration of
      2-hydroxypropyl- β-cyclodextrin (VTS-270) in patients with neurologic manifestations of
      Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease has the potential to slow the rate of progression of
      their neurologic disease.

      Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare, neurodegenerative, inherited, autosomal
      recessive lysosomal lipid storage disorder primarily in children and teenagers. The disease
      is characterized by the inability to properly metabolize cholesterol and other lipids within
      the cell due to mutations in the NPC1 gene causing unesterified cholesterol to accumulate in
      the brain, liver and spleen.

      This study is a multicenter, multinational, prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      sham-controlled, 3-part, efficacy and safety trial of VTS-270, administered by the lumbar
      intrathecal route (IT) every 2 weeks, with a planned enrollment of approximately 51 subjects
      with NPC1 disease. The study will be conducted in three parts: Parts A, B, and C.

      Part A will evaluate 3 different dose levels of VTS-270 in 9 subjects and 3 sham control
      subjects to determine the dose level for Parts B and C.

      Part B will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the dose selected from Part A compared to
      sham control in 51 subjects, including the 12 subjects from Part A.

      Part C will be an open-label extension phase of the study to subjects who either complete
      Part B or are subjects in Part B who have met rescue therapy criteria.

      Subjects in Part C will receive treatment with VTS-270 until the product is licensed or the
      program is terminated.
