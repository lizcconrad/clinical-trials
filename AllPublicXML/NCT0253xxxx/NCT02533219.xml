  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of [18F]-DOPA PET to provide
      improved presurgical planning and distinguish between focal and diffuse forms of HI. The
      investigators will perform descriptive analysis, relying on visual analysis to diagnose and
      localize a focal lesion. Our findings will be compared to surgical histopathology to
      determine sensitivity and specificity or this technique. The investigators will also track
      patient surgical outcomes, specifically whether the patient is surgically &quot;cured&quot; or still
      requires medical management to control residual hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is caused by low glucose due to excessive insulin secretion and
      remains difficult to treat because of the requirement for extensive amounts of glucose and
      the lack of effective long-term medical therapy. Correct diagnosis, localization, and limited
      excision of the focal lesion will result in a complete cure of the patient. In contrast,
      medically unresponsive diffuse disease requires a near total pancreatectomy, greatly
      increasing the risk of future diabetes mellitus. Fortunately, [18F]-DOPA PET has been shown
      to be a useful noninvasive imaging method for distinguishing between focal and diffuse forms
      of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. In this study, the investigators seek to validate the
      effectiveness of using PET/MR and PET/CT with F-DOPA to accurately and reliably detect and
      localize disease.

    <description>Subjects will undergo PET imaging with [18F]-DOPA. All PET imaging will be performed after administration of a single dose (0.08 - 0.16 mCurie/kg) of [18F]-DOPA. PET imaging can be performed on either Philips Ingenuity TF PET/MRI or PET/CT.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All Patients clinically diagnosed with Hyperinsulinemia of any age

          -  Patients in need of PET scan

          -  Patients that require sedation

          -  Patients that do not require sedation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:

          -  Patients without Hyperinsulinemia

          -  Patients who are or may be pregnant

          -  Serious intercurrent medical illness other than hypoglycemia that precludes having the
             scan either because of patient instability or concerns about potential toxicity.

          -  Patient's requiring emergency surgical intervention that would be inappropriately
             delayed by [18F]-DOPA PET imaging.
