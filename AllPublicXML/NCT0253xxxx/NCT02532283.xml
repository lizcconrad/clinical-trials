    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Pharmacokinetic parameters of JNJ-63623872 in
      combination with oseltamivir in elderly participants (aged 65 to &lt;= 85 years) compared to
      adults (aged 18 to &lt;= 64 years) with influenza A infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind
      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), placebo-controlled, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school
      team work on a medical research study) study to evaluate the effect of JNJ-63623872 in
      combination with oseltamivir in participants with influenza A infection. The study consists
      of 3 Phases: Screening visit (1 Day), participants who meet all eligibility criteria will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive study drug in double-blind treatment Phase (7 Days) and
      follow up Phase (21 Days). The duration of participation in the study for each participant is
      approximately 28 Days. Primarily Pharmacokinetic parameters of JNJ-63623872 will be measured.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
