    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if oral everolimus is tolerable and effective in
      the treatment of sporadic Angiomyolipomas (AMLs). AMLs are the most common non-cancerous
      tumor of the kidney. They are composed of blood vessels, muscle cells and fat
      cells.Everolimus is already an approved drug for several other diseases like kidney cancer,
      but is being studied now specifically to see if it is helpful for people with AML.

      Primary Objective

      1. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus in reducing tumor volume in
      sporadic AMLs as measured by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI),
      in patients who might otherwise be considered for active surgical or percutaneous
      intervention.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in subjects treated with everolimus
           for sporadic AMLs.

        2. To assess the growth kinetics of sporadic AMLs in patients who have been treated with
           everolimus as part of the study and demonstrate an objective response as well as those
           who have been treated with everolimus during the study with a suboptimal or no response.

        3. To measure the rate of surgical or percutaneous (embolization) intervention at 1 year
           from day 1 of study.

        4. To assess the safety and tolerability of everolimus in patients with sporadic AML.
