      This is a Phase 1 trial for safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of axitinib
      and selenomethionine (SLM) for adult patients with advanced metastatic clear cell renal cell
      carcinoma (CCRCC). This will be a two part study consisting of a dose escalation and
      expansion study.

      Dose-Escalation Part 1 (6-12 patients) : SLM will be given twice daily for 14 days followed
      by SLM once daily in combination with axitinib 5 mg twice daily with titration according to
      package insert in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Treatment will continue until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Expansion Part 2: In this phase (approximately 19 patients), will be treated at the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of SLM determined in the Escalation Part 1. It will be given orally
      twice daily for 14 days, followed by SLM once daily in combination with axitinib 5 mg twice
      daily with titration according to package insert in patients with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
