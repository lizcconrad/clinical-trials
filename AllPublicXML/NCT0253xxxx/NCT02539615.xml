      The purpose of this study is to measure the performance of the ForeCYTE Breast Aspirator for
      the collection and processing of Nipple Aspirate Fluid (NAF) specimens for cytology.
      Including collecting, processing and shipping samples, training staff, processing samples,
      sample interpretation and accurate and timely reporting in a manner resembling routine
      clinical use. The study will include a subset of patients who are known carriers of a BRCA
      germline mutation. NAF from this subset will be submitted for molecular testing in addition
      to cytology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy, female, age 30-55 years, from whom bi-lateral specimens can be obtained.

             The following additional considerations apply:

               -  Women with prior mastectomy/lumpectomy may be considered for NAF-collection in
                  the contralateral (non-operated) breast only if they were:

                    -  Stage I or Stage II at the time of surgery;

                    -  Have completed any and all hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted
                       therapy at least one year prior to inclusion;

                    -  Are considered disease-free (NED- No Evidence of Disease) at the time of
                       study entry;

               -  Women under the age 30 may be enrolled if they are within 10 years of the age at
                  diagnosis of breast cancer in a first-degree relative. No subject under the age
                  of 21 may be enrolled.

          2. Any woman for whom NAF-cytology testing is considered to be beneficial by her
             physician. This includes, but is not limited to women with first- and/or second degree
             relatives with breast- or ovarian cancer. Known presence of a BRCA-1 or BRCA-2
             germline mutation is allowed but not required. If known, any such mutation will be
             noted on the Case Report Form. The protocol does not provide for testing of women
             without known germ-line mutations.

          3. Non-lactating and non-pregnant.

          4. Good general health as determined by medical history, breast disease/cancer history,
             and clinical breast exam.

          5. Willing to give informed consent and follow study procedures as directed.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Medical condition/psychiatric conditions making subjects a poor candidate for study,
             as determined by the Principal Investigator.

          2. Pregnancy or suspicion of pregnancy.

          3. Open cutaneous wounds or atopic dermatitis in the area of the nipple-areolar complex.

          4. No or inverted nipple on the breast unfit for fluid collection, or significant prior
             surgery in the area of the nipple-areolar complex.

          5. Participation in an investigational drug or device study less than 30 days prior to
             enrollment in this study.

          6. Pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation less than 90 days prior to enrollment in this
             study.

          7. Acute illness, including taking antibiotics, analgesics, antipyretics and/or cold
             medications less than 7 days prior to enrollment in this study.
