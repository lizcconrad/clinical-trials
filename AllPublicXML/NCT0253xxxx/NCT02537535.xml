      Cross-sectional observational study designed to identify and describe the care gap in
      guideline-oriented low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management in Canadian
      patients at high cardiovascular risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional observational study designed to provide real-life data on the
      current management of dyslipidemia in high cardiovascular risk patients in routine clinical
      practice. Canadian guidelines recommend a target for LDL-C of ≤2.0 mmol/L (or ≥50% decrease)
      after treatment initiation in high-risk patients. The recommended first line treatment is
      statin therapy. Available data clearly indicates that up to 50% of high risk patients do not
      achieve this important target because of statin inadequacy or intolerance leading to
      non-adherence.

      Therefore this program aims to provide further insights into the challenges Canadian
      physicians face in helping their high risk patients achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C.
