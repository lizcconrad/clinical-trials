  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of OAB symptoms among patients with Parkinson's disease and a lack
      of pharmacotherapies with an acceptable side effect profile. Specifically, available
      anticholinergic medications have a high risk of cognitive side-effects, which preclude their
      use in PD patients with CI. PD can also cause a number of non-motor symptoms that are likely
      to be adversely affected by the currently available anticholinergic agents. Mirabegron is the
      first pharmacologic treatment which may not exacerbate CI, constipation, orthostatic
      hypotension (OH), somnolence, and dry mouth in PD.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Aged 25-80 at screening. Subjects older than 80 will be allowed at the discretion of
             the PI.

          2. Ambulatory (defined as able to ambulate at least 10 meters, with or without
             assistance).

          3. Clinical Diagnosis of PD based on the United Kingdom Brain Bank diagnostic criteria
             for PD.

          4. At baseline visit (Visit 2) patients must have:

               -  At least 8 micturitions per 24 hours and

               -  At least 3 urgency episodes per 3-day diary.

          5. A MoCA score between 19 and 28 (inclusive) at screening. For those on cognitive
             enhancers (donepezil, rivastigmine, memantine, galantamine) a MoCA score between 19
             and 29 (inclusive) at screening.

          6. Provide informed consent to participate in the study and understand that they may
             withdraw their consent at any time without prejudice to their future medical care.

          7. Be cognitively capable, in the opinion of investigator, to understand and provide such
             informed consent.

          8. Be cognitively capable to complete the required questionnaires and assessments, OR
             have a care partner who is willing and capable to assist them in the completion of
             these tasks.

          9. Be on a stable regimen of antiparkinson's medications at least 30 days prior to
             screening, and be expected to remain on a stable dose for the duration of the study.

         10. If taking cognitive enhancers (donepezil, rivastigmine, memantine, galantamine), must
             be on stable dose at least 30 days prior to screening, and be expected to remain on a
             stable dose for the duration of the study.

          1. Known or suspected alcohol or substance abuse in the preceding 12 months.
