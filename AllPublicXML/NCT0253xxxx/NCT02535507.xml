  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various driver gene mutations have been identified in lung cancer. Among them, human
      epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) was identified in about approximately 2% of non-small cell
      lung cancers.Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2
      receptors. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib in
      patients with HER2 positive advanced Non-small cell lung cancer.

      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib in patients with HER2
      positive advanced pre-treated Non-small cell lung cancer.

      To observe objective response rate (ORR) of pyrotinib in HER2 positive NSCLC. To observe
      Progression free survival （PFS）. To assess the overall survival (OS). To assess side effects.
      To evaluate quality of life. To explore the relationship between biomarkers and the
      toxicity/efficacy of Pyrotinib.
