      The goal of this new lupus research study is two-fold: first, to understand the genetic
      associations found between people's DNA and this disease, and second, to apply this
      understanding to drug development efforts with the investigator's partners at Pfizer.

      Lupus is a difficult disease to diagnose and one that's difficult to manage, given the lack
      of specific medicines to treat lupus and the side-effects of current medications. The
      investigators believe genetics may play a critical role in developing better lupus diagnoses
      and treatments. If individuals are eligible to participate, the investigators will send a
      23andMe DNA saliva kit at no cost. Participants will be asked to take a 15 minute online
      survey with questions about their lupus experience, symptoms and response to treatments, in
      addition to five additional bi-monthly short surveys and one final study survey during the
      12-month participation. Learn more and join the lupus study today:
