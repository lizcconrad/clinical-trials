      A total of 16 subjects, ages 18-45, will be enrolled in this crossover study. The study will
      consist of three 7-day study arms in the following order, one usual care arm, one bionic
      pancreas insulin only arm with a static glucose target, and one bionic pancreas insulin only
      arm with at dynamic glucose target.
