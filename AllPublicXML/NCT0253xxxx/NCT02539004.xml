  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urolithiasis is a universal problem, a large part of patients will be affected by multiple
      stones throughout their lifetime, with estimated recurrence rates of 75% within 20 years. The
      high recurrence rate requires an increasing amount of imaging follow-up. US-NCCT real-time
      fusion (Fusion) enables lesion assessment and follow up using both modalities as reference
      for each other. Our study proposes a novel approach for short term follow up of patients
      using Fusion instead of repeat NCCT exams.

      the goal of the study is to create an initial proof of concept that Fusion is effective for
      follow up of known urinary stones.

      the study is a prospective study on Patients with an obstructing ureteral stone found on a
      NCCT. Patients will undergo Fusion (using General Electric Logiq E9) after NCCT. The primary
      endpoint was the ability to locate the ureteral stone using US with guidance of the NCCT as a
      &quot;Road Map&quot;.
