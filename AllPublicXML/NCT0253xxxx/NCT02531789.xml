  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current post-operative monitoring of patient recovery consists measuring two blood markers
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and White Blood Cell Count (WBC). However, these are slow to respond
      to the onset of infection. However, monitoring the absolute levels of the proteins in the
      three pathways of the complement cascade should provide a faster and better predictor of
      patient recovery. The investigators propose a pilot trial to measure concentrations of
      Complement Cascade (CC) activation biomarkers in the blood over a time course around
      operations of major abdomino-pelvic surgery involving a bowel resection. Further, analysis of
      the differential CC pathway activation should identify the onset of recovery complications
      before clinical symptoms present and potentially identify the causes allowing the clinicians
      to target therapies.

      The proposed study is a pilot study on a cohort of participants recruited from routine
      elective colorectal surgery at RD&amp;E. The pilot trial will collect blood over a time course
      for a patient to record blood plasma levels of Complement proteins peri-operatively from
      admission to discharge. The assay schedule is detailed in Table 1 below. The trial will
      perform additional CC activation tests on routine blood samples taken during the patient's
      stay in hospital. In addition 4 trial samples will be taken at time intervals that will
      capture the impulse response of the patient's CC. Sample analysis will be performed in
      parallel in the clinical chemistry laboratory for laboratory for assays of CRP and the
      complement proteins C3 and C4. The additional trial assays will be performed on the MSD
      platform on loan for the period of the trial.

      The assays deployed for the pilot trial the current biomarkers of C activation panel are
      C3dg, C4d, Bb, TCC and the acute phase marker, CRP. The TCC assay has been designed in
      Cardiff (by Prof Morgan a collaborator of Prof Shaw) and the investigators have extensive
      experience in the design of C protein assays. For the target biomarkers antibodies to
      neo-antigens that are revealed post enzymatic cleavage or complex formation will be used as
      capture antibodies on the surface of the MSD platform. The C proteins are then detected with
      polyclonal antibodies provided by Prof Morgan in Cardiff and labelled with a ruthenium tagged
      antibody. Whole EDTA-stabilised plasma is then incubated in the 96-well format; all 5 assays,
      including calibration curves, are run simultaneously. Electroluminescence from the ruthenium
      complex is collected and quantified automatically. Absolute measurements of C proteins will
      be performed using standardised fully activated serum which contains a constant amount of
      activation products from all complement pathways. The serum is available through Prof
      Morgan's collaboration with the 'Complement Standardization Group'. C activation relative to
      this standard can then be determined. This work will lead to an array of C activation markers
      that will be tested against the patient cohort. This array including some of the other
      pathway markers may ultimately become the basis of a routine clinical test.
