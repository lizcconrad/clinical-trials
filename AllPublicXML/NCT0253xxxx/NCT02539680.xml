  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to study the expression of the various phosphate transporters
      in patients with normal or moderately impaired renal function or in patients on dialysis. In
      particular, the investigators want to clarify whether NaPi-IIb expression level decreases in
      CKD patients, which would render it a potentially inadequate pharmaceutical target in these
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated serum phosphate is a potent predictor of death and cardiovascular events in patients
      with renal disease. Control of serum-phosphate to desired target ranges is insufficient in
      many patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), in particular dialysis patients
      despite dietary restrictions, optimized dialysis regimens and the use of phosphate binders.
      One reason why for example, phosphate binders are insufficient to control phosphate uptake in
      the intestine or why they even loose efficacy, is a compensatory upregulation of phosphate
      transporters in the gut wall.

      Thus, several companies attempt to specifically interfere with intestinal phosphate
      transporters, in particular the NaPi-IIb transporter. However, recent Chugai data obtained in
      experimental CKD challenge the assumption that NaPi-IIb is the major therapeutic target in
      this situation. In addition to NaPi-IIb, PiT-1 and -2 also might contribute to phosphate
      transport.

      In normal human intestinal mucosa the most prominent expression of all 3 transporters is
      observed in the duodenum, i.e. an area, which can easily be assessed by endoscopy.

      During endoscopy a biopsy for research purposes will be obtained. Chugai will evaluate the
      expression level of NaPi-IIb, PiT-1, PiT-2, and villin1 at the mRNA and, if possible, the
      protein level.
