    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of multiple oral doses
      of ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 and ABT-333 when co-administered under non-fasting conditions in
      healthy Chinese adult participants.

        contraceptives; participant and/or partner(s) using double-barrier method (condoms,
        contraceptive sponge, diaphragm with spermicidal jellies or creams, or vaginal ring); or
        total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred life style of the subject;
        periodic abstinence is not acceptable

        Body Mass Index (BMI) is ≥ 18 to &lt; 30 kg/m^2.

        A condition of general good health, based upon the results of a medical history, physical
        examination, vital signs, laboratory profile, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest
        x-ray (CXR).

        Exclusion Criteria: Use of any medications (prescription and over-the-counter), vitamins
        and/or herbal supplements within the 2-week period prior to the first dose of study drug
        administration or within 10 half-lives of the respective medication, whichever is longer.

        History of epilepsy, any clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory (except mild
        asthma), renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, thyroid, or any
        uncontrolled medical illness or psychiatric disease or disorder.

        Clinically significant abnormal ECG: ECG with QT interval corrected for heart rate using
        Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) &gt; 450 msec in females and &gt; 430 msec in males, or
        ECG with second or third degree atrioventricular block.

        Previous exposure to more than a single dose of ABT-450/r/ABT-267, or ABT-333 within the
        past 12 weeks, or previous participation in this study.

        Consideration by the investigator, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable
        candidate to receive ABT-450, ritonavir, ABT-267, or ABT-333.
