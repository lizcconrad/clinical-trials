    <textblock>
      The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, including whole genome (WGS),
      exome (WES) and RNA sequencing has revolutionized the ability of investigators to query the
      molecular mechanisms underlying tumor formation. Through the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project
      (PCGP), investigators at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) have successfully used
      NGS approaches to evaluate more than 1,000 pediatric cancers ranging from hematologic
      malignancies to central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS solid tumors. From these and related
      studies, it has become clear that genomic approaches can accurately classify tumors into
      distinct pathologic and prognostic subtypes and detect alterations in cellular pathways that
      may serve as novel therapeutic targets. Collectively, these studies suggest that by
      characterizing the genomic make-up of individual tumors, investigators will be able to
      develop personalized and potentially more effective cancer treatments and/or preventive
      measures.

      Despite recent advances, NGS approaches are not yet routinely used as part of clinical care
      due to their high cost and technical complexity, as well as the many challenges related to
      data analysis and translation to the clinical setting. The overarching goal of this protocol
      is to establish and test processes by which NGS technologies, including WGS, WES and RNA
      sequencing, can be offered to pediatric oncology patients undergoing treatment at SJCRH.

      This is a non-therapeutic study examining the feasibility, acceptance and impact of clinical
      WGS, WES and RNA sequencing in a pediatric oncology setting. Investigators anticipate a
      sample size of approximately 400 patients and 400-800 biological parents.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To perform clinical next generation whole genome (WGS), exome (WES), and RNA sequencing
           on SJCRH pediatric oncology patients prospectively over a 24-month period.

        -  To use WGS, WES and RNA sequence data to identify and characterize somatic genetic
           variants of pathological significance and germline genetic variants associated with
           increased cancer risk.

      OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:

        -  To generate and analyze data describing the informed consent process and patient/parent
           perceptions of genomic investigations and research.

        -  To generate and analyze data surrounding the return of genomic sequencing results,
           examine patient/parent understanding of these results and assess the impact of results
           on patients and families.

        -  To determine the feasibility and reliability of performing WES and RNA sequencing on
           derivatives from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples alongside the
           analysis of matched frozen tumor and germline samples.

      For participants who give consent, a tumor and/or normal tissue sample will be obtained and
      used for WGS, WES and RNA sequence analysis. Once the results of these analyses are
      available, they will be disclosed to physicians, patients and parents. Mixed measures
      approaches will be used to assess understanding, acceptance and impact of genomic results on
      patients and parents.

      All tumor samples analyzed via the clinical genomics pipeline will undergo routine clinical
      pathology testing, which will be run in parallel with this study. Genetic variants deemed
      reportable by the Clinical Genomics Committee will be considered for return to physicians,
      patients and parents after several validation steps. Genes from the tumor tissue will be
      analyzed and those with biological and/or clinical relevance will be reported. A defined list
      of 63 genes will be analyzed for reporting using normal (germline) tissue. During the course
      of the study, the investigators anticipate the list of genes to be reported using normal
      tissue to change due to advances in the literature or other evidence linking additional genes
      to tumor formation and cancer risk, and new lists may be defined.

      To assess provider, patient and family understanding and describe the impacts of genomic
      testing and return of results, this study will also incorporate administration of surveys and
      semi-structured interviews. Surveys and interviews are optional, but will be offered to all
      primary SJCRH providers, as well as all eligible participants and parents, regardless of
      whether or not they consent to pursue the genomic testing.

      A sample of blood or a skin biopsy will be obtained as a source of germline DNA. This sample
      is necessary as it is the comparator against which tumor samples are evaluated. Skin biopsies
      may be done on patients who have a diagnosis where peripheral blood is likely to be
      contaminated by tumor cells.
