  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the intestinal microbiota influences rotavirus
      vaccine immune responses in healthy adult volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will alter the intestinal microbiota in healthy adults using antibiotics and
      subsequently measure immune reactions to the rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix), the tetanus vaccine
      and the pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumo23).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests carried out
             within 28 days prior to starting antibiotics (day -98). A subject with a clinical
             abnormality or laboratory parameter outside the reference range may be included if the
             investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors
             and will not interfere with the study procedures

          -  Male between 18 and 35 years of age, inclusive at the time of signing the informed
             consent

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent and able to comply with the requirements
             and restrictions listed in the informed consent form

          -  Normal defecation pattern (defined as ≤3x/ day and ≥3x/week)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had a major illness in the past 3 months or any significant chronic
             medical illness that the investigator would deem unfavorable for enrollment, including
             inflammatory diseases.

          -  Subject with any history of immunodeficiency

          -  Subjects with a history of any type of malignancy

          -  Subject with a history of thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorder

          -  Subject has a past or current gastrointestinal disease which may influence the gut
             microbiota

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones)

          -  History of alcoholism and/or drinking more than an average of 5 units of alcohol per
             day

          -  The subject has received an investigational product within three months of day 0 of
             the current study
