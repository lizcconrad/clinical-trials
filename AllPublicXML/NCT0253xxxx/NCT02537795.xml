    <description>A semi-structured interview of patients and one of their family members will be conducted. Patients and family members will be interviewed separately. The interview will consist of several open ended questions around several themes. The interviews for patients and family members will have their own focus. Patient interviews will focus on living with OCD, living with PNS and the decision making process leading to the PNS procedure. Family member interviews will focus on their own experience in their interaction with OCD patients both before and after PNS</description>

        In the University Hospital of Leuven, more than thirty patients suffering from severe OCD
        have been treated with DBS. The investigators will ask patients who are currently being
        treated with DBS whether they are willing to participate in this study. The investigators
        will also ask whether one of their family members might participate, preferentially their
        partner or another close family member. The aim is to include at least ten patients and
        their family members. OCD patients, who have been treated with anterior capsulotomy, and
        their family members will also be asked for participation in this study. The aim is to also
        include ten patients and family members in this group.
