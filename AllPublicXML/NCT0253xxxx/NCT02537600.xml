      The purpose of this study is to determine wether cobimetinib + vemurafenib combination
      treatment is effective in the treatment of BRAFV600-mutated melanoma patients with brain
      metastasis

      Patients will be enrolled into 3 cohorts:

        -  Cohort A : Neurologically asymptomatic patients who have not received prior local
           treatment ;

        -  Cohort B. Neurologically asymptomatic patients who have received prior local treatment;

        -  Cohort C. Neurologically symptomatic patients who have or have not received prior local
           treatment Every patients will be treated with Vemurafenib 960 mg PO, twice daily from D1
           to D28, continuously

      Cobimetinib 60 mg PO, once daily, from D1 to D21 - 1 cycle = 28 days

      Treatment will be administered until progression (intracranial or extracranial), unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death or decision of the treating investigator.

      Patients who develop intracranial or extracranial progression and who, in the opinion of the
      treating investigator, could benefit from continuing treatment may continue treatment with
      vemurafenib and cobimetinib after approval from the principal investigator.

      Patients who discontinue the study treatment will undergo an end-of-treatment visit 30 days
      after the last dose of vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib.

      Patients who discontinue the study treatment for any reason other than progression (e.g.
      toxicity) must be followed up every 8 weeks unless they withdraw their consent.
