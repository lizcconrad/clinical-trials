  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat adult patients who have relapsed or
      refractory B-ALL with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically
      modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that will bind to leukemia cells that
      express the CD19 protein on the cell surface. The study will determine if these modified T
      cells (called JCAR015) help the body's immune system eliminate leukemia cells. The trial will
      also study the safety of treatment with JCAR015, how long JCAR015 cells stay in the patient's
      body, the extent to which JCAR015 eliminates minimal residual disease, and the impact of this
      treatment on survival.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of
      JCAR015 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The study will have the
      following sequential phases: Part A (screening, leukapheresis, cell product preparation, and
      cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B (treatment and follow-up). The follow-up period for
      each participant is approximately 12 months after the final JCAR015 infusion. The total
      duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years. Long-term follow-up for
      survival, toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue under a separate long-term
      follow-up protocol per health regulatory authority guidelines, currently up to 15 years after
      the last JCAR015 infusion.
