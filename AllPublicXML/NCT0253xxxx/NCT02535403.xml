  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-documented and effective method for the
      treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Lately there has been an
      increase in the development and use of internet-based CBT programs (ICBT), as a means to
      reduce costs and enhance accessibility of psychological interventions. ICBT has proven
      efficacious towards adults with anxiety disorders. Research in the field of ICBT with
      children and adolescents is still in its infancy though and to date, no program targeting
      anxiety disorders has been developed nor evaluated in Denmark. The primary objective of this
      study is to investigate the efficacy of a newly developed internet-based treatment program
      for adolescents with anxiety disorders. The effect will be examined in a randomized
      controlled trial comparing ICBT to a wait-list control condition.

    <textblock>
      Within the context of a research and teaching clinic at the Department of Psychology and
      Behavioral Sciences, Aarhus University, Denmark, 70 adolescents aged 13-17 with a primary
      anxiety disorder as assessed by the ADIS C/P will be randomly allocated to either a 3 month
      wait-list control condition or a treatment condition.

      The treatment consists of an internet-based self-help program for adolescents with anxiety
      disorders called 'Chilled Out', based on material from the well-established manualised
      group-treatment Cool Kids Program: Adolescent version. It consists of 8 CBT-inspired modules
      of approximately 30 minutes each distributed over a 14-week period. The program is
      interactive using a combination of different media (text, audio, illustrations, cartoons, and
      videos) to deliver psychoeducation and CBT-inspired techniques, activities and exercises for
      adolescents to manage their anxiety. In addition, the adolescent will receive a limited
      amount of therapist support calls.

      Participants (youth and parents) are assessed with semi-structured diagnostic interviews and
      self-report measures before treatment, after 14 weeks (post treatment) and 3 months after
      treatment (follow-up).

      Participants are assessed at pre, post and 3-month follow up.
