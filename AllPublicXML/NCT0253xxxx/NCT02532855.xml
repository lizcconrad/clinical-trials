  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of the addition of sitagliptin to metformin
      with or without a sulfonylurea compared with the addition of dapagliflozin to metformin with
      or without a sulfonylurea on hemoglobin A1c (A1C) over 24 weeks of treatment as well as the
      overall safety and tolerability of sitagliptin in comparison to that of dapagliflozin after
      24 weeks of treatment. The primary hypothesis is that the change from baseline in A1C in
      participants treated with the addition of sitagliptin is non-inferior compared to that in
      participants treated with the addition of dapagliflozin after 24 weeks of treatment.
