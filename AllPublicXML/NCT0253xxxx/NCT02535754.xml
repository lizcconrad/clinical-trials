  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behaviour changes such as improving nutrition, increasing physical activity, and decreasing
      obesity are linked with lower mortality and morbidity and fewer cancers. Health promotion
      programs in the workplace are a promising way to reach a large segment of the population.
      This project evaluated the efficacy of three approaches - all of which were based on previous
      research and programs with demonstrated positive benefits - on cancer-related outcomes
      (healthy eating, physical activity, normal body weight) and work-related outcomes
      (absenteeism, presenteeism).

      The project evaluated the efficacy of three health promotion interventions on cancer- and
      work-related outcomes. Three worksites in British Columbia were randomly assigned to one of
      three conditions: (1) an empirically-validated intervention directed at individual behavior
      change using personally-tailored messages delivered by email (ALIVE) ; (2) a comprehensive
      approach building on social and institutional support developed by the Canadian Cancer
      Society British Columbia Yukon and previously used for worksite tobacco control (CCS BCY) and
      (3) an intervention including both of these approaches (CCS BCY + ALIVE). The primary outcome
      was change in fruit and vegetable consumption from baseline to 16 months, as an indicator of
      healthy diet. Change in weight, physical activity, and work productivity were secondary
      outcomes. The investigators also conducted focus groups to assess participant perspectives on
      the programs which comprise another secondary outcome.

    <description>The company assigned to this condition offered employees participation in the ALIVE program. This program was validated in a previous worksite-based randomized controlled trial (RCT). A baseline assessment includes questions asking about: presence of children at home, habits related to cooking and eating out, physical activity preferences, stage of readiness of change, and perceived barriers to achieving heath behavior goals. This information provides the basis for immediate feedback and individually-tailored messages that include goal-setting and tips to achieve these goals, interactive features, and health information. Biweekly messages are sent for a total of 48 weeks. Outcome data were based on all individuals who completed the baseline assessment.</description>

    <description>The company assigned to this condition participated in a comprehensive year-long workplace wellness program intervention focusing on nutrition, weight control, and physical activity, led by the CCS BCY. The program was modeled after a previous successful CCS BCY tobacco control worksite program. This program stresses the importance of developing social and environmental supports at the worksite to promote behavior change . Such supports could include food availability (e.g., cafeteria and vending machine selections), the built environment (e.g., availability of bike racks); social environment (e.g., group lunchtime walking clubs), and health communications (e.g., company newsletters). Outcome data were based on all individuals who completed the baseline assessment.</description>

    <description>The company assigned to this condition received both the ALIVE and CCS BCY programs. Employees were encouraged to take part in both ALIVE and company initiatives, but participation in these activities was based on individual preference. Outcome data were based on all individuals who completed the baseline assessment.</description>
