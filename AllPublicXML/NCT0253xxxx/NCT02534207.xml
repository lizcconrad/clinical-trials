  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the relationship between basmisanil plasma concentrations and the
      occupancy of Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid A (GABAA) receptor subtypes containing an alpha5 (α5)
      subunit in healthy Japanese volunteers. Each participant will have two post-screening imaging
      sessions. In the first imaging session, participants will have a baseline Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) scan. In the second imaging session, participants will receive a single oral
      dose of basmisanil, followed by two on-treatment PET scans at about 4 and 10 hours post-dose.

    <description>Single oral dose: Basmisanil doses between 20 milligrams (mg) and 960 mg may be used in this study. The planned doses for the first two participants are 160 mg and 480 mg, respectively. Basmisanil dose for subsequent participants will be decided by the investigator and sponsor during the study, based on on-going review of emerging data.</description>
