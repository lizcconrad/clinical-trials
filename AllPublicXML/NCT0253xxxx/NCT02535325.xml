      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of methoxyamine when given together
      with pemetrexed disodium, cisplatin, and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage
      IIIA-IV non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methoxyamine,
      pemetrexed disodium, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving methoxyamine together with pemetrexed disodium, cisplatin, and radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of methoxyamine (TRC102) in combination with
      pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium)-cisplatin and thoracic radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To (descriptively) assess the toxicity profile of methoxyamine (TRC102) in combination
      with pemetrexed-cisplatin and thoracic radiotherapy.

      II. To (descriptively) assess the short-term progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6) in
      the patients treated on this protocol.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of methoxyamine.

      COURSES 1-2: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes and
      methoxyamine orally (PO) day 1; and cisplatin IV over 0.5-24 hours on day 3. Patients also
      undergo 3-dimensional (3-D) conformal radiation therapy (RT) or intensity-modulated radiation
      therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week (3 days of week 1 and 4 days of week 4) for 30
      fractions total.

      COURSES 3-4: Beginning at least 10 days after RT completion, patients receive pemetrexed
      disodium IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 0.5-24 hours on day 1.

      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 weeks and then every 3
      months for 6 months.
