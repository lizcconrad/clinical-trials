  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient's immune systems are often damaged by chemotherapy or by CLL. Researchers want to
      learn if giving T-cells (immune cells) that have been expanded and specially processed in the
      laboratory (activated) will help CLL patients' immune systems recover after chemotherapy.
      This may help lower the chance of infections.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an activated T-cell infusion, when
      given with or without lenalidomide, can help to restore patients' immune systems when given
      after chemotherapy (rituximab and fludarabine with cyclophosphamide or bendamustine). The
      safety of this treatment combination will also be studied.

      Researchers also want to learn if the activated T-cells may also be able to kill cancer
      cells.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have an equal chance of being
      assigned to either group:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive chemotherapy and an activated T-cell infusion.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive chemotherapy, an activated T-cell infusion, and
           6 months of lenalidomide therapy.

        -  If your doctor determines that you are not able to receive chemotherapy or if you have a
           certain genetic mutation, you will be in Group 3. Patients in Group 3 will only receive
           an activated T-cell infusion.

      Central Venous Catheter:

      Many of the drugs given in this study and the activated T-cells will be given by vein through
      a central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube and needle that will be
      placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Blood samples will also be
      drawn through your CVC. The CVC will remain in your body during treatment. Your doctor will
      explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate
      consent form.

      T-Cell Collection:

      Blood (about 17 tablespoons) will be drawn to collect the T-cells. These cells will be
      expanded and activated in the laboratory and given back to you after chemotherapy is
      complete.

      Chemotherapy and T-cell Infusion:

      The days before you receive the activated T-cells are called minus days. The day you receive
      the activated T-cells is called Day 0. The days after you receive the activated T-cells are
      called plus days.

      On Day -5, you will receive rituximab by vein over 4-6 hours and fludarabine by vein over 1
      hour. You will receive either cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours or bendamustine over 1
      hour. Your doctor will decide whether you will receive cyclophosphamide or bendamustine.

      On Day -4 and -3, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour, and then either
      cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours or bendamustine over 1 hour.

      On Days -2 and -1, you will rest and receive nothing.

      On Day 0, you will receive the activated T-cells by vein over about 10-30 minutes.

      Before the infusion, you will receive acetaminophen (Tylenol) by mouth and diphenhydramine
      hydrochloride (Benadryl) by mouth or vein about 30-60 minutes before the infusion. These
      drugs will be used to help lower the risk of side effects. If you experience side effects
      during treatment, you must stay in the clinic to be observed until the symptoms have stopped
      completely. If you have a severe allergic reaction during the infusion of the activated
      T-cells, the infusion will be stopped right away and you will be given any needed care by the
      doctor and staff.

      If you are in Group 2, after your blood counts are high enough after the activated T-cell
      infusion, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time each day at about the same time each day
      for about 6 months. If you are able to do so, you will also take aspirin or another drug as
      instructed by your doctor on these days to help prevent blood clots. You may ask the study
      staff for more information about how these drugs are given and their risks. You will be asked
      to complete a study drug diary and bring it to each study visit. The study staff will tell
      you more about this.

      If you experience side effects from lenalidomide, your dose will be reduced. If you continue
      to experience side effects, your doctor may decide to stop lenalidomide.

      Study Visits (All Groups):

      On the day of the activated T-cell infusion:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the status of the
           disease, for tests of the immune system, and to test for CMV, EBV, and polyoma virus.

      At about 1, 3, and 12 months after the activated T-cell infusion:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the status of the
           disease, for tests of the immune system, and to test for CMV, EBV, and polyoma virus.

        -  At about 3 and 12 months after the T-cell infusion, you will have a bone marrow
           aspiration to check the status of the disease.

      At about 2 and 6 months after the activated T-cell infusion, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will
      be drawn for tests of the immune system and to test for CMV, EBV, and polyoma virus.

      Additional Study Visits for Group 2 only:

      Every 28 days, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If you can become pregnant and have regular menstrual cycles, blood (up to 2 teaspoons) will
      be drawn for a pregnancy test on the following schedule:

        -  Within 10-14 days, and within 24 hours before your first dose of lenalidomide, even if
           you have not had menses due to treatment of the disease or have had as little as one
           menstrual period in the past 24 months.

        -  One (1) time each week for 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks while taking lenalidomide.

        -  Four (4) weeks after you stop taking lenalidomide.

      If you have irregular menstrual cycles, you will have pregnancy tests every week for the
      first 28 days, then every 14 days while you are taking lenalidomide, again when you have been
      taken off of lenalidomide therapy, and then 14 days and 28 days after you have stopped taking
      lenalidomide.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation on this study will be over after the 12 month follow-up visit. You
      may be taken off study early if you are unable to receive the T-cell infusion, if you have
      any intolerable side effects, if you are unable to follow study directions, if your doctor
      thinks it is in your best interest, if the study is stopped, or if you choose to leave the
      study early.

      Your participation in this study will be over after the follow-up period.

      Follow-Up:

      Starting about a year and a half after the activated T-cell infusion, the study staff will
      call you and ask about your health and disease status every 6 months for up to 5 years. The
      phone call should take about 5-15 minutes each time.

      This is an investigational study. Bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and rituximab
      are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of CLL. Lenalidomide is FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of other types of cancer. The use of
      lenalidomide for the treatment of CLL is investigational. The T cell process being used on
      this study is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for
      research purposes only.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
