  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the main modifiable risk factor for the development of chronic diseases in Mexico.
      Several randomized controlled trials have shown that intensive lifestyle programs are
      efficacious for the management of obesity. These programs include frequent sessions (14 or
      more contacts in the first 6 months) focused on diet and physical activity and use a behavior
      change protocol. In Mexico most primary care clinics and public hospitals apply traditional
      treatments for obesity management, which have limited effect on weight loss. This study would
      provide scientific evidence for an effective model for obesity management. Objective. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the &quot;Group Lifestyle Balance
      Program&quot; for overweight and obesity management in adults, in primary care clinics and public
      hospitals from Sonora. This is a translational clinical study. Healthcare providers from the
      participating clinics will be trained with the Group Lifestyle Balance Program before its
      implementation. The primary outcome measurement is the change in body weight from baseline to
      6 months and 12 months. Changes in body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure, depression, quality of life and stress scales will be measured in
      patients receiving the program before and 6 and 12 months after starting the program.
      Additionally, biochemical parameters (fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol,
      HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment- Insulin
      Resistance (HOMA-IR) and liver enzymes [Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alanine
      Aminotransferase (ALT)] will be evaluated from baseline to 12 months.

    <description>Participants will be assigned to an adaptation of the &quot;Group Lifestyle Balance Program&quot;, a behavioral curriculum implemented in the Diabetes Prevention Program Study. The Group Lifestyle Balance Program will be provided weekly for the first 3.5 months, bi-weekly from 3.5 to 6 months and then monthly until 12 months. Health care providers will be trained for the implementation of the intervention.
Additionally, participants will attend at least one monthly visit with a nutritionist (individually).
The lifestyle objectives for participants will be as follows:
To lose 5-10% of initial weight through healthy eating.
To do 150 minutes of physical activity each week.</description>
