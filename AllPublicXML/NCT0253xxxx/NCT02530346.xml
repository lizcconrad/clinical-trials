  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help determine wether mechanical bowel preparation before a colostomy closure
      is necessary in pediatric population, in order to avoid surgery related complications
      (surgical site infection and anastomosis leakage).

      Half of the population will go through the mechanical bowel prep before colostomy closure and
      the other half won´t. Complications rate will be compared among both groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical bowel preparation is based on administering osmotic laxatives and enemas through
      the stomas, in order to diminish solid stool and bacterial load on the colon prior to a
      colostomy takedown. This was thought to decrease the surgery related complications.

      However mechanical bowel preparation can cause discomfort in patients as well as other
      complications like hydro electrolyte imbalance.

      Studies in adult population have shown that there is not a significant difference in the
      presence of surgery related complications in patients that received bowel prep and those who
      did not.

      There is not enough evidence in pediatric patients that this affirmation is also true.
