  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1b and Phase 2. Phase 1b will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the combination of idelallisib with the anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody BI
      836826 in participants with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL), and
      establish the maximum recommended Phase 2 combination dose (highRP2D) as well as an alternate
      lower recommended Phase 2 combination dose (lowRP2D). Phase 2 will determine the rates of
      complete response (CR) and of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity with the combination
      at the highRP2D and the lowRP2D in participants with R/R CLL.

      The Phase 2 portion of this study will not occur.
