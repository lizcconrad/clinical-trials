      This pilot phase I trial studies the safety of long-term use of sodium bicarbonate in
      patients with cancer. Sodium bicarbonate may neutralize tumor acidity and as a result may
      inhibit the spread of the tumor to other parts of the body (metastases) and improve survival.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if the dose concentration of 0.5 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate is feasible and
      well tolerated as measured by the proportion of subjects with first evidence of adherence
      failure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if the dose concentration of 0.5 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate is safe for long
      term consumption (90 days) as measured by blood pressure, resting pulse rate, and basic
      metabolic panels to assess metabolic alkalosis.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I (RUN-IN/ADJUSTMENT): Patients receive sodium bicarbonate orally (PO) dissolved in
      water thrice daily (TID) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-10. The dose may be adjusted as
      necessary.

      PHASE II (LONG TERM): Patients continue to receive sodium bicarbonate PO TID or BID for a
      total of 90 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any cancer patient enrolled in the study must have a written approval from their
             oncologist that a notation will be made in the patient's chart for their study
             participation

          -  Subject without known cognitive impairment, central nervous system (CNS) metastasis,
             overt psychosis, major depression, or delirium as noted in the oncology medical record

          -  Subject with a Karnofsky performance status scale of 80% or greater at time of consent

          -  Subject has completed initial adjuvant therapy and is not currently receiving or
             waiting to receive chemotherapy during the next 120 days

          -  Breast cancer subjects may be enrolled if they are receiving hormonal blockade therapy

          -  Subject is not enrolled in any other clinical trials

          -  Subject has a valid working phone number to be contacted with during the study

          -  Subject must be willing to provide urine specimen for pH measurements during scheduled
             clinical visits

          -  Subject must be willing to provide a 3 mL blood sample for metabolic panels during
             scheduled clinical visits

          -  Subject does not have uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure &gt; 140, diastolic
             pressure &gt; 90) despite maximal anti-hypertensive therapy

          -  Subject has healthy renal function: creatinine clearance: 88-128 mL/min; glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR): &gt; 90 mL/min/1.7m^2 based on standard care results no older than
             2 weeks; if no data exist, the subject will need to consent to a blood draw for a
             basic metabolic panel (which measures creatinine) for verification

          -  Subject must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines

          -  Subject is not pregnant or breastfeeding at time of consent; a pregnancy test will be
             conducted from urine sample on day of consent in premenopausal women

          -  Subject agrees to use medically approved contraception (ie. condoms, oral
             contraceptive) if premenopausal
