  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This the first report undertaken to assess the effect of supplementation with oral
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood
      pressure among people with mild hypertension. Overall, AC mycelia consumption for 8 weeks
      could successfully reduce mean diastolic and systolic BP through the suppression of PRA that
      is linked to downstream suppresion of angiotensin II formation, which further decreases the
      sympathetic outflow that leads to hypertension. In addition to blood pressure lowering
      properties, AC mycelia also has beneficial effect in reducing oxidative stress,
      significantly. No adverse events were noted, suggesting that AC mycelia deserve its
      consideration as a candidate for safe alternative treatment to conventional anti-hypertensive
      medications.

      This the first report undertaken to assess the effect of supplementation with oral
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood
      pressure among people with mild hypertension. Forty-one subjects with systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) between 130 and 179 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 85 and 109 mm
      Hg were randomized to receive either AC mycelia or starch placebo for 8 weeks, and had
      follow-up observation for an additional 2 weeks. SBP in the subjects given GABA, adenosine
      and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia significantly decreased compared to those who received the
      placebo (p&lt;0.05). DBP also decreased after the intake of AC mycelia. Compared to the placebo,
      AC mycelia significantly reduced plasma renin activity by a maximum of 25 % and 36 % on week
      8. This suppression suggested that AC mycelia is a potent inhibitor of renin, and its
      bioavailability is sufficient to produce BP reduction after a short term of oral
      administration. Neither adverse events nor abnormal laboratory findings were noted throughout
      the study period, suggesting that GABA, adenosine and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia
      significantly decreased borderline hypertension, which may support its consideration as a
      safe alternative treatment compared to conventional anti-hypertensive medications.

    <description>An 8 week double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled parallel study with 2 week follow-up period was performed in mild hypertension subjects. Consenting eligible subjects were receive three capsules per day containing either 420 mg of AC mycelia of similar appearance for 8 weeks. The subjects were required to visit at baseline, every two weeks during the intervention period (8 weeks), and at follow-up 2 weeks after treatment had ended. During each study visit, systolic and diastolic BPs were recorded, fasting blood samples were collected and anthropometric measurements were performed. Compliance was evaluated using a food diary and monitored with biweekly telephone calls.</description>
