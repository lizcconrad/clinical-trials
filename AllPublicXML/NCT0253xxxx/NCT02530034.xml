    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Hu8F4 that
      can be given to patients with advanced leukemia.

      This is the first study using Hu8F4 in humans.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of Hu8F4 based on when you join this study. Up to 5 dose levels of Hu8F4 will be
      tested. One (1)-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of Hu8F4 is found.

      Once the highest tolerable dose is found, additional participants will be enrolled so that at
      least 6 participants with each cancer type are enrolled. Additional 3 groups of 10
      participants each may be added for a specific leukemia type in &quot;expansion groups&quot; after the
      highest tolerable dose is found.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive the Hu8F4 by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 0, 7, 14, and 21 of each
      28-day cycle.

      Study Visits:

      Before you take the study drug you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration. To collect a
      bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and
      a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle.

      During Week 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If these tests have been
           performed within 3 days, they do not need to be repeated.

        -  If you can have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn before you receive the study drug for testing
           for the effects of Hu8F4 and to test for antibodies to Hu8F4. Antibodies are created by
           the immune system and may attack foreign cells or substances, such as the study drug.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing 7
           times over the 24 hours after the dose. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in
           the body at different time points.

      On Days 2-14 of Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing.

      During Weeks 2-4 of Cycle 1, blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to
      check for effects of Hu8F4, and to test for antibodies to Hu8F4.

      During Week 4 of Cycle 1, you will have bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of
      the disease.

      During Week 1 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If these tests have been
           performed within 3 days, they do not need to be repeated.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for the effects of Hu8F4 and for
           antibody testing.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn 7 times over the 24 hours after you
           receive the study drug for PK testing.

      During Weeks 2-4 of Cycles 2 and 3, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests. At Week 2 of Cycle 2, this blood will also be used to check for antibodies to Hu8F4.

      During Week 1 of Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If these tests have been
           performed within 3 days, they do not need to be repeated.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for the effects of Hu8F4.

      During Week 1 of Cycles 4 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check for the effects of Hu8F4.

      Every 2-4 weeks of Cycles 4 and beyond, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      Every 1-3 cycles, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Stud:y You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      End of treatment:

      Once you are no longer taking the study drug, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to
      test for antibodies to Hu8F4.

      This is an investigational study. Hu8F4 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study
      drug is designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
