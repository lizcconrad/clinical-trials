      This study is an open-trial study. Sixty subjects will be participated in it. The study will
      be explained to the subjects and they voluntarily agreed to participate in it. Their
      eligibility to participate in the study will be checked, and the patient will receive
      collagen or a placebo (normal saline) in the plantar facia through randomization. They will
      be asked to follow the guidelines of the investigators during the study and to visit the
      hospital seven times, including for screening and the date of re-injection. . At each visit,
      the subjects undergo a VAS, a clinical laboratory tests, and a physical exam to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Regenseal. (*Re-injection could be maximum 2times at visit2 and 3, one
      week apart based on the investigator's judgment after the initial injection. If the subject
      gets injection on the screening date, the total number of his or her visits will be six.)
