  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to first evaluate the effect of food on E7050's pharmacokinetic
      parameters following the administration of single 100 mg oral doses of E7050 tablet to each
      normal healthy participant in the study (Part A), and second to characterize E7050
      pharmacokinetics after single doses at 200 mg and 400 mg under fasted conditions (Part B).
      Part A will be a randomized, single-dose, open-label, three-treatment period crossover study.
      Part B is a nonrandomized, open-label, two-treatment sequential study design. Twelve
      participants in Treatment Period 1 will receive a single dose of 200 mg of E7050 under fasted
      conditions. Following review of safety data of the 200 mg dose level, an additional 12
      subjects will then receive a single dose of 400 mg of E7050 in Treatment Period 2.
