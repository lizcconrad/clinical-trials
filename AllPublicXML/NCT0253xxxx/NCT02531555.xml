      Background: Aim of this randomized controlled parallel-designed study was to evaluate the
      effects of diode laser as an adjunct to mechanical periodontal treatment on clinical
      parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) volume of the residual pockets diagnosed
      following initial periodontal treatment in chronic periodontitis (CP) patients.

      Methods: A total of 84 residual pockets on single-rooted teeth in 11 CP patients were
      included and randomly assigned into 3 groups. Residual pockets were treated either only by
      mechanical treatment (Group M) (n=28), only by diode laser disinfection (Group L) (n=28) or
      by combination of these techniques (Group M+L) (n=28). Plaque index, gingival index (GI),
      bleeding on probing (BoP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level and gingival
      recession were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks after treatment of residual pockets. GCF
      samples were collected at baseline, 1 and 8 weeks after treatment.

    <description>Pocket disinfection with diode laser (Group L): Subgingival irradiation with a GaAlAs diode laser (CHEESE®, Gigaa Laser, China) was applied to residual pockets each for 20 sec in continious mode. The diode laser had a wavelenght of 810 nm and power output of 1 W for subgingival irradiation (Maximum output power of device was 7 W). Diode laser application was performed parallel to root surface by a 200 µm fiber tip inserted at the bottom of periodontal pocket and slowly moved from apical to coronal direction in a sweeping motion without local anesthesia.</description>
