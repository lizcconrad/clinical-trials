    <textblock>
      Studies suggest that patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for cognitive decline and
      long-term cognitive dysfunction. To address this issue, a randomized controlled intervention
      trial on the effect of physical exercise on cognition is conducted. In addition, the impact
      on psychological and physical health outcomes is evaluated. Results may benefit patients who
      suffer from disease- or treatment-associated cognitive change.

      Studies suggest that patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for cognitive decline and
      long-term cognitive dysfunction. To address this issue, a randomized controlled intervention
      trial on the effect of physical exercise on cognition is conducted. In addition, the impact
      on psychological and physical health outcomes such as depression, fatigue, health-related
      quality of life and physical fitness is evaluated. A healthy control group matched to the
      patients on age, gender, and education will be included to both control for practice effects
      on neuropsychological measures and allow additional comparisons on self-report measures. The
      healthy control group will undergo neuropsychological testing and questionnaire survey at
      baseline and 4 months. Demographic data will be collected from all study participants at
      baseline. Medical data will be collected from patients at all time points. Results may
      benefit patients who suffer from disease- or treatment-associated cognitive change.
