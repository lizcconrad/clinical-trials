  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label trial of mouse allergenic extract administered by subcutaneous
      injection in adults with asthma and mouse sensitivity. The study is designed to evaluate:

        -  the safety of this therapy when given by injection

        -  biomarkers of the immune response and

        -  whether the therapy would be effective in treating allergic asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess if treatment with mouse subcutaneous
      immunotherapy (SCIT), using the per protocol allergenic extract doses, is safe. This will be
      done by determining the rate of related adverse events and serious adverse events in the
      course of treatment.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  determination of whether a 24 week treatment with mouse SCIT, using the per protocol
           allergenic extract doses, will induce a 3-fold increase in mouse-specific serum
           immunoglobulin E (IgE)

        -  determination of whether a 24 week treatment with mouse SCIT, using the per protocol
           allergenic extract doses, will induce changes in the serum levels of mouse-specific
           immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin subclass 4 (IgG4).

    <measure>Change in Mouse-Specific IgE Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-Treatment) through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody produced by the immune system. If a participant has an allergy, the immune system will respond to that particular allergen by producing IgE antibodies. These antibodies travel to cells that release chemicals, causing allergic reactions.
This endpoint/outcome is the ratio of geometric means for baseline mouse-specific serum IgE versus post-baseline mouse-specific serum IgE. The numerator is the geometric mean post-baseline IgE and the denominator is baseline IgE. A ratio of greater than 1 would indicate an increase in IgE throughout the course of the study.</description>

    <description>Serum Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is an antibody produced by the immune system. If a participant has bacterial or viral infections, the immune system will respond to that particular infection by producing IgG antibodies.
This endpoint/outcome is the ratio of geometric means for baseline mouse-specific serum IgG versus post-baseline mouse-specific serum IgG. The numerator is the geometric mean post-baseline IgG and, the denominator is the baseline IgG. A ratio of greater than 1 would indicate an increase in IgG throughout the course of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mouse-Specific IgG4 Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-Treatment) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Serum Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) is a subtype of antibody produced by the immune system. If a participant has bacterial or viral infections, the immune system will respond to that particular infection by producing IgG4 antibodies.
This endpoint/outcome is the ratio of geometric means for baseline mouse-specific serum IgG4 versus post-baseline mouse-specific serum IgG4. The numerator is the geometric mean post-baseline IgG4 and, the denominator is the baseline IgG4. A ratio of greater than 1 would indicate an increase in IgG4 antibodies throughout the course of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in In-vitro Mouse Antigen Binding to B-cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-Treatment) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The plan was to analyze serum from cockroach subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)-treated participants to determine if treatment inhibits in-vitro mouse antigen binding to B-cells after 6-months of treatment with mouse SCIT, using the per protocol allergenic extract doses. However, the Sponsor cancelled pursuit of mouse immunotherapy within its program at this time due to assay development complexities and cost; thus, there are no analyses/results for this endpoint/outcome.</description>

          <description>Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody produced by the immune system. If a participant has an allergy, the immune system will respond to that particular allergen by producing antibodies called IgE. These antibodies travel to cells that release chemicals, which cause allergic reactions. We collect mouse-specific serum IgE at baseline and compare with post-baseline IgE in order to determine immune modulation over time. The higher the IgE present in the serum sample, the more likely there is to be a presence of a clinical allergy to the mouse allergen.</description>

        <title>Change in Mouse-Specific IgE Antibodies</title>
        <description>Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody produced by the immune system. If a participant has an allergy, the immune system will respond to that particular allergen by producing IgE antibodies. These antibodies travel to cells that release chemicals, causing allergic reactions.
This endpoint/outcome is the ratio of geometric means for baseline mouse-specific serum IgE versus post-baseline mouse-specific serum IgE. The numerator is the geometric mean post-baseline IgE and the denominator is baseline IgE. A ratio of greater than 1 would indicate an increase in IgE throughout the course of the study.</description>

          <title>Change in Mouse-Specific IgE Antibodies</title>
          <description>Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody produced by the immune system. If a participant has an allergy, the immune system will respond to that particular allergen by producing IgE antibodies. These antibodies travel to cells that release chemicals, causing allergic reactions.
This endpoint/outcome is the ratio of geometric means for baseline mouse-specific serum IgE versus post-baseline mouse-specific serum IgE. The numerator is the geometric mean post-baseline IgE and the denominator is baseline IgE. A ratio of greater than 1 would indicate an increase in IgE throughout the course of the study.</description>
