      maintaining weight loss.

      The study will evaluate the effectiveness of financial incentives in improving maintenance of
      weight loss. The investigators propose a 2-arm randomized controlled trial in which 258
      participants who lose at least 5 kgs in a weight loss program will be randomized to one of
      the following: 1) daily weigh-ins and weekly feedback, 2) daily weigh-ins,weekly feedback,
      and a weekly escalating lottery-based financial incentive.

      Study participants will be obese volunteers recruited from a major community-based weight
      loss program (Weight Watchers), who have lost at least 5kg during the 4-6 months prior to
      enrolling in the study. Upon enrollment, these participants will have an active online
      membership with Weight Watchers. Among these participants, the following will be assessed: 1.
      Assess the effectiveness of escalating lottery rewards, relative to the control group, on
      maintenance of weight loss over the ensuing 6 months (Phase I); 2.The degree to which weight
      loss is maintained in the intervention group relative to usual care during the 6 months
      following the cessation of the interventions (Phase II).

      During Phase I, incentives will be provided to some study participants (escalating lottery
      arm) for the first 6 months and participants will be followed for 6 more months to examine
      effects following cessation of incentives.

    <description>Participants will receive weekly tips and weekly feedback for months 1-6 and will be observed without intervention in Phase II (months 7-12). The weekly feedback will pertain to whether or not the participant met his/her goal of weighing at least 6/7 days. The weekly tips will give information and suggestions on how to make it easier to weigh-in most days of the week. No financial incentive other than for the midpoint and end of study surveys will be given.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive weekly tips and weekly feedback for months 1-6 and will be observed without intervention in Phase II (months 7-12). The weekly feedback will pertain to whether or not the participant met his/her goal of weighing at least 6/7 days. The weekly tips will give information and suggestions on how to make it easier to weigh-in most days of the week. In addition to the incentives for midpoint and end of study surveys, participants who meet their weekly goal (weighing in 6 of 7 days) will be eligible for the weekly lottery during the first 6 months of the study. The expected weekly winning for the lottery is $3.55 in week 1 and this expected value will increase by $0.43 per week for each week the participant achieves their goal of weighing 6/7 days. All incentive earnings will be paid out on a monthly basis.</description>
