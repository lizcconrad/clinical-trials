      Peanut skins, a by-product of peanut processing industry, is usually discarded as a waste in
      despite of the high content of phenolic compounds. Polyphenol extract from peanut skins has
      been demonstrated to inhibit α-amylase activity in vitro. Hence, the aim of this study was to
      evaluate the regulatory effects of the peanut skin extract on blood glucose and body fat by a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study. Subjects with simple obesity (body mass
      index [BMI] ≥ 27 or body fat ≥ 30%) ingested 4 Sugarlock® (n = 16) capsules or placebo (n =
      14) a day for a total of 6 weeks. Anthropometric measurements (body weight, body fat, blood
      pressure) and blood biochemical markers including fasting blood glucose (FBG), albumin, total
      cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen
      (BUN), AST, ALT were examined every three weeks. Also, 5 subjects were randomly selected for
      MRI scans to examine the distribution and thickness of abdominal fat layers before and after
      the trial.

    <description>Subjects ingested 2 capsules (Experimental group) in the morning and 2 capsules in the evening (4 capsules/d) for a total of 6 weeks. Anthropometric measurements such as body weight, body fat, waistline, hipline, blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) and blood biochemical parameters including FBG, albumin, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, Cr, BUN, AST and ALT were measured every three weeks. Five subjects were randomly selected to take MRI abdominal scans before and after the trial. After 6-week consumption, anthropometric measurements were examined on week 8 for a follow-up observation.</description>
