      Concentrations and effects of anti-infectives in critically ill children are unpredictable
      and the risk of under-exposure may be associated with poor clinical outcomes. In addition,
      between-subject variability (BSV) is known to be substantial in critically ill children.
      Rationalisation of anti-infectives in children is therefore desirable.

      The investigators aim to investigate, using a population approach, the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of anti-infectives including PK/PD targets (fT(%) &gt; minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC)) and PD endpoints (clinical outcomes) in critically ill
      children. Covariates The effects of covariates on anti-infectives PK and PK/PDs are
      investigated in order to better explain the BSV and to ultimately suggest individualized
      dosage regimens.

      It will be a prospective PK study including 11 anti-infectives antibiotics. Six blood samples
      were taken from each patient during dosing interval. The primary PK/ PD targets were
      anti-infectives concentrations above the MIC of the pathogen at both 50% (50% f T&gt;MIC) and
      100% (100% f T&gt;MIC) of the dosing interval. The investigators used skewed logistic regression
      to describe the effect of anti-infectives exposure on patient outcome.

      Background and aims of the study:

      Recent studies have suggested a risk of under-exposure to anti-infectives in critically ill
      adults. This under-exposure may be associated with poor clinical outcomes as well as a delay
      or incomplete clinical resolution of infection; The dosing regimen of anti-infectives in
      critically ill children is usually based on weight (i.e. mg per Kg). However, between-subject
      variability is known to be substantial in children and even more so in critical illness; As a
      result, concentrations and effects of anti-infectives are unpredictable and the risk of
      under- or over-exposure is thus genuine and considerable. Rationalisation of anti-infectives
      in children is therefore desirable.

      The purpose of the present study is to investigate, using a population approach, the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of intravenous anti-infectives including
      usual PK/PD targets (fT(%) &gt; minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)) and PD endpoints
      (clinical outcomes) in critically ill children. The effects of developmental and other
      factors related to critical illness on anti-infectives PK and PK/PDs are investigated in
      order to better explain the observed between-subject variabilities and to ultimately suggest
      individualized dosage regimens.

      This prospective study will be conducted in six paediatric services of Public Hospitals in
      Paris, France

      Intervention:

      Patient selection will take place in the 6 paediatric services. The senior physician proposes
      the study to holders of parental authority whose child receives or will receive
      anti-infectives during its follow-up or hospitalization.

      The senior physician will give a briefing note to the holders of parental authority, and if
      the child is able to understand the information. The non-oral opposition for the retrieval
      and analysis of data will be collected.

      No intervention or no charge will be made for this study.
