    <measure>Number of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug administration up to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs will be defined as the adverse events (AEs) that occur between first dose of study drug administration up to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with TEAEs according to severity</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug administration up to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of TEAEs will be graded using National cancer institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v 4.03) definitions of Grade 1 through Grade 5 following his/her best medical judgment. The severity of the AEs will be classified as follows: Grade 1 or mild, Grade 2 or moderate, Grade 3 or severe, Grade 4 or life-threatening and Grade 5 or death.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>screening up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical laboratory parameters being monitored for safety will be summarized using descriptive statistics, by postdose shifts relative to Baseline for relevant parameters using relevant cut-offs. Clinical significance will be determined by investigator.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with clinically significant abnormal vital signs: blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate</measure>
    <time_frame>screening up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Observed values and changes from Baseline in vital signs will be summarized for each treatment group using descriptive statistics. Clinically noteworthy changes in vital signs will be listed and summarized as appropriate. A semi-automated blood pressure and pulse rate recording device with an appropriate cuff size will be utilized. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after 10 minutes' rest in the semi-supine position with the subject's arm unconstrained by clothing or other material. The blood pressure should be assessed on the same arm for each subject throughout the trial. Clinical significance will be determined by investigator.</description>
