                  testing are required at screening for all patients with a positive medical
                  history based on risk factors and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection. See

             potential who are not using effective birth control methods. If barrier contraceptives
             are being used, these must be continued throughout the trial by both sexes. Hormonal
             contraceptives are not acceptable as a sole method of contraception. (Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to administration of Everolimus)
