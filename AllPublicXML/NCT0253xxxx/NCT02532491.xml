    <textblock>
      This study compares the efficacy and effectiveness of two of the second-generation
      antipsychotics (SGAs) most used in our society in the treatment of schizophrenia
      (Aripiprazole and Risperidone) and the investigators do within an assistance program of
      early-stage psychosis individuals of the Community of Cantabria, clinical reference for the
      treatment of this disease in the Spanish Autonomous Community. Patients are included in a
      prospective naturalistic study, open flexible-doses and randomized into one of two possible
      patterns of treatment that includes the protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present there is no evidence of which antipsychotic treatment would be the choice for
      treating the appearance of a non-affective psychotic disorder. There are a number of
      second-generation antipsychotic drugs that have proven effective in controlling positive
      symptoms of the disease but carry a number of variable side effects so there is no evidence
      on the treatment of choice in the market. Few studies try to assess the adhesion of a first
      episode of psychosis as prolonged treatment in time. Thus the development of experimental
      studies comparing the effectiveness of such treatments in clinical practice is of high
      interest for clinical psychiatrists.

      Study setting and financial support: data for the present investigation are being obtained
      from an ongoing epidemiological and three-year longitudinal intervention program of
      first-episode psychosis (PAFIP) conducted at the outpatient clinic and the inpatient unit at
      the University Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla, Spain. Conforming to international standards
      for research ethics, this program was approved by the local institutional review board.
      Patients meeting inclusion criteria and their families provide written informed consent to be
      included in the PAFIP. The Mental Health Services of Cantabria provided funding for
      implementing the program. None pharmaceutical company supplied any financial support to it.

      Study design: this is a flexible-dose study of two neuroleptics (Aripiprazole and
      Risperidone) assigned at aleatory ratio 1:1. Rapid titration schedule (5-day), until optimal
      dose is reached, is a rule used unless severe side effects occur. At the treating physician's
      discretion, the dose and type of antipsychotic medication could be changed based on clinical
      efficacy and the profile of side effects during the follow-up period. Antimuscarinic
      medication, Lormetazepam and Clonazepam are allowed for clinical reasons. No antimuscarinic
      agents are administered prophylactically. Antidepressants (Sertraline) and mood stabilizers
      (lithium) are permitted if clinically needed.

      Clinical assessment: the severity scale of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, the
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive symptoms
      (SAPS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative symptoms (SANS) are used to evaluate
      symptomatology. To assess general adverse event experiences the Scale of the Udvalg for
      Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU), the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SARS) and the Barnes Akathisia
      Scale (BAS) are used. The same trained psychiatrist (BC-F) completed all clinical
      assessments.

    <measure>Effectiveness of Aripiprazole and Risperidone at long term as measured by Percentage of discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of discontinuation of the initially assigned treatment: patients who completed the 1 year follow-up assessment and changed initial antipsychotic. Four reasons for the discontinuation were recorded: 1.- insufficient efficacy; 2.- marked side-effects; 3.- patient reported non-adherence and 4.- other causes. If more than one reason for discontinuation was present, the most important reason according to the above ranking was selected. Antipsychotic treatment data (doses, discontinuation and concomitant medications) were registered every 3 months. Insufficient efficacy was established at the treating physician's judgment only after at least three weeks of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in general psychopathology measured by BPRS at medium and long term</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by BPRS. The patients were defined as responders to the optimum dose of antipsychotic at 6 weeks if a &gt;40% reduction of the BPRS scores at intake and had a CGI severity score of ≤ 4. In addition, investigators also explored to rate of responders if a cutoff of ≥ 50% reduction of the BPRS total scores at intake was used.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Remission rate at long term</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Remission was defined according to Andreasen et al. (2005) criteria covering BPRS and SANS scores: 1.- a score of mild or less (≤3) on six predefined BPRS symptom items: grandiosity, suspiciousness, unusual thought content, hallucinations, conceptual disorganization and mannerisms; and 2.- SANS items scores of ≤2 simultaneously in all items. These criteria are required to be maintained for at least 6 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse rate at long term</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Among patients who achieved clinical improvement and stability (CGI rating ≤ 4 and a decrease of at least 30% on BPRS total score and all BPRS key symptom items, by being rated ≤ 3 for more than 4 consecutive weeks at some point during the first 6 months following program entry), relapse was defined as any of the following criteria that occurred during follow-up: 1 - a rating of either 5 or above on any key BPRS symptom items, 2 - CGI rating of ≥ 6 and a change score of CGI of &quot;much worse&quot; or &quot;very much worse&quot;, 3 - hospitalization for psychotic psychopathology, or 4 - completed suicide. The key BPRS symptoms were unusual thought content, hallucinations, suspiciousness, conceptual disorganization and bizarre behaviour. Exacerbation was defined as any 2-point increase of any of the key BPRS symptoms, excluding changes in which the rating remained at the non-psychotic level (i.e., &lt;3).</description>
