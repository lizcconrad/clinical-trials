    <textblock>
      This study is designed to answer whether minimal invasive vessel clotting (angioembolization)
      or open surgery (retroperitoneal packing) is more effective for pelvic fractures with massive
      bleeding. Patients admitted at daytime (7am-5pm) are treated with angioembolization while
      patients admitted at nighttime (5pm to 7am) are treated with open surgery.

    <textblock>
      In patients with pelvic fracture uncontrollable bleeding is the major cause of death within
      the first 24h after injury. Early hemorrhage control is therefore vital for successful
      treatment. Nowadays, recommended techniques for hemorrhage control in pelvic fractures are
      retroperitoneal pelvic packing and angioembolization, dependent upon the available technical
      staff and resources and the condition of the patient.

      Retroperitoneal pelvic packing, on the one hand, is a relatively simple method in controlling
      pelvic hemorrhage even with limited resources. Since 89% of pelvic fracture hemorrhage
      originates from venous bleeding, fracture stabilization and compressive hemostasis by packing
      is a reasonable approach. Angioembolization, on the other hand, has great high effectiveness
      with regard to bleeding control, but requires an angiography suite and technical staff. Since
      hemostasis of retroperitoneal venous bleeding often can be achieved by external pelvic
      fixation, angioembolization is required for the 11% arterial bleedings which are hard to
      control by packing. Even though many authors see both methods as complements, time is crucial
      in the multitrauma setting and the severely injured patient does not tolerate multiple
      interventions well. Until now good predictors for treatment choice are unavailable, and
      management of hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures remains a matter of debate.

      This study was designed to answer following questions:

        -  Is retroperitoneal pelvic packing or angiography superior with regard to in-hospital
           mortality, complications, required secondary procedures, or post-intervention blood
           loss?

        -  Which of these methods is the more rapid intervention in the acute setting?
