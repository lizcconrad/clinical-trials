      Question: Can atrial fibrillation (AF) cases in patients ≥ 65 years be easily detected in a
      primary healthcare environment using a smartphone device and iECG application as an
      opportunistic screening tool?

      Objectives:

      Detection of AF through cardiac rhythm abnormalities in patients ≥65 years old in an
      opportunistic screening program using a smartphone device/application

        1. Define the predictable value of the smartphone device with electrocardiogram (ECG)
           confirmation to detect AF in patients 65 years and older

        2. Correlate screened patients cardiovascular risk profile and those that register cardiac
           rhythm irregularities for a better description of the general characteristics of
           Colombian population
