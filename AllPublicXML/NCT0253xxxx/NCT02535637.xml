  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect maternal obesity and breastfeeding play on
      infant body composition. The investigators hypothesize in the first 6 months of life breast
      fed offspring from overweight / obese mothers will be fatter with greater trunk fat mass and
      accumulate fat at a greater rate than breast fed infants from normal weight mothers.
      Furthermore, the investigators postulate that circulating maternal milk adipocytokines will
      positively correlate to total fat mass at six months of age.

      The objective of this study is to determine if offspring from overweight/obese non-diabetic
      mothers whom breastfeed have greater total fat and trunk fat mass and accumulate fat mass at
      a greater rate from ~ 1 month to 6 months of life compared to breastfed infants from normal
      weight mothers.

      Specific Aim 1: Understand how maternal obesity and breast-feeding impact body composition of
      the offspring. Based upon the investigators preliminary data and counter to accepted dogma
      the hypothesis is at six months of age total fat mass, particularly in the trunk will be
      elevated at 6 months of age in infants whose mother was either overweight or obese vs.
      infants from normal weight mothers.

      Specific Aim 2: Identify adipocytokines in breast milk. The postulate is breast milk from
      overweight and obese mothers will have greater levels of insulin, glucose, Ghrelin, IGF-1,
      IL-6, TNFα, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lower Leptin levels than breast milk
      from normal weight mothers and will be correlated with offspring fat mass.

        A total of 37 mothers whom exclusively breast fed to six-months. Participants
        (mothers/infant) included offspring from mothers with a singleton-term healthy pregnancy
        (37-40 weeks). Both vaginal and cesarean deliveries were included. Infants who are
        exclusively breastfed (defined as no formula in the last 20 days) prior to enrollment will
        be considered.
