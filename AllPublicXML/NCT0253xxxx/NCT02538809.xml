  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is a well-recognized complication in spinal cord injury (SCI) individuals. The
      observed incidence rates in SCI individuals are considerably higher compared to the general
      population. Bladder cancer in SCI individuals tends to present at an earlier age compared to
      the general population. Furthermore, bladder cancer in SCI individuals is more commonly
      invasive and at a more advanced stage at the time of diagnosis compared to bladder cancer in
      the general population. Individuals with bladder cancer commonly present with hematuria and
      other urinary symptoms. The gold standard for diagnosis is cystoscopy. However in SCI
      individuals, hematuria may get attributed to catheter irritation or trauma or an urinary
      tract infection. Furthermore, the bladder wall commonly presents with various changes under
      cystoscopic examination masking the presence of a bladder wall mass. Thus, diagnosis of
      bladder cancer in SCI individuals can be complicate.

      There is a novel test available (GeneXpert® Bladder Cancer Detection, Cepheid International,
      Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for the measurement of mRNA bladder tumor markers in the urine. The
      diagnostic accuracy of this test has been investigated in non-SCI individuals with symptoms
      suspicious for bladder cancer. The test showed high sensitivity and specificity values and is
      thus a promising diagnostic or screening tool.. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test
      has not yet been investigated in SCI individuals.

      The primary objective of the proposed study is to investigate whether urine mRNA tumor marker
      levels in spinal cord injury individuals with symptoms and findings suspicious for bladder
      cancer are a discriminator between individuals suffering from bladder cancer and those not
      suffering from cancer.

      Individuals presenting with symptoms suspicious of bladder cancer will undergo ultrasonic and
      cystoscopic examination of the bladder. An urine sample will be taken, and the bladder will
      be flushed for collecting a bladder fluid sample. In patients with bladder wall findings
      suspicious of cancer, a bladder wall biopsy will be taken, according to clinical standard
      practice. The bladder fluid and the bladder wall biopsy will be submitted for cytology and
      histopathology examination, respectively. Tumor mRNA levels will be measured in the urine
      sample.
