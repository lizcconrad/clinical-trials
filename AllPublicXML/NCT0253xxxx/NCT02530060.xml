    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      rilpivirine/Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (RPV/TFV/FTC) after a single-oral administration of
      Complera (the fixed-dose combination of RPV, FTC, Tenefovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]) to
      healthy Japanese adult male participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, single oral dose study in healthy Japanese adult male
      participants. The study consists of 3 phases; a screening phase up to 27 days (Day -28 to Day
      -2), an in-patient phase from Day -1 to Day 3 (dosing day is Day 1), and a follow-up
      assessment phase from Day 4 to the last follow-up assessment scheduled on Day 15 or at the
      time of early withdrawal. All participants will receive a single oral dose of one Complera
      tablet on Day 1 within 5 minutes after completion of the standardized breakfast.
      Pharmacokinetics of RPV/TFV/FTC will be assessed as the primary objective of the study.
      Safety of each participant will be assessed throughout the study.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
