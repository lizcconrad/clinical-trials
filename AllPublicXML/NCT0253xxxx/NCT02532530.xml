  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute brain syndrome characterized by a disturbance in consciousness
      accompanied by periods of inattention and changes in cognition. Memory impairment, irrelevant
      speech and disorientation are commonly observed signs and symptoms. Episodes of delirium have
      been associated with a prolonged hospital stay, functional and cognitive dysfunction and even
      an increased mortality. Delirium is a common complication in the postoperative setting where
      the incidence increases with the risk of surgery. The estimated incidence of postoperative
      delirium after cardiovascular surgery is remarkable, ranging from 31% up to 51%. Diverse
      preoperative risk factors have been documented for patients undergoing cardiac surgery: age,
      pre-existing cognitive dysfunction, a history of alcohol abuse and the severity of illness at
      admission.

      An early diagnosis of postoperative delirium is of great importance to prevent long-term
      cognitive impairment. For this purpose, a highly specific diagnostic monitoring tool should
      be implemented during perioperative cardiac surgery care. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
      provides information on brain oxygenation by quantifying the regional cerebral oxygen
      saturation (SctO2) at the microvascular level. Recently, two studies showed that preoperative
      cerebral tissue oxygenation was lower in the cohort of patients that developed delirium
      postoperatively. Nevertheless, these studies did not investigate whether the onset of
      postoperative delirium coincided with a change of postoperative SctO2. A relationship between
      delirium and reduced cerebral blood flow has already been suggested. As such, the occurrence
      of a postoperative decrease of SctO2 might have been overlooked thus far. Hence,
      Investigators want to conduct a prospective, interventional study to determine the
      relationship between postoperative SctO2 and the onset of delirium after cardiac surgery.

    <description>Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique that uses near infrared light between 700 and 1100nm which penetrates several centimeters through skin and bone structures. Light is absorbed by chromophores. There are multiple chromophores which can be detected in the NIR spectrum such as water, lipids, melanin, myoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Each chromophore has a specific absorption spectrum. By using different wavelengths, it is possible to differentiate chromophores. The difference between oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin can be calculated using the modified Beer-Lambert law, resulting in a numeric value which is a representation of the regional cerebral oxygen saturation.</description>
