    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing Surveillance study to observe INLYTA® treatment dosing pattern,
      safety and effectiveness in Taiwan real world routine practice. The primary objective of this
      registry is to monitor the dose adjustment of INLYTA® in real world routine practice. The
      secondary objectives include safety profile, objective response rate, and progression-free
      rate in real world routine practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center chart review registry on mRCC patients treated with axitinib. Primary
      objective is the dose adjustment. Secondary objectives are safety profile, objective response
      rate and progression free survival. Efficacy assessment will be based on investigators'
      judgment. Patients treated with 1st dose of axitinib between May 7, 2013 and June 30, 2015
      will be enrolled. The follow-up time is 12 months. Prior therapies should include sunitinib
      or interferon alpha.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of axitinib treatment until PD or death from any cause (up to 40 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target, non-target lesions and all lymph nodes decreased to non-pathological in size (less than [&lt;]10 millimeter [mm] short axis). PR was defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, without progression of non-target lesions, no appearance of new lesions. Progression of disease (PD) was defined as greater than equal to (&gt;=) 20% increase in sum of diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study) or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Response evaluation was based on investigators' judgment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of axitinib treatment until PD or death from any cause (up to 40 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined as time from first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), that was subsequently confirmed, to the first documentation of PD or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first as per RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target, non-target lesions and all lymph nodes decreased to non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, without progression of non-target lesions, no appearance of new lesions. PD was defined as &gt;=20% increase in sum of diameters of the target lesions taking as a reference smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study) or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of axitinib treatment until PD or death from any cause (up to 40 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time duration in months from start of study treatment to the first documentation of PD or to death due to any cause, whichever occured first. PD was assessed by RECIST version 1.1. and defined as &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study) or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Progression free survival based on investigators' judgment on medical records was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of axitinib treatment up to end of the study (up to 40 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life- threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non--serious events.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of axitinib treatment up to end of the study (up to 40 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Severity of the AEs was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Grade 1= mild; Grade 2= moderate; Grade 3= severe; Grade 4= life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5= death related to AE.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target, non-target lesions and all lymph nodes decreased to non-pathological in size (less than [&lt;]10 millimeter [mm] short axis). PR was defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, without progression of non-target lesions, no appearance of new lesions. Progression of disease (PD) was defined as greater than equal to (&gt;=) 20% increase in sum of diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study) or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Response evaluation was based on investigators' judgment.</description>
