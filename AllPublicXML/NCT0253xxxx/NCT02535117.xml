  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common and the third leading cause of death
      from cancer worldwide1 . Hepatectomy is still the main effective treatment for HCC
      accompanying with well-preserved cirrhosis when liver transplantation is not feasible due to
      the lack of donors Recurrence of tumor within the liver remnant is also common, with a
      reported 5-year recurrence rate of 50-70%, in patients who have undergone &quot;curative&quot;
      hepatectomy. Management of recurrent HCC is still urgent and several treatments have been
      developed. Repeat hepatectomy is considered to be the first choice for recurrent HCC with a
      5-year survival rate of 19.4 to 56%. Unfortunately, repeat hepatectomy can be performed only
      in a small proportion of patients with HCC recurrence due to the poor functional liver
      reserve or because of widespread recurrence. With a 3-year survival rate of 62% to 68% after
      treatment, radiofreqency ablation (RFA) has been used as an effective treatment for recurrent
      HCC. The efficacy of RFA for recurrent HCC has been reported to be comparable to those
      achieved by surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was considered not to be a suitable treatment for
      recurrent HCC due to postoperative adhesions that can make laparoscopic surgical procedure
      more difficult and less safe. Recently, several studies reported that laparoscopic surgery
      for recurrent HCC in cirrhotic patients is a safe and feasible procedure with good short-term
      outcomes. By far, no study has been performed to compare the efficacy and safety of
      laparoscopic surgery with RFA for treatment of recurrent HCC.

    <description>For LS, the patient was usually placed in the lithotomy position. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained at a pressure between 12 and 14 mmHg. Three to 4 working ports sized between 5 mm and 12 mm were used . Intra-operative ultrasonography was performed routinely. Parenchymal transection was performed using a Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA, Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA). Large bile duct branches or vessels were clipped before division and minor hemostasis was carried out using bipolar diathermy. Large hepatic vein branches were divided by endovascular staplers. A 1.0-cm safety margin was planed to get during the liver resection.</description>

    <description>RFA was performed according to the Guidelines of Radiofrequency Ablation Therapy for Liver Cancer: Chinese Expert Consensus Statement issued by the Chinese Society of Liver Cancer and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology RFA was performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. RFA was performed by using a commercially available Cool-tipTM RFA system (Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA), or a RF 2000 system (Radio-Therapeutics Mountain View, CA). Grounding was achieved by attaching 2 pads to the patient's back or legs.</description>
