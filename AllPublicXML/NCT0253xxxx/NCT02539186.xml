      The platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a new and potential treatment for patients with kinds of
      musculoskeletal disorders. Although few studies have showed beneficial effect of PRP for
      regeneration of peripheral neuropathy in animal study, the associated study in human is rare.

      The platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a new and potential treatment for patients with kinds of
      musculoskeletal disorders. Although few studies have showed beneficial effect of PRP for
      regeneration of peripheral neuropathy in animal study, the associated study in human is rare.
      We performe a prospective study to investigate the effect of PRP in patients with carpal
      tunnel syndrome.

      Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were randomized into intervention and control
      group. Participants in intervention group received sono-guided injection with 3cc PRP and
      control group received night splint. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on
      the 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24 week after the treatment.
