  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysms of the thoracic ascending aorta are a serious pathology which may threatens life by
      rupture or dissection. Their incidence is estimated at 10.4 per 100,000 people. At present,
      the only parameter for assessing the risk of complication is the maximum diameter of the
      aneurysm. The only way to avoid a complication is a surgical replacement of the aneurysmal
      aorta by a prosthetic tube. This procedure is performed by sternotomy and with extracorporeal
      circulation and its death rate ranges between 3% and 5%. Surgical repair is indicated when
      the diameter of the aneurysm exceeds 5.5 cm for degenerative atheromatous aneurysms or 5 cm
      in a patient with genetic disorder of connective tissue (Marfan disease or Ehlers-Danlos
      syndrome). However, there are aneurysms with diameter greater than the surgical threshold
      which remain stable. Conversely, complications have been described for aneurysms less than
      4.5 cm in diameter. The criterion of diameter appears therefore as inadequate to assess the
      risk of complication of an aneurysm of the ascending aorta.Multiple methods have been
      described in the literature. One of them relies on in vitro mechanical testing on healthy or
      aneurysmal tissue. Another method is the vivo analysis from imaging (CT, MRI or ultrasound).
      So far, no algorithm is robust enough for predicting the risk of complication better than the
      universally used criterion of diameter.

      The pathophysiology of these aneurysms has also been explored from histological studies. The
      investigators know that the microstructure of the aortic wall of an aneurysm is deteriorated
      with a degradation of elastin fibers and collagen that determine to a large extent its
      biomechanical behavior. Histological analysis appears inseparable from biomechanical
      analysis.

    <description>The index of risk of rupture is a composite measure :
an in vivo study of biomechanical behavior of aneurysmal aorta from preoperative dynamic imaging (dynamic CT-scan and 4D-MRI). It will determine the maximum stress borne by the aortic wall and its physiological elasticity.
an in vitro study with mechanical inflation testing of aneurysmal aortic tissue harvested during surgery. These tests will be conducted up to rupture and will bring results on the elasticity of the aortic wall of the aneurysm and its mode of failure.
finally, a histological analysis, with measurement of elastin and collagen content.
The physiological elasticity is measured from MRI</description>
