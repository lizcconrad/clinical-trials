    <textblock>
      This study analyzes the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of nitrous oxide 70% combined
      with basic analgetics compared to nitrous oxide 70% with fentanyl intranasal for
      analgosedation for short and painful procedures in children.

    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide 70% (N20 70%) combined with 30% oxygen meets many criteria of an ideal pain
      medication for procedural analgosedation in children. At the emergency department of the
      Children's Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland, N20 70% is regularly used for short and painful
      orthopaedic procedures, mostly for reduction of dislocated forearm or finger fractures. The
      analgesic efficacy of N20 70% still remains controversial. Therefore, all children who are
      eligible for N20 70% receive additionally either fentanyl or placebo intranasal and then
      their behavior, level of sedation and adverse events are measured during the painful
      procedure. The hypothesis is that a combination of N20 70% and fentanyl intranasal is not
      significant better than N20 70% combined with basic analgetics.
