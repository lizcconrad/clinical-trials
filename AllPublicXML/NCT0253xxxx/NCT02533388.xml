  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients have an increased risk of stress responses during extubation after general
      anaesthesia for an elective supratentorial craniotomy. How to decrease the stress responses
      during extubation after general anaesthesia remains challenging for the anaesthesiologist. In
      this study, we aimed to investigate whether transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation
      (TEAS) might decrease the stress responses and improve the quality of recovery in the elderly
      patients who underwent elective supratentorial craniotomy under general anaesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 elderly patients scheduled for elective supratentorial craniotomy under
      propofol-remifentanil total intravenous anaesthesia were randomly divided to either TEAS
      group (received stimulation at LI4, PC6, LU7, LU5, LI18 and ST9 acupoints, 2/10Hz, 6-15 mA)
      or Sham group (received no stimulation). The primary outcomes were the haemodynamic
      parameters and plasma concentrations of epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol
      (Cor). The secondary outcomes were the consumption of remifentanil and propofol, the time
      from discontinuation of anesthetics to extubation and reorientation, extubation quality
      score, the quality of postoperative recovery and postoperative complications.

    <description>Thirty minutes prior to the induction of anaesthesia, the patients in the TEAS group started to receive TEAS by a stimulator (Hwato Electronic Acupuncture Treatment Instrument, model No.: SDZ-II, Suzhou Medical Appliances Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China) to the right hand, forearm and neck by an experienced acupuncturist at the Hegu (LI4), Neiguan (PC6), Lieque (LU7), Chize (LU5), Futu (LI18) and Renying (ST9) acupoints. TEAS was peformed with an alternate dense-disperse frequency of 2 and10 Hz ( 2 Hz for 10 s and 10 Hz for 5 s). The optimal intensity ranged from 6-15 mA, The stimulus continued until 5 min before the end of surgery.</description>
