      Retrospective/Prospective, open-label study using sofosbuvir based DAA therapy to treat
      HIV/HCV coinfected pre or post liver transplant participants
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately fifty HIV/HCV coinfected patients with decompensated liver disease will be
      enrolled in the study. Ten (up to twenty) subjects will be treated with FDC SOF/LDV pre or
      post liver transplant and followed prospectively. Forty + subjects will be enrolled
      retrospectively with the intent to capture all patients who have been exposed to sofosbuvir
      based DAA therapies at participating sites since 1/2014, and to mirror the population being
      enrolled prospectively.

      In addition, participants in the retrospective arm will be contacted to consent to one
      prospective study visit for liver staging to determine rates of reversal of decompensation,
      reversal of cirrhosis and improvements in graft survival post treatment, and for future
      contact by the NIH Clinical Center to assess longer term outcomes when this study ends.

          8. History of major organ transplantation other than liver or kidney transplantation.

          9. Difficulty with blood collection/poor venous access for phlebotomy that would prevent

             medical conditions, especially if treated with medications (such as hypertension),
             must be stable at the time of screening. No new therapies should be started within 28
             days prior to the study that may confound the assessment of study drug safety.

         17. Participation in a clinical study (other than an IRB approved HOPE Act protocol
             involving the utilization of an HIV+ donor) in which an investigational drug,
             biologic, or device was received within 12 weeks prior to first dose administration.
