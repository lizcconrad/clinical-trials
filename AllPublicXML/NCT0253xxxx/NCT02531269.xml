  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using European data from patients included in the Named Patient Program (NPP) and from the
      early post-marketing authorization period, the present study aims to describe patient
      characteristics and to describe the effectiveness of Daclatasvir (DCV)-based regimens in
      Europe. This will be a retrospective cohort study of patients who received treatment with a
      DCV-based regimen in the following context:

        -  Patients enrolled within the European NPP in one of the following countries Austria,
           Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom; or

        -  In those countries where DCV is commercially available (ie, Sweden, Germany, United
           Kingdom), patients who received DCV during the early post-marketing authorization period

      The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of effectiveness of
      DCV-based regimens in a population that differs from population in the clinical trials, and
      therefore will provide additional valuable information to inform clinical practice.

      This study intends to estimate primarily the effectiveness of DCV-based regimens as measured
      by the sustained virologic response at post treatment follow-up visit week 12 (SVR12). As
      well as estimate the effectiveness of DCV-based regimens as measured by SVR12 after the end
      of Hepatitis C virus (HCV).

      This study intends also to describe as secondary objectives the characteristics (ie,
      demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment patterns of patients starting a new
      DCV-based regimens) of patients receiving DCV as well as the effectiveness of DCV-based
      regimens as measured by:

        -  On-treatment virological response at post treatment follow-up visit Week 4; and

        -  Virological response at the end of treatment (EOT); and

        -  The sustained viral response at post treatment follow-up visit Week 4 (SVR4) and post
           treatment follow-up visit Week 24 (SVR24); and

        -  The occurrence of virological failure (on-treatment and relapse).

      An exploratory objective will be to assess the concordance between SVR4 and SVR12 among the
      overall population treated with DCV.

    <description>Virological failure is defined as virologic breakthrough, other on-treatment failure or relapse, where:
Virologic breakthrough is defined as confirmed ≥ 1 log10 IU/mL HCV RNA on treatment increase from nadir, or confirmed increase in HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ if HCV RNA previously declined to &lt; LLOQ (TD/TND). (LLOQ: Lower limit of quantification)
Relapse is defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ (TND) at End of Treatment followed by confirmed detectable HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ in any follow-up visit window.
On-treatment failure is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ at any time point not meeting the definition of virologic breakthrough or relapse.</description>

                  ongoing clinical trial in the patient´s country of residence to treat his/her
                  HCV-infection.

          -  In countries where DCV is commercially available at time of study initiation(Sweden,
