  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by the abnormal accumulation
      of cystine in the lysosomes. Cystinosis is mostly caused by mutations in the cystinosin gene
      (CTNS). The major mutation, which is present in almost 50% of the cystinosis patients, is a
      57-kb deletion. This deletion removes the first 9 exons and a part of exon 10 of the CTNS
      gene. Exon 10 of the CTNS gene is a upstream 5' region that encodes for the CARKL gene and
      also for the first two noncoding exons of the transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid
      subfamily member 1 (TRPV1) gene.

      TRPV1 belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of cation channels. TRPV1
      is primarily expressed in sensory nerves and is activated by heating (&gt;43°C) and a wide range
      of chemical stimuli. One of these chemical stimuli is capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in
      hot chilli peppers. The effect of binding of the exogenous ligand capsaicin with the TRPV1
      receptor is well known to provoke the release of a number of bioactive substances including
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). These substances, in turn, act on target cells in the
      surrounding tissue such as mast cells, immune cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. The
      resulting response is characterized by redness and warmth (secondary to vasodilatation),
      swelling (secondary to plasma extravasation) and allodynia (i.e. hypersensitivity to heat and
      touch secondary to alterations in the excitability of primary sensory neurons).

      The present study wants to test the following hypotheses:

      (i) The DBF response to topical applied capsaicin is decreased in cystinosis patients,
      compared to matched control subjects.

      (ii) The skin sensitivity response after topical applied capsaicin is decreased in cystinosis
      patients, compared to matched control subjects.

      (iii) The temperature sensitivity is decreased in cystinosis patients, compared to matched
      control subjects.

    <description>At baseline and every 10 minutes during 60 minutes after capsaicin application, skin sensitivity to capsaicin will be measured using the Numerical rating scale (NRS) -11. Skin sensitivity to mechanical stimulation will be tested using Von Frey filaments after DBF measurements are performed.</description>

    <measure>Temperature sensitivity (detection and pain threshold), measured with Advanced Thermal stimulation and expressed in degrees Celsius.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Temperature sensitivity will be measured using Advanced Thermal stimulation (ATS) ( Pathway ATS Medoc) after DBF measurements are performed. A thermode will be attached to the hand of the volunteer with a baseline temperature of 32°C. The thermode will heat up and cool down with 1°C/second and the volunteers will be asked to click on a computer mouse when he/she detects the change in temperature and when it hurts.</description>

The most proximal ring (i.e. at least 15 cm proximal of the wrist crease) is referred to as ring number 1; the most distal ring is referred to as ring number 3; in between is ring number 2.
In ring number 1 and 2, subjects will receive a topical dose of 1000 µg/20 µL capsaicin (single-blind). Change in dermal blood flow induced by capsaicin will be measured with Laser Doppler Imaging.</description>
