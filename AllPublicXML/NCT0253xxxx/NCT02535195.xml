  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study was that ginger supplement consumption can be introduced as a
      new therapeutic strategy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through the improved body
      antioxidant activity, reduced levels of inflammation and insulin resistance. A randomized
      double-blind study was designed to evaluate this hypothesis in order to examine the
      effectiveness of ginger supplement in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

    <description>Participants were randomly divided based on age, sex and severity of steatosis in two groups. Randomization lists were computer-generated by a statistician and participants, project managers and employees at the clinic were completely unaware (blind) about intervention and control groups. At the first visit, baseline data were gathered and patients advised to consume 2 capsules content 500 mg of ginger (made in Green Plants of Life Pharmaceutics Co., Iran) or placebo (starch) one hour after breakfast and two capsules after dinner for 3 weeks. Capsules was administrated for all patients in the first week for 3 weeks and in each visit new series of supplement was prescribed.</description>
