      Duloxetine as an analgesic agent in patients undergoing elective spine surgery: evaluation
      with fentanyl demand controlled by the patient. The primary objective is to evaluate the
      efficacy of duloxetine in fentanyl consumption during the postoperative period of patients
      undergoing elective spine surgery by intervertebral disc degeneration . Secondary endpoints
      were pain scores and the presence or absence of adverse effects such as headache, nausea,
      vomiting, itching, dizziness and drowsiness.

    <textblock>
      Multimodal analgesia is widely advocated for the control of perioperative pain in an attempt
      to reduce the use of opioids and their side effects. Duloxetine is a selective inhibitor of
      serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake with demonstrated efficacy in chronic pain such as
      painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy of duloxetine in fentanyl consumption during the postoperative period of
      patients undergoing elective spine surgery by intervertebral disc degeneration . Duloxetine
      as an analgesic agent in patients undergoing elective spine surgery: evaluation with fentanyl
      demand controlled by the patient. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of
      duloxetine in fentanyl consumption during the postoperative period of patients undergoing
      elective spine surgery by degenerative disc disease. Secondary endpoints were pain scores and
      the presence or absence of adverse effects such as headache, nausea, vomiting, itching,
      dizziness and drowsiness.
