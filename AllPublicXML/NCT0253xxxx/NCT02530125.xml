  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pidilizumab and its effect, bad and/or good, on the
      immune system in relation to its ability to fight cancer cells. Many cancers can be brought
      to a phase called complete remission (no cancer is found) but have a chance that they may
      come back. Researchers are working to improve therapy and to find new drugs that lower the
      chance of disease coming back. This study uses a drug called pidilizumab. The drug targets
      our immune system. It can change how our immune system finds cancer cells. The drug may kill
      any remaining cancer cells that we cannot see with computed tomography (CT) scans. The drug,
      pidilizumab, is being studied in other cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of response, whereby either cluster of differentiation
      (CD)4+CD25+programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)+ T lymphocytes or CD4+CD62L+CD127+ T
      lymphocytes has an &quot;increase&quot; following administration of pidilizumab in patients with
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have completed induction chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of pidilizumab therapy following induction
      chemotherapy.

      II. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years. III. To estimate the overall
      survival (OS) at 2 years. IV. To estimate time to second line chemotherapy (TSLC) at 2 years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway specific expression markers from the
      diagnostic biopsy specimens.

      II. To characterize serum biomarkers of immune and inflammatory response during treatment
      with pidilizumab.

      III. To characterize levels of soluble PD-L1 related to treatment with pidilizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pidilizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 5 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 42 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months
      for 2 years.

PFS will be defined as time from study enrollment until the first occurrence of disease relapse, progression, re-initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, or death due to disease, or until last contact if the patient did not experience any of these.</description>
