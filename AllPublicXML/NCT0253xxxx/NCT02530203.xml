    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to control and spinal cord stimulation arm (SCS) to investigate
      the effect of SCS on the occurrence of post-operative atrial fibrillation in the five days
      after surgery.

      Pre market single center clinical research feasibility study. Non blinded randomized
      controlled study. 52 patients undergoing CABG procedure will be enrolled and randomized into
      two different group (26 person each): the Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and the control
      group. The first group will be implanted before the CABG procedure with a temporary SCS lead
      (5 days) while the second one will not. The lead will be connected to an external stimulator.

      The day of the CABG surgery, before the scheduled procedure, the patients in the treatment
      group will be implanted with the SCS lead. CABG procedure follows the SCS lead implantation.
      SCS will be switched off before surgery.

      After the CABG procedure, all patients will be hospitalized for minimally five days at the
      end of which they will be discharged. The Primary Endpoint data will be collected from the
      day of CABG procedure (Day-0) until Day-5. SCS lead will be removed on Day-5.

      1-week follow up visit will be performed one week after discharge. End-points will be
      evaluated at various time before, during and after surgery. In both groups arrhythmic
      episodes for primary and secondary endpoints will be recorded via a Holter monitor (recording
      5 days continuously).
