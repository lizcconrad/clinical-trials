    <textblock>
      Intratumoral plasmid IL-12 electroporation (IT-pIL12-EP) will be administered to
      approximately 10 patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with cutaneous or
      subcutaneous disease. Patients will receive one complete cycle of therapy, consisting of
      local injection of plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12) followed immediately by electroporation (EP), into
      accessible tumor lesions. IT-pIL12-EP will be administered in Days 1, 5, and 8 of the single
      28-day cycle.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of intratumoral injection of
      pIL-12 followed immediately by electroporation (IT-pIL12-EP). A minimum of ten patients with
      biopsy-accessible triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be treated in this study.
      Additional patients, up to a maximum of 25 patients, may be enrolled based upon
      pharmacodynamic observations and at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, in
      consultation with the Sponsor. All patients will receive a single 28-day treatment cycle. One
      lesion will remain untreated (the control lesion). Treatment will be administered on Days
      1,5, and 8 of the single 28-day cycle. Treatments will consist of direct injection of pIL-12
      into tumor lesions, followed immediately by electroporation of the lesions. At the end of the
      treatment cycle, patients will return to clinic for a final safety evaluation and tumor
      biopsy. This end of study (EOS) visit will occur prior to initiating any new anti-cancer
      therapy/regimen.

      All patients will undergo tumor biopsies at two separate timepoints for molecular and
      histological analyses associated with the primary endpoint. At least one lesion will be
      biopsied at Screening (pre-treatment sample). Biopsies of the untreated control lesion and at
      least one treated lesion will be obtained at the EOS visit (post-treatment samples).
      Additional tumor biopsy samples may be requested if there is either tumor regression or
      progression prior to EOS.

      Duration of participation will be approximately 4 weeks for each patient. A patient is
      considered to have completed the study if all three IT-pIL12-EP treatments (Days 1, 5, &amp; 8)
      and all required pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies have been obtained and EOS safety
      follow-up evaluations have been performed.
