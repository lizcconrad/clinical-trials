      A 6 month safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetic study with ANF-Rho to treat
      patients with chronic neutropenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neutropenia patients who are eligible for participation will be screened and enrolled
      to received open-label ANF-Rho for a period of 6 months. Study participation will be
      separated into 2 periods, Induction (8 weeks) and Maintenance (16 weeks). Blood samples to
      measure neutrophil levels and biochemistry labs will be drawn throughout the study to monitor
      efficacy response and patient safety. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected during both
      periods and questionnaires will be completed by the patient and investigator for bone pain,
      quality of life (QOL) and injection site reaction.
