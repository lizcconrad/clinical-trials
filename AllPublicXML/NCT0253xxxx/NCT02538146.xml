    <textblock>
      An open label pilot study will determine the effect of the amino acid nutritional supplement
      acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) on pain, quality of life, well-being, and serum pro-inflammatory
      mediator and oxidative stress levels in volunteers with chronic pancreatitis. The ALC is
      given to all participants for 3 months, and assessments will occur at intake and after 3
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study to determine the effect of the amino acid nutritional
      supplement acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) on chronic pancreatitis. ALC is an acetylated form of
      naturally occurring amino acid L-carnitine ((R)-3-Acetyloxy-4-trimethylammonio-butanoate)
      found in red meat and is readily commercially available. Supplementation with ALC may
      decrease pain and improve overall health based on our preclinical treatment studies in rats
      with high fat and alcohol induced pancreatitis. In rats, ALC reduces pain measures, improves
      glucose tolerance, decreases lipid peroxidation, and Ki67 cellular injury biomarker, and
      improves pancreatic histopathology. The measurable outcomes of this clinical study are
      patients' questionnaire scores for:

      pain, quality of life, well-being, and serum pro-inflammatory mediator and oxidative stress
      levels in volunteers with chronic pancreatitis. The questionnaires are given at intake and at
      experiment end (3 months). Participants will receive ALC for 3 months. These findings will
      indirectly determine the effect of ALC on the function and inflammatory state of the
      pancreas. Currently, there is no specific therapy for chronic pancreatitis, and its
      pathophysiology is still poorly understood. It is known that chronic pancreatitis is caused
      by ongoing inflammation in the pancreas, yet, no pharmacological intervention exists that
      optimally addresses this. The broad actions of ALC as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      agent as well as its ability to reduce side-effects of alcohol cessation make it a perfect
      compound to pursue for the treatment of pancreatitis.

    <ipd_description>One young participant (&gt;35) successfully completed the trial and provided a personal statement and data indicating the acetyl-L-carnatine had improved his pancreatitis. Two older individuals (&gt;60) withdrew from the study within two months citing inability to tolerate the acidity of the product. Difficulties recruiting in this very ill population was also a consideration in termination. For additional information contact sabrina.mcilwrath@uky.edu</ipd_description>
