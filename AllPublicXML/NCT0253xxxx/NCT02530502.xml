  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of phase I trial is to determine the safest, most effective dose of MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab), when used with radiotherapy and temozolomide for treating newly diagnosed
      patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Phase II trial will evaluate if MK-3475 used in combination
      with temozolomide and radiation followed by radiation and temozolomide to see if this is
      better than using radiation and temozolomide alone. Temozolomide binds to the
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), changes it, and triggers the death of tumor cells. MK-3475 is an
      investigational drug, it is not currently approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)
      for use in treating GBM but it is approved for treating melanoma. MK-3475 works by targets
      the local tumor immune-protection in solid tumors. It is hoped the addition of MK-3475 to the
      usual treatment for GBM will improve the current treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation therapy (RT) + temozolomide
      (TMZ) + MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) followed by MK-3475 + TMZ x 6 cycles (1 cycle is 9 weeks),
      MK-3475 can continue for an additional 12 months. (Phase I) II. To determine the
      progression-free survival (PFS) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients
      treated with RT + TMZ + MK-3475 followed by MK-3475 + TMZ x 6 cycles (1 cycle is 9 weeks),
      MK-3475 can continue for an additional 12 months. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine PFS-6 (percentage of patients alive and progression-free at 6 months post
      registration); response rate; overall survival (OS); OS-6, 12 and 24 (percentage of patients
      alive at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively); safety of MK-3475 in GBM. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there is a correlation of programmed cell death 1 (PD1) or programmed cell
      death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) expression and T-cell infiltrate in pathology from first and, if
      applicable, second surgical specimens with outcome. (Phase I/II) II. Assess changes in
      peripheral T-cell activation and tryptophan metabolites. (Phase I/II) III. Correlate
      o-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) status with outcome.
      (Phase I/II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab, followed by a phase II
      study.

      RT PORTION: Patients undergo focal RT over 42 days, and receive concurrent temozolomide
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42 and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22,
      and 43.

      POST-RT: After completion of RT, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5 and 29-34 of
      course 1 and days 1-5 and 29-33 of subsequent courses, and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 22, and 43. Treatment repeats every 9 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 courses, patients deriving benefit may
      continue to receive pembrolizumab for an additional 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-4 months.
