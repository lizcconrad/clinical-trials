      The PRO Kidney project will recruit a representative cohort of patients with advanced renal
      cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with systemic antiproliferative therapies such as TKIs, mTOR
      inhibitors, cytokines, antiVEGF or immune therapy. The aim of this study is to collect data
      on the effectiveness and patientsÂ´quality of life on preference in the real life setting.

      Patient Reported Outcomes ( PRO) are assessed by a questionnaire consisting Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy ( FACT) Kidney Syndrome Index 19 (FKSI 19) completed by four
      questions assessing ailments about changes in skin of hands/feet, taste, color of hair and
      mouth scores.
