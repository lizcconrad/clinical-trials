      The purpose of this study is to compare short-term and long-term efficacy of total
      parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation and total parathyroidectomy without
      autotransplantation for Secondary hyperparathyroidism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common disorder in patients with chronic
      kidney disease. It is caused by permanent stimulation of the orthotopic and heterotopic
      parathyroid tissue due to phosphate retention, hypocalcemia, and vitamin D insufficiency.
      Despite the initiation of new therapeutic agents, several patients will require
      parathyroidectomy.There are three options for the surgical treatment of SHPT:subtotal PTX
      (3.5-gland resection,SPTX), total PTX with autotransplantation(TPTX+AT), and total PTX
      without autotransplantation(TPTX).SPTX and TPTX+AT both leave a fragment of
      activated,proliferated parathyroid tissue.Since the pathophysiological condition of chronic
      renal failure and maintenance dialysis continues, the growth stimulus persists and may cause
      recurrent sHPT.The SPTX procedure has a lesser likelihood of a non-functioning remnant, but
      recurrent disease always requires a neck reoperation that carries a high likelihood of
      recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.Therefore most surgeons believe that TPTX+AT is a better
      procedure for patients with SHPT.

      Because of the potential complication of permanent hypocalcemia and adynamic bone
      disease,TPTX was not introduced into clinical practice.However,recent retrospective studies
      demonstrated patients after TPTX did not develop permanent hypoparathyroidism and adynamic
      bone disease as initially expected.Postoperative hypocalcemia is temporary.TPTX may provide
      an alternative strategy to the currently performed procedures mainly because of the reported
      lower recurrence rates.An 8-year follow-up study showed the recurrence rates after TPTX is
      7%.Recurrence rates after TPTX+AT is 21.4%,and the site of recurrence is located in
      approximately 80% at the graft and in 20% in the neck.However, to the present there is no
      randomized controlled trial to Compare the effects of total parathyroidectomy with
      autotransplantation and total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation.The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the short-term and long-term efficacy of total parathyroidectomy
      without autotransplantation comparison to total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation.

      Intervention: One hundred patients with SHPT need undergo parathyroidectomy at the Second
      Hospital of Anhui medical university were selected and divided into total parathyroidectomy
      without autotransplantation group and total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation group,
      each group contains 50 cases.

      Results:

        1. Clinical data include: intact parathyroid hormone,serum calcium,serum
           phosphorus,calcium-phosphorus product,hemoglobin,operation
           time,morbidity,mortality,clinical symptoms and signs,recurrence and reoperation,quality
           of life scores.

        2. Statistical method: groups t-test, analysis of variance were used.
