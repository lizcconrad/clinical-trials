    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe whether dopamine agonists can be safely withdrawn
      after the tumor volume and prolactin level of invasive prolactinomas involving the cavernous
      sinus have been effectively controlled through pharmacological treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For giant or large invasive prolactinomas involving the cavernous sinus, whether the drug can
      be safely withdrawn after the tumor volume and prolactin(PRL) level have been effectively
      controlled through pharmacological treatment still remains unknown. The study objects are
      patients with invasive prolactinomas involving the cavernous sinus, which were invaded the
      cavernous sinus to an extent corresponding to Grade III or IV, according to the
      classification scheme of Knosp and colleagues, who had undergone pharmacological treatment
      including bromocriptine or cabergoline. Observation will be started after drug withdrawal
      criteria are reached (PRL remains normal level for no less than two years; tumor volume has
      shrank more than 50%, and the distance is more than 5mm between tumor and optical nerve),the
      patients are randomized to withdrawal group or continue treatment group.Observational items
      include changes of PRL level, tumor volume as well as vision acuity and visual fields. If
      elevated PRL or tumor relapse is observed, pharmacological treatment will be restarted.
