    <textblock>
      Allergy is a very common problem and can be a handicap in everyday life, specially when
      symptoms occur at work place. Some persons working with drosophila developed respiratory
      symptoms. Investigators tried to analyze if these manifestations could be due to a specific
      allergy to drosophila.

      To do so, investigators invited laboratory workers who presented any symptoms in presence of
      drosophila to undergo skin prick tests in order to determine if a specific sensibilization to
      drosophila exists. Then, a blood sample is taken from these persons to research specific IgE
      directed against drosophila. By this way, investigators hope determine if a specific allergy
      to drosophila exists, its characteristics as prevalence, symptoms, populations concerned...in
      order to better protect laboratory workers and prevent allergy incidence.
