  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective multicenter evaluation of the performance of the InterGraft
      System for anastomosis of a hemodialysis graft. The InterGraft System includes an arterial
      InterGraft (AIG) connector and a venous InterGraft (VIG) connector used with a standard
      arterial-venous (AV) graft. The study is intended to demonstrate that the 6 month cumulative
      patency of grafts connected with the InterGraft Connectors is similar to that of grafts
      connected using standard sutured anastomoses. In addition, the study will also include a
      separate cohort of up to 25 subjects in whom the VIG is used for the venous anastomosis,
      together with a standard sutured arterial anastomosis, in situations where the target artery
      is not suitable for use of the AIG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal multicenter, prospective, non-randomized adaptive design study. The planned
      study enrollment is a minimum of 104 evaluable subjects who require AV graft placement for
      hemodialysis and who meet the entry criteria. However, the study will allow for a maximum
      enrollment of 252 subjects, including up to 185 evaluable subjects, up to 30 roll-in cases,
      up to 25 subjects in a separate cohort study (described below), and a provision for 12
      subjects lost to follow-up. Roll-in cases will not be included in the primary analysis, but
      will be analyzed separately. This maximum number of subjects allows for an upward adjustment
      in sample size, if warranted, based on a pre-specified midpoint evaluation of the primary
      endpoint. Additional subjects may be enrolled up to a maximum of 185 evaluable subjects after
      review of interim analysis results.

      In addition to the main study, a separate study cohort may enroll up to 25 subjects in whom
      the VIG is used for the venous anastomosis, together with a standard sutured arterial
      anastomosis. Such subjects may be identified based on pre-surgery imaging or at the time of
      the surgery (e.g., cases in which the subject meets the initial inclusion criteria, but the
      target artery is determined to be unsuitable for anastomosis with the AIG at the time of
      surgery). Data from this cohort will not be included in the primary analysis, but will be
      analyzed separately.

      The study will include up to 15 participating clinical centers. Study site investigators will
      be physicians skilled in AV access graft placement and interventional techniques. Study data
      will be collected up to the point at which each subject has completed the 6 month endpoint.
