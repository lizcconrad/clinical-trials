    <textblock>
      Which splinting method produces the best outcomes (in range of movement, pain and function)
      in the non-operative treatment of stable volar plate injuries in adults?

      The volar plate is a ligament located at the middle knuckle (proximal interphalangeal joint -
      PIPJ) of the finger. It is commonly injured through hyperextension, for example a ball
      hitting the fingertip. Current treatment in the Hand Therapy Unit involves splinting the
      injured joint dorsally (on the back of the finger) into 20⁰ flexion (bent) using
      thermoplastic material. However, there is a potential risk of developing permanent stiffness
      of the PIPJ into straightening, once the volar plate ligament heals. To reduce this risk, the
      study aims to investigate if using a volar (on the front of the finger) gutter splint in 0⁰
      flexion (straight), which still prevents hyperextension, achieves better outcomes. There is
      no existing high-quality evidence comparing these two methods.

      This is a randomised controlled trial. For the purposes of this study, the current treatment
      of a 20° dorsal block splint will act as the control group. The intervention group will be
      the volar gutter splint group. A convenience sample will be used and all patients (over 16
      years old) presenting to the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust's Hand Therapy Unit will be
      invited to participate in the study, with consideration to inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      Participants will be randomised into one of two groups through the use of a random number
      generator. The outcomes assessed will be range of movement, pain and function. These will be
      measured at initial assessment, four and twelve weeks. These are all average normal time
      intervals that patients are seen. Each splint is worn for four weeks and participants will
      receive standardised advice, exercises and treatment.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All stable volar plate injuries.

          2. Aged 16 and older.

          3. Male and female.

          4. Acute presentation within 2 weeks of injury.

          5. All ethnic groups speaking English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Vulnerable patient groups or those lacking capacity.

          2. Previous injury or pathology involving the same digit.

          3. Surgical intervention

          4. Unstable proximal interphalangeal joint.

          5. Concomitant tendon or additional bony injury outside the traditional Eaton
             classification types of volar plate injury.

          6. The DASH outcome measure is available and validated in 27 languages. However, those
             who do not speak/understand English well will unfortunately be excluded. This is an
             educational project and therefore there is no funding to use a translator service.

          7. Volar plate injuries are just as common in children and teenagers as adults. But under
             16s will be excluded from this study as the DASH questionnaire has only been assumed
             valid in adults. There is no research investigating its use in younger age-groups.
