  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that viral specific T-cells (a type of white
      blood cell) can be generated from an unrelated donor and given safely to patients with viral
      infections.

    <textblock>
      Viral reactivation and infection is a major cause of morbidity in immunocompromised patients
      (including HSCT recipients). In this study we will draw blood from unrelated (third party)
      donors and use the blood to generate cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) with specificity for
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (ADV), and BK virus (BKV). The
      CTLs will be infused into immunocompromised children with specific viral infections (EBV,
      CMV, ADV, or BKV). Cells will be selected for infusion based on the recipient's HLA type and
      the viral specificity of the cells.

    <description>3rd party donor derived CTL's will be infused into immunocompromised patients who have evidence of viral infection or reactivation defined as any of the following:
Blood adenovirus PCR ≥ 1,000
Blood CMV PCR ≥ 500
Blood EBV PCR ≥ 9,000
Plasma BKV PCR &gt;1,000
Evidence of invasive adenovirus infection or disease, defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity by PCR or culture in one or more sites.
Evidence of invasive CMV infection, eg pneumonitis, retinitis, colitis
Evidence of EBV-associated lymphoproliferation (EBV-LPD) defined as proven by biopsy or probable by an elevated EBV DNA level in the blood associated with clinical symptoms (adenopathy or fever or masses on imaging) but without biopsy confirmation.
Evidence of symptomatic BK virus infection, which may include symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis.</description>
