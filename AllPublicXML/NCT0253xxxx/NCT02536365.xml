  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common feature of ASD is over or under sensitivity to the environment and difficulty
      putting sensory information together in an orderly way, referred to here as sensory issues.
      Building on previous work, this study will test the efficacy of Sensory Integration Therapy
      (SIT), a non-invasive intervention to improve functional skills in children with ASD, in
      comparison to commonly applied ABA behavioral treatments, in the treatment of ASD symptoms. A
      total of 180 children with ASD and sensory issues in the greater New York City Metropolitan
      area will complete this study.

    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most common neurodevelopmental disorder with
      estimated costs of treatment across the lifespan of $3.2 million. A common feature of ASD is
      over or under sensitivity to the environment and difficulty putting sensory information
      together in an orderly way, referred to here as sensory issues. Such sensory issues are now
      included in the diagnostic criteria in the DSM5 under the Restrictive and Repetitive
      Behaviors and Interests Criteria. These sensory issues have a deleterious effect on
      functional skills and limit participation in work, education, and social activities for
      individuals with ASD and their family. Building on previous work, this study seeks to extend
      understanding of Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) as a non-invasive intervention to improve
      functional skills in children with ASD and sensory issues, and to test its efficacy in
      comparison to commonly used applied behavioral treatments. Further, the investigators will
      explore the proposed neurobiological mechanisms by which this intervention may work, and
      phenotypic moderators of outcome. This study utilizes a randomized trial to compare SIT to a
      commonly used behavioral intervention to evaluate outcomes on functional skills as a basis
      for improved independence over the lifetime. A total of 180 children with ASD and sensory
      issues in the greater New York City Metropolitan area will complete this study.

    <time_frame>Increase between week 0 and week 12 in functional adaptivity as assessed by PEDI-CAT, with follow up for stability of change at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PEDI-CAT provides a valid and reliable assessment of the child's ability to perform daily living skills. The psychometric properties including validity and reliability are well documented and the PEDI-CAT showed good discriminant validity between groups of children with and without disabilities in all domains. Score estimates were found to be stable over time with strong test-retest reliability</description>

    <description>An observation-based, standardized performance assessment of daily living skills . It has been standardized on more than 150,000 persons, ages 2-100 years of age, internationally and cross-culturally.</description>

    <measure>Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Reduction between week 0 and week 12 in repetitive behavior scale score as assessed by RBS-R, with follow up for stability of change at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The RRB is a 43-item parent rating scale that measures the presence and severity of 6 types of repetitive behaviors: rituals/sameness (12 items), self-injurious behavior (8 items), stereotypic behavior (9 items), compulsive behavior (6 items), and restricted interests (3 items). The RBS-R yields an overall Total Score and six Subscale Scores, and has demonstrated reliability, stability, and validity in large autism samples.</description>
