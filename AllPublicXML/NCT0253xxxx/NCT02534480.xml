  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NGP 555 is a small molecule preventative therapy aimed at reducing Alzheimer's disease
      amyloid buildup by targeting Abeta 42 production.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NGP 555 is a gamma-secretase modulator with a selective mechanism to reduce Abeta 42 while
      raising shorter Abeta forms such as Abeta 37 and 38.

      NGP 555 is being developed as a preventative disease modifying therapy for Alzheimer's
      disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female volunteers aged 18-55 yrs and in good health as determined by medical
             history, physical examination, clinical laboratory studies, electrocardiograms (ECGs),
             vital signs, and investigator judgment

          2. Volunteer voluntarily agrees to participate in this study and signs an Institutional
             Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent prior to performing any of the screening
             procedures

          3. Female volunteers who are of child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically
             acceptable method of contraception (e.g., abstinence, an intrauterine device.

          4. Male healthy volunteers willing to use barrier contraception.

          5. Body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18.0 kg/m2 and ≤ 32.0 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of seizure disorder, symptomatic seizures (not including a history of simple
             febrile seizures in childhood) or any past or present medical condition which, in the
             opinion of the investigator has the potential to reduce seizure threshold (e.g.,
             history of head trauma or concussion, previous alcohol abuse, substance abuse)

          2. Any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             make the volunteer unsuitable for participation in the clinical study

          3. History of alcohol and/or illicit drug abuse within two years of entry

          4. Any psychiatric diagnosis or symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, major depression, anxiety
             or delusions)

          5. History of cerebrovascular events or non-vasovagal related loss of consciousness

          6. History of cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease

          7. Hepatic impairment as defined by &gt;1.3 times the upper limit of normal ranges of serum
             liver enzymes

          8. Renal impairment as defined by abnormal ranges of serum creatinine.

          9. Presence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension (fall in systolic blood
             pressure of &gt;20 mmHg or fall diastolic blood pressure of &gt; 10 mmHg; and increase in
             heart rate by &gt; 20 beats per minute [bpm])

         10. Corrected QT interval (QTc) values of &gt; 450 ms for males and &gt; 470 ms for females.

         11. Volunteers with abnormally low serum B12, folate or abnormal thyroid function tests

         12. Positive Screening test for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C antibody,
             or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody

         13. Positive urine test for alcohol or drugs

         14. Suicidal ideation

         15. Female volunteers that are breastfeeding or female volunteers with a positive urine
             pregnancy test

         16. Clinically significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs or
             clinical laboratory tests

         17. Volunteer is unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and
             study-related restrictions, the nature, scope and possible consequences of the
             clinical study
