  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is researching managing postsurgical pain by injecting both short-acting local
      anesthetics and EXPAREL® at the time of surgery and reviewing if it could reduce or eliminate
      the need for postsurgical opioids and improve clinical outcomes following the FAST dental
      implant surgery procedure. This approach is being compared to the current standard of care.

    <textblock>
      Postsurgical pain following the Full Arch Surgical Therapy (FAST) dental implant surgery
      procedure is commonly managed with a variety of interventions, including local infiltration
      with short-acting local anesthetics during surgery and the use of postsurgical opioid and
      non-opioid analgesics. Although this approach to managing postsurgical pain is considered the
      current standard of care, its reliance on opioid analgesics to provide analgesia beyond the
      duration of short-acting local anesthetics exposes patients to opioid-related adverse events
      (ORAEs) that may delay their recovery and have other deleterious clinical consequences. The
      primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of local infiltration
      of EXPAREL for the FAST dental implant surgery procedure compared to standard of care.
