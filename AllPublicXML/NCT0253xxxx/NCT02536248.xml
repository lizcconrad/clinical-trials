  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory processes are increasingly being recognized as a critical step in the
      pathogenesis of both diabetes and heart disease and may constitute a biological link between
      the two diseases. Inflammatory cytokines increase vascular permeability, change
      vasoregulatory responses, increase leukocyte adhesion to endothelium, and facilitate thrombus
      formation by inducing procoagulant activity, inhibiting anticoagulant pathways, and impairing
      fibrinolysis. Leukocyte adhesion to arterial endothelial cells is thought to be an important
      step in the development of atherosclerosis, and adhesion molecules, such as intercellular
      adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and L-selectin, play key roles in this process. Therefore,
      identifying novel therapeutic approaches that would favorably affect inflammation,
      endothelial function, and glucose is of significant interest. Investigators have recently
      demonstrated that, relative to placebo, sitagliptin treatment resulted in a significant
      reduction in plasma levels of various inflammatory markers and cell adhesion molecules. The
      results also suggest that the beneficial effects of sitagliptin on both inflammation and
      endothelial function are most likely mediated by an elevation in plasma GLP-1 levels and
      global improvement of the glucose-insulin homeostasis. However, the mechanisms underlying the
      beneficial effects of sitagliptin on these markers remain to be fully elucidated. The
      proposed study will address this key issue.
