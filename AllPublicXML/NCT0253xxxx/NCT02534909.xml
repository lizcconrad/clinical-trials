        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients between the age of 18-75 (inclusive), or 18-65 (applicable in
             Czech Republic) with a diagnosis of PNH prior to screening

          -  A documented PNH clone size of â‰¥10% by RBCs and/or granulocytes

          -  Serum LDH levels at least 1.5-fold above the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening

          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential at screening

          -  Previous vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis is required at least 2 weeks prior
             to first dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected hereditary complement deficiency

          -  History of recurrent meningitis, history of meningococcal meningitis despite
             vaccination

          -  Presence or suspicion (based on judgment of the investigator) of active bacterial
             infection within 2 weeks prior to first dose of LFG316, or recurrent bacterial
             infections

          -  Under active therapy with other agents interfering with the complement system

          -  Severe concurrent co-morbidities that are a likely caused by underlying autoimmune
             diseases other than PNH

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, unless they are using highly effective methods of
             contraception during dosing and for 50 days after the last dose of LFG316.
