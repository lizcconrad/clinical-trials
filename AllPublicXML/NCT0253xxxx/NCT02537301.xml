  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Group chat through the platform of mobile social networking provides an easily accessible,
      real-time and interactive channel for communication. With the help of mobile social app, a
      group of doctors with similar interests can share valuable cases, important papers and
      opinions through multiple media types (texts, images, and videos). It remains unknown what
      activities of Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography(ERCP) doctors on a group-chat
      platform are.

      In the beginning of 2013, a chatting group on Wechat (the most popular mobile social app in
      China), focusing on ERCP, was created. All the doctors who received and finished their ERCP
      training in Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases were invited to join in the platform. The
      contents in the chatting group were analyzed. The relationships between the chatting
      activities of ERCP doctors and the performance of ERCP (such as case volume, cannulation
      success rate and PEP etc.) were investigated.
