  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of an internet-based preparation on the
      outcome expectancy and treatment credibility of rehabilitants concerning inpatient
      psychosomatic rehabilitation. Both study groups receive the usual written information for
      preparation (TAU). The patients of the experimental group have access to various videos on
      the study website until their inpatient rehabilitation begins, the patients of the placebo
      group receive no special treatment. The investigators hypothesize that the experimental group
      gains more positive outcome expectancy and treatment credibility compared to the control
      group.
