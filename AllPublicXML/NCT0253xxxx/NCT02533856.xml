    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the relative effectiveness of providing
      Enhanced Transitions of Care (ETOC) to improve patient outcomes after discharge from the
      Emergency Department (ED). Patients who are being discharged from the ED and have had a
      previous ED visit or hospital admission within the Thomas Jefferson Hospital System (TJUH or
      Methodist) within the past 90 days will be eligible for enrollment in this trial. Patients
      who consent to enrollment will be randomized to discharge by usual care or discharge with
      ETOC as provided by the company BoardRounds.

    <description>30-day healthcare utilization will be measured by assessing the total number of ED treat-and-release visits, hospital admissions, and outpatient care visits in the 30 days after study enrollment - will be reported in aggregate and separately for each type of utilization (ED, inpatient hospital stay, office visit). Counts will be determined by medical record review for visits occurring within the health system, and will be supplemented by patient report in a 30-day survey to determine utilization outside the health system.</description>

Counts will be determined by medical record review for visits occurring within the health system, and will be supplemented by patient report in a 30-day survey to determine utilization outside the health system.</description>

    <description>This will be a descriptive outcome to describe the types and counts of unmet needs that are identified by patients in the 30-days after ED discharge, as assessed in a survey administered 30 days after discharge. There will not be statistical analysis performed on this outcome, rather it will be descriptive and exploratory regarding patient primary struggles after ED discharge.</description>
