  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to study the correlation between the portosystemic pressure
      gradient and azygos blood flow measured by MRI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will benefit from:

        -  Pressure gradient measurement portosystemic

        -  MRI measurement of azygos flow, aortic, portals, spleen and lower cellar

        -  Liver biopsy

        -  Laboratory tests

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between portosystemic pressure gradient measured by catheterization of the hepatic veins transjugular and azygos flow measured by MRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>MRI and catheterization will be performed the same week.
For the azygos blood flow (by MRI), measures will be repeated 5 times. Speed of extraction and the rate on the post processing console will be made with a double reading.
For the measurement of portal pressure by catheterization, will be performed measurements of occluded hepatic vein pressure and free hepatic vein.
They will be repeated 3 times each.
These measures will be carried out to calculate the portosystemic pressure gradient.
The flow rate and gradient measurements will be performed blindly to the other.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between portosystemic pressure gradient measured by catheterization of the hepatic veins transjugular and aortic flow measured by MRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is different of primary outcome because the Measurement of azygos blood flow (MRI) is repeated on a strictly perpendicular section to the vessel facing the T4-T5 disk and the extraction speed rate and on post processing console is made by double reading.
Measuring portal pressure by catheterization. Measurements of occluded hepatic vein pressure and free hepatic vein and will be repeated 3 times each.
Flow measurements and gradient will be carried out blind to each other by the radiologist and the hepatologist.</description>

    <description>Measurement of azygos blood flow (MRI) Repeated Measure 5 times on a strictly perpendicular cut to the vessel immediately after anastomosis of the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava and Extraction speed and flow on post processing console with double reading.
Measurement of portal pressure by catheterization It will be defined by the measures of occluded hepatic vein pressure and free hepatic vein and measurements will be repeated 3 times each.
The flow rate and gradient measurements will be performed blindly to the other.</description>

    <description>The measurement of portosystemic pressure gradient will be performed before liver biopsy.
Then liver biopsy is performed. The MRI was performed on the day of biopsy or within one week around the completion of the biopsy.
The MRI machine used is the Siemens 3T.</description>
