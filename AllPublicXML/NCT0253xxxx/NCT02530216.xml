  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare delivery now mandates shorter visits with higher documentation requirements,
      undermining the patient-provider interaction. Electronic health records (EHRs) have the
      potential to improve outcomes and quality of care in this pressured environment, and are
      endorsed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Health Information
      Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act as an important mechanism to support
      value-based healthcare. However, EHR systems were principally designed to support the
      transactional needs of administrators and billers, less so to nurture the relationship
      between patients and their providers. The purpose of this research is to identify ways to use
      EHRs to support clinical gastroenterologists and their patients while meeting the meaningful
      use requirements of the HITECH Act.

      To improve clinic visit efficiency and meet criteria for meaningful use, investigators
      developed a patient-provider portal (P3) that systematically collects patient symptoms using
      a computer algorithm called Automated Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms (AEGIS). AEGIS
      utilizes computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to guide patients through questions drawn from a
      library of over 300 symptom attributes measuring the timing, severity, frequency, location,
      quality, and character of their GI symptoms, along with relevant comorbidities, family
      history, and alarm features. The system then automatically &quot;translates&quot; the patient report
      into a full narrative HPI available for use by GI providers in an EHR.

      In a cross-sectional study in the American Journal of Gastroenterology comparing AEGIS versus
      physician-documented HPIs, investigators found that blinded physician reviewers perceived
      that AEGIS HPIs were of higher overall quality, better organized, and more succinct,
      comprehensible, complete and useful compared to HPIs written by physicians during usual care
      in academic GI clinics. In the current study, investigators aim to evaluate
      computer-generated HPIs prospectively on a wider scale in diverse academic and
      community-based settings. Moreover, investigators aim to test an enhanced AEGIS intervention
      that ties patient HPIs to an individualized &quot;education prescription&quot; which guides the patient
      through a library of multi-media educational materials on GI symptoms, conditions, and
      treatments.

    <description>AEGIS (Automated Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms) guides patients through questionnaires to measure symptom attributes including the timing, severity, frequency, location, quality, and character of their gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, along with relevant comorbidities, family history, and alarm features. This information is transformed into a history of present illness (HPI) written in language familiar to clinicians. AEGIS also supports both the clinician and patient with an individualized &quot;education prescription&quot; which guides the patient through a library of multi-media educational materials on GI symptoms, conditions, and treatments. The prescription is created by the portal based on each patient's unique AEGIS &quot;fingerprint.&quot;</description>
