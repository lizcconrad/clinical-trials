  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is the gold standard for securing the airway. However, while managing
      patients with difficult airways, various supraglottic devices have been used as rescue airway
      devices. The aim of this study is to compare the fiberoptic view through the internal aspect
      of the i-gel versus the Air-Q LMA in pediatric patients. By examining the fiberoptic view
      through these two devices, the investigators will determine which device provides a clearer
      passage to the glottic opening and is therefore the preferred conduit to aid endotracheal
      intubation in difficult airways.

    <description>The Air-Q is composed of an airway tube that connects to an elliptical mask with a cuff which is inserted through the patient's mouth, down the windpipe, and once deployed forms an airtight seal on top the glottis (unlike tracheal tubes which pass through the glottis) allowing a secure airway to be managed by a health care provider.</description>

    <description>The i-gel is designed to create a non-inflatable anatomical seal of the pharyngeal, laryngeal and perilaryngeal structures whilst avoiding the compression trauma that can occur with inflatable supraglottic airway devices.</description>
