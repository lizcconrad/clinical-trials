    <description>the researcher used the checklist to assess the student's mastery level skill l while changing a skill and recorded his score on the learning curve based on a 1 (no mastery) to 100 (complete mastery) scoring scale. This procedure continued until the learning curve reached to a plateau state, i.e. either reaching to the full mastery score (100) or revealing no significant change in three subsequent sessions. All the students achieved mastery (the plateau state) after performing the task for at most ten times.</description>
