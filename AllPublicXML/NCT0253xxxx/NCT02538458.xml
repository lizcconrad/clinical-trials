      Efficacy/Safety of 3% hypertonic saline inhalation (24H vs 72H) to treat acute bronchiolitis
      in infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In acute bronchiolitis in infants, 3% hypertonic saline nebulizations proved to be efficient,
      reducing the hospitalization length and clinical severity scores. Among the questions
      remaining, treatment length is still being discussed in the literature. The trial hypothesis
      is that the efficiency of a 24 hours treatment by 3% hypertonic saline is not inferior to a
      72 hours treatment, in acute bronchiolitis in infants. The primary objective of the study is
      to compare the efficiency of a 24 hours treatment by 3 % hypertonic saline, versus a 72 hours
      treatment maximum, on clinical remission, judged by the Wang score measured 72 hours after
      starting treatment, in children younger than 12 month hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis.
