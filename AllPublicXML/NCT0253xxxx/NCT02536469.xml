      A phase Ib, dose escalation, multiple dose trial with HuMax-IL8 in patients with metastatic
      or unresectable, locally advanced malignant solid tumors.

      All human subjects with a diagnosis of incurable solid tumors are eligible for the
      dose-escalation phase of this study. This study consists of two phases, the dose-escalation
      phase and the expansion phase. Subjects will be treated with the study treatment until any
      off-treatment criteria are met. The safety and efficacy will be assessed until the end of
      treatment or for a maximum of 52 weeks. In addition, a separate visit will be performed at
      the time of disease progression if the patient has a progression between end of treatment and
      52 weeks. The patients will be followed up for overall survival until the study closure. The
      study will be closed when all enrolled patients have been followed up for at least 52 weeks
      or have died.

          -  Patients must have recovered (grade 1 or baseline) from any clinically significant
             toxicity associated with prior therapy

          -  Age ≥ 18 years. .

          -  Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would
             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.
