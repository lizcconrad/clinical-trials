  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of
      first-line combined gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and Pegaspargase (P-Gemox) in newly diagnosed,
      nasal type, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment P-Gemox dosages were as follows: days 1, 30 min intravenous infusion of 1250 mg/m2
      gemcitabine; day 1, 2h intravenous infusion of 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin; day 1, deep
      intramuscular injection of 2500 U/m2 PEG-ASP at three different sites. The regimen was
      repeated every 2 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. Stage IE/IIE patients underwent four
      cycles induction chemotherapy, followed by involved-field radiotherapy after got CR, PR or
      SD. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was done by linear accelerator at 2.0 grays (Gy)
      per daily fraction with 5-6 weeks. The involved- field radiation (IFRT) dose was 50-56 Gy.
      Stage IIIE/IVE patients patients underwent at least two cycles treatments unless there was
      disease progression or unacceptable side effects, or withdrawal of patient consent. Primary
      tumor radiotherapy was recommended after they achieved CR.
