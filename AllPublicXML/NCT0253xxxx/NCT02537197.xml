  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of regular naltrexone dosing on disordered gamblers. Gamblers
      will also be scanned pre- and post-treatment where we will investigate the functional changes
      to tasks designed to engage brain region associated with gambling and addiction. These
      changes will be correlated with treatment outcomes and urge scores.

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of regular dosing of naltrexone for the treatment of
      disordered gambling. It will also examine the changes of neurological functioning to tasks
      associated with addiction. Converging evidence suggests that disordered gambling shares
      similarities with substance dependence and disordered alcohol use. Naltrexone is a medication
      that is used to reduce the cravings and euphoria from opioids and alcohol use and some
      studies have shown that it also has efficacy as a treatment for problematic gambling. Pilot
      data suggest the prefrontal cortex is activated for a healthy subject during a
      delay-discounting task, possibly indicating some consideration of the delayed value of a
      hypothetical money amount. If discounting rates can be correlated with treatment outcomes and
      neurological activation, these tasks may provide a new predictive tool for treatment outcome.
      However, no previous study has examined the neurological changes from pharmacological
      treatments of gambling. This study will provide data on the differences between pre- and
      post-treatment of regular naltrexone dosing for disordered gamblers

    <description>Regular Naltrexone dosing (approximately 12 weeks): Initially, participants will be given seven 25mg oral naltrexone (ReVia, Generic Health, or similar) half tablets at intake (days 1-7). The Full dosing regimen will begin if no toxicity issues are present and consists of fourteen 50mg tablets (two per day; 100mg). If required, dosages can be stepped up or down. If adverse symptoms persist (or if gambling symptoms escalates), the participant will be removed from the study and given alternative treatments. Participants will receive the following week's medication at each Calgary Opioid Dependence Program visit. Pill counts will be made at each visit. Physicians will monitor the progress of participants from intake and adjust dosages up or down to control gambling behaviour.</description>

             stimuli in the gambling stimuli task that is similar to video lottery terminals
             displays so gamblers will be familiar with these images).

             similar

          -  English speaking

          -  Evidence of a current significant medical illness, or unmanaged psychiatric or
             neurological disorder.

          -  Positive urine specimen to drugs of abuse.

          -  History of a traumatic brain injury or loss of consciousness (10 minutes or more).
