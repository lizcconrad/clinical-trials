  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to

      â€¢ Investigate the relative bioavailability of sorafenib as 400 mg (4 x 100 mg) tablet for
      oral suspension formulation in comparison to 400 mg (2 x 200 mg) marketed tablet formulation.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to

        -  Evaluate the dose proportionality in sorafenib pharmacokinetics for sorafenib tablet for
           oral suspension formulation after administration of 200 mg (2 x 100 mg) and 400 mg (4 x
           100 mg) dose of sorafenib in fasted state

        -  Evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the tablet for oral suspension
           formulation after administration of a single dose of 400 mg sorafenib (4 x 100mg)

        -  Evaluate the taste and palatability of sorafenib (both formulations)

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of sorafenib tablet for oral suspension in healthy
           male subjects

A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly and another medical important serious event as judged by investigator.
