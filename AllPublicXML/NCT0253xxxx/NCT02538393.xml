  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to

      • Investigate the relative bioavailability of sorafenib as 400 mg (4 x 100 mg) tablet for
      oral suspension formulation in comparison to 400 mg (2 x 200 mg) marketed tablet formulation.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to

        -  Evaluate the dose proportionality in sorafenib pharmacokinetics for sorafenib tablet for
           oral suspension formulation after administration of 200 mg (2 x 100 mg) and 400 mg (4 x
           100 mg) dose of sorafenib in fasted state

        -  Evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the tablet for oral suspension
           formulation after administration of a single dose of 400 mg sorafenib (4 x 100mg)

        -  Evaluate the taste and palatability of sorafenib (both formulations)

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of sorafenib tablet for oral suspension in healthy
           male subjects

AEs that started or worsened after first administration of study medication up to 30 days after end of treatment with study medication were considered to be treatment-emergent (TE). A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly and another medical important serious event as judged by investigator.
