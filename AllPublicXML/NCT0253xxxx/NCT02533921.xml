  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve outcomes for persons living with Parkinson's Disease
      (PD) and their family caregivers. The investigators hypothesize that outpatient
      interdisciplinary palliative care will improve patient-centered outcomes for PD patients at
      high-risk for poor outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is an approach to caring for individuals with life-threatening illnesses that
      addresses potential causes of suffering including physical symptoms such as pain, psychiatric
      symptoms such as depression, psychosocial issues and spiritual needs. Palliative care
      approaches have been successfully applied to improve patient-centered outcomes in cancer as
      well as several chronic progressive illnesses including heart failure and pulmonary disease.
      To date there have been minimal attempts to apply these principles to PD although preliminary
      evidence suggests that PD patients have significant unmet needs under current models of care
      which may be amenable through a palliative care model. This study will provide critical
      information to forward this field including data on the comparative effectiveness of
      outpatient palliative care for PD versus current standards of care; effects of this
      intervention on cost and service utilization; and the characteristics of patients most likely
      to benefit from such an approach and the specific services most needed by PD patients and
      their caregivers.
