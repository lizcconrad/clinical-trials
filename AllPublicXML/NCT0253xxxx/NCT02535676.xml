      The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of tDCS (transcranial direct
      current stimulation) for treatment of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The
      proposed design is a clinical trial, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
      Participants will receive ten sessions of active or sham stimulation in five consecutive
      days. 100 patients will be randomized into two groups (active tDCS vs sham tDCS) and will be
      assessed after the intervention: 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks after. As objectives, the investigators
      expect to see a clinical improvement of negative symptoms through scales PANSS (Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale), Calgary, Auditory verbal hallucinations, SANS (Skills for
      Assessment of Negative Symptoms), and expect improvement on computerized cognitive tests.
      Another goal is to see improvement in biological markers related to schizophrenia, plasma and
      DNA will be stored.

    <description>The device will produce a direct current of 2 mA from one electrode to the other. In active stimulation, the device will be turned on for 20 min and in sham stimulation the device will be turned in 2 mA for one minute and will be automatically turned off the remaining 19 minutes. The sham or active mode is chosen by a numeric code.</description>
