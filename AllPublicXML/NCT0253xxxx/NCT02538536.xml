          2. Patient has signed written informed consent.

          3. Patient has been diagnosed of IPF according to the most recent guideline on IPF
             diagnosis and management released by American Thoracic Society (ATS), European
             Respiratory Society (ERS), Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), and Latin American
             Thoracic Association (ALAT).

          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             and agree to use adequate birth control from screening throughout the study and for 30
             days after the last study drug administration.

          5. If a male patient has not been vasectomized at least 6 months before screening and
             partners with a woman of childbearing potential, he must be willing to use an
             acceptable contraceptive method throughout the study and for 30 days after the last
             study drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a known diagnosis of a respiratory disorder other than IPF.

          2. Substantial emphysema on high resolution computer tomography (HRCT) with degree of
             emphysema greater than fibrosis.

          3. Patient is an active smoker.

          4. Patient has evidence of active infection.

          5. Patients currently has or has a history of cancer, except basal cell carcinoma or

          6. Patient has a concurrent medical or psychological condition that, in the
             investigator's opinion, may compromise the patient's ability to participate in the
             study or give informed consent, or may complicate the evaluations of the study drug.

          7. Patient is receiving another investigational treatment for IPF at screening and/or
             plans to receive an investigational treatment for IPF during the current study.

          8. Patient has chronic hepatitis or significantly elevated liver enzyme levels, defined
             as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 2.5 × upper
             limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin above ULN.

          9. Female patient who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning a pregnancy during the
             course of the study.

         10. Woman of childbearing potential who is unwilling to use adequate birth control
             throughout the duration of the study.

         11. Patient has participated in an investigational clinical trial during the last 4 weeks.
