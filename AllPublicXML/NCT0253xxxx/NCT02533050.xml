  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) has a high frequency in patients
      victims of a coronary artery disease (CAD) (myocardial infarction, revascularization). Unlike
      patients seen in a sleep Laboratory with an impact on daytime functioning, CAD apneic
      patients do not complain in their daytime functioning. The objective of this study is to
      explore whether the objective cognitive assessment measures may be a good marker of the
      efficacy of CPAP treatment given to non-sleepy apneic CAD patients.

      Coronary patients with an AHI between 15 and 40 / h will be treated (or not) after
      randomization with CPAP treatment. The expected results are: CPAP apneic coronary patients
      should have a positive impact on cognitive performance, particularly on attention span and
      working memory measured by improvement in the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test score
      (PASAT score).

    <description>The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Single digits are presented every 4 seconds and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The score for the PASAT is the total number correct out of 60 possible answers.</description>
