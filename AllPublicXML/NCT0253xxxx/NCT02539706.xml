    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of rocuronium injection pain to menstrual cycle phases.Half
      of participants will receive follicular phase, while the other half will receive luteal
      phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menstrual period includes a spectrum of emotional and somatic symptoms observed in luteal
      phase of menstrual cycle, which are disappeared after menstruation.

      During menstrual cycle, fluctuation in sexual hormones results in attitude change and
      alteration in pain perception.

      Different studies reported some interactions between sex hormones and central nervous system,
      which might be linked to activity of serotonin and beta-endorphin in the brain.

      Pain perception differs during menstrual cycle.

      It has been recommended that estrogens might have an influence on somatic sensory process.

      Some studies reported a significant effect of pain sensitivity with higher levels of
      progesterone and some other studies reported similar patterns for pain perception.

      There are reports of more complaint of pain in luteal phase of menstruation, which is
      suggested as the reason for functional changes in women during menstrual cycle.

    <description>Tracheal intubating dose of 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium at room temperature was injected over 10 -15 s. The patients were observed immediately if they had pain in the arm, and the response was assessed. Withdrawal movements were also assessed and scored as follows: no movements = 0, movement limited to hand = 1, movement limited to the forearm including the elbow joint = 2, and movement of the upper arm including the shoulder joint = 3</description>
