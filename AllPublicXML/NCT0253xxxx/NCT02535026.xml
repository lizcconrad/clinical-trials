    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Status in Breast Cancer Specimens Using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Silver In-Situ Hybridization (SISH) Procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>HER2 status of the collected tissue samples was determined based on the results obtained from IHC test and SISH procedure. The IHC test gives a score of 0 to 3 positive (+) that measures the amount of HER2 receptor protein on the surface of cells in a breast cancer tissue sample. If the score is 0 to 1+, it's called &quot;HER2 negative (-).&quot; If the score is 2+, it's called &quot;borderline.&quot; A score of 3+ is called &quot;HER2 positive.&quot; Tissue samples which had the IHC score of 2+ (borderline) were re-tested using SISH procedure for confirmation of the HER2 status. Tissue samples with SISH test results + were considered as HER2+. Tissue samples for which HER2 status was not determined were considered as HER2 equivocal.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Different Phenotypes of Breast Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Breast cancer phenotypes were classified in to a) Luminal A: tissue samples that were estrogen receptor (ER) + and/or progesterone receptor (PR) +, HER2-, and either histologic grade 1 or 2; b) Luminal B: tissue samples that were ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2+ or ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2- and histologic grade 3; c) HER2 enriched: tissue samples that were ER-, PR-, and HER2+; d) Triple negative: tissue samples that were negative for ER, PR, and HER2. Histological grading was done by Nottingham Histologic Score system based on three factors, a) the amount of gland formation (differentiation), b) the nuclear features (pleomorphism) and c) the mitotic activity. Each of these features is scored from 1-3, and then each score is added to give a final total score ranging from 3-9. The final total score is used to determine the grade in the following way: i) Grade 1 tumors have a score of 3-5, ii) Grade 2 tumors have a score of 6-7, and iii) Grade 3 tumors have a score of 8-9.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Status in Breast Cancer Specimens Using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Silver In-Situ Hybridization (SISH) Procedures</title>
        <description>HER2 status of the collected tissue samples was determined based on the results obtained from IHC test and SISH procedure. The IHC test gives a score of 0 to 3 positive (+) that measures the amount of HER2 receptor protein on the surface of cells in a breast cancer tissue sample. If the score is 0 to 1+, it’s called “HER2 negative (-).” If the score is 2+, it's called &quot;borderline.&quot; A score of 3+ is called “HER2 positive.” Tissue samples which had the IHC score of 2+ (borderline) were re-tested using SISH procedure for confirmation of the HER2 status. Tissue samples with SISH test results + were considered as HER2+. Tissue samples for which HER2 status was not determined were considered as HER2 equivocal.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Status in Breast Cancer Specimens Using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Silver In-Situ Hybridization (SISH) Procedures</title>
          <description>HER2 status of the collected tissue samples was determined based on the results obtained from IHC test and SISH procedure. The IHC test gives a score of 0 to 3 positive (+) that measures the amount of HER2 receptor protein on the surface of cells in a breast cancer tissue sample. If the score is 0 to 1+, it’s called “HER2 negative (-).” If the score is 2+, it's called &quot;borderline.&quot; A score of 3+ is called “HER2 positive.” Tissue samples which had the IHC score of 2+ (borderline) were re-tested using SISH procedure for confirmation of the HER2 status. Tissue samples with SISH test results + were considered as HER2+. Tissue samples for which HER2 status was not determined were considered as HER2 equivocal.</description>

        <description>Breast cancer phenotypes were classified in to a) Luminal A: tissue samples that were estrogen receptor (ER) + and/or progesterone receptor (PR) +, HER2-, and either histologic grade 1 or 2; b) Luminal B: tissue samples that were ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2+ or ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2- and histologic grade 3; c) HER2 enriched: tissue samples that were ER-, PR-, and HER2+; d) Triple negative: tissue samples that were negative for ER, PR, and HER2. Histological grading was done by Nottingham Histologic Score system based on three factors, a) the amount of gland formation (differentiation), b) the nuclear features (pleomorphism) and c) the mitotic activity. Each of these features is scored from 1-3, and then each score is added to give a final total score ranging from 3-9. The final total score is used to determine the grade in the following way: i) Grade 1 tumors have a score of 3-5, ii) Grade 2 tumors have a score of 6-7, and iii) Grade 3 tumors have a score of 8-9.</description>
