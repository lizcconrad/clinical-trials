    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions located in epicardial vessel who
        qualify for percutaneous coronary intervention will be included according to the inclusion
        and exclusion criteria specified below:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years.

          2. Eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

          3. Acceptable candidate for CABG

          4. Clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive territorial functional
             study. Documented stable angina pectoris ((Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
             Classification 1, 2, 3 or 4) or unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia
             (Braunwald Class IB-C, IIB-C or IIIB-C), or documented silent ischemia.

          5. The target lesion is a single de novo coronary artery lesion with ≥ 50% and &lt; 100%
             stenosis in one of the major epicardial territories (LAD, LCX or RCA). A second target
             lesion in another major epicardial vessel could be treated and this second lesion
             should fit with the inclusion/exclusion criteria and will receive the same type of
             stent.

          6. The target lesion must be covered by one study stent, preferably with a margin of 3 mm
             on each side of the lesion.

          7. The target lesion must be ≤ 34 mm in length by visual estimate.

          8. The target reference vessel diameter must be ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm.

          9. Patient or patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the study
             and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as notified /
             approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the clinical site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female of childbearing potential

          2. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 25%

          3. Evidence of an acute Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction within 72 hours
             preceding the index procedure

          4. Known allergies to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®, Ceruvin) or
             ticlopidine (Ticlid®), heparin, sirolimus, cobalt chromium, contrast agent (that
             cannot be adequately pre-medicated)

          5. A platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC &lt;3,000 cells/mm3

          6. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt;2.0mg/dl or &gt;150µmol/L)

          7. Target vessel has evidence of thrombus

          8. Target vessel is excessively tortuous which makes it unsuitable for proper stent
             delivery and deployment

          9. Previous bare metal stenting (less than 1 year) anywhere within the target vessel

         10. Previous drug-eluting stenting anywhere within any epicardial vessel

         11. The target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent
             placement (e.g. but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser,
             rotational atherectomy, etc.)

         12. Significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require
             revascularization or impede run-off

         13. Heavily calcified lesion and/or calcified lesion which cannot be successfully
             predilated

         14. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft

         15. Ostial target lesion

         16. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study,
             including its follow-up period

         17. Within 30 days prior to procedure, patient has undergone a previous coronary
             interventional procedure of any kind

         18. Within 48 days post-procedure, patient requires planned interventional treatment of
             any non-target vessel. Planned intervention of the target vessel after the index
             procedure is not allowed.

         19. CVA within previous 6 months

         20. Unprotected Left Main (LM) coronary artery disease (stenosis &gt;50%)

         21. In the investigator's opinion, patient has a co-morbid condition(s) that could limit
             the patient's ability to participate in the study, compliance with follow-up
             requirements or impact the scientific integrity of the study

         22. Planned surgery within 48 days after the index procedure

         23. Life expectancy less than 1 year

         24. Any contraindication to blood sampling
