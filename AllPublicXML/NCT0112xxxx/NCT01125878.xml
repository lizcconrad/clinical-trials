  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are interested in learning how appetite responds to certain types of starch and
      fiber mixtures. In this research study, subjects will be asked to consume cookie bars
      containing different types of starch and fiber mixtures, then describe their feelings of
      hunger, fullness and desire to eat for the 3 hour study period. Subjects will be asked to do
      this on four separate occasions. Following the 3 hour study period, a deli-style lunch will
      be served. Investigators want to see how appetite responds to these four different starch and
      fiber mixtures.

    <textblock>
      This study will require one initial screening visit (approximately 1 hour) and four study
      visits each lasting approximately 4 hours. All visits should be done in 2 months. We are
      looking for healthy, non-smoking, premenopausal female volunteers older than 18 with no
      medical history of diabetics, heart, lung, kidney, stomach, or liver disease.

      The initial screening visit will determine subject eligibility through height, weight and
      waist circumference measurements, blood glucose finger prick and eating, health and mood
      surveys.

      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will have four study visits. All study
      visits will be scheduled according to each individual subject's menstrual cycle. At each
      visit subject will be asked to eat the cookie bar and then answer questions about their
      feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat. Subject will continue to answer questions
      about their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat at specific time points up to 3
      hours after eating the yogurt. After 3 hours a lunch meal will be served. The lunch meal
      consists of typical deli items, such as pasta, rolls, salad, etc. Subject will be allowed to
      eat as much or as little of the lunch as they'd like.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective and behavioral satiety responses after consumption of the resistant starch composites by visual analog scales and subsequent food intake.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hour postprandial study</time_frame>
    <description>Meals will be provided under fasting conditions and thereafter subjects will record satiety reponses at 30 mins, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 on a visual analog scale (VAS). The subject will answer a series of questions on the VAS describing their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat at the above mentioned time points.
Satiety will also be determined on the quantity of the test lunch meal consumed. This test meal will be served three hours after consumption of the starch composites.</description>
