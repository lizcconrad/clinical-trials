  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 120 participants aged 8 and up with Duchenne, Becker, or autosomal
      recessive limb-girdle (specifically: LGMD 2C-2F and 2I) muscular dystrophies that have no
      clinical cardiac symptoms. Participants will be randomized to one of four arms: Arm 1 CoQ10
      alone, Arm 2 Lisinopril alone, Arm 3 CoQ10 and Lisinopril or Arm 4 No study medication.
      Randomization will be stratified by ambulatory status and corticosteroid use. The primary
      outcome for the study is the myocardial performance index (MPI), measured by standard Doppler
      echocardiography. The study will last 24 months with visits at Months 0.5,1.5, 6, 12, 18 and
      24.

      Following completion of the Clinical Trial of Coenzyme Q10 and Lisinopril, participants will
      be offered participation in a companion protocol: PITT1215 A Natural History Companion Study
      to PITT0908: Clinical Trial of Coenzyme Q10 and Lisinopril in Muscular Dystrophies. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the longitudinal natural history of DMD, BMD, and
      LGMD2I and to evaluate the effects of Coenzyme Q10 and/or Lisinopril on prevention of cardiac
      dysfunction in these disorders.This will be an 18-month longitudinal natural history study
      designed to accompany the Clinical Trial of Coenzyme Q10 and Lisinopril in Muscular
      Dystrophies.

    <description>The MPI is a sensitive, quantifiable, noninvasive measure of global ventricular function that is independent of cardiac geometry and heart rate. MPI is collected through standard echocardiogram assessment. MPI is a ratio of the total time spent in isovolumic activity (isovolumic contraction time and isovolumic relaxation time) to the time spent in ventricular ejection.</description>
