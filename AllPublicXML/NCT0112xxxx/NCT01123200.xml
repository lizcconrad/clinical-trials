      The investigators are developing a tool to help people who are severely paralyzed. This tool
      is called a brain-computer interface (BCI). BCIs can connect to computers or other electronic
      devices.

      This study allows a person with ALS to communicate, control their wheelchair tilt and perform
      other tasks using a BCI, thus increasing their independence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This small-scale study of the feasibility of a BCI to operate the tilt position of a power
      wheelchair was also designed to determine the conditions and support structures necessary for
      use of a BCI in the home. In this study, people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) will
      have a BCI in their home. They will receive training in order to operate and maintain the
      BCI. The BCI will allow them to access at least one task of primary interest to them. Task
      may include communication, computer access, control of assistive technology, or control of
      wheelchair seat position. Data concerning the use of the BCI will be collected throughout the
      study. Custom installations will be made for each participant to connect to their wheelchair
      and provide communication options if needed. Each installation is expected to be a unique
      prototype because of the differing control requirements for the individual wheelchairs in use
      by the participants.

      We intended to enroll six participants, but were only able to enroll one.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older.

          -  Presently having difficulty communicating or operating the controls for assistive
             technology or likely to have difficulty in the next six months.

          -  Able to see the BCI display

          -  Able to understand and remember instructions concerning participation.

          -  Live in an environment that can accommodate the wheelchair portable BCI host computer

          -  Expected to live in the same physical environment for at least 6 months.

          -  Has family and caregiver(s) who are supportive of participation in this research.

          -  Has a primary caregiver who is technically capable, willing to learn the setup and
             operation of the BCI system, and likely to remain with the subject for at least 6
             months.

          -  Has been shown to be able to use a BCI (in an experimental session under another IRB,
             e.g. HUM 00012968).

          -  Has a clear understanding of the shortcomings of the present state of BCI technology

        Exclusion Criteria:
