      The aim of this study is to evaluate the new formulation of the influenza vaccine for the
      2010-2011 Northern Hemisphere (NH) season in terms of immunogenicity and safety in the
      corresponding population and to check its compliance with the Committee for Proprietary
      Medicinal Products (CPMP) Note for Guidance (NfG) CPMP/BWP/214/96

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the compliance, in terms of immunogenicity, of the influenza vaccine (split
           virion, inactivated) NH 2010-2011 formulation with the requirements of the Committee for
           Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) Note for Guidance (NfG) CPMP/BWP/214/96 in both
           age groups

        -  To describe the safety of the influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) NH 2010-2011
           formulation in both age groups
