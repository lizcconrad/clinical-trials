      Recruitment of at least 10 adult patients (men and women) among individuals affected and
      admitted to the hospitals identified for the clinical study. All patients shall be between 18
      and 75 years of age, with confirmed diagnosis of cryptococcosis or aspergillosis . During
      therapy (14 days) and examination (28 days), the patients will be subject to 7 doctor's
      visits (day 1,3,7,10,14,21, and 28).

      Objective: primary objective Evaluation of the overall global clinical response based on
      secondary end points from 1 to 6 at the end of the therapy (Study day 14) and at the final
      visit at the end of the study - follow-up- (Study day 28) in comparison to the initial
      clinical state.

      The evaluation will be based on: improvement/normalization in relation to the
      semi-quantitative scales at 3, 4 and 5 items or at opinion expressed as positive for at least
      3 of the first 6 secondary end points.

      secondary objectives

        1. Improvement on the basis of clinical symptoms;

        2. Antifungal efficacy from the cultures;

        3. Improvement on the basis of mycological blood testing;

        4. Improvement on the basis of laboratory diagnosis (hemogasanalysis, ESR, CPR);

        5. Improvement on the basis of radiological imaging (Rx, CAT HR,â€¦);

        6. Improvement on the basis of endoscopic examination;

        7. Evaluate the plasma levels of SPK-843 after single dose and after multiple doses;

        8. Evaluate the safety in the administration of SPK-843.

      Methodology: Open label multi center study

        Inclusion Criteria:The following will be included in the study:

          -  Patients with proven fungal etiology confirmed by mycological culture test and by
             hystopathological exam (&quot;patients with definite diagnosis&quot;), or patients with fungal
             infection of which is difficult to determine the etiological agent but with diagnosis
             of deep mycosis based on blood testing for fungal infection and/or clinical
             radiological examination, and/or endoscopic clinical examination, clinical
             symptomatology (&quot;patients with clinical diagnosis&quot;).

          -  Patients being treated with other anti-fungal drugs (i) showing a poor response to the
             treatment at least after 5 days of administration of the anti-fungal drug, (ii) that
             have had an adverse reaction to the drug prejudicing its use, determining the
             risk/benefit ratio unfavorable to the patient.

          -  Patients between 18 and 75 years of age.

               -  Patients that require the infusion of leucocytes;

               -  Patients with arterial thrombosis or with serious coagulative dysfunctions;
