      Patients who have undergone coronary bypass surgery have had a vein removed from the leg and
      implanted in the chest to &quot;bypass&quot; blockages in the coronary arteries. These veins are called
      saphenous vein grafts or SVGs. SVGs often develop blockages that can cause chest pain and
      heart attacks. SVG blockages can be opened by using small balloons and stents (metal coils
      that keep the artery open). Two types of stents are currently used: bare metal stents (BMS)
      and drug-eluting stents (DES). Both BMS and DES are made of metal. DES are also coated with a
      drug that releases into the wall of the blood vessel to prevent scar tissue from forming and
      re-narrowing the vessel. Both stents have advantages and disadvantages: DES require taking
      special blood thinners (called thienopyridines, such as clopidogrel or prasugrel) longer than
      bare metal stent and could have more bleeding but are also less likely to renarrow. Both BMS
      and DES are routinely being used in SVGs, but it is not known which one is better. Neither
      bare metal (except for an outdated model) nor drug-eluting stents are FDA approved for use in
      SVGs. The purpose of CSP#571 is to compare the outcomes after DES vs. BMS use in SVGs.

      In CSP#571 patients who need stenting of SVG blockages will be randomized to receive DES or
      BMS in a 1:1 ratio. Per standard practice, patients will receive 12 months of an open label
      thienopyridine if they have acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or if they have another clinical
      reason for needing the medication. Patients without ACS who receive DES also need to take 12
      months of a thienopyridine whether or not they are in the study, but non-ACS patients who
      receive a BMS do not. In order to make sure patients do not know which stent they received,
      non-ACS patients who received BMS will receive 1 month of open label thienopyridine followed
      by 11 months of blinded placebo, while those who received DES will receive 1 month of open
      label thienopyridine followed by 11 months of blinded clopidogrel, which is a thienopyridine.

      All study patients will be followed in the clinic for at least 1 year after their stenting
      procedure to see if there is a difference in the rate of cardiac death, heart attack, or any
      procedure that is required in order to increase the flow of blood to and from the heart
      between the BMS and DES groups.

      VA Cooperative Studies Program #571 is designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of
      drug-eluting stents (DES) in reducing aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft (SVG) failure
      when compared to bare metal stents (BMS) in patients undergoing stenting of de novo SVG
      lesions.

      SVGs often develop luminal stenoses that are most commonly treated with stent implantation.
      Approximately 60,000-100,000 percutaneous SVG interventions are performed annually in the
      USA. Two types of coronary stents are currently available: bare metal stents and drug eluting
      stents. Bare metal stents are the standard of care for the percutaneous treatment of SVG
      lesions, but are limited by high rates of in-stent restenosis (as high as 51% after 12
      months) often leading to repeat percutaneous or surgical SVG treatments. Drug-eluting stents
      have been shown to significantly reduce in-stent restenosis and the need for repeat target
      vessel and lesion revascularization in native coronary arteries, yet their efficacy in SVGs
      is not well studied, with conflicting results from various small studies. The proposed
      Cooperative Studies Program study will be the first large prospective, randomized,
      multicenter, blinded clinical trial comparing DES and BMS in SVG lesions. It will provide
      critical knowledge to assist the cardiac interventionalist in selecting the optimum stent
      type for these challenging lesions.

      Patients undergoing clinically-indicated stenting of de novo SVG lesions will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to DES or BMS. To ensure blinding to the type of stent used, of the patients
      who do not present with an acute coronary syndrome and do not require 12 months of dual
      antiplatelet therapy, those who receive DES will receive 11 months of clopidogrel and those
      who receive BMS will receive 11 months of matching placebo. After stenting, patients will be
      followed clinically for a minimum of one year to determine the 12-month incidence of target
      vessel failure (TVF, primary study endpoint). TVF will be defined as the composite of cardiac
      death, target vessel myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization, and is the
      primary clinical endpoint used in all FDA-approved DES pivotal trials. Coronary angiography
      and intervention during follow-up will only be performed if clinically-indicated (no
      mandatory angiographic follow-up). Secondary endpoints include: 1) clinical outcomes other
      than TVF (procedural success; post-procedural myocardial infarction; post-procedural
      bleeding; all cause death and cardiac death; follow-up myocardial infarction; stent
      thrombosis; target lesion revascularization; target vessel revascularization; non-target
      vessel revascularization; the composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, and target
      vessel revascularization (patient-oriented composite endpoint according to the FDA guidance
      document on DES studies); the composite endpoint of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial
      infarction, and target lesion revascularization (device-oriented composite endpoint for
      target lesion failure); and stroke); and 2) incremental cost-effectiveness of DES relative to
      BMS. A tertiary endpoint is in-stent neointima proliferation as measured by intravascular
      ultrasonography.

      Based on published studies, the investigators estimate the 12-month TVF rate in the BMS arm
      to be 30%. The investigators hypothesize that DES will reduce TVF to 18% (40% relative
      reduction). Assuming two-year accrual and one interim assessment, a total sample size of
      about 520 patients will be needed to detect this difference with 90% power, using a two-sided
      5% significance level. Assuming an intake rate of 1 patient per month per VA Medical Center,
      the investigators will need 22 participating sites. However, the investigators will begin the
      study with 25 sites to protect against a site dropout rate of 10%.

      Percutaneous treatment of SVG lesions is of particular importance to the VA system because
      many Veterans have undergone and continue to undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
      Every year, approximately 12-15% of percutaneous coronary interventions performed within the
      VA system are performed in SVGs, at a cost of approximately $15,000-$20,000 per procedure;
      DES are currently used in approximately half of SVG interventions. Because of (a) the high
      prevalence and high cost of SVG stenting, (b) DES cost two- to three- fold more than BMS and
      often require prolonged ( 12 months) thienopyridine administration to prevent late stent
      thrombosis, and (c) DES may have increased risk for late and very late stent thrombosis, a
      catastrophic complication with high mortality, the proposed study will have considerable
      impact on the clinical practice of SVG lesion stenting, patient satisfaction, and financial
      burden of health care systems (both within and outside the VA), regardless of whether the
      results are positive (DES offer significantly superior health benefits to patients than BMS),
      or negative (DES do not offer significantly superior health benefits to patients than BMS).
      Due to decreasing profits and increasing competition, DES manufacturers are not planning to
      ever fund a SVG DES study. The VA system with its Cooperative Studies Program is uniquely
      suited to conduct the proposed study.

        <description>Definite stent thrombosis will be considered to have occurred by either angiographic or pathologic confirmation.
Angiographic Confirmation of Stent Thrombosis will be defined as the presence of thrombus originating in a study stent, or in the segment 5mm proximal or distal to the stent AND fulfillment of at least one of the following 5 criteria within a 48 hour time window:
Acute onset of ischemic symptoms at rest
New ischemic ECG changes suggestive of acute ischemia
Rise and fall of cardiac biomarkers
Nonocclusive intracoronary thrombus seen in multiple projections, or persistence of contrast material within the lumen, or a visible embolization of intraluminal material downstream
Occlusive intracoronary thrombus Pathological Confirmation of stent thrombosis will be defined as evidence of recent thrombus with the stent determined at autopsy or via examination of tissue retrieved following thrombectomy.</description>
