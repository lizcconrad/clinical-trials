      and quality of life in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

      This is an observational cohort study. The participants will be inpatients undergoing
      elective CABG surgery at one tertiary medical center. Functional status (including activity
      of daily living, cognitive and nutritional status), symptom distress, and quality of life
      will be measured at multiple points: pre-surgery, day 1 to 7 post-surgery, before discharge,
      and 2-4 weeks after discharge. Structured questionnaire will be used to collect demographic
      and medical characteristics. The Barthel Index, hand-held dynamometer, 6-minute walking test,
      Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Confusion Assessment
      Method (CAM), Symptoms Distress Scale, and Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) will be used
      to collect functional data and compared for changes. The trajectory of functional status,
      symptoms distress, and quality of life will be further analyzed. The findings will add to the
      literature by raising the awareness on changes of functional status, symptoms distress, and
      quality of life for patients undergoing elective CABG so targeted and timely intervention
      could be developed and planned.
