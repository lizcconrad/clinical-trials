      Milk thistle is an herbal drug that may have some liver protection properties and may reduce
      inflammation in the liver. It may also have anticancer effects. However milk thistle is not
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for any medical purpose in the United States.

      It has not been used in patients with liver cancer previously, to our knowledge, but there
      have been many studies of its use in patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis. Some of these
      studies have shown that milk thistle may help reduce elevated liver function tests.

      Siliphos is a derivative of milk thistle that can be absorbed better than some other types of
      milk thistle. The investigators would like to perform a study to identify doses of siliphos
      that are safe to take in advanced liver cancer and to identify positive or negative side
      effects this compound may have. The investigators will be using this information in future
      studies to see if siliphos can be used as a therapy in patients with advanced liver cancer to
      reduce elevated liver function tests.

      Milk thistle (MT) has been historically used to treat patients with liver diseases, and has
      been shown to have antioxidant, anti inflammatory, and hepatoprotective properties. It may
      also have direct anticancer effects through inhibition of growth factors and promotion of
      cell cycle arrest. MT has been shown to improve LFTs in several studies of patients with
      cirrhosis. To our knowledge, there have been no published trials evaluating the clinical
      efficacy of MT in advanced HCC. We therefore propose a phase I study to identify the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of silybinphosphatidylcholine (a commercially available preparation with
      increased bioavailability), in patients with advanced HCC. We will use a traditional dose
      escalation, open label design with a study intervention period of 3 months, followed by one
      year of observation, with a maximum total of 30 subjects, evaluating a dose range between 1
      to 12 gm Siliphos. The data obtained from this study will be utilized in the future to
      evaluate MT efficacy in reducing liver function tests in advanced HCC, which will have
      significant implications in its use as a potential adjunctive agent in patients with
      currently limited treatment options.
