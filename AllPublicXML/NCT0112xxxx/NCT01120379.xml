      XIENCE V USA is a prospective, multi-center, multi-cohort post-approval study. The objectives
      of this study are

        -  To evaluate XIENCE V EECSS continued safety and effectiveness during commercial use in
           real world settings, and

        -  To support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
           initiative. This initiative is designed to evaluate the composite of all death,
           myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke (MACCE) and the survival of patients that are free
           from Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) and
           that have been treated with drug eluting stents (DES) and extended dual antiplatelet
           therapy.

      Among patients enrolled in the XIENCE V USA who have completed Study Phase I, some will be
      eligible to participate in the XIENCE V USA Long Term Follow-up (LTF) Cohort. This LTF cohort
      is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, observational, single-arm study is designed to
      evaluate XIENCE V EECSS continued safety and effectiveness in real world settings from 1 year
      after the index procedure up to 5 years. The XIENCE V USA LTF cohort will consist of the
      following from the initial 5,000 patients:

        -  The first 1,500 on-label patients who are treated in accordance with the XIENCE V EECSS
           Instruction for Use (IFU), and consecutively enrolled in the XIENCE V USA study

        -  The remaining patients who do not participate in the HCRI-DAPT cohort

        -  Data monitoring committee up to two years

        <description>Stent thrombosis was defined by ARC criteria as definite (angiographic confirmation with at least one of the following: acute onset of ischemic symptoms at rest, new ischemic ECG changes that suggest acute ischemia or typical rise and fall of cardiac biomarkers OR pathological confirmation at autopsy or via examination of tissue retrieved following thrombectomy), probable (any unexplained death within the first 30 days or, regardless of the time after the index procedure, any MI related to documented acute ischemia in the territory of the implanted stent without angiographic confirmation and in the absence of any other obvious cause), and possible (any unexplained death from 30 days after intracoronary stenting until end of trial follow-up). Stent thrombosis was categorized as acute (0-24 hours post stent implantation), Subacute (&gt;24 hours to 30 days post stent implantation), late (&gt;30 days to 1 year post stent implantation), or very late (&gt;1 year post stent implantation).</description>
