      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the broad clinical benefit of dosing
      Seroquel XR with flexible in the treatment of acute bipolar mania patients with partial
      response to existing therapy. Clinical benefit will be assessed with the Clinical Global
      Impression-Clinical Benefit (CGI-CB) score, according to a classification based on the
      principles outlined in the CGI efficacy index. Improvement in clinical benefit will be
      defined as a decrease from baseline in CGI-CB.

    <measure>The Proportion of Patients With Improvement From Baseline to Week 4 in Clinical Global Impression-Clinical Benefit Score (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-CB is used to evaluate the investigator's global weighted impression of efficacy and interference of adverse event from baseline to every visit. Improvement in clinical benefit is defined as a decrease from baseline in CGI-CB. Rank 1 denotes best possible benefit from new treatment and rank 10 indicates that there is no benefit from treatment.</description>

    <measure>The Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in - YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is an 11-item, multiple-choice diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure severity of manic episodes. There are 4 items graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, disruptive/aggressive behavior), and 7 items graded on 0 to 4 scale. These 4 items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2.</description>

    <measure>The CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of Illness) Change From Baseline to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Improvement scale (CGI-I) is scored to rate the patient's change from baseline CGI. A CGI-I score of 1 indicates that a patient is &quot;very much improved&quot; and a score of 7 indicates that a patient is &quot;very much worse.&quot; CGI-I scores greater than 4 indicate worsening, while scores less than 4 indicate improvement. At all following visits CGI-I will also be rated. The following calculations will be made: Proportion of patients with CGI Global Improvement rating ≤ 2 at Day 29</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is scored to rate patient's current clinical state. At enrolment patient's condition is rated using the CGI-S. At assignment CGI-S is again completed and a score of at least 4 (moderately ill). The score at assignment Day 1 will be regarded as the baseline value. At all following visits CGI-S will be rated. Each CGI item is scored on a scale from 1 to 7. A CGI-S score of 1 indicates that a patient is &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a score of 7 indicates that a patient is &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>

        <title>The Proportion of Patients With Improvement From Baseline to Week 4 in Clinical Global Impression-Clinical Benefit Score (LOCF)</title>
        <description>CGI-CB is used to evaluate the investigator's global weighted impression of efficacy and interference of adverse event from baseline to every visit. Improvement in clinical benefit is defined as a decrease from baseline in CGI-CB. Rank 1 denotes best possible benefit from new treatment and rank 10 indicates that there is no benefit from treatment.</description>

        <title>The Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in - YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale) Total Score</title>
        <description>The YMRS is an 11-item, multiple-choice diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure severity of manic episodes. There are 4 items graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, disruptive/aggressive behavior), and 7 items graded on 0 to 4 scale. These 4 items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients. Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on patients’ clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2.</description>

        <title>The CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of Illness) Change From Baseline to Week 4</title>
        <description>The Global Improvement scale (CGI-I) is scored to rate the patient’s change from baseline CGI. A CGI-I score of 1 indicates that a patient is “very much improved” and a score of 7 indicates that a patient is “very much worse.” CGI-I scores greater than 4 indicate worsening, while scores less than 4 indicate improvement. At all following visits CGI-I will also be rated. The following calculations will be made: Proportion of patients with CGI Global Improvement rating ≤ 2 at Day 29</description>

        <title>The Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness) Score</title>
        <description>The CGI-S is scored to rate patient’s current clinical state. At enrolment patient’s condition is rated using the CGI-S. At assignment CGI-S is again completed and a score of at least 4 (moderately ill). The score at assignment Day 1 will be regarded as the baseline value. At all following visits CGI-S will be rated. Each CGI item is scored on a scale from 1 to 7. A CGI-S score of 1 indicates that a patient is “Normal, not at all ill” and a score of 7 indicates that a patient is “Among the most extremely ill patients”.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>In March 2011, considering the low patient inclusion rate (32 patients recruited so far whereas study objective was 125 patients for 85 completers), the study was ended prematurely earlier than the planned date. No analysis was conducted afterwards.</limitations_and_caveats>
