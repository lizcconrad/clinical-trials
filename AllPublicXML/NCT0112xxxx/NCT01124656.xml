      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      pioglitazone-azilsartan, once daily (QD), in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      AD-4833-536 is a combination of AD-4833 (pioglitazone) and TAK-536 (azilsartan). Pioglitazone
      is an oral antidiabetic agent that acts by reducing insulin resistance and approved for
      treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Azilsartan is a angiotensin II
      receptor blocker that modulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood
      pressure. In a recent clinical trial conducted in subjects with moderately poor to poor
      control of their type 2 diabetes mellitus, azilsartan coadministered with pioglitazone showed
      a reduction in hemoglobin A1C and fasting plasma glucose levels.

      After a one week screening period, subjects will be stratified to receive a starting dose of
      pioglitazone-azilsartan (30 mg + 20 mg or 45 mg + 20 mg).

      The planned open-label treatment period was 52 weeks; however due to formulation issues, the
      study was prematurely discontinued and efficacy data were not analyzed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has type 2 diabetes with glycosylated hemoglobin ≥7.0 % to ≤ 11.0% at Screening.

          -  Has been on a stable diabetic diet/exercise program.

          -  If receiving anti-glycemic therapy, he/she must be on ≤ two (2) anti-glycemic agents
             and be on a stable regimen for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Has clinical laboratory evaluations at Screening (including clinical chemistry,
             hematology, and complete urinalysis) within the reference range for the testing
             laboratory unless the results are deemed not clinically significant for inclusion into
             this study by the investigator.

          -  A female subject of childbearing potential who is sexually active agrees to use
             adequate contraception from screening throughout the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
