  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response and safety in subjects receiving the
      drugs lenalidomide and azacitidine when each drug is given by itself and when the drugs are
      taken together. This study is open for patients with relapsed or refractory follicular or
      marginal zone lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, non-randomized, un-blinded, phase 2 efficacy trial using an
      Immunomodulatory derivatives of thalidomide (IMiDâ„¢)compound and a hypomethylating agent for
      epigenetic targeted therapies in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular and marginal
      zone lymphoma. There will be two parts to the trial. Each patient will progress through each
      part of the study.

      Part 1: Sequential single agent therapy with azacitidine and lenalidomide. Each agent will be
      given for four-six 28-day cycles.

      Subjects with less than a complete response (CR) after 4 cycles of study drug in Part 1a or
      1b should proceed to the next study drug(s) after the prescribed washout period.

      Subjects with a CR may receive up to 6 cycles of study drug and will not receive the next
      study drug(s) until there is evidence of progressive disease.

      There will be a 1-6 week 'washout' period between stopping and starting each agent in Part 1,
      unless rapid progression suggests holding therapy would not be in the patient's best
      interest. There will be no washout period required between Part 1 and Part 2.

      Part 2: Combination therapy with azacitidine and lenalidomide given in 28-day cycle for up to
      13 cycles in subjects who have stable disease or better.

A complete response is defined as a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is defined as a greater than or equal to 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease. Patients who have been on study drug for at least 2 months will be considered evaluable for response as long as they have had repeat imaging to assess response or clear progression based on physical exam.</description>

        <description>Number of patients with a complete or partial response using Cheson criteria for lymphoma.
A complete response is defined as a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is defined as a greater than or equal to 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease. Patients who have been on study drug for at least 2 months will be considered evaluable for response as long as they have had repeat imaging to assess response or clear progression based on physical exam.</description>
        <time_frame>Response will be assessed after at least 4 months on first study drug.</time_frame>
