  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WHIMS-Y provides valuable information on the long-term effects on risk of cognitive
      impairment of hormone therapy in a subset of WHI participants in the WHI Hormone Trials.
      Following cessation of study-prescribed HT cognitive function and impairment were assessed.

      The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Younger Women (WHIMS-Y) is proposed to assess
      the long-term impact of random assignment to postmenopausal hormone therapy (equine estrogen
      alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone versus placebo) among women who were aged
      50-54 at the time of randomization into the WHI hormone trials. Secondary objectives relate
      to the consistency of any treatment effects across unopposed or opposed therapy and whether
      there exists evidence of graded relationships between cognitive effects and age of
      administration, years from menopause, and baseline risk factors for cognitive impairment.

    <ipd_description>WHIMS-Y will follow guidelines, methods and processes as set forth in the WHI 2015-2020 Data Sharing Plan. Limited data sets will be archived on the WHIMS-Y website. Accompanying the limited data sets, substantial electronic documentation will be provided in a standard format that is readable on a variety of platforms. Documentation will include data collection forms, a description of study protocol and procedures, description of all variable re-coding and a list of major study publications. These data will be available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Data will be made available for timely release no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset.</ipd_description>
