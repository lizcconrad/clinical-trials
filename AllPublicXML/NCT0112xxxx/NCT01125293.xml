  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of the combination of everolimus,
      rituximab and bortezomib. Everolimus is a drug that works by preventing cells in your body
      from growing and dividing. Information from basic and other clinical research suggests that
      everolimus may also inhibit tumor growth in people with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. The
      FDA has approved everolimus for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a cancer that is closely
      related to Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. Rituximab is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which included Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.

      -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of a combination of study drugs that can be
           administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that
           have Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, not everyone who participates in this research
           study will receive the same combination of study drugs or the same dose of the study
           drug.

        -  In this research study every 4 week (28 day) period is called a cycle. While on study,
           participants will receive up to 6 cycles of combination treatment followed by everolimus
           alone for up to 2 years.

        -  Participants will take everolimus by mouth everyday, and will receive rituximab
           intravenously on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 on Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 only. If the participant
           receives bortezomib, it will be given intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 of every cycle.

        -  After the third cycle, tests will be done to see how the disease is responding to the
           study treatment. If the disease stays the same, or is helped, the participant will
           continue to get the combination of study treatment for another 3 cycles.
