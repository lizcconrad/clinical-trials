  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether using information from a special arterial blood pressure monitor
      to guide how much fluid is given during surgery changes how long a patient stays in the
      hospital after the surgery. There is scientific evidence from using similar information from
      different devices that this technique might allow us to do a better job giving fluids during
      surgery and that this may be associated with a shorter hospital stay after surgery.
