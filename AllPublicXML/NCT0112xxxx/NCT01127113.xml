  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction (heart attack) is usually the consequence of rupture of a fatty
      'plaque' in a heart artery. The presence of this fat and debris causes the propagation of a
      blood clot and blockage of the artery. The heart muscle normally supplied by the artery
      becomes deprived of oxygen and, if starved for long enough, this area of muscle dies. Much of
      the heart muscle damage is caused by overactivation of inflammatory cells. Whilst
      inflammation can be beneficial in healing processes, there is accumulating evidence that
      overactivation of inflammatory processes contributes to further muscle damage and cell death
      during myocardial infarction. We have recently developed a means of labelling human blood
      cells with 'nanoparticles' of iron oxide which can then safely be reinjected into the blood
      to allow the cells to be tracked and seen in the body using a conventional magnetic resonance
      scanner.

      In the proposed study we aim to recruit patients with recent heart attacks to perform similar
      cell labelling and reinjection of labelled cells into the same volunteer's blood stream via
      the arm to track the fate of the blood cells over the course of days to months. We think that
      the labelled inflammatory cells will 'home' to the site of the heart attack and will be
      visible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart. We aim not only to highlight the
      role of inflammatory cells in myocardial infarction, but also propose that, if successful,
      this technique could be used in the future to assess the effects of antiinflammatory
      treatments currently being developed for the treatment of patients with heart attacks. The
      technique could also be extended to allow labelling of other cell types, including stem
      cells, to let us further understand how these cells may contribute to repair of damaged
      organs including the heart.
