      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of alvespimycin
      hydrochloride in treating patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL). Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as alvespimycin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL
      and B-PLL.

      II. To define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL
      and B-PLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL and B-PLL.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of 17-DMAG in patients with relapsed CLL/SLL and B-PLL.

      III. To determine the feasibility of measuring pharmacodynamic markers of 17-DMAG including
      the Hsp90 client proteins Akt and IKK-alpha/IKK-beta.

      IV. To determine if FoxD3 and downstream genes such as EPHA7 and ID4 are re-expressed in CLL
      cells following treatment with 17-DMAG.

      V. To correlate pharmacokinetic features of 17-DMAG with response, toxicity and
      pharmacodynamic endpoints.

      VI. To correlate risk parameters such as ZAP-70 with response to 17-DMAG.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive alvespimycin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 4,
      8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

             method of birth control; abstinence) for a time frame of 14 days prior to study entry
             and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the treating
             physician should be notified immediately

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for

             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier;
             corticosteroids alone will not be considered prior therapy, but must be discontinued

             for indications other than the primary malignancy

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known central nervous system involvement should be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop

             composition to 17-DMAG

             infection requiring iv antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 17-DMAG is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with 17-DMAG, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with 17-DMAG

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             17-DMAG
