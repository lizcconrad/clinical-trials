      The purpose of this study is to evaluate of functional tests and clinical findings with APOS
      System treatment in patient after bi-trimalleolar fracture of ankle. These functional changes
      will be evaluated AOFS, FAOS, SF36 and WOMAC scores, walking laboratory GAITRite and clinical
      examination.

      Trial design Prospective, comparative, randomize trial. The patients after surgery due to bi
      or trimalleolar fracture of ankle, that were referred to the physiotherapy treatment, 3 weeks
      cast and 6 weeks from surgery with full weight bearing indicated by orthopedic

        -  The population will randomized separated in trail and control group/ Both receive APOS
           shoes The trial group will receive APOS walking system

        -  The control group will receive the same walking protocol as the trial group without
           biomechanics units.

             1. st visit: enrollment of patient - 6 weeks post op 1. The patient will be given a
                full verbal and written explanation regarding the trial and treatment. The patient
                will sign the informed consent form and will be given a serial number.

           2. The screening forms will be completed. 3. Demographic data: date of birth, sex, age
           and complete medical history, height and previous treatments will be recorded.

           4. Physical examination: range of motion, Achilles tendon thickness. The results will be
           recorded in the CRF 5. Walking test using a laboratory walking GAITRite + 6 minute walk
           test 6. Fill out questionnaire: FAOS - AOSF - SF36 - WOMAC 7. Adjustment of Apos walking
           System

           2nd visit: 12 weeks post op
