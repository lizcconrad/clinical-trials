    <textblock>
      To describe the type II diabetes population in primary care with special reference to
      treatment, other diseases and mortality during the last decade. To test the hypothesis that
      the type or combination of per oral glucose lowering drugs have different effects on the risk
      of cardiovascular disease and diabetic complications.

        Eligible subjects are all type II diabetes patients, found in medical records at the
        participating centres. Patient data from the period 1 January 1999 - 31 December 2009 will
        be included in the observation. To ensure a representative selection of primary care
        centers, selection of study sites will be based on the following criteria to ensure a
        representative sample of the Swedish population: a mix of rural and urban areas, public and
        private care providers, small, mid sized and large primary care centers.
