      The primary objective is to compare the predicted lifetime risk values produced by SNP panel
      assessment to the risk values produced by the prediction models that are most commonly used.
      A second objective is to examine whether the incorporation of risk assessment panels
      (standard or SNP based) can improve the positive value of breast biopsies in women with
      BIRADS 4 mammograms.

      Calculating the risk that a woman will develop breast cancer in her lifetime can lead to
      decreased mortality rates as a result of increased screening and prevention methods when a
      person is known to be at high risk. Though there are several risk assessment models that are
      commonly used, it is important to continue to improve the process of calculating risk.
      Several genetic markers have been noted to potentially indicate risk of developing breast
      cancer. New tests, called SNP panels, can detect some of these genetic markers. This study
      aims to use both these SNP panels and the commonly used risk models to calculate risk and
      examine outcomes in women coming in to do screening mammography. This study will enroll women
      between the ages of 40-65 who are undergoing screening mammography (n=1000), in addition to
      women with BIRADS category 4 mammogram readings who are about to undergo biopsy (n=600), all
      with no personal history of breast or ovarian cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), mantle
      radiation, or known BRCA 1/2/mutation in self or family members. The participants will only
      be expected rto provide consent, swabs of the inside of the cheek of her mouth, and baseline
      questionnaire answers that will allow for a risk assessment to be performed.

    <measure>Predicted Risk Category and Prevention Recommendations</measure>
    <description>The predicted risk category and prevention recommendations which are based upon the category each patient falls into after risk assessment using either a traditional or a SNP-based approach. Change in PPV of mannographic biopsy by stratification into low and high risk groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tests and Evaluations</measure>
    <description>Secondary Outcome will be determining the number of women who are ordered and/or complete tests and/or evaluations if there are abnormal imaging results during mammography or if they have high lifetime risk. These will be measured through access to the electronic medical records (EMR) and/or through a follow up survey.</description>

        Adult women will be recruited for this study. Women undergoing screening mammography will
        be chosen if they are between the ages of 40 and 65. Women will be excluded if they have a
        personal history of breast or ovarian cancer, DCIS, or mantle radiation, or known BRCA 1/2
        mutation in self or in family members.

             a BIRADS category 4 mammogram result.

        Exclusion Criteria:
