    <textblock>
      Gabapentin is a first line medication and fentanyl is second line medication in neuropathic
      pain. But, there is no head to head study on the efficacy of those medication in neuropathic
      pain.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the efficacy of the transdermal fentanyl matrix is not
      inferior to the gabapentin in neuropathic pain.

    <description>transdermal fentanyl matrix: during 1st to 6th days, 12ug/h of fentanyl matrix will be applied. During 7th to 28th days, the dosage of fentanyl matrix will be increased until the pain score decrease not more than 2 every 6 days. The maximal dosage is 100ug/h. During 29th to 56th days, the dosage will be maintained.
Gabapentin: the 1st day, 300mg hs, the 2nd day, 300mg bid, the 3th to 4th days, 300mg tid, the 5th to 6th days, 300mg-300mg-600mg the 7th to 28 days, the dosage will be increased until the pain score decreased not more than 2 and the maximal dose is 2400mg per day. During 29th to 56th days, the dosage will be maintained.</description>
