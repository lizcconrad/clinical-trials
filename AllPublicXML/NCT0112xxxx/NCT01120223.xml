      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once daily use of LEO
      80185 gel in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 17) with scalp psoriasis. LEO 80185 gel has
      marketing approval in many countries under the brand names Xamiol® gel and Taclonex Scalp®
      Topical Suspension for the treatment of scalp psoriasis in adults. No studies have been
      performed in subjects younger than 18 years
