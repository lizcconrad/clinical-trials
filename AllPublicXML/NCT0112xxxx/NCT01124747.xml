  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the systemic disposition of ASP1585 after oral
      administration of 14C-labeled drug in healthy male subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive study drug for 18 days with a radioactive dose of study drug given on
      Day 15. Blood, urine and feces will be collected to confirm recovery of radioactivity.
