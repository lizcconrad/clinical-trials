      A randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of classification based cognitive functional
      physiotherapy according to the system proposed by Peter O'Sullivan as compared to manual
      therapy and exercise in patients with non specific chronic low back pain.

      The investigators hypothesis was that treatment targeted at the mechanism behind the problem
      from a multidimensional perspective would be superior to traditional treatment.

      NSCLBP is widely viewed as a multifactorial biopsychosocial pain syndrome. It has been
      proposed by several authors that NSCLBP represents a vicious cycle associated with different
      combinations of maladaptive; cognitive (negative beliefs, fear avoidance behaviours,
      catastrophising, depression, stress, lack of pacing and coping), physical (pain provocative
      postures, movement patterns and pain behaviours) and lifestyle (inactivity, rest) behaviours
      that act to promote pain and disability. However a recent systematic review suggests that
      this change in paradigm and our new understanding of NSCLBP has not resulted in clinical
      trials utilizing multidimensional classification systems or targeted interventions based on
      the underlying mechanisms. line with this shift in paradigm a novel multidimensional
      classification system has been developed incorporating the biopsychosocial model, which
      subgroups patients based on their presentation of. with matched interventions directed at the
      maladaptive cognitive, physical and lifestyle behaviours associated with the disorder.

    <description>A novel multidimensional classification system has been developed incorporating the biopsychosocial model, which subgroups patients based on their presentation with matched interventions directed at the maladaptive cognitive, physical and lifestyle behaviours associated with the disorder. The intervention is called 'cognitive functional therapy' as it directly challenges these behaviours in a functionally specific and graduated manner.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group was treated with joint mobilization or manipulation techniques applied to the spine or pelvis primarily and was designed to be consistent with best current manual therapy practice in Norway. The particular dose and techniques were at the discretion of the treating therapist, based on each participant's objective and physical examination findings. In addition most of the patients in this group was given exercises or a home exercise program.</description>
