  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this feasibility study is to determine the therapeutic potential of the L19SIP
      antibody, labeled with the radionuclide 131I in combination with radiochemotherapy, for the
      treatment of patients with newly diagnosed, unresectable, locally-advanced NSCLC following
      the promising results with this agent in previous clinical studies.

      The L19SIP antibody is a fully human antibody, capable of preferential localization around
      tumor blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a
      rare event in the adult (with the exception of the female reproductive tract), but it is a
      characteristic pathological feature for most types of aggressive cancer.

    <description>Lung tumor irradiation with a total dosage of between 60-66 Gy, fractionated in combination with the following concurrent chemotherapy options:
Cohorts 1, 2 &amp; 3a is composed of cisplatin i.v. 80 mg/m2 on day 1, and vinorelbine i.v. 25 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 for cycle 1 &amp; 4. For patients with significant comorbidities, the dose of vinorelbine is reduced to 12.5 mg/m2 during cycles 2 &amp; 3. Treatment cycles will be repeated every 28 days.
Protocol A (suggested for patients with comorbidities: Carboplatin 70 mg/m2, over 30 min iv, (Day 1-5 ) + Vinorelbine 12.5 mg/m2 as a 5-min bolus iv or short iv-infusion (Day 1, 8, 22), repeated on Day 28.
Protocol B (suggested for patients in good clinical condition): Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 1 hour iv (Day 1, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50) + Carboplatin AUC 2, 30 min iv on (Day 1, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50).
Total treatment duration is 8-16 weeks</description>
