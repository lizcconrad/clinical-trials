      Acanthosis Nigricans is skin disease that associated with hyperinsulinemia. Clinical is
      velvety hyperpigmented plaques on neck, axilla, groin. If hyperinsulinemia is improved by
      treated with oral metformin and/ or diet control, acanthosis nigricans would be improved as
      well. Hyperpigmented plaques will be changed. We assess objective measurement by using
      spectroscopic and colorimetric analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have an elevated fasting insulin level, suggesting they are in an
             insulin resistant state.

          2. Subjects must carry a diagnosis of acanthosis nigricans, which will be verified by a
             Dermatologist before entry into the study. If necessary, a small 4mm punch biopsy may
             be taken to document dermatopathology consistent with acanthosis nigricans.

          3. Subjects must be willing and able to undergo treatment with Metformin, including
             initial referral and follow up.

          4. Agree to abide by the investigator's guidelines

          5. Be able to understand the requirements of the study, the risks involved and are able
             to sign the informed consent form

          6. Agree to follow and undergo all study-related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes are excluded because of their naturally
             insulin-deficient, rather than hyper-insulinemic, states.

          2. Women who are lactating, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant.

          3. Any reason the investigator feels the patient should not participate in the study.
