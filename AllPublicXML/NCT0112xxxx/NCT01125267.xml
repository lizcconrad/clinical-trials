  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project evaluates a culturally adapted, family-based intervention designed to promote
      treatment adherence among Mexican-Americans with schizophrenia using a randomized, controlled
      design in a public mental health setting. Mexican-American patients with schizophrenia and
      their families were randomly assigned to either: 1) one year of multi- family groups that
      emphasize the importance of attitudes towards adherence, subjective norms, and self-perceived
      and actual adherence skills in maintaining adherence, added to ongoing customary outpatient
      care; 2) standard multi-family groups without an emphasis on medication adherence, added to
      customary outpatient care; or 3) customary outpatient care only (monthly pharmacotherapy
      sessions and additional services as clinically needed). The study hypotheses are that
      subjects assigned to the adapted multi-family group would have better medication adherence,
      less psychiatric symptoms and fewer psychiatric hospitalizations throughout the course of the
      study (one year of treatment and one year of follow up) compared to the comparison
      conditions.

    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Psychiatric hospitalization will be monitored through the use of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health Management Information System. This allows for the data capture of all participants who are hospitalized in an inpatient unit anywhere in Los Angeles County throughout the two-yaer course of the study. Although the primary outcome variable is whether or not a participant has been hospitalized within a given assessment period, the number of hospitalizations and the number of days hospitalized across all assessment periods will be assessed, as well.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants who are at least 80% adherent to their antipsychotic medication regimens during a particular assessment period</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Multi-modal method of assessing medication adherence including pill count, pharmacy records and interviews of patient, key relative and treating psychiatrist. Using the Treatment Compliance Interview, participants will be rated as either non-adherent (less than 50% adherence), partially adherent (50%-79% adherent) or fully adherent (80% or greater).</description>
