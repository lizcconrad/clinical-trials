  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Throat swabbing is an important instrument in the diagnosis of strep pharyngitis and
      sometimes the main argument for antibiotic treatment. There is no firm knowledge about an
      appropriate method of the swabbing for receiving maximal sensitivity. We hypothesize that
      accurate swabbing from the pus will increase the sensitivity of the swabbing as compared to
      free swabbing. In order to check this hypothesis we will compare two swabs from the same
      throat. One that will be taken by a physician specifically from the pass and the second will
      be taken by a nurse as she used to do it. An increase of 10% of positive results will be
      accepted as a significant advantage.
