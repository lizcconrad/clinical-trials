      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Patients with Stage IIIC and Stage IV
      Melanoma experience benefit when treated with Denileukin diftitox in two different dosing
      schedules.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose/schedule and clinical efficacy study in patients with
      Stage IIIC and Stage IV melanoma.

      Dose-Schedules: This is a schedule, dose, and pharmacodynamic study of Denileukin diftitox in
      in patients with Stage IIIC and Stage IV melanoma. Two arms of 40 patients each were
      originally planned (see below) for a total of 80 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to
      1 of 2 arms: 1. 12 mcg/kg/day on Days 1 through 4 of each 21-day treatment cycle, for a total
      of 4 cycles (12 weeks); 2. 12 mcg/kg/day on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day treatment cycle,
      for a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks). Patients will be evaluated for (clinical response, safety
      and tolerability, and pharmacodynamic measures of ONTAK activity. An optional substudy will
      be conducted that will involve collection of serial tumor biopsies at study entry and Day 84
      in order to assess tissue pharmacodynamic markers of ONTAK activity (Treg depletion in tumor,
      appearance of melanoma antigen-specific CD8+lymphocytes, and other markers of mucosal
      immunity and inflammatory response).

      Following an amendment, patients will be enrolled in Arm 1 only (expanded to a total of 55
      patients) and Arm 2 was closed. According to the original design, if two responses or less
      were observed among 22 patients on either arm, that arm would be discontinued.

      Patients experiencing clinical benefit (immune-related stable disease [irSD], immune-related
      partial response [irPR], or immune-related complete response [irCR] per irRC) after 4 cycles
      of treatment, may continue their denileukin diftitox treatment for up to 8 cycles

    <description>Test product: dose and mode of administration:
denileukin diftitox was originally administered by intravenous infusion over 30-60 minutes according to 1 of 2 treatment arms:
12 mcg/kg/day on Days 1 through 4 of each 21-day treatment cycle, for a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks);
12 mcg/kg/day on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day treatment cycle, for a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks)
