  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and Brain CT
      (Computed Tomography) Angiogram data in subjects who participate in the &quot;Hyperbaric Oxygen
      for Chronic Stable Brain Injury&quot; (HYBOBI) study. Including information from MRI and CT
      studies provide information about whether hyperbaric oxygen improves brain function in
      subjects who have had a brain injury. Subjects will complete MR and CT scans twice during the
      study. The first MR and CT will be performed prior to the first hyperbaric session of the
      HYBOBI study, and the second will be performed within two weeks following the last hyperbaric
      session.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an ongoing feasibility study (HYBOBI), brain-injured subjects are exposed to hyperbaric
      oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres for 60 minutes. They receive this exposure five days per week, and
      receive 60 total sessions. Prior to hyperbaric oxygen, these study subjects have neurologic,
      cognitive, and functional measures. The measures are repeated at the conclusion of 60
      hyperbaric oxygen sessions, and again six months later. The goal of the HYBOBI feasibility
      study is to learn about these patients and determine possible hyperbaric oxygen effects, if
      any, to prepare for a blinded randomized controlled clinical trial.

      This study adds an imaging component to the HYBOBI study, further investigating brain changes
      in participants. Participants will undergo Brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) using a 3
      tesla magnet, and Brain CT (Computed Tomography) Angiogram. Subjects will undergo imaging
      before receiving hyperbaric oxygen and within 2 weeks of completion of the 60 hyperbaric
      sessions.

    <description>The first prime outcome measure will be auditory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation, comparing post-hyperbaric oxygen to pre-hyperbaric oxygen. This is a categorical variable: absent, mild, moderate, normal, and increasing. We will look at the difference between pre-hyperbaric (pre-HBO2) and post-hyperbaric (post-HBO2) scans graphically and descriptively, with the percentage of patients who show any improvement (any change towards normal).</description>
