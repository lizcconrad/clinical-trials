  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of Metamin 3D on improvement of glucose and lipid on Taiwanese
      subjects with metabolic syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Metamin 3D consists of mixed extractives of nature plants, including soy bean protein,
      bitter melon, red yeast rice, green algae and trisodium glycyrrhizinate. the improvement of
      lipid and glucose was reported respectively previously. We design a prospective,
      double-blinded and placebo-controlled study to evaluate the improvement on metabolic
      syndrome.
