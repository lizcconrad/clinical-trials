      This is a Phase 1, open label, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, MTD, and PK/PDn
      of Oprozomib when administered orally (PO) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of a 14 day cycle in
      patients with advanced refractory or recurrent solid tumor malignancies for which standard
      curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.
