  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project is a natural extension of a programmatic line of investigation into the
      relationship between exercise, brain aging, and AD that Dr. Burns has developed over the last
      four years. The current study will provide data to estimate expected effect sizes for power
      analyses and sample size calculations. It will also provide an opportunity to optimally
      design a larger trial that can be extended to multiple sites to more definitively examine the
      role of exercise as a therapy in AD. The current project's aims are an important and
      necessary developmental step given the lack of fitness data in AD and the limited knowledge
      of the mechanisms that may form the basis of an association between aerobic fitness and AD.

    <time_frame>week 0, 13, and 26</time_frame>
    <description>A composite measure of several memory tests (Logical Memory (Immediate and Delayed), Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (sum of free recall). Each score was normalized to an independent dataset of individuals without dementia. Then the 4 standardized scores were averaged.
Numbers closer to positive indicate better memory performance. The scores are centered around a mean of 0 and standardized so each value represents a fraction of the standard deviation. There are no limits to the scores.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this group will perform 150 minutes a week of aerobic exercise over 3-5days. Participants will begin exercising 3 times the first week for 20 minutes, increasing to three bouts of 25 minutes the second week. Thereafter, weekly exercise duration will be increased until their target duration of 150 minutes is achieved in week 6. Exercise trainers will assist participants in adjusting exercise routines to achieve their weekly exercise duration goals. Use of equipment, achievement of target HR and safety will be closely monitored by the trainer through the course of the study. Each subject will wear a Polar F4 heart monitor (Polar USA) for recording heart rate during each exercise session. Subjects unable to exercise continuously on the treadmill will perform intermittent training until the target duration is reached. The majority of the exercise sessions will involve walking on a treadmill.</description>

    <description>This groups intervention is designed to match the aerobic exercise intervention with respect to participation and socialization. Stretching and toning has been repeatedly used as control intervention for exercise studies.The schedule and format will be identical to the aerobic conditioning group to best balance confounding variables such as attention, social interactions, and other unknown variables that might influence the results. An experienced and trained exercise instructor will run the stretching sessions three days a week at the local YMCA. We will monitor changes in heart rate with Polar F4 heart monitors (Polar USA) during the sessions to assess, and minimize, potential aerobic benefits from the intervention.</description>

          <title>Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes</title>
          <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment &amp; Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home &amp; Hobbies, and Personal Care. The sum of each domain (CDR Sum of Boxes) is used as a measure of dementia severity from 0 (no impairment) to 18 (severe impairment).</description>

Numbers closer to positive indicate better memory performance. The scores are centered around a mean of 0 and standardized so each value represents a fraction of the standard deviation. There are no limits to the scores.</description>

            <description>Aerobic Exercise: Participants randomized to this group will perform 150 minutes a week of aerobic exercise over 3-5days. Participants will begin exercising 3 times the first week for 20 minutes, increasing to three bouts of 25 minutes the second week. Thereafter, weekly exercise duration will be increased until their target duration of 150 minutes is achieved in week 6. Exercise trainers will assist participants in adjusting exercise routines to achieve their weekly exercise duration goals. Use of equipment, achievement of target HR and safety will be closely monitored by the trainer through the course of the study. Each subject will wear a Polar F4 heart monitor (Polar USA) for recording heart rate during each exercise session. Subjects unable to exercise continuously on the treadmill will perform intermittent training until the target duration is reached. The majority of the exercise sessions will involve walking on a treadmill.</description>

Stretching and toning has been repeatedly used as control intervention for exercise studies.The schedule and format will be identical to the aerobic conditioning group to best balance confounding variables such as attention, social interactions, and other unknown variables that might influence the results. An experienced and trained exercise instructor will run the stretching sessions three days a week at the local YMCA. We will monitor changes in heart rate with Polar F4 heart monitors (Polar USA) during the sessions to assess, and minimize, potential aerobic benefits from the intervention.</description>

        <description>The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia is a validate measure of depressive symptoms in individuals with dementia. Larger numbers indicate greater levels of depression. Scores range from 0 to 38.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0, 13, and 26</time_frame>

            <title>Aerobic Exercise</title>
            <description>Aerobic Exercise: Participants randomized to this group will perform 150 minutes a week of aerobic exercise over 3-5days. Participants will begin exercising 3 times the first week for 20 minutes, increasing to three bouts of 25 minutes the second week. Thereafter, weekly exercise duration will be increased until their target duration of 150 minutes is achieved in week 6. Exercise trainers will assist participants in adjusting exercise routines to achieve their weekly exercise duration goals. Use of equipment, achievement of target HR and safety will be closely monitored by the trainer through the course of the study. Each subject will wear a Polar F4 heart monitor (Polar USA) for recording heart rate during each exercise session. Subjects unable to exercise continuously on the treadmill will perform intermittent training until the target duration is reached. The majority of the exercise sessions will involve walking on a treadmill.</description>

            <title>Stretching</title>
            <description>Stretching: This groups intervention is designed to match the aerobic exercise intervention with respect to participation and socialization. Stretching and toning has been repeatedly used as control intervention for exercise studies.The schedule and format will be identical to the aerobic conditioning group to best balance confounding variables such as attention, social interactions, and other unknown variables that might influence the results. An experienced and trained exercise instructor will run the stretching sessions three days a week at the local YMCA. We will monitor changes in heart rate with Polar F4 heart monitors (Polar USA) during the sessions to assess, and minimize, potential aerobic benefits from the intervention.</description>
