      The research project CHAIN (COPD Assessment History in Spain): &quot;A Multidimensional Study on
      the Evolution of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)is a multicentre, observational
      study conducted in several areas of Spain aimed to better define COPD natural history and its
      phenotypes

      Observational studies are needed to ascertain the natural history and progression of COPD,
      and to better define its phenotypes. These two aspects are considered fundamental to a proper
      evaluation of current (and future) COPD treatment options, and it could possibly justify the
      limited impact of recent major drug trials.

      Currently, there remain gaps in the natural history of patients with COPD. Most data are from
      analysis of mild COPD patients or smokers, usually measuring only fall in FEV1, and both have
      significant limitations in design and interpretation.

      Studies in more severe patients with COPD have also been conducted mainly by studying lung
      function, possibly influenced by the recommendations of current guidelines for disease
      management. In recent years, we have more longitudinal data on changes in exercise capacity,
      imaging, and biomarkers, among other variables of interest, but our knowledge is yet partial.

      The research project CHAIN (COPD Assessment History in Spain): &quot;A Multidimensional Study on
      the Evolution of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a multicenter observational
      study that will follow prospectively two cohorts: a) a COPD group active or former smokers
      (COPD cohort) and b) a group of active smokers or former smokers without COPD (control
      cohort). Both cohorts will be followed up for a period of at least 5 years, with visits every
      12 months (and phone controls at least every 6 months). We will try to extend the monitoring
      of the cohort up to 10 years. CHAIN is supported by the PII of COPD SEPAR
