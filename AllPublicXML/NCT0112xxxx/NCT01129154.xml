  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most common malignancies in caucasian population.
      The effect of the immune system on the development of skin tumors has been demonstrated in
      transplant patients taking immunosuppressive agents (65 fold risk increase). It has been
      reported that activation of EGFR and RAS signaling pathways play an important role in disease
      progression maybe through downregulation of the immune system.

      The investigators want to treat unresectable SCC patients with an antibody against EGFR
      (Vectibix®, panitumumab). This antibody induces tumor regression in metastatic colorectal
      cancer and has been approved as single agent for this indication.

      The investigators want to measure the response rate but also analyze the modification of
      expression profile of some key proteins involved or supposed to be involved in the signaling
      pathways of EGFR and in the regulation of the immune system. Chemokines such as CCL27 have
      been shown to play a critical role in the skin-associated immune response by regulating T
      cell homing. Pivarcsi et al have reported that downregulation of CCL27 is mediated by
      activation of EGFR/RAS/MAPK signaling pathways.

      This is an open-label, multicentric study of 17 patients with skin squamous cancer cell.

      Eligible patients should not be suitable for immediate surgery. If they have only one tumor,
      it should be greater than 3 cm2 in order to allow multiple biopsies.

      Patients will receive six infusions of Panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks or until progression
      if earlier.

      Patients will be assessed at baseline, at week 6 and then every 12 weeks till progression. In
      addition to clinical examination, evaluation tools will include photography and CT-scan, MRI
      or PET-scan.

      Skin and tumor biopsies will be performed during first cycle at baseline and at days 2, 4, 8,
      43, 85. Blood collections for translational research will be done during first cycle at
      baseline and at days 2, 4, 8,15, 43, 85. Blood collection for hematology and chemistry
      assessment will be done each 4weeks.

      Patients presenting with a stable disease or a tumor response at week 12 will be eligible for
      maintenance cycles consisting in an infusion of panitumumab every 2 weeks till progression.

    <description>Time to treatment failure (TTF) is defined as the time from date of first dose of study medication to first occurrence of any following event : documentation of objective tumor progression, toxicities requiring prematurely stop of treatment or death. TTF will be calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier technique. Time to Progression will also be calculated. Subjects without evidence of progression at the end of follow up will be considered as censored.</description>
