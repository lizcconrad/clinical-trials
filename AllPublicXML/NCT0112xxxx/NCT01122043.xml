      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical safety and efficacy of the EndoGlide
      as a donor insertion device in DSAEK surgery. The investigators hypotheses is that the
      Endoglide will cause less endothelial damage compared to the investigators previous technique
      of glide insertion but will have the same low complication rate as the previous device. Hence
      the investigators aim to evaluate the surgical efficacy of the EndoGlide to enable consistent
      double coiling of the donor lenticule in DSAEK surgery with minimal endothelial touch.
      Evaluate ease of insertion of the EndoGlide through a 4 to 4.5mm scleral tunnel wound.
      Evaluate ability of the EndoGlide to consistently effect complete wound sealing, so as to
      stabilize anterior chamber with an AC maintainer in position. Evaluate ease of donor
      pull-through from the EndoGlide chamber into the AC and to evaluate spontaneous uncoiling of
      the donor in the AC. Evaluate clinical efficacy and safety outcomes in EndoGlide assisted
      DSAEK surgery in study patients with corneal decompensation requiring DSAEK surgery, in terms
      of postoperative visual acuity, primary graft failure rate, donor dislocation rate,
      endothelial cell loss, and deturgescence of the host cornea and donor lenticule as measured
      by corneal thickness parameters with the Visante AS-OCT. The investigators will perfprm a
      prospective Phase II clinical trial using the EndoGlide for donor insertion in 100 corneal
      patients referred to the SNEC Corneal Clinics of the study investigators with moderate
      degrees of corneal decompensation from a variety of disorders which require DSAEK corneal
      transplantation surgery, with or without concurrent cataract surgery, to restore visual
      acuity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. patients presenting with corneal decompensation or bullous keratopathy requiring
             corneal transplantation for visual restoration and pain relief

          2. Clinical diagnoses including post-surgical forms of corneal decompensation (all forms
             of pseudophakic and aphakic bullous keratopathy including TASS and irreversible
             Descemets detachment), post-laser corneal decompensation, Fuchs' and other forms of
             endothelial dystrophy, traumatic corneal decompensation, post-inflammatory corneal
             decompensation, etc.

          3. Mild to moderate forms of corneal decompensation

          4. patients who agree to study participation following full informed consent

          5. patients who agree to adhere to the standard SNEC clinical DSAEK protocol in terms of
             pre and postoperative investigations and follow-up visits up to 12 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe forms or late stage presentation of corneal decompensation with severe corneal
             stromal scarring, unsuitable for DSAEK surgery as apposed to penetrating keratoplasty

          2. patients with complex anterior segment complications precluding a successful DSAEK
             procedure

          3. patients unkeen to participate in the clinical trial
