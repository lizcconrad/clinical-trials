  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neisseria meningitidis occurs worldwide as endemic disease1 and is a major cause of invasive
      infections such as meningitis and septicaemia. Three protein-polysaccharide conjugate
      serogroup C meningococcal (MenC) vaccines were developed in the late 1990's and an
      accelerated programme of clinical trials in the UK led to licensure of these MenC vaccines in
      1999 and these vaccines were introduced into the routine infant immunisation schedule at 2, 3
      and 4 months. However, children who were aged 1-18 years in 2000 only received a single dose
      of a MenC conjugate vaccine during the mass immunisation campaign.

      Previous studies have demonstrated rapid waning of MenC specific antibody concentrations and
      serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) titres following immunisation in young children. A
      cross-sectional review on rates of sero-protection against MenC disease in the UK has
      demonstrated that the majority of children who were immunised with a single dose of a MenC
      conjugate vaccine between the ages of 1-10 did not have protective titres of MenC SBA 7 years
      after the immunisation campaign. As this cohort of children reaches adolescence there is a
      risk of increased transmission of the organism and a resurgence of meningococcal disease in
      children who do not have protective levels of antibody. There is thus a need to conduct a
      study evaluating the changes in MenC SBA titres over time in children who received a single
      dose of a MenC vaccine in early childhood which is the main objective of this study.
