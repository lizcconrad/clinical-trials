    <textblock>
      Makers of ionic foot baths claim that their machines can eliminate heavy metals from the
      body. Researchers at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine are evaluating the ability
      of an ionic foot bath to help eliminate heavy metals from the body by rigorously testing the
      machine under controlled conditions. The machine will first be tested without feet under
      normal operating conditions and again after operation under normal conditions with foot
      immersion.

    <measure>Change in heavy metal content in the water after a 30 minute IonCleanse footbath</measure>
    <time_frame>4 sessions, May 26 to June 17 2010</time_frame>
    <description>The footbath water will be assessed after each footbath session for each participant via a drinking water assessment performed by an accredited lab.
Screening for heavy metals will be done via a 24 urine collection and Urine Toxic Metals assessment four times during the study - baseline, during 2nd and 4th footbath sessions and then at the 3 month mark post baseline.</description>
