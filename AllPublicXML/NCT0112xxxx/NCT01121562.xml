    <measure>Clinical Benefit Response Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 799 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>CBR rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR), confirmed partial response (PR) ,or stable disease (SD) ≥ 24 weeks.
Based on RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as a greater than or equal to 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesion. SD is defined neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest dimensions since the treatment started.</description>

    <measure>Tumor Shrinkage</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 799 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor shrinkage is defined as the percent change from baseline for the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions in participants.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 799 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from registration to first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years from the last subject registration to the study</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration to documentation of death due to any cause.</description>

    <measure>Dose-corrected Trough Plasma Concentrations of Sunitinib, SU012662 and Total Drug (Sunitinib + SU012662).</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose of Cycle 1 Day15, Cycle 2 Day1, Cycle 3 Day1, and Cycle 4 Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Reference dose is 37.5 mg. Dose-corrected concentration is calculated from the following formula, &quot;observed concentration multiplied by 37.5&quot; over &quot;actual dose&quot;.
SU012662 is an active metabolite of sunitinib.</description>
