  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will try to define an appropriate dose of the investigational drug indocyanine
      green (ICG) in combination with near infrared (NIR) imaging to use for future studies.

      ICG is a dye which has been in use since the 50s, and is approved for testing liver function
      and measuring blood flow from the heart. It has been used in studies to map lymphatic
      pathways in lung and breast cancer and information from those studies suggest it may help
      identify lymph nodes associated with melanoma. ICG can be detected within the body using
      near-infrared light cameras.

      In this study the investigators are looking at how easily ICG can get to the first lymph node
      (sentinel lymph node [SLN]) associated with melanoma, whether the investigators can see the
      path of the ICG and the SLN using a near infrared camera, and what dose of ICG works the
      best. While the current method for SNL mapping, known as lymphoscintigraphy, is effective it
      does provide a small amount of radiation. This study will compare the investigators results
      to the standard procedure.

    <textblock>
      At the time of surgery, you will undergo a lymphoscintigraphic procedure which is standard of
      care for patients with melanoma. You will also receive a dose of ICG mixed with human serum
      albumin. This will be administered in four small injections immediately around your tumor or
      the tumor scar if it has already been removed. Pictures of the ICG solution will be taken
      with the NIR camera and the progression of the dye along the lymphatic channel from your
      tumor to the SLN will be monitored.

      As each lymph node is removed, pictures will be taken to see if the ICG dye has entered and
      colored that node. We will compare this technique with the results from the
      lymphoscintigraphy to measure accuracy.

      Patients will be followed for at least one hour post injection for adverse events. The
      patient will then be taken off of the study. The results from each intervention will
      subsequently analyzed.
