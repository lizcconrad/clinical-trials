  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) derived from human umbilical cord/placenta at a dose of 1.0E+6 MSC/kg on the subjects
      for refractory anemia (RA) and refractory anemia with ring sideroblast (RARS) of
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes are bone marrow stem cell disorders resulting in disorderly and
      ineffective hematopoiesis. MDS is characterized by variable degrees of cytopenias (anemia,
      neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia ) and risk of transformation to leukemia.

      To date treatment of MDS is unsatisfactory: chemotherapy has a limited role in the management
      of leukemic progression; autologous stem cell transplantation does not prolong relapse-free
      survival and stem cell transplantation is poorly tolerated in older individuals. Some MDS
      patients have been shown to respond to a wide variety of immunosuppressive agents ranging
      from corticosteroids to CsA and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). However, the overall response
      rate is less than 30%. In fact, few treatments appear to change the natural history of MDS.

      The management of MDS patients therefore remains to be improved. Human MSCs isolated from
      Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord/placenta have been shown to have immunosuppressive,
      stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue repairing properties. This study will evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of MSC transplant in the MDS patients.

      This study will last about 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      MSC transplant (Group 1) or CsA therapy alone (Group 2). Patients will undergo MSC transplant
      at the start of the study (defined as Day 0). After 3 months, patients will receive the
      second MSC transplantation when one responds well to the treatment. After 3, 6 and 12 months
      from the first transplantation, patients will be evaluated.
