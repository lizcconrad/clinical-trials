      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Eribulin Mesylate Administered in
      Combination with Pemetrexed is safe and tolerable and to gain a preliminary indication of
      clinical benefit when administered to Patients with Stage IIIB or IV Nonsquamous Non Small
      Cell Lung Cancer.

    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib portion: a safety
      run-in period with 3 ascending doses of eribulin; and a Phase II portion: a randomized 3-arm
      design. .

      Phase Ib-Patients will be recruited into cohorts, into one of two parallel arms evaluating
      different eribulin dosing schedules (Arm 1: eribulin on Day 1; Arm 2: eribulin on Days 1 and
      8), with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 patients per cohort. All patients will receive
      pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) in combination with eribulin. All patients in a cohort will receive
      the same dose level of eribulin and there will not be any intra-patient dose escalation.

      The dose level of eribulin will be escalated for additional cohorts in each of the two arms
      unless greater than or equal to 2 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are reported at the lower
      dose level(s) prior to enrollment of the next dose level.

      Phase II- Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either eribulin in
      combination with pemetrexed, in each of two dosing schedules (Arms 1 and 2), or pemetrexed
      alone (Arm 3). For both the Phase Ib and II portions, 1 cycle of therapy will last 21 days,
      with an estimated number of 6 cycles. Radiologic examinations including a computed tomography
      (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as appropriate (and CT or magnetic resonance
      imaging [MRI] as appropriate), will be performed during Screening and thereafter every 2
      cycles until disease progression.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients may be entered in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Male or female patient greater than or equal to 18 years of age;

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsquamous NSCLC stage IIIB with malignant
             pleural effusion or stage IV disease not amenable to curative therapy. Patients with
             history of stage III disease that have relapsed after chemo- and radiotherapy are also
             eligible;

          3. Have at least 1 site of measurable disease by the Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST) criteria;

          4. Have failed 1 prior platinum-doublet containing chemotherapy regimen for stage IIIB
             with malignant pleural effusion or stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC. One additional
             cytotoxic regimen is allowed for neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or neoadjuvant plus adjuvant
             therapy for Phase II patients. For patients enrolled in the Phase Ib portion, a
             maximum of three total prior regimens is allowed.

             Definition of a Chemotherapy Regimen: Any platinum-doublet containing chemotherapy,
             that may also include biological or targeted agents, and/or humanized antibodies,
             given concomitantly, sequentially, or both, is considered 1 regimen. If, due to
             toxicity, the dosing of 1 or more of the components must be reduced, or 1 or more of
             the components of the regimen must be omitted, or 1 of the components must be replaced
             with another similar drug, the changed version of the original regimen is not
             considered a new regimen. However, if a new component, dissimilar to any of the
             original components, is added to the regimen, the new combination is considered a new
             regimen. If the treatment is interrupted for surgery or radiotherapy, and then
             continues with an unchanged schedule and components, that treatment is considered as
             one regimen despite the interruption.

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months;

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) less than 1;

          7. Patients must have adequate renal function as evidenced by calculated creatinine
             clearance greater than 45 mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula;

          8. Patients receiving daily treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
             (NSAIDS) are eligible. Patients with creatinine clearance 45-79 ml/min must be able to
             interrupt NSAIDS 2 days before (5 days for long-acting NSAIDs), the day of, and 2 days
             following administration of pemetrexed;

          9. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) greater than 1.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dL (a hemoglobin
             less than 9.0 g/dL at Screening is acceptable if it is corrected to greater than 9
             g/dL by growth factor or transfusion prior to first dose), and platelet count greater
             than 100 x 10^9/L;

         10. Patients must have adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than 1.5
             times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN), and alkaline phosphatase, alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than 3 x ULN (in the
             case of liver metastases, less than 5 x ULN). If there are bone metastases,
             liver-specific alkaline phosphatase may be separated from the total and used to assess
             liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase;

         11. Male or female patients of child-producing potential must agree to use double barrier
             contraception, oral contraceptives, or avoidance of pregnancy measures during the
             study and for 90 days after the last day of treatment;

         12. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test;

         13. Females may not be breastfeeding; and

         14. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients may be entered in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Prior treatment with pemetrexed, epothilone, ixabepilone, patupilone, halichondrin B

          5. Received treatment in another clinical study within the 30 days prior to commencing
             study treatment or patients who have not recovered from side effects of an

         11. Patients with organ allografts requiring immunosuppression;

         12. Known positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known hepatitis B surface antigen,
