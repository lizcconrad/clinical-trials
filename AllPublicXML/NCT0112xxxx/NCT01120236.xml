    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying bicalutamide, goserelin, or leuprolide acetate to
      see how well they work when given with or without cixutumumab in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer
      cells. Antihormone therapy, such as bicalutamide, goserelin, or leuprolide acetate, may
      lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab,
      can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.
      It is not yet known whether bicalutamide, goserelin, or leuprolide acetate are more effective
      when given with or without cixutumumab in treating prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rate (PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/mL) after
      seven cycles (28 weeks) of protocol treatment between those randomized to a luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist and bicalutamide and those randomized to a LHRH
      agonist, bicalutamide and IMC-A12 (cixutumumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of IMC-A12 with a LHRH agonist
      and bicalutamide.

      II. To compare the proportion of men who do not achieve a PSA of &lt; 4 ng/mL between the two
      groups.

      III. To assess the accuracy of the prognostic model of undetectable PSA that was developed
      from Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)-9346 using current trial data from each arm.

      IV. To assess serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) for
      pharmacodynamic activity with potential biomarkers for IMC-A12 (including, but not limited
      to: insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-I, free IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein [IGFBP]2,
      IGFBP3, growth hormone, insulin and C-peptide) obtained from optional blood specimens both
      before initiation of androgen deprivation therapy and twelve weeks after initiation of
      combined therapy.

      V. To determine baseline pre-treatment circulating tumor cell (CTC) quantities and response
      to therapy (for those patients with detectable CTC levels &gt;= 1) twelve weeks later.

      VI. In the same subset of patients where CTC levels are obtained, determine baseline serum
      levels of micro-ribonucleic acids (RNAs) to include but not limited to microRNA (mi)-141 both
      before initiation of androgen deprivation therapy and twelve weeks after combined therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy comprising bicalutamide orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28 and either goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) or leuprolide
      acetate intramuscularly (IM) every 1, 3, 4, 6, or 12 months. Patients also receive
      cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy comprising bicalutamide and either
      goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate as in arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of
             adenocarcinoma of the prostate; note: If there is no formal biopsy report documenting
             the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the patient can be allowed on trial if the PSA level
             is at least 20, and there are at least three definitive metastatic lesions seen on
             scan; all patients must have had metastatic (M1) disease as evidenced by soft tissue
             and/or bony metastases prior to androgen deprivation therapy initiation; patients must
             have at least one of the following at the time they started androgen deprivation
             therapy:

               -  Visceral disease (liver, lung, or other viscera)

               -  Bone metastases to sites in either the axial (spine, pelvis, ribs, or skull)
                  and/or the appendicular (clavicle, humerus, or femur) skeleton

               -  Lymph node disease not considered to be encompassed within a single radiotherapy
                  port (e.g., above the aortic bifurcation, etc.)

          -  Patients who have measurable disease must have radiographic assessment (at least an
             abdominal/pelvic computed tomography [CT]) within 28 days prior to registration;
             non-measurable disease must also be assessed (e.g., bone scan) in all patients within
             56 days prior to registration; all disease must be assessed and documented on the
             Baseline Tumor Assessment Form

          -  Patients must have a PSA &gt;= 5 ng/mL obtained within 90 days prior to initiation of
             androgen deprivation therapy

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are not eligible; brain imaging studies are not
             required for eligibility if the patient has no neurologic signs or symptoms, but if
             brain imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease

          -  Patient must have had no more than 30 days of prior medical castration for metastatic
             prostate cancer (prior androgen deprivation therapy is allowed if it was received with
             curative intent in the neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant fashion and at least 2
             years have elapsed since completion of androgen deprivation therapy); the start date
             of medical castration is considered the day the patient first received an injection of
             a LHRH agonist, not an oral antiandrogen; if the method of castration is luteinizing
             hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (i.e., leuprolide or goserelin), the patient
             must be willing to continue the use of LHRH agonists and add bicalutamide for combined
             androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) during protocol treatment; the 30 day window begins
             from the date of receiving the LHRH agonist, not the oral antiandrogen; if the patient
             was on a different antiandrogen (e.g. flutamide), the patient must be willing to
             switch over to bicalutamide; patients must not have received bilateral orchiectomy;
             patients must not have received or be planning to receive LHRH antagonists (i.e.,
             Degarelix); however, if the patient was initiated on a LHRH antagonist within the 30
             day window and is willing to switch to a LHRH agonist with bicalutamide, he may enroll
             on the late induction group

          -  Patients who have not already started androgen deprivation therapy must be offered the
             opportunity to participate in the translational medicine studies; once a patient has
             started any form of antiandrogen (i.e., either bicalutamide or LHRH agonist), he is
             not eligible for any translational medicine studies

          -  Patients must not have received any prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic
             prostate cancer; prior cytotoxic chemotherapy with curative intent in the neoadjuvant
             or adjuvant setting is allowed; patients must not have received any prior treatment
             with agents that directly inhibit IGF or IGFRs

          -  Patients must not have received prior strontium-89, rhenium-186, rhenium-188, or
             samarium-153 radionuclide therapy within 28 days prior to registration

          -  Patients may have received prior radiation therapy or biologic therapy (e.g. vaccines,
             immunotherapy, anti-sense, small molecules, monoclonal antibodies); however, at least
             28 days must have elapsed since completion of therapy and patient must have recovered
             from all side effects

          -  Patients may have received prior surgery; for all major surgeries, at least 28 days
             must have elapsed since completion and patient must have recovered from all side
             effects

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000 mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500 mcL

          <title>Gleason Score</title>
          <description>This is a 2 to 10 grading system for prostate carcinoma devised by Dr. Donald Gleason in 1977 as a method for predicting the behavior of prostate cancer. Tumors with a low Gleason score are less likely to show aggressive behavior and therefore are less likely to have spread outside of the gland to lymph nodes. To obtain a Gleason score, the dominant tumor pattern is added to the second most prevalent pattern to obtain a number between 2 and 10. If a tumor has patterns 3 and 2, the score would be 5. If the tumor has only one pattern, then the single pattern is added to itself (e.g. 3+3=6).</description>
