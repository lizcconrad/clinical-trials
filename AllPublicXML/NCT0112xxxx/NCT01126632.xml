      Observing the effects of an Olympus cap on the visibility and in adenoma detection during
      colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To see if Colonoscopy with the CAP is able to give more visibility and to see if detection
      rate for adenomas, polyps are easier to detect.

    <description>Propose to perform a randomized controlled trial comparing cap-assisted colonoscopy with the standard colonoscopy to assess visibility. To see if it is easier to detect polyps, adenomas with the cap than without. This is standard procedure. Just comparing if it is better to use the cap during colonoscopy.</description>
