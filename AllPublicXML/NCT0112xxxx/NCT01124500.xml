  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of the Methylphenidate
      patch and a placebo patch (a patch that contains no medicine) on patients and their fatigue
      caused by cancer or by cancer treatment. The Methylphenidate patch contains a medication that
      is known to increase alertness and wakefulness. Oral methylphenidate has been used in the
      past to treat cancer related fatigue and is often used to treat unusual sleepiness. But this
      is the first time that the patch form is offered to try treating cancer fatigue in patients
      who cannot always swallow tablets.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the efficacy of sustained-release, transdermal methylphenidate compared to a placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>for 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>In reducing fatigue, increasing activity levels, and sustaining steady wakefulness throughout the day. The outcome measure will be BFI and ESS based self-reporting of the reduction of numeric rating scale on fatigue level and sleepiness, combined with objective measurement of increased activity intensity scores monitored by actigraphy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the feasibility of accelerometry-based objective outcome measures to assess improved activity levels and energy expenditure of cancer patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>for 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the feasibility of accelerometry-based objective outcome measures to assess improved activity levels and energy expenditure, will be evaluated by examining the patients' rating of their comfort while wearing the actigraphy device and of how willing they would be to wear the device for a future study.</description>

    <description>The proposed study is a within-subject, cross-over, randomized and double-blinded pilot trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of sustained-release, long-acting methylphenidate via transdermal patch compared to placebo in fatigued patients with Head and Neck malignancies</description>

    <description>The participants will start with a 10mg MPH patch on day -4, the 1st day of the titration period. This will be increased up to 20mg over 4-day titration period as needed and tolerated, and continued on the optimal dose. Subjects will be seen on day 1 of the double-blind part of the study at a patient education room or the Dr.'s office and receive 10 identical patches including 5 MPH and 5 placebo patches that will be randomly assigned over the 10-day course. The patch will be placed at 9am and removed at 4pm daily for 10 days. During the 10 days, each subject will be monitored for continuous 240 hours by actigraphy based activity monitors to follow activity levels and energy expenditure.</description>
