  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this small, short pilot study is to determine the feasibility (e.g.,
      recruitment, dose acceptance, retention) of a future longer trial comparing the effects of
      different types of milk (raw milk, cow's milk, nondairy-milk) on lactose maldigestion.

  <detailed_description>

      The goal is to determine if raw milk consumption intake will benefit humans with lactose
      maldigestion, a common human response to the intake of dairy products during adult years. An
      increasing number of people are consuming raw unpasteurized milk. Enhanced nutritional
      qualities, taste, and health benefits have all been advocated as reasons for increased
      interest in raw milk consumption.

      However, science-based data to substantiate these claims are limited or anecdotal.

      Raw milk may differ in its ability to improve lactose maldigestion related symptoms from
      other milk types. Adult lactose maldigestion affects the majority of the world adult
      population. It appears that consumption of lactose containing foods by those who cannot
      digest lactose is a relatively common cause of irritable bowel syndrome.
