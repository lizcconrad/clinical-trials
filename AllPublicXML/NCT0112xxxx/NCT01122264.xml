  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if treatment in erectile dysfunction with a
      long-acting drug (Tadalafil) taken once a day or taken as needed results in a longer
      treatment adherence and better long term outcomes (over 24 weeks), compared with a
      short-acting drug (Sildenafil Citrate) taken as needed.

    <measure>Time to Discontinuation of Randomized Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 334 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time to discontinuation of randomized treatment was defined as the number of days from randomization until the day the participant discontinued the randomized treatment. Discontinuation of randomized treatment was defined as switching between the 3 study treatments (tadalafil on demand, tadalafil once a day, or sildenafil citrate on demand) or discontinuing from all treatments. A change of dose within the same treatment was not considered switching of treatment. This outcome measure was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.</description>

    <measure>Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) Questionnaire at 4, 8, 16, and 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant questionnaire consists of 11 questions. Each question is rated on a scale of 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 4 (extremely high treatment satisfaction). The EDITS summary score was obtained by adding each individual result for all questions, dividing by the number of questions answered (mean satisfaction score), then multiplying by 25, thus obtaining a score range from 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 100 (extremely high satisfaction). Least Squares Mean changes were adjusted for treatment group, country, visit, and visit*treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 24 Week Endpoint of the Sexual Self-Confidence, Spontaneity, and Time Concerns Domains (23-items) of the Psychological and Interpersonal Relationships Scale (PAIRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAIRS is a 23-item scale that assesses broader psychological/interpersonal outcomes associated with erectile dysfunction and its treatment. Each question is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The scale consists of 3 domains: Sexual Self-Confidence (items 1-6), Spontaneity domain (items 7-15), and Time Concerns (items 16-23). The average domain score for each domain was calculated by adding the nonmissing items for the respective domain, then dividing by the number of nonmissing items for the respective domain. Each average domain score ranged from 1 to 4. Higher scores represent the following: greater sexual self-confidence (better outcome); greater spontaneity (better outcome); higher time concerns (worse outcome). The Least Squares Mean changes were adjusted for treatment group, country, baseline IIEF-EF severity, baseline domain score, and baseline domain score*treatment (if p&lt;0.10).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 4, 8, 16, and 24 Weeks of the Sexual Relationship Domain of the Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SEAR assesses psychosocial outcomes in men with erectile dysfunction. Sexual Relationship domain consists of 8 items (items 1-8). Items 2-8 are rated on a scale of 1 (Never) to 5 (Always), whereas item 1 is reverse scored (1=Always and 5=Never). The domain score was computed by summing its respective items, then transforming it into a 0 (least favorable) to 100 (most favorable) scale. Transformed score = 100 x [(actual raw score - lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range]. Least Squares Mean changes adjusted for baseline score, treatment group, country, visit, and visit*treatment.</description>

        <title>Time to Discontinuation of Randomized Treatment</title>
        <description>Time to discontinuation of randomized treatment was defined as the number of days from randomization until the day the participant discontinued the randomized treatment. Discontinuation of randomized treatment was defined as switching between the 3 study treatments (tadalafil on demand, tadalafil once a day, or sildenafil citrate on demand) or discontinuing from all treatments. A change of dose within the same treatment was not considered switching of treatment. This outcome measure was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.</description>

        <description>Self-reported sexual desire on IIEF over past 4 weeks; comprises 2 questions (items 11 and 12). Each question rated on a scale from 1 (almost never or low/no sexual desire) to 5 (almost always or very high sexual desire). Total scores range: 2 to 10; lower numerical scores denote lower sexual desire. Least Squares Mean changes from baseline to endpoint for each visit from repeated measures analysis and included terms for baseline score, treatment group, country, baseline*treatment (if p&lt;0.10), visit, and visit*treatment. Correlation matrix for repeated observations assumed to be unstructured.</description>

        <title>Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) Questionnaire at 4, 8, 16, and 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>The participant questionnaire consists of 11 questions. Each question is rated on a scale of 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 4 (extremely high treatment satisfaction). The EDITS summary score was obtained by adding each individual result for all questions, dividing by the number of questions answered (mean satisfaction score), then multiplying by 25, thus obtaining a score range from 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 100 (extremely high satisfaction). Least Squares Mean changes were adjusted for treatment group, country, visit, and visit*treatment.</description>

          <description>The participant questionnaire consists of 11 questions. Each question is rated on a scale of 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 4 (extremely high treatment satisfaction). The EDITS summary score was obtained by adding each individual result for all questions, dividing by the number of questions answered (mean satisfaction score), then multiplying by 25, thus obtaining a score range from 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 100 (extremely high satisfaction). Least Squares Mean changes were adjusted for treatment group, country, visit, and visit*treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Week Endpoint of the Sexual Self-Confidence, Spontaneity, and Time Concerns Domains (23-items) of the Psychological and Interpersonal Relationships Scale (PAIRS)</title>
        <description>The PAIRS is a 23-item scale that assesses broader psychological/interpersonal outcomes associated with erectile dysfunction and its treatment. Each question is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The scale consists of 3 domains: Sexual Self-Confidence (items 1-6), Spontaneity domain (items 7-15), and Time Concerns (items 16-23). The average domain score for each domain was calculated by adding the nonmissing items for the respective domain, then dividing by the number of nonmissing items for the respective domain. Each average domain score ranged from 1 to 4. Higher scores represent the following: greater sexual self-confidence (better outcome); greater spontaneity (better outcome); higher time concerns (worse outcome). The Least Squares Mean changes were adjusted for treatment group, country, baseline IIEF-EF severity, baseline domain score, and baseline domain score*treatment (if p&lt;0.10).</description>

          <description>SEAR assesses psychosocial outcomes in men with erectile dysfunction. Confidence domain measures improvement in confidence; 2 subscales (6 items: Self-Esteem [items 9-12]; Overall Relationship [items 13-14]). Each item range: 1 (Never) to 5 (Always); item 11 reverse scored. Domain score=sum of domain's respective items, then transformed into 0 (least favorable) to 100 (most favorable) scale. Transformed score=100x[(actual raw score-lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range]. Least Squares Mean change adjusted for baseline score, treatment group, country, visit, and visit*treatment.</description>
