    <textblock>
      Multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare selective laser
      trabeculoplasty (SLT) and Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and
      ocular hypertension patients. IOP will be recorded, at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year
      after the laser procedure.

      This study derives from a clinical observation that laser treated eyed with PXF glaucoma may
      have a similar long-term response rates when either ALT or SLT is performed. Some authors
      have considered that there is a risk of IOP elevation in the immediate post laser period with
      ALT or SLT as a complication to be related to denser angle pigmentation (20,48). (46) No
      long-term analysis comparing response rates of both laser treatments in these types of
      patients has been done.

      Primary objective is to determine which laser therapy has more IOP lowering effect as primary
      or adjunctive treatment in eyes diagnosed with ocular hypertension and glaucoma associated to
      PXF. Response rates will be compared between groups at long-term.

      Secondary objective is to determine the relationship between the type of laser therapy
      performed and angle pigmentation, number of applications, and amount of energy used with age,
      number and type of medication used post laser and phakic status.

    <description>All eyes will be treated using a commercially available Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Coherent Selecta 7000, Coherent Inc., Palo Alto , CA, USA) calibrated by the manufacturer. On the day of treatment, IOP will be measured, then one drop of Apraclonidine 1% or Brimonidine 0.2% and pilocarpine 1% or 2% will be instilled. Before the patient is seated at the laser slit-lamp system a proparacaine hydrochloride drop will be instilled in the eye to be treated. A Goldmann goniolens or a Latina SLT or any other goniolens will be placed on the eye to be treated with methyl cellulose 1%. The helium-neon aiming beam is focused onto the pigmented trabecular meshwork. SLT will be performed with approximately 50 applications, a 400um spot size with energies varying from 0.8-1.2 mjoules.</description>

    <description>All eyes will be treated using Ophthalas 532 Eyelite Laser Photocoagulator (Alcon Surgical, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, USA. On the day of treatment, IOP will be measured, then on the day of treatment, IOP will be measured, then one drop of Apraclonidine 1% or Brimonidine 0.2% and pilocarpine 1% will be instilled. Before the patient is seated at the laser slit-lamp system a proparacaine hydrochloride drop will be instilled in the eye to be treated. A Goldmann goniolens will be placed on the eye to be treated with methyl cellulose 1%. The aiming beam is focused onto the anterior portion of the pigmented trabecular meshwork. ALT will be performed to the superior or inferior 180 degrees with ~ 50 applications, a 50um spot size with energies varying from 400-700 mW with 0.1 second duration.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only patients with clinical evidence of unilateral or bilateral open angle
             pseudoexfoliation ocular hypertension (IOP &gt; 22mmHg) or glaucoma (Evidence on Humphrey
             30-2 or Goldmann of nerve fiber layer damage) with uncontrolled IOP, over 18 years of
             age, and are willing to participate in the study will be included. If increased IOP is
             bilateral then the worst eye will be treated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have evidence of any glaucoma other than
             pseudoexfoliative open angle, if the trabecular meshwork cannot be seen in 360
             degrees, if they had previous laser therapy ALT or SLT, if they have advanced visual
             field defect (split fixation or a scotoma within 10 degrees fixation), taking any
             systemic or topical steroids, have had any previous ocular surgery (glaucoma or
             cataract extraction included) or laser within the previous six months, if they are
             monocular patients, if they have any corneal disease precluding the angle evaluation
             and treatment, or if they had ocular trauma.
