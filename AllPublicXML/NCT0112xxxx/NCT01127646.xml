  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to help to understand the effect on children and adolescents
      who are stable on treatment with atomoxetine or osmotic-release oral system (OROS)
      methylphenidate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of not taking the
      medication for a maximum of 6 days over a 28-day study treatment period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to assess the effect of missed doses of daily medication
      (off-days). On the off-days the patient will take a placebo (sugar pill). Over the 4 weeks of
      the actual study there will be 6 random off-days of study medicine and neither the caregiver,
      patient nor study doctor will know which days are the missing days.

      To cover all aspects of the patients' lives and notably their school time, aside from
      investigator's assessments, evaluations will also be performed on a daily basis by those
      involved in their day-to-day life: parents, teachers (on school days) and the patients
      themselves, using an electronic diary.

    <time_frame>Baseline through 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Parent-completed 11-item questionnaire; measures difficulty level of and 8 common evening behaviors (such as, sit through dinner) and 3 common morning behaviors (such as, get out of bed). Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (a lot of difficulty). Total score (evening+morning) range is 0 to 33. Higher scores indicate greater difficulty in evening and morning behavior. DPREMB-R total score between days without missing doses (on-days) and days with missing doses (off-days) was not analyzed due to the insufficient sample size.</description>

    <description>This instrument is a single-item expert rating of the severity of the participant's attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in relation to the assessor's total experience of participants with ADHD. Severity is rated on a 7-point scale (1=normal, not ill at all; 7=among the most extremely ill participants). Higher scores represent greater illness severity.

        <title>Daily Parent Report of Evening and Morning Behavior-Revised (DPREMB-R) Scale Mean Total Score (On-Days Versus Off-Days) During the 4-Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Parent-completed 11-item questionnaire; measures difficulty level of and 8 common evening behaviors (such as, sit through dinner) and 3 common morning behaviors (such as, get out of bed). Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (a lot of difficulty). Total score (evening+morning) range is 0 to 33. Higher scores indicate greater difficulty in evening and morning behavior. DPREMB-R total score between days without missing doses (on-days) and days with missing doses (off-days) was not analyzed due to the insufficient sample size.</description>

        <description>This instrument is a single-item expert rating of the severity of the participant’s attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in relation to the assessor’s total experience of participants with ADHD. Severity is rated on a 7-point scale (1=normal, not ill at all; 7=among the most extremely ill participants). Higher scores represent greater illness severity.
