  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and effect on quality of life of
      liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin in combination with cyclophosphamide as first or second
      line treatment of older patients (≥ 70 years old) with metastatic breast cancer. The efficacy
      of the combination will be correlated with the functional status of patients according to the
      comprehensive geriatric assessment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly individuals make up a large part of the breast cancer population. When treated with
      chemotherapy for metastatic disease they derive similar benefits to their younger
      counterparts. Anthracyclines are associated with a cumulative dose-dependent cardiomyopathy
      with increased rate in patients over the age of 70. Liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin
      improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by reducing significantly the cardiotoxicity
      and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination
      with cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer
