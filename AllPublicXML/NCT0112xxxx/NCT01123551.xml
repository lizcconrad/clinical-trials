    <textblock>
      In the emergency department, 60% of patients have an acute pain. Appropriate management of
      acute pain is a public health priority according to who recommendations. Nebulized morphine
      has been extensively studied in children but less well in adults.

      It offers a non-invasive route for systemic drug delivery, more rapid and less invasive than
      intravenous (IV) method.

    <description>After randomization, patients will receive 10 mg of morphine (1ml) diluted in 4 ml normal saline and nebulized with 6 l/mn during 10 min. Nebulization will be repeated systematically 3 times every twenty minutes unless the patient pain was resolved (VAPS 30%). In addition, patients receive a bolus of IV placebo(5 ml normal saline . IV placebo (2 ml) will be repeated every 10 minutes if the objective of analgesia was not reached .</description>
