  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment after stroke is common and has a major effect on morbidity and quality
      of life. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have demonstrated benefit in vascular dementia, but
      efficacy in treating more circumscribed cognitive deficits following stroke, such as aphasia,
      has not been systematically investigated.

      This study evaluated the efficacy of Galantamine (Reminyl) in subjects with chronic, stable
      non-fluent aphasia secondary to stroke. Subjects enrolled in a double-blind placebo-
      controlled cross-over study that employed a comprehensive battery of language tests and
      measures of general cognitive and behavioral status that will be used to control for factors
      that may influence language functioning. The primary study outcome was a within-subject
      comparison of changes in language function and behavioral scores between placebo and
      active-treatment phases (12 weeks each). Our hypothesis was that by increasing acetylcholine
      levels, and facilitating activity of other neurotransmitters affecting attentional systems,
      Galantamine would produce gains in both language and behavioral scores in patients suffering
      chronic effects in cognitive systems due to injury following stroke.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of aphasia with relatively spared comprehension.

          -  Onset 6 months or greater prior to enrollment.

          -  Native English speaker

          -  Right-handed.

          -  Adults (18 years of age or older).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving ongoing individual speech therapy. (Most patients are no longer
             eligible for individualized speech therapy after 6 months from stroke onset, thus this
             should not eliminate many patients).

          -  Extremely mild or extremely severe aphasia. (Boston Naming Test Score &lt;3 or &gt;45 items
             named from 60 items).

          -  Global dementia (and any other patient with reduced decisional capacity requiring a
             legally authorized representative for consent).

          -  Presence of major cognitive deficit other than aphasia caused by stroke related
             disease.

          -  Contraindications to cholinomimetic agents: History of active peptic ulcer disease
             within 1 year, Severe asthma, unstable angina, bradyarrhythmia with resting pulse less
             than 50, sick sinus syndrome, or seizures.

          -  Major psychiatric disorders that affect cognition including: psychosis, major
             depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance abuse.

          -  Major medical conditions that alter cognition (e.g., heart failure, dialysis dependent
             renal failure, hepatic failure, active cancer).

          -  Impairments that affect metabolism of the medication including: Severe renal
             impairment (Creatinine clearance equal to or greater than 9), and moderate or severe
             hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score &gt;7)

          -  Patients using medications that have major effects on brain neurotransmitter systems
             or cognition within 2 months of enrollment. Exclusionary medications are: medications
             with significant anti-cholinergic activity (tricyclic antidepressants,
             diphenhydramine), anti-Parkinsonian medications (including Sinemet, amantadine,
             bromocriptine, pergolide, selegiline), and narcotic analgesics (&gt; 2 doses per week).
