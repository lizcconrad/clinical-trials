  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is a very serious fungal infection. Hematological patients are
      the most affected group. IA has a very high morbimortality due to its rapid progression and
      because it is very difficult to be early diagnosed. Diagnosis is used to be done too late or
      even post-mortem. They are two new methods (techniques) trying to make the diagnosis on an
      early stage: detection of Galactomannan antigen of Aspergillus species and real - time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of its DNA in blood. IA in immunocompromised patients is
      mainly located in lungs, so our hypothesis is that in patients where the investigators
      suspect IA the investigators should find earlier Galactomannan antigen or real -time PCR of
      Aspergillus in respiratory samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and its detection
      could be useful for diagnosis.

      Objectives: To detect Galactomannan Antigen and Real Time - PCR for Aspergillus DNA in
      bronchoalveolar lavage. To validate the routine utility of these tests in BAL as a diagnostic
      method of IA and investigate if Galactomannan Antigen and Real Time - PCR for Aspergillus DNA
      in bronchoalveolar lavage can optimize blood test sensibility.

      Methods: Prospective study. The investigators will include 200 patients. 100 of them will be
      hematological patients, neutropenic and at high risk to develop an IA. The other 100 will be
      patients without risk or no suspicion at all of IA. The investigators will perform a BAL in
      all patients. And blood detection of Galactomannan Antigen in hematological patients. The
      investigators will perform a standard microbiological culture of BAL and Galactomannan
      Antigen in both samples (bronchoalveolar lavage and blood). The investigators also will carry
      out Real Time - PCR for Aspergillus DNA detection in bronchoalveolar lavage.

      Expected results: To detect Galactomannan Antigen and Real Time - PCR for Aspergillus DNA in
      BAL with more specificity and making earlier diagnosis than in blood. The investigators also
      expect to implant these techniques in BAL in the routine for IA diagnosis in neutropenic
      patients.

        1. hematological neutropenic patients at high risk of IA in which we usually perform a
             BAL for microbiological study when they present persistent fever and an opportunist
             infection suspicion.

          2. patients without hematological illness and without IA suspicion, in which we perform
             an BAL because of another reason.
