  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endomicroscopy (EM) can improve the diagnosis Barrett's esophagus (BE) and some early
      esophageal cancers (Intra Epithelial Neoplasia (IEN)). EM provides optical biopsies
      comparable to standard histology. Specifically, EM allows targeted biopsy rather than random
      mucosal biopsy during routine endoscopic surveillance of BE or evaluation EIN, which will
      improve the diagnostic yield of mucosal samples for BE IEN. Furthermore, when combined with
      high resolution endoscopy, EM may improve the overall in vivo detection of IEN in lesions as
      well as flat mucosa.

      EM will provide accurate place and size of IEN which will impact the physician's decision to
      biopsy or perform endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). This could potentially minimize the
      number of unnecessary biopsies and as well as enable the physician to perform EMR at the time
      of the initial examination, rather than delaying endoscopic treatment after the pathology is
      available. This study is important because it will validate single center studies supporting
      the routine use of EM for screening and surveillance of BE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis is that endomicroscopy (EM) can improve the efficiency of the
      endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and associated Intraepithelial
      neoplasia(IEN), providing in-vivo optical biopsies comparable to standard histology.
      Specifically, EM will enable targeted biopsy rather than random mucosal biopsy during routine
      endoscopic surveillance of BE or endoscopic evaluation of patients with suspected or proven
      unlocalized IEN, which will improve the diagnostic yield of mucosal samples for BE IEN.
      Furthermore, when combined with high resolution endoscopy, EM may improve the overall in vivo
      detection of IEN in lesions as well as flat mucosa.

      The investigators also hypothesize that EM will provide additional accurate information
      regarding the presence of IEN that will impact upon the physician's decision to obtain a
      mucosal biopsy or perform endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). This could potentially minimize
      the number of unnecessary biopsies and as well as enable the physician to perform EMR at the
      time of the initial examination, rather than delaying endoscopic treatment to another
      procedure after the pathology from the mucosal biopsies are available. This study is
      important because it will validate single center studies supporting the routine use of EM for
      screening and surveillance of BE.

    <description>Compare the diagnostic yield (defined as the proportion of mucosal biopsy samples with neoplasia) of HRE plus EM with directed biopsy (HRE-EM-DB) over HRE with directed biopsy of all mucosal lesions followed by random biopsy (HRE-DB-RB) to diagnose BE in flat mucosa and mucosal lesions
The mean diagnostic yield for IEN will be calculated (number of mucosal biopsies and EMR specimens with High Grade Dysplasia (HGD) or Carcinoma (CA) divided by total number of mucosal biopsies obtained) by group and compared, using a chi square or Fisher's exact test for independent groups, depending on the distribution of the data.</description>
