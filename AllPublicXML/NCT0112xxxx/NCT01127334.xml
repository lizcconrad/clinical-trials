    <textblock>
      Out of all the patients that receive a CRT-D ( a dual chamber pacemaker with defibrillator )
      for cardiac resynchronization therapy there is approximately one-third that do not respond.
      We believe that by using a simple technique that includes routine echocardiography that are
      normally performed in these patients could help us better understand how to program their
      device to reach better optimization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults age 18-110 years

          2. Must have a CRT-D (A biventricular pacemaker with defibrillator)

          3. Last optimization of their device (CRT-D) must not have been done in the past 3 months

          4. Must be optimal heart failure medical regimen. This includes target dose of
             beta-blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) (or equivalent; i.e
             angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB); or balanced preload and afterload reducers with
             hydralazine and nitrates.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 18 years of age or greater than 110 years old.

          2. Does not have a CRT-D

          3. Optimization of their device has occurred in the past 3 months

          4. Not on optimal medical therapy for heart failure as listed in the inclusion criteria.
