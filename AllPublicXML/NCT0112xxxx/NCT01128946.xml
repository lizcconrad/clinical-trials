  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use an oral in-situ caries model to study remineralization of enamel due to
      the action of different combinations of fluoride salts delivered from dentifrices.

    <measure>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (%SMHR) of Enamel Specimens Exposed to NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF) and SnF/NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>SMH test was used to assess mineral status of partially demineralized enamel specimens using Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening/demineralization, while decrease in the indentation represents rehardening/ remineralization of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline(B), after intra-oral exposure(R) and after in-vitro demineralization(D) using formula: [(D-R)/(D-B)]*100.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Enamel Fluoride Uptake Upon Exposure to NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF), SnF/NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF), NaMFP/NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF) and NaF Toothpaste (675ppmF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Enamel fluoride uptake was determined using the microdrill enamel biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride (F) divided by the area of the enamel cores. The difference between treatments was calculated with respect to fluoride uptake by enamel.</description>

        <title>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (%SMHR) of Enamel Specimens Exposed to NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF) and SnF/NaF Toothpaste (1450ppmF)</title>
        <description>SMH test was used to assess mineral status of partially demineralized enamel specimens using Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening/demineralization, while decrease in the indentation represents rehardening/ remineralization of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline(B), after intra-oral exposure(R) and after in-vitro demineralization(D) using formula: [(D-R)/(D-B)]*100.</description>

        <description>Enamel fluoride uptake was determined using the microdrill enamel biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride (F) divided by the area of the enamel cores. The difference between treatments was calculated with respect to fluoride uptake by enamel.</description>
