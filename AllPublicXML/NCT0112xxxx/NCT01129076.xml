      Background:

        -  Thalassemia major (TM) is a chronic disorder that affects a person s ability to produce
           hemoglobin, resulting in anemia. Hemoglobin is a component of red blood cells that
           carries oxygen and nutrients to cells in the body. As a result, individuals require
           life-long blood transfusions and extensive medical management. Studies have shown that
           because of its demanding nature, TM might negatively affect an individual s quality of
           life, sense of self, and social integration, but little is known about affected
           individuals overall experiences with and perceptions of TM.

        -  TM is caused by a genetic change in the thalassemia gene. The disease is passed to
           children by parents who carry one copy of the altered thalassemia gene. The parents are
           called carriers of the condition and have a 25 percent chance of having a child with TM.
           It is possible to screen for carriers of TM and use this information for pregnancy
           planning and management.

        -  TM is common among people from South and South East Asia and is an important public
           health concern in Singapore. More research is needed to explore the lives of people with
           TM, and the societal perceptions that exist in Singapore about TM.

      Objectives:

        -  To describe the familial, social, and professional experiences of individuals with TM.

        -  To investigate the social messages being given out about TM in Singapore and the sources
           of those messages.

        -  To explore the impact of these experiences, perceptions, and social messages on
           individuals who have TM.

        -  To explore how the experiences and perceptions of individuals who have TM affect their
           life, sense of self, social integration, and compliance with medical treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Residents of Singapore who are 14 years of age or older, can speak English, and
           currently have TM.

        -  Parents of individuals with TM who are 14 years of age or older. Parents must be 21
           years of age or older, be able to speak English, and have had caregiving
           responsibilities for their child at some point.

      Design:

        -  All participants will have a one-time semi-structured interview, followed by a
           questionnaire to obtain demographic information.

        -  Interviews will be conducted in Singapore and are expected to last for 30 to 90 minutes.

        -  Individuals with TM will be asked about their own perceptions of TM; familial, social,
           and professional experiences involving TM; and their perceptions of others views and of
           social messages related to TM.

        -  Parents of individuals with TM will be asked about their experiences in caring for a
           child with TM, talking to their child about TM, telling people about their child s TM,
           and interacting with health care providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia major (TM) is a chronic, inherited hematological disorder that can require
      life-long medical care. As a result of the chronic and demanding nature of the condition,
      studies have shown that TM might negatively affect an individual s quality of life, sense of
      self, social integration, and compliance with medical treatment. Yet, little is known about
      affected individuals overall experiences with and perceptions of TM. In this study, the
      concept of stigma will be used to explore and understand these experiences and perceptions in
      the population of individuals with TM in Singapore. This study will involve qualitative
      interviews with TM patients and parents of TM patients. Interviews will focus on individuals
      family, social and professional experiences with TM; the social messages that exist in
      Singapore about TM and their sources; individuals perceptions of how others view TM;
      individuals own perceptions of TM; and the impact of these various experiences, messages and
      perceptions on the individual with TM. Interviews will be conducted with approximately 20-30
      individuals with TM, and 10-20 parents of individuals with TM. Interviews will be transcribed
      and subjected to thematic analysis to identify common themes. The results of this study will
      further our understanding of the psychosocial burden of TM and the potential role of stigma
      in this population, which may ultimately inform the care for individuals with TM. The study s
      setting will also provide insights into the impact of the Singaporean sociocultural context
      on the psychosocial elements of living with a genetic condition, which might eventually help
      to inform the development of appropriate psychosocial support services and genetic counseling
      services in the region.
