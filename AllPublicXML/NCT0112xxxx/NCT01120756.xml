  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some of the most common and disabling consequences of brain injury are deficits in cognition,
      such as difficulty with sustained attention, memory, organization, and goal management. The
      long-term goal of this research program is to develop and test novel neuroscience-based
      cognitive assessment tools and interventions for improving attentional regulation and related
      &quot;executive function&quot; brain processes involved in goal-directed behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury often results in a disruption of attentional regulation processes, which reduces
      the efficiency and effectiveness of cognitive functions including learning, memory,
      problem-solving and goal management, leading to significant functional disability. Despite
      the importance of these problems, few effective interventions are available. Current projects
      involve developing novel theory-driven neural biomarkers and behavioral measurement tools and
      training interventions that target attentional control processes. The collection of results
      will help delineate neural mechanisms that support improved attention regulation that may
      serve as neurobiological targets for the development of novel interventions that enhance the
      benefits of rehabilitation.

      In a controlled intervention study design, individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and
      chronic executive control dysfunction will participate in comparison interventions, with pre-
      and post-intervention measurements of performance on neurocognitive 'challenge' tests
      assessing targeted and non-targeted domains, functional performance in low structure
      'real-world' settings, and functional MRI measurements assessing goal-directed information
      processing. The interventions are: Goal-oriented attentional self-regulation (GOALS)
      training, Brain Health Education (EDU), Pathfinder Attention Regulation Training (PATH), and
      Tonic and Phasic Alertness Training (TAPAT).

      GOALS is designed to train attention regulation skills with meta-cognitive strategies for
      goal management, with application to participant-selected projects.

      Brain Health Education is designed to increase knowledge and understanding of key factors
      that affect brain functioning.

      Pathfinder training is designed to intensively train goal-directed self-regulation skills
      using a combination of digital game scenarios and application to personal life.

      TAPAT is designed to improve alertness at two levels: tonic attention of sustained attention
      and phasic alertness, or the capacity to rapidly and effectively interrupt an ongoing
      response pattern.

      Participants undergo fMRI, neuropsychological and functional assessments at baseline,, after
      the interventions, and at follow-up.

    <description>This will involve 5-7 weeks of training (20 hours of group training (2 hour sessions, 2 days per week), 3 hours of individual training (1 hour at the beginning, halfway through and at the end of training), and approximately 20 hours of home practice). In brief, the GBSM training protocol is designed to maximize the potential for improving attention regulation skills and the goal-directed functions they support, applying mindfulness-based attention regulation training to practice in redirecting attention to goal-relevant processes especially in the context of distractions is emphasized throughout training. Participants are asked to identify realistic functional goals as feasible individual and group projects, and are then trained in goal management strategies on the functional task(s) of their choice.</description>
