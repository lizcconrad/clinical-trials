      RATIONALE: An orientation and patient education program and telephone counseling may help
      improve the quality of life in patients with peritoneal surface malignancies.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies quality of life and survivorship care in patients
      undergoing surgery and chemotherapy for peritoneal surface malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess feasibility of instituting an orientation program, brief follow up care and phone
      calls in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Reduce pre-treatment distress and anxiety. II. Improve pre-treatment self-efficacy. III.
      Provide educational material delivered by the SRB. IV. Improve overall post-operative QOL
      ratings at 3 months, relative to discharge.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and their caregiver(s) receive a hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)
      orientation with a Survivorship Navigator (SN) over 90 minutes following their initial
      surgical consult. Patients then receive telephone calls over 20-30 minutes from the SN once
      weekly for 3 weeks prior to HIPEC. . After HIPEC, patients meet with the SN for 20-30 minutes
      to discuss adjustments and adaptation to the surgery and hospitalization 3-4 days post-HIPEC,
      biweekly for two weeks, and weekly thereafter until hospital discharge. After hospital
      discharge, patients receive telephone calls from the SN twice monthly for 1 month.
