  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SIAM III was a multicenter, randomized, prospective, controlled trial in patients with
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction receiving fibrinolysis &lt;12 hours after onset of symptoms.
      All patients received reteplase, aspirin in combination with ticlopidin, and heparin.
      Patients of the early PCI group were transferred within 6 hours after fibrinolysis for PCI.
      The conservative group received elective PCI two weeks after fibrinolysis. In total 197
      patients were included, 163 were treated by PCI. The primary end point was the composite of
      ischemic events, death, reinfarction, and target lesion revascularization.

    <measure>Reinfarction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reinfarction was defined as two or more of the following criteria: chest pain lasting for more than 30 minutes; a new significant ST-elevation; and a rise in the serum creatine kinase level to more than &gt;3x upper normal limit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ischemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ischemic events included unplanned hospitalization and / or unplanned angiography due to postinfarction angina, recurrent angina pectoris lasting for more than 15 minutes despite the administration of nitrates, or being accompanied by electrocardiogram changes, pulmonary edema, or hypotension.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Target Vessel Revascularization</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Target vessel revascularization was defined as any repeated percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery involving the infarct related lesion.</description>
