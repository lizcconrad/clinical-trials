  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study is the first step to determine if Opal immunotherapy may have potential
      utility as a treatment for HIV. Although effective treatments for HIV infection exist, they
      are limited by the requirement for life-long daily treatment, cost, side effects, and the
      development of resistance.

      There is a need for therapeutic approaches that induce or enhance T-cell immunity to control
      HIV disease. Overlapping Peptide-pulsed Autologous Cells (Opal) is a technique where
      autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or whole blood is pulsed with sets of
      overlapping peptides spanning whole proteins of HIV.

      Opal-HIV-Gag(c) is not for direct injection and is administered by ex vivo incubation of
      whole blood or separated blood components (such as white blood cells or peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells) and reinfusion.

      As a practical alternative to PBMC separation and to optimise vaccine presentation during the
      ex vivo incubation, a blood cell separation device will be used to separate the whole blood
      and enrich the white blood cell component. The device processes whole blood in a closed,
      single use disposable kit. Reconstituted Opal-HIV-Gag(c)or matching placebo will be added to
      the white blood cells, incubated for one hour and reinfused into the subject. Subjects will
      receive 4 administrations at 4 weekly intervals. Subjects are followed for 12 weeks after the
      final administration.

      Each dose group will be enrolled sequentially, with a sentinel group for each dose group.
      Satisfactory safety data from each cohort, reviewed by a Data Safety Monitoring Board, will
      permit dose escalation.
