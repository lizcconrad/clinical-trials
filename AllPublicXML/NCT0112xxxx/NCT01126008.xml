      This phase II trial is evaluating the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiation therapy with
      weekly docetaxel and cisplatin combination regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown the superiority of concurrent chemoradiotherapy over radiotherapy
      only in locally advanced head and neck cancer. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with high dose
      cisplatin has been universally used regimen. In a large-scaled phase II trial, however,
      conducted by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC),
      docetaxel (100mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75mg/ m2) every three weeks regimen produced improved
      survival, nonetheless there was significant limitation to deliver full doses of treatment due
      to significant hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Previously, we showed the safety
      of the combination regimen of weekly docetaxel and cisplatin in concurrent chemoradiation
      treatment in a phase I study. We determined the MTD of docetaxel to be 20mg/m2 weekly when
      concurrently administered with conventional fractionation RT and weekly 20mg/m2 of cisplatin.
