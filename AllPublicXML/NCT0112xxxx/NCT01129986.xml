        Inclusion Criteria:

        Group A:

          -  Must be male or female ≥18 years of age.

          -  Must be a healthy individual with intact skin

        Group B:

          -  Must be male or female ≥18 years of age

          -  Must have a venous stasis ulcer between the knee and the ankle (including the lateral
             and medial malleolus). The ulcer must have the typical appearance of venous leg
             ulceration and the diagnosis of venous origin.

          -  Ankle Brachial Pressure Index of &gt;0.8 -&lt;=1.2

          -  Must have a venous leg ulcer between 3 cm up to 5.6 cm maximum and an ulcer duration
             of 60 days or greater prior to enrollment in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Group A and Group B:

          -  Is unable to manage the self-treatment at home

          -  Is pregnant or is a nursing mother

          -  Is a woman of child bearing potential who is not using an adequate form of
             contraception (or abstinent)

          -  Is &lt; 18 years of age

          -  With gross morbid obesity (i.e., a Body Mass Index ≥ 50)

          -  Has a known allergy to any of the drugs and/or dressings that are part of this
             protocol

          -  Has previously participated in this study

        Group B:

          -  Has an ulcer that is deemed by the Investigator to be caused primarily by a medical
             condition other than venous insufficiency (e.g., diabetes, malignant ulceration
             [Marjolin's ulcer], vasculitis, etc.)

          -  Has evidence of current clinical infection although colonization is not an exclusion
             criterion (see definition section)

          -  Suffers from diabetes mellitus with HbA1c ≥ 10%

          -  Suffers from clinically significant arterial disease

          -  Has evidence of the ulcer and/or infection extending to the underlying muscle, tendon,
             or bone

          -  Has used any investigational drug(s)/device(s) within 30 days preceding screening or
             the physician or subject anticipates use of any of these treatments during the 2 weeks
             following start of the treatment portion of the study

          -  Has used or is anticipated to use any of the prohibited concomitant medications and
             treatments, as specified in study protocol, section 9.1.

          -  Suffers from a condition, other than venous insufficiency or venous hypertension
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject
             and/or the quality of the data.

          -  Suffers from a condition, other than venous insufficiency or venous hypertension
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would seriously interfere negatively with
             the normal wound healing process.

          -  Has laboratory values at screening outside ± 20% of the institution's normal range for
             any parameter other than HbA1c

          -  If laboratory values are outside ± 20% but the investigator deems the subject
             acceptable for enrollment, the Principal Investigator may approve the inclusion of the
             subject as long as there is no evidence of any comorbid condition where comorbidity
             could influence the trialIs using any of the prohibited concomitant medications or
             treatments.

          -  Wound surrounding skin not intact or has signs of active dermatitis or infection

          -  Wound over-bleeds

          -  Wound is severely ischemic

          -  Wound is larger than device aperture diameter
