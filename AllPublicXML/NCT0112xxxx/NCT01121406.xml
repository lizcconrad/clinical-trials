  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, randomized phase II trial. The aim is to assess the efficacy and
      the safety of BI 6727 Versus investigator's best choice single agent cytotoxic in recurrent
      third and fourth lines platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.

      100 patients will be randomised at the study entry to receive either BI 6727 (Arm A: 50
      patients) or non-platinum single agent cytotoxic (Arm B: 50 patients) Treatment will be
      continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint: disease
      control rate at week 24 according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours version
      1.1.

      Secondary endpoints: efficacy (progression free survival, overall survival, biological tumour
      response, biological progression free survival assessed by serum CA 125 according to
      Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, safety according to the NCI CTCAE v.3, disease
      symptoms control assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-OV28 and individual symptoms
      questionnaires, pharmacokinetics of BI 6727.

      Others endpoints: biomarkers and pharmacogenetics analysis (optional)

    <measure>Biological Tumour Response Based on Serum Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) According to the Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>At screening and every 6 weeks thereafter (Up to 213 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were to have a pre-treatment CA-125 of at least twice the upper limit of normal to be considered for CA-125 response. Patients were not evaluable by CA-125 if they had received mouse antibodies or if they had undergone medical and/or surgical interference with their peritoneum or pleura during the previous 28 days. In eligible patients, a CA-125 response was defined as the moment the CA- 25 was reduced by 50%, with this being confirmed with a consecutive CA-125 assessment not earlier than 28 days after the previous one.
Biological response rate based on serum CA-125 levels was assessed according to the guidelines by the Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup. Monitoring of blood levels of the tumour marker CA-125 was performed at screening and every 6 weeks thereafter.</description>

    <description>Biological PFS including assessment of CA-125 levels was defined as the time from randomisation until the first occurrence of progressive disease according to CA-125, progressive disease according to radiological evidence, or death.
Also according to the below criterias,
In patients with radiological measurable disease, disease progression during study treatment could not be declared on the basis of CA-125 alone.
Patients with elevated CA-125 pre-treatment and normalization of CA-125 had to show evidence of CA-125 ≥ to two times the upper normal limit on two occasions at least one week apart or
Patients with elevated CA-125 pre-treatment, which never normalized, had to show evidence of CA-125 ≥ to two times the nadir value on two occasions at least one week apart or
Patients with CA-125 in the normal range pre-treatment had to show evidence of CA-125 ≥ to two times the upper normal limit on two occasions at least one week apart.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Overall 54 patients were treated in Volasertib arm and 55 patients were treated in Cytotoxic arm. The &quot;Not completed&quot; category in the Subject Disposition table represents &quot; Treatment permanently discontinued&quot; and &quot;The reasons for non-completion&quot; in the table represent &quot;Reason for treatment discontinuation&quot;.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Volasertib (BI 6727 300 mg) was administered as intravenous infusion over 2 hours at Day 1 of each 21-day treatment course.
Treatment was to be administered until disease progression or occurrence of toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation. Patients withdrawn from volasertib treatment could receive a treatment according to investigator’s choice. The patients were to be followed for survival status.</description>

          <title>Cytotoxic</title>
          <description>Patients received a non-platinum cytotoxic single agent. The investigator chose the most appropriate drug according to patient status (previous chemotherapy effects, cumulative toxic effects, performance status, and nutritional status), the product Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), and the local standard of care. The following non-platinum regimens were recommended because they are regarded efficacious and safe in patients with resistant ovarian cancer:
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD): 40 mg/m² at Day 1 (1 course = 28 days)
Topotecan: 1.25 mg/m² from Days 1 to 5 (1 course = 21 days), or 4 mg/m² at Days 1, 8, and 15 (1 course = 28 days)
Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m² at Days 1, 8, 15, and 21 (1 course = 28 days)

        <title>Biological Tumour Response Based on Serum Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) According to the Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Criteria</title>
        <description>Patients were to have a pre-treatment CA-125 of at least twice the upper limit of normal to be considered for CA-125 response. Patients were not evaluable by CA-125 if they had received mouse antibodies or if they had undergone medical and/or surgical interference with their peritoneum or pleura during the previous 28 days. In eligible patients, a CA-125 response was defined as the moment the CA- 25 was reduced by 50%, with this being confirmed with a consecutive CA-125 assessment not earlier than 28 days after the previous one.
Biological response rate based on serum CA-125 levels was assessed according to the guidelines by the Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup. Monitoring of blood levels of the tumour marker CA-125 was performed at screening and every 6 weeks thereafter.</description>

The following non-platinum regimens were recommended because they are regarded efficacious and safe in patients with resistant ovarian cancer:
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD): 40 mg/m² at Day 1 (1 course = 28 days)
Topotecan: 1.25 mg/m² from Days 1 to 5 (1 course = 21 days), or 4 mg/m² at Days 1, 8, and 15 (1 course = 28 days)
Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m² at Days 1, 8, 15, and 21 (1 course = 28 days)

The investigator chose the most appropriate drug according to patient status (previous chemotherapy effects, cumulative toxic effects, performance status, and nutritional status), the product Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), and the local standard of care. The following non-platinum regimens were recommended because they are regarded efficacious and safe in patients with resistant ovarian cancer:
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD): 40 mg/m² at Day 1 (1 course = 28 days)
Topotecan: 1.25 mg/m² from Days 1 to 5 (1 course = 21 days), or 4 mg/m² at Days 1, 8, and 15 (1 course = 28 days)
Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m² at Days 1, 8, 15, and 21 (1 course = 28 days)
