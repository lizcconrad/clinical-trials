    <textblock>
      Canthaxanthine is a naturally occurring carotenoid that has been a popular over-the-counter
      oral artificial tanning agent in Europe, Canada, and Australia since 1979. It is also used at
      low dosage as a food-colouring agent and as a therapeutic agent for photosensitivity
      disorders such as erythropoietic protoporphyria. Canthaxanthin retinopathy was first
      described in 1982 by Cortin et al. In Germany the office of the federal board of health
      refused the permit for oral tanning agents containing canthaxanthine in 1985. At that time
      the long-term course of the disease was not known. 25 years later the investigators did these
      long-term follow-up examinations.
