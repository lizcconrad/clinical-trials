  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study to test the hypothesis that telcagepant is superior to placebo in
      preventing perimenstrual migraines as measured by mean monthly headaches during the entire
      treatment period. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of telcagepant
      for female migraine participants.

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE.

    <measure>Mean Monthly Headache Days During Entire Study Period Among Participants With Menstrually-related Migraine (MRM) or Pure Menstrual Migraine (PMM) Who Have an Average of 5 or More Moderate or Severe Migraine Headaches Per Month at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a headache diary each evening at bedtime, including recording headache duration and acute headache medication use. Mean monthly headache days was calculated from diary data. A headache day was defined as a day in which a headache (defined as headache pain ≥30 minute duration or requiring acute treatment) started, ended, or recurred. Headache pain persisting for more than 1 calendar day after initial onset was considered an occurrence of additional headache days. Mean monthly rate was adjusted to 28 days. Participant subgroups (based on symptoms over the 3 menstrual cycles prior to study): PMM - In ≥2 out of 3 cycles attacks occur exclusively on Day 1 ± 2 of menstruation and at no other times of the cycle; MRM - In ≥2 out of 3 cycles attacks occur on Day 1 ± 2 of menstruation and additionally at other times of the cycle.</description>

Headache pain persisting for more than 1 calendar day after initial onset into additional qualifying days (i.e., day following dosing day) was considered an occurrence of additional headache days. Mean monthly rate was adjusted to 7 days.

        <title>Mean Monthly Headache Days During Entire Study Period Among Participants With Menstrually-related Migraine (MRM) or Pure Menstrual Migraine (PMM) Who Have an Average of 5 or More Moderate or Severe Migraine Headaches Per Month at Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants completed a headache diary each evening at bedtime, including recording headache duration and acute headache medication use. Mean monthly headache days was calculated from diary data. A headache day was defined as a day in which a headache (defined as headache pain ≥30 minute duration or requiring acute treatment) started, ended, or recurred. Headache pain persisting for more than 1 calendar day after initial onset was considered an occurrence of additional headache days. Mean monthly rate was adjusted to 28 days. Participant subgroups (based on symptoms over the 3 menstrual cycles prior to study): PMM – In ≥2 out of 3 cycles attacks occur exclusively on Day 1 ± 2 of menstruation and at no other times of the cycle; MRM - In ≥2 out of 3 cycles attacks occur on Day 1 ± 2 of menstruation and additionally at other times of the cycle.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants who were randomized only once, took at least 1 dose of study drug, had ≥1 post-randomization efficacy measurement, met the definition of the MRM or PMM subgroup and reported average of ≥5 moderate-severe migraine headaches/month at baseline. Participant must have ≥1 month with ≥4 dosing days and ≥7 diary days.</population>

          <description>Participants completed a headache diary each evening at bedtime, including recording headache duration and acute headache medication use. Mean monthly headache days was calculated from diary data. A headache day was defined as a day in which a headache (defined as headache pain ≥30 minute duration or requiring acute treatment) started, ended, or recurred. Headache pain persisting for more than 1 calendar day after initial onset was considered an occurrence of additional headache days. Mean monthly rate was adjusted to 28 days. Participant subgroups (based on symptoms over the 3 menstrual cycles prior to study): PMM – In ≥2 out of 3 cycles attacks occur exclusively on Day 1 ± 2 of menstruation and at no other times of the cycle; MRM - In ≥2 out of 3 cycles attacks occur on Day 1 ± 2 of menstruation and additionally at other times of the cycle.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who were randomized only once, took at least 1 dose of study drug, had ≥1 post-randomization efficacy measurement, met the definition of the MRM or PMM subgroup and reported average of ≥5 moderate-severe migraine headaches/month at baseline.

        <title>Mean Monthly On-drug Headache Days During the Entire Study Period Among Participants With PMM Who Have an Average of 3 or More Moderate or Severe Migraine Headaches Per Month at Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants completed a headache diary each evening at bedtime, including recording headache duration and acute headache medication use. Mean monthly on-drug headache days was calculated from diary data. “On-drug” headache day was a day, which had a valid diary entry and which followed a study drug dosing day, in which a headache (defined as headache pain ≥30 minute duration or requiring acute treatment) started, ended, or recurred. Headache pain persisting for more than 1 calendar day after initial onset into additional qualifying days (i.e., day following dosing day) was considered an occurrence of additional headache days. Mean monthly rate was adjusted to 7 days. PMM participant subgroups (based on symptoms over the 3 menstrual cycles prior to study) – In ≥2 out of 3 cycles attacks occur exclusively on Day 1 ± 2 of menstruation and at no other times of the cycle.</description>

        <population>All randomized participants who were randomized only once, took at least 1 dose of study drug, had ≥1 post-randomization efficacy measurement, met the definition of the PMM subgroup and reported average of ≥3 moderate-severe migraine headaches/month at baseline.
