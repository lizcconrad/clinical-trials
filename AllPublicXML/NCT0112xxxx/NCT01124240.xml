      Cilengitide 2000 mg flat i.v. twice weekly is administered over a period of 18 months without
      interruption.

      Starting one week after the initiation of Cilengitide, RTX (60 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction) with
      concurrent daily temozolomide (60 mg/m2 p.o.) and daily procarbazine (PCB, 50 mg p.o. if BSA
      &lt; 1.7; 100 mg p.o. if BSA ≥ 1.7) is given over a period of 6 weeks (RTX Monday to Friday,
      both TMZ and PCB seven days a week).

      After a break of 4 weeks, adjuvant TMZ (50mg/m2 p.o in first cycle, 60 mg/m2 p.o. in
      subsequent cycles) and PCB (50 mg p.o. if BSA &lt; 1.7; 100 mg p.o. if BSA ≥ 1.7) are then given
      daily D1 to 20. This TMZ/PCB cycle is repeated every 28 days over a total period of 6 cycles.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM (WHO Grade IV,including GBM subtypes, e.g.
             gliosarcoma), histopathologically confirmed by central assessment as part of the
             screening for the CENTRIC trial.

          2. Males or females ≥18 years of age.

             was not possible to obtain a Gd-MRI within &lt;48 hours post surgery, a Gd-MRI is to be
             performed prior to randomization).
