  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifetime prevalence of major depression is estimated at 28% by age 18 (Lewinsohn et al.,
      1999), with higher cumulative rates in females (35%) than males (19%). Approximately 17% of
      children and adolescents in the United States are obese as defined by a BMI above the 95th
      percentile, with more than 30% falling between the 85th and 95th percentiles (Ogden et al.,
      2008). Overweight children and adolescents are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes
      (Pinhas-Hamiel et al., 1996) and overwhelming risk for adult obesity (Guo et al., 1994).
      There is a substantial percentage of adolescents who are both overweight and depressed with
      estimates from clinical samples averaging 25%. Treatment of teens with comorbid medical and
      psychiatric conditions such as overweight/obesity and depression has received little to no
      attention in the psychosocial treatment research literature. Due to the large number of
      adolescents who are both depressed and overweight, developing a behavioral treatment that
      addresses both problems simultaneously has important public health significance. The purpose
      of this proposal is to combine treatments for depression and overweight to address these
      co-occurring conditions in one intervention. The long-term objectives of this research are to
      develop efficient and effective treatments for co-occurring physical and emotional disorders.
      The research program will be divided into 3 major phases: a development phase (Stage 1a), a
      pilot study phase (Stage 1b), and a revision phase. During the development phase (Stage 1a),
      a treatment for overweight teens and CBT treatment for depressed teens will be adapted into
      one integrated protocol that addresses depression using CBT techniques, an exercise
      component, and advice regarding healthy eating. As part of this phase, we will adapt existing
      intervention manuals and therapist training materials, and gain some initial clinical
      experience with the intervention via an open trial with 6 teens. During the randomized pilot
      study phase (Stage 1b), the integrated intervention will be compared to a control group
      receiving CBT treatment for depression alone (N=40 in total). During the pilot phase, the
      feasibility and acceptability of administering the program will be assessed. In addition, we
      will compare change in depressed mood at end of treatment and 6 month follow-up periods
      across the two groups. During the revision phase, the intervention manual will be further
      developed and refined, based on experiences and observations made during the development and
      pilot study phases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adolescents must: 1) be between the ages of 12 and 18 years (18 year olds must still be in
        high school and living at home); 2) be at or above the 85th percentile with reference to
        age and gender-specific Body Mass Index (BMI); 3) have at least one parent available to
        participate in the treatment protocol; 4) speak English; 5) agree to study participation
        and random assignment; and 6) be available for follow-up. In order to meet the depressed
        mood criterion, adolescents must have a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder
        (single or recurrent), based on the KSADS-PL with a CGI-Severity ≥ 3 for depression and
        CDRS ≥ 36. Participants must be healthy, as established by their primary care physician, in
        order to participate in the exercise program -

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Adolescents will be excluded if: 1) they are currently receiving psychotherapy or
        participating in another weight loss program (only can have been in a weight loss program
        in the past); 2) they have a medical condition that would interfere with the prescribed
        dietary plan or participation in physical activity; 3) they are developmentally delayed
        such that the intervention materials will not be appropriate; 4) they are actively suicidal
        at intake; 5) they have not been on a stable dose of a psychostimulant for 6 months to
        ensure that a recently prescribed psychostimulant is not contributing to weight loss; 6)
        teens on an SSRI will not be allowed to participate due to potential effects of medication
        on weight loss; 7) they have a substance abuse or dependence diagnosis; or 8) they have
        failed a medication or psychotherapy trial for depression in the past.
