  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This treatment outcome evaluation of the Stonewall Project will recruit 150 participants to
      complete a face-to-face assessment visit at baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month
      follow-up to examine treatment outcome with respect to HIV risk and substance use.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stonewall Project clients who have initiated treatment within the past 60 days will be
      eligible for the outcome evaluation. 20% of clients are likely to be on parole or probation;
      these clients will be eligible to participate in the study.

      Outcome measures that will be examined as part of the treatment outcome evaluation include:
      1) self-reported substance use; 2) urine toxicology screening; and 3) sex risk taking.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>stimulant use (measured via self-report and urine toxicology screening)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a self-report measure that assesses substance use during the past month. We will examine the total number of days that stimulants (cocaine, crack, or methamphetamine) were used during the past month. We will also conduct urine toxicology screening to determine whether participants test positive for cocaine or methamphetamine metabolites at each study visit. This is an objective measure of recent stimulant use (i.e., during the past 72 hours).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>sexual risk taking</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual risk taking will be assessed using a measure that allows our team to examine risk as a function of HIV status, partner type (i.e., insertive or receptive), and whether the participant was under the influence of methamphetamine. Sex risk for HIV-negative men will be defined as any unprotected anal intercourse, irrespective of the HIV serostatus of sex partners. Sex risk for HIV-positive men will be defined as unprotected anal intercourse with HIV-negative or unknown serostatus partners.</description>
