      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To determine whether an educational intervention designed based on studies in the area
           is effective in increasing acceptance of surgery and presentation to the hospital, when
           adjusting for a number of potential determinants of service uptake;

        2. To assess short-term impact of the educational intervention on knowledge about cataract
           and attitudes toward locally-available surgical services.

    <textblock>
      China is home to the 18% of the world's blind people, an estimated 6.6 million. In China,
      cataract is the leading cause of blindness. In Guangdong, current counseling measures for
      patients diagnosed with cataract are minimal and often lack adequate descriptions of what
      cataract is, what causes cataract, and benefits/risks of surgery. A counseling session for
      cataract patients and family members, conducted by a trained nurse during outreach screening,
      may increase subsequent attendance at pre-operative examination, acceptance of cataract
      surgery, and attendance at follow-up examinations. An integral part of this counseling is a
      short movie consisting of testimony from a former cataract patient who underwent surgery
      (&quot;pseudophakic motivator&quot;). The use of pseudophakic motivators have been shown to be
      effective in increasing surgical uptake. In addition, a previously validated &quot;Barriers
      Questionnaire&quot; will be used to assess predictors of of hospital attendance, surgery
      acceptance, and follow-up attendance in the categories of cost, transportation, knowledge,
      and concerns about quality.
