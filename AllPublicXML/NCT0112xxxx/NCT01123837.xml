    <textblock>
      &quot;The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to see if giving dextrose fluid in the
      veins (IV) decreases the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in female urologic,
      gynecologic and breast outpatient surgery patients and at what blood surgery level. The
      reason for this study is that IV dextrose has been shown to decrease the incidence of PONV
      and the use of medications to treat PONV, while leading to sooner discharge after surgery.
      This can decrease overall healthcare cost and improving patient satisfaction.&quot;

    <measure>A Closer Look at the Effect of Glucose on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measures will be the severity and incidence of PONV along with the type and number of rescue medications given at 0,30,60, and 120 minutes PACU time and the next morning.</description>

    <measure>A Closer Look at the Effect of Dextrose on Post-operative nausea and vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints recorded will be length of surgery, history of PONV, amount of pain medicine administered, blood loss, drop in BP &gt; 20%, unplanned hospital admission for PONV, and time till ready for discharge from PACU.</description>

    <description>In the treatment group, a 250cc bolus over 2 hrs of D5LR will be initiated prior to the end of surgery and continued in PACU.Blood glucose will be measured at 3 different timepoints using a point of care testing device (Accu-Chek). We will be measuring changes in blood glucose levels associated with PONV and the type and number of rescue medicines given at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after anesthesia and the first postoperative morning</description>

    <description>The treatment group will receive a 250cc bolus over 2 hrs of D5LR prior to the end of surgery and continued in the PACU. Blood glucose will be checked 3 different times using an Accu-chek monitor along with the type and number of rescue medications given at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after anesthesia and the post-op morning.
The control group will receive a 250cc bolus over 2 hours of LR. Blood glucose will be monitored 3 times along with the type and how much of rescue medications are given at 30, 60 and 120 minutes post-op and the morning after surgery.</description>
