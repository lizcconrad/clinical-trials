    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma (NB), a common cancer of early childhood originating from primitive sympathetic
      neural precursors, is characterized by the remarkable heterogeneity of clinical behaviors
      from spontaneous regression to rapid progression and death. The current therapeutic options
      are developed according to the Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk stratification criteria
      based on clinical and biological factors, including tumor stage, MYCN status, age at
      diagnosis, histology, and ploidy status. 1-2 The treatment strategies ranging from
      observation alone to intensive multimodality therapy depends on the risk stratification of
      three subgroups of low, intermediate, and high risk of death. Despite a number of molecular
      and biologic factors has been identified to predict the prognosis, MYCN amplification, which
      occurring in roughly 20% of primary NB, is one of the most powerful prognostic factors.3 The
      co-opting neurotrophin pathways including the neurotrophin receptors (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC)
      and their ligands (NGF, BDNF, and neurotrophin-3, respectively), which regulate the
      differentiation, apoptosis, and growth of neural cells, are also important molecules related
      to the prognosis of NB.4 However, a proportion of patients with MYCN nonamplified NB still
      presents clinically aggressive progression similar to those of MYCN amplified tumors,
      suggesting that other unfavorable molecules exist for the inferior survival.5-6 The IGF-II
      RNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3), also known as L532S or K homology domain-containing protein
      overexpressed in cancer (KOC), is a member of RNA-binding protein family which includes IMP1,
      IMP2, and IMP3. The IMPs are primarily expressed during early embryogenesis and have been
      implicated in various post-transcriptional functions, including mRNA localization, cell
      growth, and cell migration during early embryogenesis.7-8 The IMP3 orthologue Vg1-RBP in
      Xenopus has also been described to promote migration of neural crest cells.9 Recently, the
      IMP3 is considered an oncofetal protein by increasing proliferation and invasion in various
      cancers including pancreas, kidney, and lung cancers.10-14 The expression of IMP3 is,
      however, low or undetectable in adjacent benign tissues.13 These lines of evidence indicate
      that IMP3 is capable of a potential biomarker to predict cancer progression and metastasis,
      and may serve as a target molecule for cancer therapy.14

      oligonucleotide microarray is a powerful tool to do a genome-wide screening of candidate
      genes related to cancer prognosis.15 In this study, 22 primary NB tumors were subjected to
      oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Among the differentially expressed genes according to
      the patients' prognosis, IMP3 showed an especially high expression level in NB tumors
      carrying unfavorable prognosis. Further evaluation of IMP3 expression in a large sample size
      demonstrated that IMP3 expression could predict an unfavorable prognosis of NB patients
      independent of other biomarkers. Targeting of IMP3 expression in a NB cell line did suppress
      cell invasion ability, suggesting that IMP3 could not only be a prognostic factor, but also
      be a potential therapeutic target of NB.
