          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: non childbearing potential
             including pre-menopausal females with documented (medical report verification)
             hysterectomy, double oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy., or postmenopausal
             defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
             with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) or 6 weeks
             postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until completion of the follow up visit.

          -  Body weight &gt; 45 kg and BMI within the range 18 - 28 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent and a signed and dated written informed
             consent is obtained, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions
             listed in the consent form.

          -  Normal spirometry (FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ≥ 70%).

          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history
             (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked))

          -  Available to complete the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically important abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment
             (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, ECG (12-lead) or
             from 24hr Holter monitoring. If the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree
             that a finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere
             with the study procedures a subject can be included.

          -  A mean QTc(B) value at screening &gt;450msec, or an ECG that is not suitable for QT
             measurements (e.g. LBBB or poorly defined termination of the T wave).

          -  A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than
             140/90 mmHg at screening.

          -  A mean heart rate outside the range 40-90 bpm at screening.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates and
             benzodiazepines. The detection of drugs with a legitimate medical use would not
             necessarily be an exclusion to study participation. The detection of alcohol would not
             be an exclusion at screening but would need to be negative pre-dose and during the
             study.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome).

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody (if testing required by local SOP's).

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 3months of the study defined as:

        an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater
        than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an
        average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to a
        half-pint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass (125ml) of wine.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, verapamil or components
             thereof, known allergy or hypersensitivity to milk protein or the excipients lactose
             monohydrate and MgSt, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of
             the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  The subject is unable to use the novel dry powder inhaler correctly.

          -  The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to ipratropium bromide,
             tiotropium, atropine and any of its derivatives.

          -  Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any β2 agonist
             or sympathomimetic drug,.

          -  Subject is kept under regulatory of judicial order in an institution.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.
