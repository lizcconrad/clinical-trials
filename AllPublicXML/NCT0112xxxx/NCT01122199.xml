      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the combination of two drugs called RAD001
      and AMG479. This study will see what effects (good and bad) RAD001 and AMG479 have on cancer.
      This study will also find the highest doses of RAD001 and AMG479 that can be given without
      causing severe side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated (MTD) and recommended Phase II doses for AMG479
      (ganitumab) and RAD001 (everolimus) in patients with refractory solid tumors.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity of AMG479 and RAD001.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine preliminary antitumor efficacy of AMG479 and RAD001 in solid tumors: response
      and stable disease rates, duration of response and of stable disease, time to progression
      (TTP) and overall survival (OS).

      II. For all patients, to analyze tumor and blood samples for pharmacodynamic biomarkers
      related to IGF-1R and mTOR signaling: pAkt, pS6, p-4EBP1, PTEN, IGF-1, IGF-2, pIGF-1R and
      IGFBP3 and correlate with response and stable disease.

      III. For all patients, to analyze the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) for RAD001 and AMG479, and
      correlate with response/stable disease and pharmacodynamic markers.

      IV. To evaluate the effects of RAD001 on AMG 479 pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 (days 1-7 and 16-28 of
      course 1 only) and ganitumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 (day 15 of
      course 1 only). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30, every 3 months for 2
      years from registration for study treatment, every 6 months for years 3-5, and then annually
      thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological proof of metastatic solid tumor refractory to standard
             therapies, or for which no standard therapies are available.

          -  Patients in the expansion cohort must have a measurable site of disease according to
             RECIST (v 1.0)

          -  Laboratory values must be obtained within protocol limits and obtained within 14 days
             prior to registration

          -  Patients must have disease which is not amenable to potentially curative surgical
             resection of metastatic disease (curative metastasectomy).

          -  Must be willing to provide metastatic tissue biopsy samples (may be paraffin embedded)
             at baseline
