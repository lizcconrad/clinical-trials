    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are to test whether in a cohort of low-income minority
      veterans with poor diabetes mellitus (DM) control:

        1. Peer counseling is an effective means of reducing HbA1c (a measure of glucose control).

        2. Financial incentives are an effective means of reducing HbA1c. This is a randomized
           controlled pilot study. There will be 3 arms: 1) a control group of poorly controlled
           diabetics getting usual care; 2) peer counseling with no incentives; and 3) financial
           incentives without peers. Ultimately, contingent on the success of this intervention,
           the researchers plan to apply for funding for a large scale intervention employing both
           peer counseling and incentives to improve DM control in low income and minority patients
           who are at high risk for premature morbidity and mortality.
