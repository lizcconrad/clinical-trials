  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determinate the degree of chest pain on patients with
      malignant pleural effusion submitted to pleurodesis with silver nitrate in three different
      dosages and concentrations ( 30ml 0.5% ; 30ml 0.3% ; 60ml 0.3%). Our secondary purpose is to
      evaluate the efficacy and occurence of adverse effects in the usage of silver nitrate for
      pleurodesis in the aforementioned dosages/concentrations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural effusion is a frequent complication in advanced neoplasia. Pleurodesis is
      the procedure of choice for symptomatic control, with talc as the sclerosing agent of choice.
      However, the occurrence of severe adverse effects associated with its use has led to the
      search for other agents.

      Silver nitrate poses an option, presenting excellent results in animal models and having
      successful usage in pleurodesis in the past. Although important, the current literature on
      the effective use of silver nitrate for pleurodesis is still too scarce, and a deeper
      knowledge on the occurrence of adverse side effects, especially pain, is still necessary to
      allow the substance to be considered as an effective alternative to talc, as well as for the
      definition of an adequate dosage.

    <description>On hospital discharge, five days after the procedure, patients are submitted to chest computerized tomography (CT). After 30 days of the procedure, patients are submitted to another chest CT and the volume of pleural effusion is calculated and compared to that of the hospital discharge date (calculated by the 5th day CT).</description>

    <description>The safety of the treatment will be assessed both by monitoring of complete blood counts, renal function, liver function and inflammation markers, as well as monitoring of body temperature, arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The occurrence of adverse side effects will be assessed using the United States National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.3.0.</description>
