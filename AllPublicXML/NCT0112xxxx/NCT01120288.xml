  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - A protein called HIF is believed to be involved both in forming cancers and helping them to
      grow after they are formed. EZN-2968 is a new type of cancer drug that goes into the cancer
      cell and switches off the production of the HIF protein. Researchers are interested in
      testing EZN-2968 in people who have liver cancer because studies have shown that this drug
      travels to the liver and stays there when the drug is given through a vein.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of EZN-2968 on liver cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with liver cancer that has
      not responded to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have an initial screening visit with a physical examination, blood and
           urine tests, and imaging studies to assess tumor size. Tumor biopsies may also be taken
           for research purposes.

        -  Participants will have an undefined number of 6-week treatment cycles of EZN-2968, given
           once a week for 3 weeks followed by 3 weeks without the drug.

        -  During each cycle, participants will have additional blood tests and imaging scans to
           assess tumor response to treatment.

        -  Cycles of treatment with EZN-2968 may continue until the treatment is not effective,
           illness requires participants to stop taking the study drug, or the participant chooses
           to withdraw from the study.

      Background:

        -  Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) facilitates the adaptation of normal and tumor tissue
           to oxygen deprivation. HIF-1 is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells, where it is
           involved in the upregulation of many gene products essential for invasion, migration,
           angiogenesis, and survival, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
           Blocking HIF-1 activity inhibits the expression of VEGF, resulting in the inhibition of
           tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.

        -  EZN-2968 is an antisense oligonucleotide that specifically targets HIF-1 alpha, one of
           the subunits of HIF-1. Safety and preliminary suggestion of activity have been
           demonstrated in two Phase I trials; one patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, one with
           renal cell cancer, and one with angiosarcoma of the face treated with EZN-2968 had
           objective evidence of shrinkage of large masses. In vivo data show evidence of
           intracellular uptake of EZN-2968 into tumor cells, and in the Phase I trial, preliminary
           data show that eleven patients had prolonged stable disease (&gt;90 days duration on
           study), three of which had objective evidence of tumor shrinkage, thus demonstrating
           proof of principle for this approach.

      Primary Objective:

      - Determine the modulation of HIF-1alpha mRNA in tumor biopsies pre- and post-administration
      of EZN-2968.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assess the safety of EZN-2968 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the modulation of HIF-1 alpha protein levels in tumor biopsies pre- and
           post-administration of EZN-2968.

        -  Evaluate anti-tumor response as determined by RECIST.

        -  Evaluate the expression of HIF-1 alpha target genes by real-time PCR in tumor biopsies.

        -  Assess tumor angiogenesis using DCE-MRI.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancies will be
           included in the study.

        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection.

        -  Patients must have failed at least one line of prior therapy for metastatic disease or
           have a disease for which no standard curative therapy exists.

        -  Lesion must be amenable to biopsy.

      Design:

        -  EZN-2968 will be administered as a 2-hour IV infusion at a dose of 18 mg/kg once a week
           for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a 3-week period without drug. Each cycle will be 6
           weeks, i.e., 3 weeks of therapy followed by 3 weeks without drug.

        -  Tumor biopsies and other correlative imaging and pharmacodynamic studies will be
           performed at baseline and after the third dose. Tumor restaging will be performed every
           2 cycles.

        -  Eligibility Criteria

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor.
             The diagnosis should be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NIH.

          -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection.

          -  Disease must be amenable to biopsy, and patients must be willing to undergo tumor
             biopsies.

          -  Patients must have failed at least one line of prior therapy for metastatic disease or
             have a disease for which no standard curative therapy exists. Prior anti-angiogenic
             therapy is allowed.

          -  Age (Bullet)18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available
             on the use of EZN-2968 in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this
             study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials, if applicable.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky (Bullet)60%).

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        absolute neutrophil count (Bullet)1,500/mcL

        platelets (Bullet)100,000/mcL

        total bilirubin 1.5 X ULN

        AST/ALT 2.5 X institutional ULN

        creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal

        OR

        creatinine clearance (measured) greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute for patients with
        creatinine levels &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal

        INR 1.4

        PTT 40 seconds unless due to lupus anticoagulant

          -  Urine protein should be screened by urine analysis for urine protein:creatinine (UPC)
             ratio. For UPC ratio &gt;1, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should
             be &lt;500 mg for patient enrollment.

          -  The effects of EZN-2968 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (abstinence; female use of hormonal methods, or barrier methods of birth control; male
             use of a condom) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and
             for 6 months after completion of study. Because there is a risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with EZN- 2968, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued while the patient is on this trial and for

             30 days after completion of treatment on this trial. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Willingness to undergo tumor biopsies for research purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events to eligibility levels (by performance status and
             laboratory criteria outlined above) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier. Patients may have received investigational agent(s) as part of a Phase 0
             study (also referred to as an early Phase I study or pre-Phase I study where a
             sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI's discretion, up to 2 weeks
             prior to study entry.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with active brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
             Patients whose brain metastatic disease status remains stable for (Bullet) 3 months
             after treatment of the brain metastases without steroids or antiseizure medications
             may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.

          -  Patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation.

          -  Hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (hypertension defined as systolic blood
             pressure &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal medical
             management).

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to EZN-2968.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. A history of hepatitis is allowed if, following consultation with
             Liver Diseases Branch, it is felt to be clinically stable.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because EZN-2968 has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             EZN-2968, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with EZN-2968.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with EZN-2968.

          -  Patients with surgical non-healing wounds. Patients with other non-healing wounds will
             be evaluated and included at the PI s discretion if considered minor.
