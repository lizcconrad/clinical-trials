  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of an optical device
      designed and developed for monitoring the intravenous infusion site for infiltration. The
      hypothesis is that the changes in optical signals measured near the infusion site using the
      optical device can be used to monitor intravenous infusion for infiltration.

        Subjects recruited from the patient population at Virginia Commonwealth University Health
        System will be enrolled in the Study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will have peripheral IV catheter with active infusions that are anticipated
             to be in place and functioning for 48-72 hours. The IVs and accompanying infusions are
             solely a part of the subject's medical care and are not started or terminated for the
             purposes of this Study. The rationale for choosing this time frame is that the rate of
             infiltration is likely to be increased the longer the IV infusion is taking place.

          -  Subjects are admitted to one of the institution's intensive care or intermediate care
             units, including Adult Emergency Department, Pediatric Emergency Department, Adult
             Medical Intensive Care Unit, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Neonatal Intensive Care
             Unity, Surgical-Trauma Intensive Care Unit, Cardiothoracic Surgery Intensive Care
             Unit, Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit, Burn Intensive Care Unit, Transplant Intensive
             Care Unit, Coronary Care Intensive Care Unit, Post-Anesthesia Recovery Unit, Pediatric
             Intermediate Care Unity, Surgical Intermediate Care Unit, and Medical Intermediate
             Care Unit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to consent

          -  Lack of a peripheral IV
