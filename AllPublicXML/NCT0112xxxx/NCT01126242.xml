    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare tape versus semi rigid support versus lace up brace
      treatment for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries with regard to clinical outcome and cost
      effectiveness.

      There is a difference of 10 in functional outcome (Karlsson Score) between non-elastic
      adhesive taping and semi-rigid and lace-up ankle support, in favour of the last, for the
      treatment of acute lateral ankle ligament injury at 6 months follow-up.

      This study is designed as a single blind prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      the difference in functional outcome after treatment with tape versus semi-rigid versus
      lace-up ankle support (brace) for grade II and III acute lateral ankle ligament injuries. The
      patients will be randomly allocated into one of the three groups. Randomization will be
      performed by computer. Blinding of patients is not possible, but the observer will be blinded
      at eight weeks and six months.

    <description>The patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding the function of the ankle joint. The score includes eight items based on a subjective evaluation of stability, pain, swelling and stiffness in relation to activities of everyday life, sports and recreational activities, running, stair climbing and working ability. The maximum score is 100 points.</description>

    <description>Anterior Drawer Test (ADT). The patient sits on a bench with the legs hanging downwards. The knee joint is flexed and the foot held in 150 plantar flexion. First the healthy ankle is examined. Examination is performed according to van Dijk. 38 The examiner assigned one of the four predetermined numbers to each examined ankle joint, based on the estimated anterior displacement of the talus relative to the tibia.
0 = 0-2mm, 1 = 3-5mm, 2 = 6-10mm and 3 = 11-15mm</description>

    <description>DAAT. Because the manual ADT is of a subjective nature we measure the instability with the dynamic anterior ankle tester (DAAT). 39 The principle of the test is to apply a force impulse tot the calcaneus, within the muscle reflex time, and to measure anterior-posterior translation and mediolateral rotation. The highest and the lowest score were discarded and the mean of the three remaining scores counted as the result of the test.</description>

    <description>Main objective of the economic evaluation is to assess the cost effectiveness and cost-utility of brace and tape therapy of acute lateral ankle ligament injury. The economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective, implying that both direct health care and direct non-health care costs, as well as indirect costs will be used as economic indicators. Firstly, relevant categories of resource utilisation were identified. Secondly, the volume of each category was measured and multiplied by the resource costs.</description>

    <description>FAOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport Rec), and foot and ankle-related Quality of Life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questionnaire. Standardized answer options are given (% Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The result can be plotted as an outcome profile.</description>

    <description>Group I will be treated with non-elastic adhesive tape around the affected ankle, applied by the 'van Unen-technique'. This technique is an alternative for the 'Coumans- technique'. The rationale of taping is to take the load off the injured tissue, to correct the biomechanics, to protect the injured part and to enhance proprioception and awareness of the injured tissue. Different materials can be used alone or in combination. The bandage material must have an adhesive layer which allows it to adhere to the skin and to itself. Since the direct stabilizing effect of a bandage lasts no longer than about half an hour, the positive effect is presumed to occur primarily through traction on the skin which stimulates muscular activity. Taping is a treatment that involves no loss of time, requires no crutches and is not attended with any ultimate impairment of function.</description>

    <description>The ASO (Ankle Stabilizing Orthosis) fits into an athletic or street shoe. The ASO is made of thin, durable ballistic nylon - the same protective material used by law enforcement and military personnel. Support is achieved through exclusive non-stretch nylon stabilizing straps that mirror the stirrup technique of an athletic taping application. The calcaneus is captured, effectively locking the heel. The ASO ankle brace holds the ankle in a biomechanical neutral position, reducing either inversion or eversion type injuries or re-injuries.</description>

    <description>A semi-rigid brace, the M-step® from Medi®, will be applied. The foam gel in the pads continuously adapts to give an uninterrupted optimal fit to the constantly changing anatomical conditions, which therefore ensures a uniform compression. The ability of the foam gel pad to adapt allows one orthosis to be used for both the left and the right ankle. The pads are very light and have a soft fleecy surface. Even the edges of the outer moldings are generously padded. The M-step ankle orthosis can be quickly and securely applied by means of two Velcro fasteners; the Velcro fasteners can be detached from the outer shells and fixed individually.</description>
