      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV)
      carbamazepine (CBZ) administered as multiple 15 minute infusions and a single 5 minute
      infusion to adult patients with epilepsy on stable higher doses of oral CBZ.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase III, multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of intravenously administered CBZ in adult patients with epilepsy. This study
      included a 28 day Lead-in Period, a Confinement Period (up to 7 days and 6 nights) and a 28
      day Follow-up Period.

      Patients began confinement on Day -1 of the trial, continuing to take their oral CBZ as
      prescribed by the investigator. On the morning of Day 0, Day 4, and Day 17, patients began
      the 24hr urine collection for evaluation of urinary biomarkers. All patients temporarily
      discontinued their prescribed oral CBZ and begin IV CBZ administration on the morning of Day
      1, continuing administrations every 6 hours (Q6h) through the morning of Day 4.
