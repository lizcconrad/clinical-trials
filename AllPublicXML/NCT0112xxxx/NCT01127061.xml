  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the safety and
      potential benefits of moderate intensity exercise in patients with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy. The investigators hypotheses are that exercise parameters derived from a
      baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test will target an appropriately safe level of exercise
      intensity that will not cause significant arrhythmias or exacerbate symptoms and that
      exercise training for 4 months will result in significant improvements in peak oxygen
      consumption and quality of life, with neutral effects on the clinical characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized clinical pilot trial is to establish the safety profile and
      potential benefits of moderate intensity exercise in patients with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy (HCM). Participation in competitive athletics is associated with an increased
      risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with structural heart disease, including
      HCM. This has appropriately led to the establishment of national guidelines based on expert
      opinion that discourage participation in high intensity competitive sports, burst exertion
      (e.g., sprinting), or isometric exercise (e.g., heavy lifting). Non-competitive, low to
      moderate intensity exercise is allowable, although many physicians and HCM patients are still
      understandably apprehensive. Data on the safety of a recreational exercise program, and how
      to gauge appropriate intensity level, are desperately needed so that HCM patients can reap
      the well established health benefits of regular physical activity. Limited, but compelling
      animal data suggest that moderate intensity exercise is not only safe, but may also prevent
      or even reverse cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocellular disarray, and apoptosis associated
      with HCM. There are no published studies on exercise in patients with HCM, although large
      clinical trials in heart failure have shown exercise training to be safe, to improve
      functional capacity and quality of life, and to lower cardiovascular mortality. The pilot
      randomized control trial proposed here is the first to determine the safety of moderate
      intensity exercise training and explore its potential benefits in patients with HCM.

    <description>Participants in the exercise group will undergo 4 months of training, 4-7 days per week with a minimum of 20 minutes per day. The protocol will be custom designed in consultation with an exercise physiologist based on data from the initial cardiopulmonary stress test. Exercise regimen will begin at a low level of intensity then increase in duration and training intensity to a goal of 60 minutes a day and 80% of the heart rate reserve during the 1st month of the study protocol with maintenance of the program thereafter. There is no need to come to a participating site for actually doing the exercise regimen. No strength training or burst activity will be prescribed and all activities will fall well within the recommended national guidelines for recreational exercise.</description>
