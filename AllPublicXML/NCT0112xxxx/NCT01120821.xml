      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of patients
      with Polycythemia Vera treated with Gleevec.

    <textblock>
      Phlebotomy is a standard temporizing treatment for Polycythemia Vera. Performing repeated
      phlebotomies may lead to iron deficiency and can contribute to a rising platelet count. This
      may create additional problems, such as clots particularly in patients older than 50. There
      is reason to believe that the use of Gleevec may cause a decrease in the activity of the
      marrow so that patients may not require as many or any phlebotomies. Thus, spleen function
      may possibly improve by decreasing in size and patients' platelet counts may also improve.

             refractoriness or intolerance to interferon-alfa.

          -  Patients may have PV with inadequate control on hydroxyurea.

          -  Performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Adequate end organ function, defined as the following:

               1. total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x upper limit of the normal range (ULN)

               2. SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN

               3. creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               4. ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L

          -  Written voluntary informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Patients receiving busulfan within 6 weeks of Study Day 1.

          -  Patients receiving interferon-alpha within 4 weeks of Study Day 1.

          -  Patients receiving hydroxyurea within 2 weeks of Study Day 1.

          -  Patients with Grade III or IV cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart
             Association Criteria.

          -  Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
             potentially unreliable.

          -  Patients previously treated with Gleevec.

          -  Serum erythropoietin level &gt; or = 25 units/microliter
