    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that:

      1) an intervention targeted at the prescribing physician would increase the rate of a
      metoclopramide discontinuation among patients prescribed the medication for questionable or
      unclear indications; and 2) the discontinuation would be durable.

    <time_frame>12 weeks after intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve weeks after the intervention period, we searched the medical records of patients in the intervention and non-intervention groups to determine whether discontinuation of metoclopramide therapy had taken place.</description>

    <description>Physicians in the intervention group were mailed a written feedback letter regarding their patients who were prescribed questionable metoclopramide therapy. Non-intervention providers received no letter. The letter consisted of the following components:
The name and medical record # of the patients involved
Information regarding the metoclopramide prescription: dates, dosage, indication recorded, and the duration of therapy
A reminder of the adverse effect of long-term metoclopramide therapy
A recommendation to consider having the patient undergo a trial of metoclopramide discontinuation if appropriate, and documentation of a discussion of risk and benefits of metoclopramide therapy with patients
A request that the physician document the discontinuation trial in the electronic medical record</description>
