    <textblock>
      Background:

      Hypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause
      of death in the United States and New York City (NYC). One in 4 NYC adults has hypertension,
      with higher prevalence in both Blacks and Latinos compared to Whites (Angell 2008). In NYC,
      only 65% of all adults with HTN and on treatment are controlled (Angell 2008).

      Self-blood pressure monitoring (SBPM) is associated with reduced blood pressure in patients
      with hypertension (Cappuccio 2004). Studies suggest that SBPM may increase control either by
      inducing clinicians to titrate medication more actively, (Agency for Healthcare Research and
      Quality 2002) by engaging patients to participate in their own health care, (Taylor 2007) or
      a combination of the two.

      However, minimal research has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of SBPM in different
      racial and/or ethnic groups or in low income populations or to discern effective patterns of
      SBPM use by patients. Best practices for integration of self monitoring into HTN into regular
      treatment have also yet to be established.

      Objectives:

      The goal of this study is to assess the impact of SBPM under conditions consistent with
      existing community health clinic resources and infrastructure in NYC's medically underserved
      neighborhoods using commonly available automated home BP monitors. By using a community
      clinic's electronic health record (EHR) and automated BP monitors with the capability to
      transmit readings to a research database, we can facilitate a more rigorous evaluation of a
      pilot SBPM intervention and assess patterns of home monitor use and clinical management and
      their association with outcomes.

      The three specific aims of this intervention are to:

        1. Assess whether use of SBPM reduces elevated BP and increases HTN control to similar
           levels in two historically understudied minority populations, Blacks and Latinos.

        2. Confirm pilot findings by assessing the impact of SBPM on BP and HTN control compared to
           usual care using randomized controlled trial methodology.

        3. Develop standards and refine guidance for the effective use of SBPM that can be easily
           communicated to key stakeholders.
