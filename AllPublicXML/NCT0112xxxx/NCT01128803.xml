  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The secretion by tumor cells of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was observed in 50 to 60% of
      hepatocellular carcinoma. The AFP can be used as a marker for tumor recurrence after
      treatment and may be considered as a tumor antigen specific for hepatocellular carcinoma.The
      aim of the project is to use the alpha fetoprotein (AFP) as a tumor antigen and to propose an
      approach of immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma based on the injection of autologous
      dendritic cells loaded with specific peptides of AFP.
