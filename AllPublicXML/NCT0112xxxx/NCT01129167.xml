  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer often spreads through local invasion into local structures, including fat,
      blood vessels, nerves, and nearby organs (stomach, duodenum, spleen, bile duct). Local
      microscopic invasion is associated with recurrence of pancreatic cancer after pancreatic
      resection, such that even if the original cancer is surgically removed, microscopic areas of
      cancer often remain. Data on the patterns of local invasion by pancreatic cancer have not
      been published. In this study, The investigators hope to investigate the frequency of the
      various methods of local invasion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This would help the
      investigators better understand how pancreatic cancer spreads, and determine what cancers are
      not resectable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the eighth most common malignancy, and the fifth leading cause of
      cancer-related death, in the United States. Unfortunately, patients often present late in the
      course of the disease. Accordingly, the 1- year survival rate is approximately 20%, and the
      5-year survival rate is less than 4%. Even in patients with local disease who are surgical
      candidates, survival at five years remains only 10-25%. Staging for pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      typically utilizes the TNM classification, where &quot;T&quot; represents tumor size, &quot;N&quot; represents
      regional lymph node metastasis, and &quot;M&quot; represents distant metastasis. This type of staging
      can usually only be done after operative resection. Unfortunately, up to 25% of patients are
      found to be unresectable at the time of surgical exploration. This is most often due to local
      invasion or metastatic disease. Local microscopic invasion is associated with recurrence of
      pancreatic cancer after pancreatic resection. Comprehensive data on the patterns of local
      invasion by pancreatic cancer have not been published. The investigators believe that it
      would be beneficial to investigate the frequency of the various methods of local invasion of
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A clearer understanding of the natural history of local invasion
      could potentially lead to a better determination of what constitutes unresectability.

    <description>The clinical and pathology information from the CUMC surgical database will be reviewed to determine the frequency of the various modalities of local invasion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This includes: peripancreatic fat invasion, neural/perineural invasion, vascular invasion, macrovascular invasion, duodenal invasion, bile duct invasion, splenic invasion,and gastric invasion.</description>
