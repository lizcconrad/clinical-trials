    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, prospective, double-blind, clinical study to assess the
      clinical application and outcomes with mild® devices versus sham in patients with symptomatic
      moderate to severe central canal spinal stenosis. Sham patients were eligible to choose to
      cross-over and have the actual decompression procedure after week 6 exam.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) &lt;=4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 to 12 prior to cross-over</time_frame>
    <description>Using VAS, pain is measured on a 0 to 10 point scale where 0 represents no pain and 10 indicates severe pain. A post-treatment score of 4 points is the accepted threshold between a &quot;mild&quot; pain score of 1-3 points and a &quot;moderate to severe&quot; pain score of 5 to 10 points which represents debilitating pain that would qualify the patient for a different or additional treatment option. All patients in each arm who reported a pain score of 4 or less at six to twelve weeks post-treatment are reported below.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) &lt;=4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 to 12 &amp; Year One After Sham to mild x-over</time_frame>
    <description>VAS as measured on a 10-point scale. A score of 4 or less after treatment is considered favorable, as it indicates pain is less than the &quot;moderate to severe&quot; categories represented by scores of 5 to 10. All patients in each arm who reported a pain score of 4 or less at Week 6-12 and Year 1 are reported below.</description>

        <description>Using VAS, pain is measured on a 0 to 10 point scale where 0 represents no pain and 10 indicates severe pain. A post-treatment score of 4 points is the accepted threshold between a “mild” pain score of 1-3 points and a “moderate to severe” pain score of 5 to 10 points which represents debilitating pain that would qualify the patient for a different or additional treatment option. All patients in each arm who reported a pain score of 4 or less at six to twelve weeks post-treatment are reported below.</description>
