      This is an exploratory clinical investigation. The objectives of this study are to evaluate
      the safety, steady-state pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of metyrosine (Demser®) for the
      treatment of psychosis in patients with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS).

    <description>Metyrosine (250 mg capsules) were to be used at all dose levels (administered as multiples of that dosing unit). The starting dose was 250 mg/day of metyrosine. Dose escalation was to be carried out weekly for 8 weeks (up to a maximum of 8 capsules/day [2000 mg/day if metyrosine]) with dosage increments of 1 capsule/day per week. Weekly dose escalation was to stop based upon the investigator's assessment of safety, but not efficacy (i.e., dose escalation was to be forced to the maximum of 8 capsules/day assuming acceptable safety and tolerability).</description>
