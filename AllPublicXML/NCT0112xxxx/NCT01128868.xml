    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the abductor muscle strength measured with a
      dynamometer in patients with reverse oblique inter- or subtrochanteric fractures treated
      either with a proximal femur locking plate or a trochanteric nail.

      &quot;Proximal femur locking plates&quot; stands for both the PF-LCP (Synthes) and the PeriLoc (Smith &amp;
      Nephew). Trochanteric nails allowed in this study are the Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation
      (PFNA), the Titanium Trochanteric Fixation Nail (TFN) and the Gamma Nail (GN).

    <measure>Compare the functional outcome and abductor muscle strength measured with Lafayette Manual Muscle Tester in patients with reverse oblique inter- or subtrochanteric fractures treated either with a proximal femur locking plate or a trochanteric nail.</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>As hip abductors are the most important muscles around the hip joint, the primary outcome parameter will involve objectively measuring hip abductor strength. Muscle strength will be assessed with a portable handheld dynamometer (Model 01163, Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN, USA).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient outcome will be measured using the following outcome measurements:
Mobility measured with the &quot;timed up &amp; go&quot;-test (TUG), Lower Extremity Measure (LEM) for functional outcome, Length of hospital stay, Walking ability (Parker Mobility Score), Capacity to return to pre-residential status, Quality of life (Short Form-36 [SF-36]), Mortality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain scores on the Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (additionally assessed in a subgroup with the Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with the Visual Analogue Scale</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local complications</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Local complication will be recorded and categorized:
Implant / surgery complications, Bone / fracture complications, Soft tissue / wound complications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revision rate</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical revision includes all secondary surgical interventions that are related to the injury itself or the primary intervention. It is distinguished from planned revisions due to the injury (eg, planned soft tissue procedure) and revisions due to a complication. Revisions due to a complication are undertaken to resolve the problem and will therefore be documented in the complication form.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systemic or general complications</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>All complications affecting other regions of the body will be documented and evaluated as general/systemic complications, eg, thromboembolic complications, sepsis and others.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exploration of prognostic factors for the occurrence of complications, using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX)</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>Fracture risk prior to injury will be calculated with the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool [FRAX] (http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/index.htm).
Additionally, the fracture risk will be considered as a prognostic factor (in the absence of regular BMD measurements) for the analysis of complications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The results of fracture reduction are assessed with the following clinical and radiological evaluations : Varus/valgus deformity, Endo-/exorotation deformity, Limb length.</description>
