  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of increased life expectancy and improved therapeutic methods in cardiology, the
      proportion of very old patients with cardiovascular disease increases. However, clinical
      practice &quot;in real life&quot; are still insufficiently known in this population. The
      recommendations still lack of studies specifically devoted to elderly or very elderly, an
      extrapolation of data based on evidence obtained in younger populations.

      This is a multicenter observational study during a day. On this day, all participating
      centers fill a questionnaire for each patient 80 years or older hospitalized in their
      service.

  <detailed_description>

      Information about the center will be collected: non-university or university center, presence
      of coronary angiography room, number of beds, number of patients 80 years or older
      hospitalized in the day of the investigation.

      The questionnaire is designed to:

        -  Know the history of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular patient and degree of
           dependence

        -  Know the reason for hospitalization

        -  Evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic already implemented or planned for this patient

      The day of the survey, information on each patient 80 years or older hospitalized in the
      service will be collected:

        -  Patient Data: date of birth, sex, status. The patient identification data (name,
           surname, address) will not be collected.

        -  Patient History: date of last hospitalization, life, cardiovascular risk factors,
           cardiovascular and non cardiovascular history, date of last hospitalization, life

        -  Circumstances of admission: course of care before admission, admission to intensive care
           unit or hospital unit classical primary diagnosis and diagnosis (s) partner (s)

        -  Initial assessment: treatment admission, major hemodynamic, electrocardiographic and
           biological

        -  Regarding the current hospitalization: diagnosis already implemented or planned
           (echocardiography, angiography, electrophysiological study, etc ...), therapeutic
           methods already implemented or planned angioplasty, percutaneous valve intervention,
           conventional or biventricular stimulation, cardiac surgery, medication

        -  Become of the patient after hospitalization

        -  The clinician's subjective impressions about the condition of the patient and monitoring
           recommendations

        -  Assessment of addiction: ADL Scale

      No monitoring of patients is contemplated.
