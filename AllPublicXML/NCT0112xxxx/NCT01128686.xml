      This is to evaluate the proportion of subjects who show good responses to LAM treatment such
      as HBV DNA negativity, HBV DNA less than 4 log, no resistant mutation, HBeAg seroconversion
      and normalization of ALT in naïve CHB patients with certain pre-treatment characteristics,
      i.e. HBV DNA less than 9log copies per ml and ALT more than 2 times ULN in HBeAg positive
      subjects, HBV DNA less than 7log copies per ml and elevated ALT in HBeAg negative subjects.
