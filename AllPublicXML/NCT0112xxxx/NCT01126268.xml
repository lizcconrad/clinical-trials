  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of
      retapamulin in the treatment of subjects with bacterial infections, including impetigo,
      folliculitis, and minor soft tissue infections including secondarily infected eczema presumed
      to be caused by methicillin resistant Staph aureus. Male and female patients ages 9 months to
      98 years will be recruited from a university based dermatology clinic. Upon enrollment, wound
      cultures will be collected, and then subjects will apply topical retapamulin twice daily for
      five days. The primary endpoint will be resolution of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) infection based on clinical presentation and physical exam, as well as
      bacteriological efficacy based on culture results. It is anticipated that approximately 75
      patients will be enrolled, with expectation that approximately 50 of these patients will have
      MRSA infections.

    <measure>Number of Participants Whose Wound Cultures Were Positive for MRSA and Who Were Determined to be a Clinical Success at the Follow-up Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success is defined as no further signs or symptoms of infection present, including erythema, purulence, crusting, edema, warmth and pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Response at Follow up as Assessed by a Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was based on clinical evaluation by the investigator at the follow-up visit using a predefined scale with the following categories: (1) clinical success, (2) clinical improvement, (3) no change, (4) clinical failure, and (5) unable to determine. Patients who were designated as clinical success as defined in number 1 above were considered a true &quot;clinical success&quot; while all others were considered a &quot;clinical failure.&quot; Patients were classified with an outcome of &quot;unable to determine&quot; if they missed their follow-up visit or refused clinical examination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Microbiologic Response at Follow up as Assessed by a Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological response was determined by the investigator at the follow-up visit using the following microbiological outcomes: (1) microbological eradication, (2) presumed microbiological eradication, (3) presumed microbiological improvement, (4) microbiological persistence, (5) presumed microbiological persistence, (6) unable to determine, (7) new pathogen, and (8) colonization. Patients who were designated microbiological eradication, presumed microbiological eradication, presumed microbiological improvement, or colonization as defined in numbers 1, 2, 3, and 8 above were considered a &quot;microbiological success&quot; while all others were considered &quot;microbiological failure.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were a Therapeutic Success</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Therapeutic response was determined from the clinical response and the microbiological response. Patients who qualified as both a &quot;clinical success&quot; and a &quot;microbiological success&quot; were deemed a &quot;therapeutic success,&quot; and all others were deemed &quot;therapeutic failures.&quot;</description>
