    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that, when added to tiotropium (TIO),
      fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination (FSC) DISKUS 250/50 significantly increases
      exercise endurance time (EET) in the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT), compared to TIO
      alone. Male and female subjects at least 40 years of age with a diagnosis of Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are eligible. Subjects will be screened and consented at
      or during a 6-week (wk) period prior to visit (V)1. The 4-wk run-in period begins immediately
      after V1, when subjects receive open-label TIO plus as-needed relief inhaler (identical
      formulations called albuterol in the US and salbutamol in Canada). At V2, subjects will
      perform an incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) to establish their maximal walk response. The
      first ESWT will occur at V3. Subjects must demonstrate an EET of ≤20 min that is reproducible
      (EET from V3 and V4 varying by ≤2 min). Eligible subjects are then randomized at V5 to either
      FSC 250/50mcg DISKUS twice daily plus open label TIO 18 mcg daily, or placebo DISKUS twice
      daily plus open label TIO 18 mcg daily for the 4-wk treatment period. The last study visit is
      V6. The primary efficacy measure is the difference between the EET at V6 (wk-8) vs. V4 (wk-3;
      the last ESWT done before randomized study drug is given). Secondary efficacy measures
      include V6 vs. V4 comparisons in exercise dyspnea scale (EDS), exercise inspiratory capacity
      (EIC) and cardio-respiratory measurements (CRM), and V6 vs. V5 comparisons in dyspnea related
      to activities of daily living (baseline dyspnea index and transition dyspnea index
      interviewer-administered [BDI-TDI]) and quality of life (Chronic Respiratory Disease
      Questionnaire Self-administered Standardized [CRQ-SAS]). The safety measure will be an
      assessment of adverse events. We will also attempt to validate prospectively the minimal
      clinically-important difference (MCID) for a change in the EET through correlation with
      dyspnea and quality of life results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We postulate that adding fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination DISKUS 250/50 (FSC) to
      tiotropium (TIO) will improve exercise endurance time (EET) and its clinical and physiologic
      correlates, based on the combination of the three different mechanisms of action represented.
      We propose to test this hypothesis by comparing outcomes of exercise testing (Endurance
      Shuttle Walk Test; ESWT) with FSC added to TIO compared to those on TIO alone.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate that, when added to TIO, FSC significantly increases
      EET compared to TIO alone at Visit 6 (V6; week [wk]-8) vs. V4 (wk-3; the last ESWT before
      double-blind drug).

      Secondary efficacy measures will be as follows. Exercise dyspnea scale (EDS), exercise
      inspiratory capacity (EIC) and cardio-respiratory measurements (CRM) will involve V6 vs. V4
      comparisons. Dyspnea related to activities of daily living (ADLs) will be assessed using the
      baseline dyspnea index and transition dyspnea index interviewer-administered (BDI-TDI), and
      quality of life will be assessed using the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire
      Self-Administered Standardized (CRQ-SAS). The BDI-TDI and CRQ-SAS will be based on
      comparisons of data from V6 vs. V5. We will also attempt to validate prospectively the
      minimal clinically-important difference (MCID) for a change in the EET through correlation
      with dyspnea (Likert scale).

      Safety evaluations will include the type, incidence and severity of adverse events.

      This is a randomized, parallel-group study totalling 6 visits. Screening is at or up to 6 wk
      prior to V1, and includes a discussion of study procedures, a review of inclusion/exclusion
      criteria, collection of informed written consent, adjustment of medications and determination
      of spirometry pre- and post-albuterol/salbutamol. At V1, subjects meeting inclusion criteria
      will be enrolled, familiarized with the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT), and given paper
      diaries.

      The run-in will begin with the dispensing of open-label medications at the end of V1. During
      the 4-wk run-in, subjects will have 3 visits (V2-V4). Open-label TIO will be taken daily
      beginning after V1, and open-label relief inhaler (identical formulations called albuterol in
      the US and salbutamol in Canada) will be taken on an as-needed basis beginning after V1.
      Open-label medications will be withheld before V2, V3 and V4 (last dose of TIO, the morning
      of the day before the visit; last dose of albuterol/salbutamol, at least 6 hr before the
      start of the visit). At V2, subjects will be given open-label TIO, will undergo ISWT 2.5-hr
      post-TIO, and will be familiarized with the ESWT. At V3 and V4, subjects will be given
      open-label TIO, and will undergo ESWT 2.5-hr post-TIO. ESWT will be performed again at V4
      only if the EET at V3 was ≤20 min. Subjects will be studied at V5 if the EET result from V4
      is also ≤20 min and the EET from V3 and V4 vary from each other by ≤2 min; otherwise,
      subjects will be withdrawn. The ESWT from V4 will be used as the baseline EET for
      exercise-related outcomes because it will be the last ESWT done before double-blind study
      drug is given.

      Open-label medications will be withheld before V5 and V6 (last dose of TIO the morning of the
      day before the visit; last dose of albuterol/salbutamol, at least 6 hr before the start of
      the visit). At V5, subjects will undergo spirometry, lung volumes and diffusing capacity, and
      will be randomized. Subjects will then be given open-label TIO and double-blind DISKUS study
      drug, and undergo spirometry and lung volumes 2 hr post-TIO/double-blind DISKUS study drug,
      and ESWT 2.5 hr post-dose. Per randomization, subjects will receive for 4 wk after V5,
      open-label TIO plus either FSC or placebo DISKUS. Double-blind DISKUS study drug will be
      withheld before V6 (last dose the evening of the day before the visit). V6 will be the last
      study visit, consisting of spirometry and lung volumes, followed by open-label TIO and
      double-blind DISKUS study drug, spirometry and lung volumes 2 hr post-dose, and the final
      ESWT 2.5 hr post-dose.

      All study visits will begin with a check-up to determine eligibility for further study
      procedures. Details of the paper diary report will be reviewed after drug administration, V2
      through V6. Immediately after review of the paper diary, BDI (at V5), TDI (at V6) and CRQ-SAS
      (V5 and V6) will be undertaken, and the post-dose study activities, as outlined above, will
      follow.

      Final contact will be by telephone approximately 2 wk after V6 or Early Withdrawal. The total
      duration of the study will be 8 wk, including the 4 wk run-in and the 4 wk period of
      double-blind plus open-label treatment. There will also be a screening period of up to 6 wk
      prior to V1, and the 2-wk period after the final study visit for phone call follow-up.

      Subjects at a subset of sites will undergo EIC and CRM during each ESWT using portable
      telemetric monitoring (Oxycon Mobile; CareFusion, San Diego, CA).

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 3) and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>EDS is used to measure the level of breathlessness due to exercise, assessed using a 10-point modified Borg scale at 2-minute intervals during the ESWT: 0=no difficulty in breathing at all, 10=maximal breathing difficulty (BD). The participant pointed to the level on the scale correlating with his BD, and the local study coordinator confirmed that level verbally to him. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline. A dyspnea score/time slope was calculated by fitting a linear regression line to the dyspnea scores reported during the exercise tests.</description>

          -  abstinence: if not sexually active, must commit to complete abstinence from
             intercourse

        Female subjects, with the exception of those who are post-menopausal or surgically sterile,
        will undergo urine pregnancy tests approximately 7 days prior to first dose and
        approximately monthly.

          -  Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the definition
             of the American Thoracic Society (ATS).

          -  Severity of Disease: FEV1 post-albuterol/salbutamol at least 30 to no more than 80% of
             predicted normal and FEV1/FVC ratio post-albuterol/salbutamol of no more than 0.70
             based on NHANES III reference values. Note that identical formulations of short-acting
             beta-agonist are called albuterol in the US and salbutamol in Canada.

          -  Smoking History: A history of smoking at least 10 pack-yr is required. Pack-yr are
             defined as the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number
             of yr smoked. Please note that both current and previous smokers are eligible for this
             study. Previous smoking is defined as no smoking for at least 6 months prior to
             consent; subjects are otherwise considered &quot;current&quot; smokers.

          -  CXR: Chest radiograph, within 1 yr prior to consent, without findings suspected to
             represent an active, clinically-significant process other than those believed to be
             related to uncomplicated COPD.

          -  Use of TIO: A history of using TIO with compliance at least 80% starting at least 14
             days prior to V1, and ending 24 hr prior to V1, is required. Please note that any
             subject whose medical history precludes the safe use of TIO (such as significant
             narrow-angle glaucoma, known urinary retention, etc) should not be started on TIO for
             the purpose of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria at V1 must not be enrolled in the study:

          -  Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Any significant disease that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation,
             or which would affect the efficacy analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated
             during the study. Previously diagnosed cancer is considered a significant disease
             unless it is in complete remission for 2 yr (no evidence of tumor burden) at V1.
             Localized carcinomas of the skin that have been resected for cure are not
             exclusionary.

          -  Other Respiratory Disorders: Subject had lung resection surgery (e.g., lung volume
             reduction surgery or lobectomy) within 1 yr of V1 or has a significant respiratory
             disorder other than COPD (e.g., lung cancer, sarcoidosis, active tuberculosis,
             bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, sleep apnea, cystic fibrosis, or
             alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put
             the safety of the subject at risk through study participation, or which would affect
             the efficacy analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Acute Exacerbation of COPD: active disease within the past 6 wk. For the purpose of
             this study, an acute exacerbation of COPD will be identified using the following
             criteria [Anthonisen, 1987; Burge, 2003; Anzueto, 2009]: either

          -  worsening of two or more of the following &quot;major&quot; symptoms for at least two
             consecutive days:

          -  dyspnea

          -  sputum volume

          -  sputum purulence or

          -  worsening of any one major symptom together with any one of the following &quot;minor&quot;
             symptoms for at least two consecutive days:

          -  sore throat

          -  nasal discharge or nasal congestion

          -  fever without other cause

          -  increased cough or wheeze.

          -  Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Participation in the early, active phase of a Pulmonary
             Rehabilitation Program. For the purpose of this study, the &quot;early, active&quot; phase of
             pulmonary rehabilitation consists of sessions, scheduled on a regular and frequent
             basis (generally more than bi-weekly and for a total duration of at least 4 wk), held
             at an institution or at home, that include exercise training among interventions such
             as education and psychosocial support. Not included as the &quot;early, active&quot; phase of
             pulmonary rehabilitation are reinforcement or maintenance sessions that follow an
             &quot;early, active&quot; phase with interactions that are less frequent and less intense but
             may be scheduled for a longer total duration such as 6 months to 1 yr.

          -  12-Lead ECG: Potential subjects are excluded if they have a functioning cardiac
             pacemaker. Otherwise, the investigator will determine the clinical significance of any
             ECG abnormality, and whether it precludes the potential subject from entering the
             study.

          -  Drug Allergy: Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to
             any beta2-agonist, sympathomimetic drug, corticosteroid (intranasal, inhaled, or
             systemic including any components of the formulations [e.g. lactose or milk protein]),
             or atropine or its derivatives, including ipratropium or tiotropium.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI): A BMI of 40 kg/m2 or higher.

          -  Use of ritonavir, ketoconazole or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4: If any of these
             medications are used prior to V1, they must be stopped at V1 if indicated.

          -  Other Exclusionary medications: If any of the following medications are used prior to
             V1, they must be stopped as specified below.

        (Medication, Washout period prior to V1) Any Investigational Drug, 30 days Oral or
        parenteral corticosteroids, 30 days ICS, 30 days ICS/LABA combination products (e.g.,
        ADVAIR, Symbicort), 30 days Theophylline, 7 days Tiotropium, 24 hr LABA (e.g. formoterol or
        salmeterol), 12 hr Short-acting beta-agonists (e.g., albuterol or salbutamol), 6 hr
        Ipratropium or ipratropium-containing combination products (e.g., Combivent), 6 hr Oral
        beta-agonists, 6 hr

          -  Long-Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT): Subject is on LTOT and is receiving supplemental
             oxygen more frequently than nocturnal-only.

          -  Affiliation with investigator site: Subject is a study Investigator, sub-Investigator,
             study coordinator, or employee of a participating Investigator or immediate family
             member of the aforementioned.

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>In the open-label 4-week run-in phase, participants received 18 micrograms Tiotropium (TIO) once daily. Participants completing this phase (n=255) were then randomized to receive either TIO+placebo or TIO+Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination DISKUS. The number enrolled in the protocol section reflects these 255 randomized participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>EET is defined as the time taken by a participant to exert himself during an exercise. EET was calculated based on the Endurance Shuttle Walk test (ESWT). The ESWT is a standardized, externally controlled, constant-paced field test for the assessment of endurance capacity in participants with chronic lung disease. Change from Baseline in EET was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

          <title>Mean Change in Exercise Endurance Time (EET) From Baseline (Week 3) to Week 8</title>
          <description>EET is defined as the time taken by a participant to exert himself during an exercise. EET was calculated based on the Endurance Shuttle Walk test (ESWT). The ESWT is a standardized, externally controlled, constant-paced field test for the assessment of endurance capacity in participants with chronic lung disease. Change from Baseline in EET was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Scores on the Exercise Dyspnea Scale (EDS) From Baseline (Week 3) to Week 8</title>
        <description>EDS is used to measure the level of breathlessness due to exercise, assessed using a 10-point modified Borg scale at 2-minute intervals during the ESWT: 0=no difficulty in breathing at all, 10=maximal breathing difficulty (BD). The participant pointed to the level on the scale correlating with his BD, and the local study coordinator confirmed that level verbally to him. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline. A dyspnea score/time slope was calculated by fitting a linear regression line to the dyspnea scores reported during the exercise tests.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Flow of Carbon Dioxide (V'CO2) Per Time Slope During the Course of the ESWT From Baseline (Week 3) to Week 8</title>
        <description>The amount of CO2 in the hemoglobin of the participants was measured during the ESWT using the OMS. The system consisted of a carbon dioxide sensor and allowed breath-by-breath measurement of pulmonary gas exchange parameters. The V'CO2 per time slope was calculated for each participant by fitting a linear regression line to the V'CO2 recorded for each participant during the ESWT. V'CO2 per time slope results were compared between treatment groups as means of these regression lines. Change from Baseline in V'CO2 per time slope was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <description>VT is the lung volume representing the normal volume of air displaced between normal inspiration and expiration when extra effort is not applied (normal value is approximately 500 mL or 7 mL/kg body weight). VT was measured during the ESWT using the OMS, consisting of volume transducer O2 and CO2 sensors and allowing breath-by-breath measurement of pulmonary gas exchange parameters. The participant's VT per time slope was calculated by fitting a linear regression line (RL) to their VT during the ESWT. VT per time slope results were compared between treatment groups as means of these RLs.</description>

          <title>Mean Change in Tidal Volume (VT) Per Time Slope During the Course of the ESWT From Baseline to Week 8</title>
          <description>VT is the lung volume representing the normal volume of air displaced between normal inspiration and expiration when extra effort is not applied (normal value is approximately 500 mL or 7 mL/kg body weight). VT was measured during the ESWT using the OMS, consisting of volume transducer O2 and CO2 sensors and allowing breath-by-breath measurement of pulmonary gas exchange parameters. The participant's VT per time slope was calculated by fitting a linear regression line (RL) to their VT during the ESWT. VT per time slope results were compared between treatment groups as means of these RLs.</description>

Participants rated their experience on a 7-point scale in response to each q.: 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment); higher scores indicate better HRQOL. Individual q. were equally weighted, and domain scores (range=1-7) were calculated as the mean across the non-missing items within each domain (domain scores were calculated although an individual item score was missing).</description>

        <title>Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) at Week 4 and Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) at Week 8</title>
        <description>The BDI-TDI is a multidimensional dyspnea measurement. The BDI, administered at Week 4, consisted of 3 items (functional impairment, magnitude of task in exertional capacity, and magnitude of effort) requiring recall over the previous 4 weeks. BDI scores ranged from 0 (very severe impairment) to 4 (no impairment); the summed total score = 0 to 12. The TDI, administered at Week 8 as a follow-up of the BDI, consisted of the same 3 items requiring recall over the previous 4 weeks. TDI scores ranged from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement); the summed total score = -9 to 9.</description>
