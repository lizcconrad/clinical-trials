    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and effect on quality of life of weekly
      paclitaxel plus bevacizumab as first line treatment in elderly patients (≥ 70 years old) with
      metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore, the efficacy of the combination therapy will be
      correlated with the functional status of patients according to the comprehensive geriatric
      assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly individuals make up a large part of the breast cancer population. Older women are
      more likely than younger women to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage of breast cancer.
      However, when treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease they derive similar benefits
      to their younger counterparts. Preference should be given to chemotherapeutic drugs with
      safer profiles regimens, such as weekly taxane, according to the SIOG recommendations.
      Recently, initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab
      demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone
