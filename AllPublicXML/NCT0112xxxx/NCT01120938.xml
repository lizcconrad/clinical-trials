    <textblock>
      Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of death among infants between 1
      month and 1 year of age in the developed world. SIDS continues to be a phenomenon of unknown
      cause. The best approach to for prevention in high risk infants is unclear. Several
      substantial lines of evidence indicate that pacifiers have a protective effect on the
      incidence of SIDS. These studies were significantly powered and the results were consistent
      world-wide. The explanation for the protective effects of pacifiers on SIDS prevalence is
      unclear. A recent case report from New Zealand showed by means of nasopharyngeal films of a
      baby with and without a pacifier the possibility that sucking on a pacifier is associated
      with a forward movement of the tongue with enlargement of the upper airways' cross sectional
      area. Indeed, this hypothesis was originally postulated 30 years ago by Cozzi et al.

      Working hypothesis and aims: Our hypothesis is that since the upper respiratory tract is that
      portion of the airway that imposes the greatest resistance to ventilation, sucking on a
      pacifier results in upper airway dilatation, thus greatly reducing upper airway obstruction
      and improving ventilation at a stage when infants are virtually obligate nasal breathers. It
      should be stressed that airway resistance is proportional to the 3rd power of the radius of
      the airway, thus even a relatively small increase in airway diameter may have a profound
      effect on airway resistance and respiratory mechanical work of breathing! In young infants
      and those with underdeveloped respiratory center drive, this decrease in the work of
      breathing could certainly be sufficient to minimize the risk of SIDS as described above.Thus,
      the aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of sucking on a pacifier on upper airway
      patency.

      Ten to 12 infants' parents who have been referred for clinical examination of MR (or CT with
      and without contrast) of the brain and neck and who require sedation to perform this
      examination will be asked to participate in the study. These infants represent a potentially
      ideal population in which to study the upper airway. They are already undergoing MR/CT, their
      upper airways images are recorded, are asleep, and do not typically have airway
      abnormalities. In these children, 2 images of the upper airways -one obtained while with and
      one obtained while without a pacifier -will be analyzed and compared. In no case will
      additional sedation be given to obtain the MR/CT images of the airway. If the patient begins
      to wake up during the investigational sequence, the sequence will be aborted.

      To test our hypothesis using the functional method, we will compare LRT aerosol penetration
      with and without a pacifier.

      Infants who are regular pacifier users and are receiving therapeutic aerosols regularly
      (e.g., ventolin, budicort) will be studied. Labeling the aerosol particles with a gamma
      emitting isotope marker and quantifying its deposition scintigraphically by means of a gamma
      camera is a simple, safe and commonly used method to assess aerosol deposition throughout the
      URT and LRT.
