  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study consisting of a screening period, a conversion/titration phase
      (Phase 1), an open-label treatment phase (Phase 2), and a follow-up period.

      The study will enroll new subjects (hereafter referred as &quot;de novo&quot; subjects) with
      schizophrenia, or bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic
      features, and rollover subjects with schizophrenia from 31-09-266 (hereafter referred to as
      &quot;Study 266&quot;). All de novo subjects must enter the screening period of the study. Subjects who
      are screened and are not required to go through Phase 1 will complete a Phase 2 baseline
      visit prior to their participation in Phase 2.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse events were recorded from the time of the informed consent was signed throughout the 24 month treatment period until the follow-up visit 30 (Â± 3) days after the end of trial.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or participant enrolled in a clinical trial and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study medication. A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered to have a causal relationship with the study medication. A serious-AE or reaction was any untoward occurrence that, at any dose, was fatal, life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was any other medically significant event that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may have jeopardized the participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Cognitive Impairment for Each New York Assessment for Adverse Cognitive Effects of Neuropsychiatric Treatment (NY-AACENT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The NY-AACENT is not a validated scale. It was included in this trial because of concerns that regulatory authorities (the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP] and the Paediatric Sub-Committee of the European Medicinal Agency [PDCO]) had regarding drug induced cognitive impairment. No validated scale addressing these issues was available at the time of the trial. The NY-AACENT was used to detect changes in cognitive function subsequent to pharmacological or similar treatments for neurological or psychiatric problems. It was specifically designed to be used in pediatric populations (ages 12 to 17), but could have been utilized with other age groups, as appropriate.</description>

    <measure>Baseline and Post-Baseline Tanner Staging</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Tanner staging was completed together with the physical examination by the same trial-affiliated clinician in the most inconspicuous manner for the participant as possible. Tanner staging assessment consisted of 2 domains (pubic hair and breast development) for girls and 3 domains (pubic hair, penis development, and testes development) for boys. A participant who reached Stage 5 (both in pubic hair and genitalia) did not need to continue with Tanner Staging assessment and the Tanner Staging scales of this participant were imputed as 5 for all of the following scheduled time points up to and including the completion visit/ET visit. The clinician arrived at a single score summarizing the domains (not individual domain scores) when evaluating the participant. The total shift data for last visit is presented below.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline for Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) in Suicidal Ideation Intensity Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidality was defined as reporting at least one occurrence of any suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as reporting any type of suicidal behaviors (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, and preparatory acts or behavior). Suicidal ideation was defined as reporting any type of suicidal ideation. The suicidal ideation intensity total score is the sum of intensity scores of 5 items (frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation). The score of each intensity item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (worst) which leads to the range of the total score from 0 to 25. A missing score of any item resulted in a missing total score. If no suicidal ideation was reported, a score of 0 was given to the intensity scale.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS consists of 11 items assessing the core symptoms of mania and was used to assess participants with bipolar I disorder, manic and mixed episodes with or without psychotic features: elevated mood, increased motor activity - energy, sexual interest, sleep, irritability, speech (rate and amount), language - thought disorder, content, disruptive - aggressive behavior, appearance, and insight. Each item had 5 or 9 grades of severity, with lower scores indicating milder symptoms. The number of raters within each trial center was to be kept to a minimum. The YMRS Total Score (range 0 to 44) is the sum of the rating scores for 11 items for assessing the core symptoms of mania. A missing value for any YMRS assessment item(s) could have resulted in a missing YMRS Total Score. A higher YMRS Total Score represents greater severity. In this study, 94 participants had bipolar disorder, this explains the N=94 in the table below and these were de novo participants.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale - Bipolar (CGI-BP) Version Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-BP scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to bipolar disorder. The scale rated the subject's Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-Severity: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) and Change From Preceding Phase (CGI-BP-Improvement: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) based on a 7- or 8-point scale. Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-Severity) was rated at all visits. At each visit other than Day 0 (Baseline), the Change From Preceding Phase (CGI-BP-Improvement) was judged with respect to participant's condition at Baseline. The CGI-BP Severity Scores (range 1 to 7), as well as CGI-BP Improvement Scores (range 1 to 7) are single-item rating scores, with higher scores representing greater severity or less improvement. Data for 94 de novo participants were available with bipolar disorder.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale - Bipolar Version Improvement Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-BP scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to bipolar disorder. The scale rated the subject's Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-Severity: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) and Change From Preceding Phase (CGI-BP-Improvement: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) based on a 7- or 8-point scale. Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-Severity) was rated at all visits. At each visit other than Day 0 (Baseline), the Change From Preceding Phase (CGI-BP-Improvement) was judged with respect to participant's condition at Baseline. The CGI-BP Severity Scores (range 1 to 7), as well as CGI-BP Improvement Scores (range 1 to 7) are single-item rating scores, with higher scores representing greater severity or less improvement. Only 94 participants had data at Baseline to explain the N=94 in the table below and these were de novo participants.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in General Behavior Inventory (GBI) Scale Total Score for Mania and Depression in Both Parent/Guardian and Subject Version of the Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The GBI is a self-report inventory with 73 items focusing on mood-related behaviors, including depressive, hypomanic, and biphasic symptoms. For this trial, two 20-item subscales were utilized: one was completed by the parent/guardian or legal representative, as applicable for local laws, and the other was completed by the participant. Responses were given on a 4-point Likert scale, with 0 being never or hardly ever and 3 being very often or almost constantly. The GBI Total Score for mania (range 0 to 30) is the sum of scores for items 1 to 10 and the GBI Total Score for depression (range 0 to 30) is the sum of scores for items 11 to 20 in the GBI Parent/Guardian or Subject Version panel. Scores from the Parent/Guardian and participant Versions were summarized separately. A missing value for any GBI assessment items could have resulted in a missing GBI Total Score. High scores represent greater psychopathology. Data was only available for 80 de novo participants with bipolar disorder.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders Rating (ADHD-RS-IV) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV is a reliable and easy-to-administer instrument both for diagnosing ADHD in children and adolescents and for assessing treatment response. Containing 18 items, the scale was linked directly to DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for ADHD. There were 3 versions of the scale: a parent questionnaire on home behaviors (English), a parent questionnaire on home behaviors (Spanish), and a teacher questionnaire on classroom behaviors. For this trial, the parent questionnaire on home behaviors (English) was utilized. The ADHD-RS-IV Total Score (range 0 to 54) is the sum of rating scores for 18 items, with higher scores representing greater severity. A missing value for any ADHD-RS-IV assessment items could have resulted in a missing ADHD-RS-IV Total Score. Data were only available for 82 participants with bipolar disorder and these were de novo participants.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) in Bipolar (de Novo Participants)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGAS is a 100-point rating scale measuring psychological, social, and school functioning for children aged 6 to 17. It was adapted from the Adults Global Assessment Scale. The Global Assessment Scale was a rating scale for evaluating the overall functioning of a participant during a specified time period on a continuum from psychological or psychiatric sickness to health. The CGAS is a valid and reliable tool for rating a child's general level of functioning on a health-illness continuum. The CGAS was developed by Schaffer and colleagues to provide a global measure of severity of disturbance in children and adolescents. The CGAS Score (range 1 to 100) is a single-item score for rating a child's general level of functioning on a health-illness continuum, with higher scores representing better functioning.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or participant enrolled in a clinical trial and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study medication. A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered to have a causal relationship with the study medication. A serious-AE or reaction was any untoward occurrence that, at any dose, was fatal, life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was any other medically significant event that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may have jeopardized the participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <description>The AIMS Scale was an extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) rating scale. The AIMS is a 12 item scale. The first 10 items e.g. facial and oral movements (items 1-4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), trunk movements (item 7), investigators global assessment of dyskinesia (items 8 to 10). The first 10 items are rated from 0 to 4 (0=best, 4=worst). Items 11 and 12, related to dental status, have dichotomous responses, 0=no and 1=yes. The AIMS Total Score is the sum of the ratings for the first seven items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 28.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Cognitive Impairment for Each New York Assessment for Adverse Cognitive Effects of Neuropsychiatric Treatment (NY-AACENT)</title>
        <description>The NY-AACENT is not a validated scale. It was included in this trial because of concerns that regulatory authorities (the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP] and the Paediatric Sub-Committee of the European Medicinal Agency [PDCO]) had regarding drug induced cognitive impairment. No validated scale addressing these issues was available at the time of the trial. The NY-AACENT was used to detect changes in cognitive function subsequent to pharmacological or similar treatments for neurological or psychiatric problems. It was specifically designed to be used in pediatric populations (ages 12 to 17), but could have been utilized with other age groups, as appropriate.</description>

        <title>Baseline and Post-Baseline Tanner Staging</title>
        <description>Tanner staging was completed together with the physical examination by the same trial-affiliated clinician in the most inconspicuous manner for the participant as possible. Tanner staging assessment consisted of 2 domains (pubic hair and breast development) for girls and 3 domains (pubic hair, penis development, and testes development) for boys. A participant who reached Stage 5 (both in pubic hair and genitalia) did not need to continue with Tanner Staging assessment and the Tanner Staging scales of this participant were imputed as 5 for all of the following scheduled time points up to and including the completion visit/ET visit. The clinician arrived at a single score summarizing the domains (not individual domain scores) when evaluating the participant. The total shift data for last visit is presented below.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline for Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) in Suicidal Ideation Intensity Total Score</title>
        <description>Suicidality was defined as reporting at least one occurrence of any suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as reporting any type of suicidal behaviors (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, and preparatory acts or behavior). Suicidal ideation was defined as reporting any type of suicidal ideation. The suicidal ideation intensity total score is the sum of intensity scores of 5 items (frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation). The score of each intensity item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (worst) which leads to the range of the total score from 0 to 25. A missing score of any item resulted in a missing total score. If no suicidal ideation was reported, a score of 0 was given to the intensity scale.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued Due to All Adverse Events</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants who discontinued due to all causes other than sponsor terminating the trial was measured from the date of entering the open-label treatment phase to the date of ET for discontinued participants in the open-label treatment phase (ie, time to discontinuation = date of discontinuation [or date of completion for completed participants] â date of participant entering the open-label treatment phase + 1). If the participants completed the trial or were discontinued due to the sponsor terminating the trial, they were censored at the time of completion or trial termination, respectively.</description>

        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items, and 16 general psychopathology scale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Score</title>
        <description>The YMRS consists of 11 items assessing the core symptoms of mania and was used to assess participants with bipolar I disorder, manic and mixed episodes with or without psychotic features: elevated mood, increased motor activity - energy, sexual interest, sleep, irritability, speech (rate and amount), language - thought disorder, content, disruptive - aggressive behavior, appearance, and insight. Each item had 5 or 9 grades of severity, with lower scores indicating milder symptoms. The number of raters within each trial center was to be kept to a minimum. The YMRS Total Score (range 0 to 44) is the sum of the rating scores for 11 items for assessing the core symptoms of mania. A missing value for any YMRS assessment item(s) could have resulted in a missing YMRS Total Score. A higher YMRS Total Score represents greater severity. In this study, 94 participants had bipolar disorder, this explains the N=94 in the table below and these were de novo participants.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale - Bipolar (CGI-BP) Version Severity Score</title>
        <description>The CGI-BP scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to bipolar disorder. The scale rated the subjectâs Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-Severity: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) and Change From Preceding Phase (CGI-BP-Improvement: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) based on a 7- or 8-point scale. Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-Severity) was rated at all visits. At each visit other than Day 0 (Baseline), the Change From Preceding Phase (CGI-BP-Improvement) was judged with respect to participant's condition at Baseline. The CGI-BP Severity Scores (range 1 to 7), as well as CGI-BP Improvement Scores (range 1 to 7) are single-item rating scores, with higher scores representing greater severity or less improvement. Data for 94 de novo participants were available with bipolar disorder.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in General Behavior Inventory (GBI) Scale Total Score for Mania and Depression in Both Parent/Guardian and Subject Version of the Scale</title>
        <description>The GBI is a self-report inventory with 73 items focusing on mood-related behaviors, including depressive, hypomanic, and biphasic symptoms. For this trial, two 20-item subscales were utilized: one was completed by the parent/guardian or legal representative, as applicable for local laws, and the other was completed by the participant. Responses were given on a 4-point Likert scale, with 0 being never or hardly ever and 3 being very often or almost constantly. The GBI Total Score for mania (range 0 to 30) is the sum of scores for items 1 to 10 and the GBI Total Score for depression (range 0 to 30) is the sum of scores for items 11 to 20 in the GBI Parent/Guardian or Subject Version panel. Scores from the Parent/Guardian and participant Versions were summarized separately. A missing value for any GBI assessment items could have resulted in a missing GBI Total Score. High scores represent greater psychopathology. Data was only available for 80 de novo participants with bipolar disorder.</description>

        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV is a reliable and easy-to-administer instrument both for diagnosing ADHD in children and adolescents and for assessing treatment response. Containing 18 items, the scale was linked directly to DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for ADHD. There were 3 versions of the scale: a parent questionnaire on home behaviors (English), a parent questionnaire on home behaviors (Spanish), and a teacher questionnaire on classroom behaviors. For this trial, the parent questionnaire on home behaviors (English) was utilized. The ADHD-RS-IV Total Score (range 0 to 54) is the sum of rating scores for 18 items, with higher scores representing greater severity. A missing value for any ADHD-RS-IV assessment items could have resulted in a missing ADHD-RS-IV Total Score. Data were only available for 82 participants with bipolar disorder and these were de novo participants.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) in Bipolar (de Novo Participants)</title>
        <description>The CGAS is a 100-point rating scale measuring psychological, social, and school functioning for children aged 6 to 17. It was adapted from the Adults Global Assessment Scale. The Global Assessment Scale was a rating scale for evaluating the overall functioning of a participant during a specified time period on a continuum from psychological or psychiatric sickness to health. The CGAS is a valid and reliable tool for rating a child's general level of functioning on a health-illness continuum. The CGAS was developed by Schaffer and colleagues to provide a global measure of severity of disturbance in children and adolescents. The CGAS Score (range 1 to 100) is a single-item score for rating a childâs general level of functioning on a health-illness continuum, with higher scores representing better functioning.</description>
