  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this study is to determine if 3 MIU of IFN-α5 in monotherapy, and 1,5 MIU
      of IFN-α5 combined with 1,5 MIU of IFN- α2b, are safe dose levels as well as to investigate
      the antiviral efficacy and pharmacodynamics (PD) of such doses and drugs in
      treatment-experienced HCV patients with genotype 1 chronic infection, after 29 days of
      treatment. It is also intended to determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of the safe dose achieved
      of IFN-α5 in monotherapy.
