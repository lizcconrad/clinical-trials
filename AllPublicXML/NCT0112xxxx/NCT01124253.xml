  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine whether adjuvant vinorelbine plus cisplatin and endostar
      prolongs overall survival compare to vinorelbine plus cisplatin alone among patients with
      completely resected IB-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an open labelled, randomized, mono-center phase III clinical trail.A total of 250
      patients with resected stage IB to stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer will either the
      group of vinorelbine plus cisplatin plus endostar or the group of vinorelbine plus cisplatin
      randomly. The primary end point was overall survival; principal secondary end points were
      recurrence-free survival and the toxicity and safety of the regimens.The major inclusive
      criteria are pathological confirmed non-small cell lung cancer after complete resection and
      can tolerate chemotherapy safely.The tissue and blood samples will be banked for further
      investigation. All of the enrolled patients will be followed up until death or over 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer, the pathology type includes
             squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and any mixed type of
             the 3 types mentioned above.

          -  Stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer, tumor was completely resected (The type of
             surgery including lobectomy, left side pneumonectomy,bi-lobectomy).

          -  The time from surgery to first dose of adjuvant chemotherapy are mandatory between 4-8
             weeks.

          -  No evidence of tumor relapse prior to adjuvant therapy.

          -  Age 18-70, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) performance status 0-1.

          -  Normal hematologic function.Renal function , hepatic and cardiac function will be
             within the acceptable ranges as following:serum bilirubin, aspartate
             aminotransferase(AST)and alamine aminotransferase(ALT)levels below 1.5 times of normal
             value.

          -  No history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy;

          -  The patient should have well compliance for chemotherapy and follow up

          -  Informed consent should be obtained before treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The histological or cytological documents do not match the inclusion criteria.

          -  Right side pneumonectomy or any kind of incompletely resected surgery.

          -  The recruitment time are beyond 8 weeks from surgery.

          -  Any concurrent acute or chronic systemic diseases or psychiatric diseases, which might
             both increase the risks of the research itself or the medical therapy and influence
             the research results analysis. The researchers can make a judge for the following
             conditions to tell whether they are fit for this research:Uncontrolled high blood
             pressure, unstable angina , myocardial infarction , uncontrolled arrhythmia,or
