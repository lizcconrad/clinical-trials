      This is a randomized trial comparing progesterone with conventional clobetasol propionate in
      patients with vulvar lichen sclerosus.

      Background

      A total of 62 female patients with first diagnosis of lichen sclerosus will be treated daily
      with either topical progesterone 8% or clobetasol propionate 0.05% for 12 weeks. Response to
      the treatment will be evaluated by macroscopic description of the dermatologic phenotype by
      using a specific lichen sclerosus score and photography-documentation. The symptoms and
      quality of life of the patients will be evaluated by standardized questionnaires.
      Additionally, tissue samples will be taken before and again after 12 weeks of treatment to
      evaluate the response status.

      Objective

      The purpose of this study is to compare progesterone with conventional clobetasol propionate
      in a superiority trial.

      Methods

      Prospective, randomized, controlled, superiority phase II pilot trial. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to either progesterone or clobetasol propionate, with patients, physicians,
      assessors and analysts being blinded.
