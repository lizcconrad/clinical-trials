    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of AUY922, when administered weekly at 70 mg/m2, in adult
      patients with advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), who have received at least two
      prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients will be retrospectively, and prospectively, stratified
      based on their molecular tumor etiology. The following strata was assigned: Patients with
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations, Patients with Kirstin Raus
      sarcoma virus (KRAS) activating mutations, Patients with EML4-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma
      kinase) translocations and patients that were both EGFR and Kras wild type.

    <measure>Response Assessment by Study Stratum - Per Investigator Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study was the investigator assessment of efficacy at 18 weeks in terms of response complete response (CR)/partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or non clinical benefit (NCB) as assessed by response evaluation criteriain solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. ORR = patients with confirmed complete or partial response. Stable disease at 18 weeks = patients without response and with no assessment of progressive disease up to 18 weeks, but with an assessment of stable disease or better either within 2 weeks prior to the 18 week time point, or at the next non-missing assessment after the 18 week time point. No clinical benefit = all other patients.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival Rate Using Kaplan Meier Estimates - Per Investigator Radiological Review</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization/start of treatment to date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival was censored at the date of last contact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate as Per Investigator Using Kaplan Meier Estimates - Per Investigator Radiological Review</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not have an event, progression-free survival was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. A Novartis modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors RECIST 1.1 criteria was applied to CT/MRI imaging data when assessing any responses to AUY922 treatment. All images were evaluated locally by the investigator. All complete or partial responses were confirmed by a second assessment at least 4 weeks later.</description>

    <description>Patients with NSCLC who have tumors with an inversion in the short arm of chromosome 2 that results in the fusion of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene with the ALK gene leading to the production of an EML4-ALK fusion tyrosine kinase. ALK is a transmembrane protein, which has a kinase domain and is not usually expressed in the lung. EML4 mediate ligand-independent dimerization, and therefore constitutive activity of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain. Patients received AUY922 at 70 mg/m^2 weekly infusions.</description>

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (stage IIIB or stage
             IV) NSCLC who have received at least two prior lines of treatment. Patients who, in
             the investigators opinion, are deemed unsuitable for the standard 2nd line
             chemotherapy will be eligible for protocol participation. One of the prior lines must
             have included a platinum agent. Prior treatment with a platinum agent is not a
             requirement for EGFR mutant patients and patients with EML4-ALK translocations

          -  Patients enrolled to the fifth stratum, modified EGFR mutant, must have documented
             prior response to EGFR TKI as defined by CR, PR or SD for 6 months or greater unless
             patient has de novo resistance to EGFR TKI (e.g. exon 20 insertions.)

          -  All patients must have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST criteria.
             Previously irradiated lesions are not measurable unless the lesion is new or has
             demonstrated clear progression after radiation

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance status ≤ 2. For patients enrolled to the
             fifth stratum, modified EGFR mutant, World Health Organization (WHO) performance

        Adequate liver function defined as:

          -  AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT ≤ 3.0 x Upper limit of Normal (ULN) or ≤ 5.0 x ULN if liver
             metastasis are present.

          -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Serum albumin &gt; 2.5 g/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received more than four lines of prior treatment. Exception:
             Patients enrolled to the fifth stratum, modified EGFR mutant, must not have received
             more than two prior lines of therapy. Chemotherapy administered as adjuvant treatment
             more than six months prior to study enrollment is not considered a prior line of
             therapy for purposes of this study.

          -  Patients with a history of CNS metastasis. Note: Patients without clinical signs and

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Kras Mutant Patients</title>
          <description>Patients with KRAS mutant tumors. Patients received AUY922 at 70 mg/m^2 weekly infusions.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>EGFR Mutant Patients</title>
          <description>Patients with EGFR activating mutation tumors (Note: These patients must have progressed on one prior EGFR TKI containing regimen unless they have documented T790M activating mutation). Patients received AUY922 at 70 mg/m^2 weekly infusions.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P3">
          <title>EGFR and Kras Wild Type Patients</title>
          <description>Patients exhibiting both mutations were stratified to the KRAS mutation stratum. Patients received AUY922 at 70 mg/m^2 weekly infusions.</description>

        <group group_id="P4">
          <title>Patients With EML4-ALK Translocation</title>
          <description>Patients with NSCLC who have tumors with an inversion in the short arm of chromosome 2 that results in the fusion of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene with the ALK gene leading to the production of an EML4-ALK fusion tyrosine kinase. ALK is a transmembrane protein, which has a kinase domain and is not usually expressed in the lung. EML4 mediate ligand-independent dimerization, and therefore constitutive activity of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain. Patients received AUY922 at 70 mg/m^2 weekly infusions.</description>

        <group group_id="P5">
          <title>Modified EGFR Mutant Patients</title>
          <description>The modified EGFR stratum was defined as patients less heavily pretreated who had received one or two lines of prior therapy, with a documented response to a EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for ≥ 6 months), unless the patient had de novo resistance to EGFR TKI. Patients received AUY922 at 70 mg/m^2 weekly infusions.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P6">
          <description>For some patients, it was not possible to determine their genotype, and hence their stratum membership could not be determined. Patients received AUY922 at 70 mg/m^2 weekly infusions.</description>

        <description>The primary endpoint of the study was the investigator assessment of efficacy at 18 weeks in terms of response complete response (CR)/partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or non clinical benefit (NCB) as assessed by response evaluation criteriain solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. ORR = patients with confirmed complete or partial response. Stable disease at 18 weeks = patients without response and with no assessment of progressive disease up to 18 weeks, but with an assessment of stable disease or better either within 2 weeks prior to the 18 week time point, or at the next non-missing assessment after the 18 week time point.

          <title>EML4-ALK Translocation</title>
          <description>Patients with NSCLC who have tumors with an inversion in the short arm of chromosome 2 that results in the fusion of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene with the ALK gene leading to the production of an EML4-ALK fusion tyrosine kinase. ALK is a transmembrane protein, which has a kinase domain and is not usually expressed in the lung. EML4 mediate ligand-independent dimerization, and therefore constitutive activity of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain. Patients received AUY922 at 70 mg/m^2 weekly infusions.</description>
