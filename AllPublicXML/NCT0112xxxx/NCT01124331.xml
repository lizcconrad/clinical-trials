      The primary question to be addressed by this study is: compared with a functional oxygen
      saturation level (SpO2) of 91-95%, does targeting SpO2 85-89% in extremely preterm infants
      from birth or soon after, result in a difference in mortality or major disability in
      survivors by 2 years corrected age (defined as gestational age plus chronological age)?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen has been used in the care of small and sick newborn babies for over 60 years. However,
      to date there has been no reliable evidence to guide clinicians regarding what is the best
      level to target oxygen saturation in preterm infants to balance the four competing risks of
      mortality, lung disease, eye damage and developmental disability.

      Five high quality randomised controlled trials are now underway assessing two different
      levels of oxygen saturation targeting (USA - SUPPORT; Australia - BOOST II; New Zealand -
      BOOST NZ; UK - BOOST II UK; Canada - COT). The value of these gold-standard trials can be
      further enhanced when, with careful planning, they are synthesised into a prospective
      meta-analysis (PMA). A PMA is one where trials are identified for inclusion in the analysis
      before any of the individual results are known.

      We have established the Neonatal Oxygenation Prospective Meta-analysis (NeOProM)
      Collaboration, comprising the investigators of these five trials and a methodology team. The
      trials are sufficiently similar with respect to design, participants and intervention and,
      with planning, will have enough common outcome measures to enable their results to be
      prospectively meta-analysed. Together they have a combined sample size of almost 5000
      enrolled infants.
