        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-nicotine or tobacco using, healthy male and/or female subjects between 18 and 55
             years of age, inclusive, with no history or evidence of clinically relevant medical
             disorders as determined by the investigator in consultation with the Amgen physician

          -  Females must be of non-reproductive potential (ie, postmenopausal by history - no
             menses for 1 year - and FSH consistent with postmenopausal status per laboratory
             ranges; or history of hysterectomy; or history of bilateral tubal ligation; or history
             of bilateral oophorectomy).

          -  Physical examination, clinical laboratory test values and ECGs are clinically
             acceptable to the investigator and Amgen.

          -  Males must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control for the duration of
             the study and continuing for 12 weeks after the last dose of AMG 853. Highly effective
             methods of birth control (i.e., those with a failure rate of less than 1% per year)
             include sexual abstinence, vasectomy or a condom supplemented with the use of a
             spermicide, where available, in combination with one of the following methods used by
             the female partner: in regions where spermicide is available, diaphragm or
             cervical/vault caps supplemented with spermicide, hormonal birth control (implants,
             injectables, or combined oral contraceptives), intrauterine devices (IUDs).

          -  Male subjects whose partners become pregnant during the study will not receive
             subsequent scheduled doses, must practice sexual abstinence or use a condom for two
             weeks following the last dose, and will be followed for safety through end of study.
             The pregnant partner information will be reported to Amgen as per the Pregnancy
             Notification Worksheet.

          -  Body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant disorder, condition or disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, would pose a risk to subject
             safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion.

          -  Creatinine clearance within the screening period of less than 80 mL/min as calculated
             by the Cockcroft-Gault method.

          -  History suggestive of esophageal, gastric, or duodenal ulceration or bowel disease
             (including but not limited to peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerative
             colitis, Crohn's disease, or irritable bowel syndrome), or a history of
             gastrointestinal surgery other than uncomplicated appendectomy.

          -  Any positive test for cotinine (tobacco use) on the day before dosing of each
             treatment period (day -1, 7, 14 and 21). A positive cotinine level is defined as any
             level exceeding the upper limit of normal per local laboratory reference ranges.

          -  Known substance abuse (eg, alcohol, licit or illicit drugs) within 1 year of dosing.

          -  Any positive test for drugs and or alcohol use on the day before dosing of each
             treatment period (day -1, 7, 14 and 21). Alcohol should not be consumed within 48
             hours of day -1 and throughout the study.

          -  Females who are lactating/breastfeeding.

          -  Males with pregnant partners.

          -  Subjects who require specialized diets or have dietary restrictions that would prevent
             them from complying with the study requirements.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to swallow tablets.

          -  Unwilling to consume a standardized high-fat breakfast (approximately 800 to 1000
             calories) consisting of approximately 33 g protein, 58 g carbohydrate, and 75 g fat,
             respectively (e.g. 2 eggs fried in butter, 2 strips of bacon, 2 slices of toast with
             butter, 4 ounces of hash-brown potatoes, and 8 ounces of whole milk).

          -  Subjects who are lactose intolerant

          -  A history of malignancy of any type, other than surgically excised non-melanomatous
             skin cancers or in situ cervical cancer within 5 years before the day of dosing.

          -  Donated greater than 500 mL of blood or blood products within 60 days of dosing.

          -  Receiving or has received any investigational drug (or using or has used an
             investigational device) within the 30 days before receiving the first dose of study
             medication, or at least 5 elimination half-lives (whichever is longer).

          -  Subjects who were previously exposed to AMG 853.

          -  Use of any over-the-counter or prescription medications (specifically including, but
             not limited to, antacids, H2- blockers, and proton pump inhibitors, aspirin or other
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS]) within 30days of dosing. Acetaminophen
             (up to 2 g per day) for analgesia and hormone replacement therapy (eg, estrogen) will
             be allowed.

          -  Use of any known inhibitors of CYP3A4/P-gp such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, HIV
             protease inhibitors, nefazadone, cyclosporine, erythromycin, clindamycin,
             tetracycline, and clarithromycin within 14 days or 5 half lives, which ever is longer;
             or grapefruit juice or grapefruit containing products within 7 days prior to
             investigational product administration.

          -  Use of any known CYP inducers such as rifampin, corticosteroids, or anticonvulsants
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives, which ever is longer, before investigational product
             administration.

          -  Use of any herbal medicine (eg, St. John's wort) within 30 days before investigational
             product administration. All herbal medicines, vitamins, and supplements consumed by
             the subject within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational product and
             continued use, if appropriate, will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the
             Amgen Medical Monitor.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to sulfonamide drugs.

          -  Positive for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibodies.

          -  Known history of Gilbert's syndrome.

          -  Any other condition that might reduce the chance of obtaining data (eg, known poor
             compliance) required by the protocol or that might compromise the ability to give
             truly informed consent.
