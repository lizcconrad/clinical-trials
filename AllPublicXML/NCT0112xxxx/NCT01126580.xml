  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if LY2189265 is safe and effective in reducing
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as compared to metformin in participants with Type 2
      Diabetes.

      The term rescue therapy in this trial was defined primarily as additional nontrial
      antidiabetic medication for the management of severe, persistent hyperglycemia or alternative
      antidiabetic medication following study drug discontinuation. For efficacy analyses,
      participants who received rescue medication were included in the analysis population, but
      only measurements obtained prior to taking rescue therapy were included in the efficacy
      analysis. For safety analyses, with the exception of hypoglycemia outcomes, all measurements
      including those obtained after taking rescue therapy were included in the analysis.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in the Diabetes Symptoms Checklist Participant-reported Outcome (DSC-r) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Symptoms Checklist-revised (DSC-r) was designed to assess the presence and perceived burden of diabetes-related symptoms. Respondents were to consider troublesomeness of 34 symptoms on a 5-point scale ranging from 5=&quot;extremely&quot; to 1=&quot;not at all.&quot; For symptoms/side-effects not experienced, the item was scored as 0. Symptoms were grouped into the following subscales: psychology-fatigue, psychology-cognitive, neurology-pain, neurology-sensory, cardiology, ophthalmology, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Subscale scores were calculated as the sum of the given subscale divided by the total number of items in the scale. Total score was computed from the sum of the 8 subscales and ranged from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater symptom burden. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted by treatment, country, prior medication group, gender, and baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell Function</title>
        <description>The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) quantifies insulin resistance and beta-cell function. HOMA2-B is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady-state beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). HOMA2-S is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate insulin sensitivity (%S) as percentages of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference populations were set at 100%. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, country, prior medication group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, baseline HOMA2 as a covariate, and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in the Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living (IW-ADL) Score</title>
        <description>The Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living (renamed the Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living [APPADL]) questionnaire contains 7 items that assess how difficult it is for participants to engage in certain activities considered to be integral to normal daily life, such as walking, standing and climbing stairs. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = &quot;not at all difficult&quot; and 1 = &quot;unable to do&quot;. The individual scores from all 7 items are summed and a single total score is calculated and may range between 7 and 35. A higher score indicates better ability to perform activities of daily living. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted by treatment, country, prior medication group, gender, and baseline score.</description>

        <description>The Impact of Weight on Self-Perception (IW-SP) questionnaire contains 3 items that assess how often the participants' body weight affects how happy they are with their appearance and how often they feel self-conscious when out in public. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = never and 1 = always. A single total score is calculated by summing the scores for all 3 items. Total score ranges between 3 and 15, where a higher score is indicative of better self-perception.

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in the Diabetes Symptoms Checklist Participant-reported Outcome (DSC-r) Score</title>
        <description>The Diabetes Symptoms Checklist-revised (DSC-r) was designed to assess the presence and perceived burden of diabetes-related symptoms. Respondents were to consider troublesomeness of 34 symptoms on a 5-point scale ranging from 5=“extremely” to 1=“not at all.” For symptoms/side-effects not experienced, the item was scored as 0. Symptoms were grouped into the following subscales: psychology-fatigue, psychology-cognitive, neurology-pain, neurology-sensory, cardiology, ophthalmology, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Subscale scores were calculated as the sum of the given subscale divided by the total number of items in the scale. Total score was computed from the sum of the 8 subscales and ranged from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater symptom burden. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted by treatment, country, prior medication group, gender, and baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26 and 52 Weeks in Electrocardiogram Parameters, Fridericia Corrected QT (QTcF) Interval and PR Interval</title>
        <description>The QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave and was calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG) data using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT/RR^0.33. Corrected QT (QTc) is the QT interval corrected for heart rate and RR, which is the interval between two R waves. PR is the interval between the P wave and the QRS complex. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, country, prior medication group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, baseline interval as a covariate, and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <description>Information on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors was collected at baseline. Data on any new CV event was prospectively collected using a CV event electronic case report form. Deaths and nonfatal cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) were adjudicated by an external committee of physicians with cardiology expertise. Nonfatal cardiovascular AEs to be adjudicated included myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, coronary interventions, and cerebrovascular events, including cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and transient ischemic attack. The number of participants with CV events confirmed by adjudication is summarized cumulatively at 52 weeks plus 30-day follow up.
