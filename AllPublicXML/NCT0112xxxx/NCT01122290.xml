      Background: Children's emotional eating is related to greater BMI and less healthy diet but
      little is known about the early development of this behavior.

      Objective: This study aimed to examine the relationships between preschool children's
      emotional eating and parental feeding practices using experimental manipulation of child mood
      and food intake in a laboratory setting.

      Design: 25 3-5 year old children and their mothers sat together and ate a standard meal to
      satiety. Mothers completed questionnaires about their feeding practices. Children were
      assigned to a control or negative mood condition. Children's consumption of snack foods in
      the absence of hunger was measured.
