  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, biologics have changed the treatment of psoriasis, giving us additional
      therapeutic options that are potentially less toxic to the liver, kidneys, and bone marrow
      and are not teratogenic. Nevertheless, traditional systemic therapies continue to play an
      important role in the treatment of psoriasis in Turkey, even in patients who are requiring
      biologic treatments according to national recommendations. This study is designated to
      observe the effectiveness and safety of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in patients with
      moderate to severe psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to dermatology clinics, with moderate to severe psoriasis for whom the
      physician has decided to initiate psoriasis treatment with anti-TNFs in accordance with
      Turkish Ministry of Health regulations and reimbursements. (Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
      can be used for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult
      patients who failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to
      other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or Psoralen Ultra-Violet A.
      Patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis and appropriate anti-tuberculosis
      prophylaxis must be initiated if latent tuberculosis is diagnosed). This is a national,
      multi-center, observational, prospective photographic atlas study in patients who are treated
      with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for moderate to severe psoriasis in daily clinic
      according to Turkish regulations and reimbursement. Demographic data will be collected by the
      investigator at the beginning of the study. Every participant will be examined by the
      investigator and the Psoriasis Area Severity Index will be determined at the beginning of the
      study and at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24. Each patient will be asked to fill out the Dermatology
      Life Quality Index at each visit. Each patient will be asked to fill out the Work
      Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Psoriasis at the beginning and last visit
      (week 24). A standardized set of photographs will be taken at the beginning of the study and
      at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24 by a dermatologist trained about standardized photograph positioning
      and settings. Psoriasis Area Severity Index, Dermatology Life Quality Index and Photographic
      scores will be statistically analyzed separately in order to evaluate treatment response.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or very severe (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease. Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Baseline value - post-baseline value / Baseline value * 100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 75% Reduction in PASI Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with a 75% reduction (improvement) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from Baseline. PASI score is based on an assessment of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling), and the percent area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (best outcome) to 72 (worst outcome).</description>

    <measure>Dynamic Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Change in Psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>In the dynamic physician global assessment of change in psoriasis, the physician compared sets of standardized photographs taken at Baseline and at Week 24 for each participant and rated the change of psoriasis severity on the dynamic PGA scale from -5 (considerable deterioration), 0 (no or minimal change) to +5 (considerable improvement).</description>

    <measure>Dynamic Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Change in Psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>In the dynamic patient global assessment of change in psoriasis, the participant compared their own sets of standardized photographs taken at Baseline and at Week 24 and rated the change of the severity of psoriasis using the dynamic photographic scale adapted to a visual analog scale ranging from -5 (very large deterioration) to +5 (very large improvement).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Static Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>In the static physician assessment of psoriasis, psoriasis severity was rated first for all Baseline photographs and then for all Week 24 photographs according to the following scale:
Clear (no lesion); Psoriasis almost cleared; Mild psoriasis; Mild to moderate psoriasis; Moderate psoriasis; Moderate to severe psoriasis; Severe psoriasis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all.
Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Baseline value - post-baseline value / Baseline value * 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The following parameters were assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Psoriasis (WPAI:PSO):
Percent work time missed in the last 7 days due to problems associated with psoriasis;
Percent impairment at work, based on the participant's assessment of how much psoriasis affected their productivity while they were working in the last 7 days;
Percent overall loss of work productivity, based on hours missed and impairment while working due to psoriasis;
Percent general activity impairment, based on the participant's assessment of how much psoriasis affected their ability to perform regular daily activities, such as work around the house, shopping, child care, exercising, studying, etc.
Each domain score ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 100 (complete impairment). Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Baseline value - post-baseline value / Baseline value * 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants experiencing any adverse event or a serious adverse event during the study are summarized. A serious AE is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.

        <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or very severe (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease. Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Baseline value - post-baseline value / Baseline value * 100.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score</title>
        <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all.
Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Baseline value - post-baseline value / Baseline value * 100.</description>

        <description>The following parameters were assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Psoriasis (WPAI:PSO):
Percent work time missed in the last 7 days due to problems associated with psoriasis;
Percent impairment at work, based on the participant's assessment of how much psoriasis affected their productivity while they were working in the last 7 days;
Percent overall loss of work productivity, based on hours missed and impairment while working due to psoriasis;
Percent general activity impairment, based on the participant's assessment of how much psoriasis affected their ability to perform regular daily activities, such as work around the house, shopping, child care, exercising, studying, etc.
Each domain score ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 100 (complete impairment). Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Baseline value - post-baseline value / Baseline value * 100.</description>
