      Background: The frequency of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), the most common oral mucosa
      lesions seen in primary care, is up to 25% in the general population. Sublingual vitamin B12
      treatment, 1000 mcg per day for 6 months was found to be effective for patients suffering
      from RAS, regardless of the serum vitamin B12 level. However, the optimal therapeutic dose of
      vitamin B12 treatment remains unclear.

      Working hypothesis and aims:

      Aim-To assesses the influence of different vitamin B12 treatment doses on the frequency and
      severity of RAS episodes.

      Working hypothesis- The group receiving the higher dose of vitamin B12 treatment will have
      the lower frequency and severity of RAS episodes; the reaction will be faster.

      Methods: randomized, double blind, intervention study.

      Study population: 75 patients in three groups (total of 225 patients):

      Group I- will receive sublingual vitamin B12 treatment, 1000 mcg per day for 6 months Group
      II- will receive sublingual vitamin B12 treatment, 100 mcg per day for 6 months Group I- will
      receive sublingual vitamin B12 treatment, 2000 mcg per day for 6 months Study design: Study
      participates will be followed through three study periods: The first period- three months
      prior to receiving active treatment, the second period- six month of active treatment (with
      randomization to study groups), and the third period- three month after finishing active
      treatment. Frequency and severity of RAS episodes will be recorded by the patient with
      &quot;aphthous diary&quot; that will be filled daily during all study period (12 months).

      Expected results: This study will allow us to identify optimal dose of vitamin B12 treatment
      that will achieve faster and longer remission of RAS episodes.

      Importance: This is a very common problem in the population. Study results will help to
      identify optimal doses of vitamin B12 needed to treat RAS.

      Probable implications to Medicine: study results are supposed to give faster and better
      treatment for RAS episodes
