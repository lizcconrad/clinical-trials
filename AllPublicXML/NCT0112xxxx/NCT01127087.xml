    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Oral administration of the oxalate metabolizing enzyme Oxazyme (OC4) will degrade
      food-borne oxalate and hence prevent its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. In
      addition, by reducing oxalate concentrations in the gastrointestinal fluid, oxalate secretion
      from blood to the intestinal tract may be increased. Both effects would decrease blood levels
      of oxalate, and hence oxalate excretion in the urine.

      Oxazyme is an oxalate degrading compound that can potentially degrade food-borne oxalate and
      hence prevent its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.

      We propose a 20-patient open-label trial pilot study of one month of Oxazyme twice daily (1gm
      Oxazyme sachet dissolved in 150 ml water) among adult subjects with a history of calcium
      oxalate nephrolithiasis. Patients will be stratified into those with enteric hyperoxaluria
      after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB, n=10) and those with idiopathic hyperoxaluria (n=10).
      The patients will perform two, 24-hour, urine collections immediately before starting Oxazyme
      and on the last two days of the treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass hyperoxaluric Calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone subjects or
             Idiopathic hyperoxaluric CaOx stone subjects

          -  Patients must have or had radio-opaque stones present on x-ray, or a history
             consistent with the passage of a stone or stone surgery or Extracorporeal Shock Wave
             Lithotripsy (ESWL) in the last 5 years.

          -  Hyperoxaluria Ox/Cr ratio â‰¥36 mg/g

             volume.

          -  Patients may be taking drugs for the prevention of stone disease, including
             pyridoxine, thiazides, citrate supplements and allopurinol, as long as there have been
             no changes in these medications for at least 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary hyperoxaluria patients

          -  Use of Oxadrop, Oxabsorb, or other therapies affecting oxalate absorption from the
