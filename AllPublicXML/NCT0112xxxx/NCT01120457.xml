    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-936564 (MDX-1338)
      in relapsed Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other selected B-cell cancers and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the drug alone in relapsed/refractory AML
