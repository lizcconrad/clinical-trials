  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia, meaning a lack of oxygen, has been associated strongly with a wide range of human
      cancers. Hypoxia occurs when tumor growth exceeds the ability of blood vessels to supply the
      tumor with oxygenated blood. It is currently understood that hypoxic tumors are more
      aggressive. Current methods for measuring hypoxia include invasive procedures such as tissue
      biopsy, or insertion of an electrode into the tumor. EF5-PET may be a non-invasive way to
      measure tumor hypoxia.

      To establish PET imaging with the tracer EF5 as an accurate and reliable method for measuring
      the oxygen content of a tumor and to establish the measurement of secreted markers in blood
      as an accurate and reliable method for measuring the oxygen content of a tumor.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Any solid tumor malignancies of any stage meeting all of the following criteria:
             Minimum tumor dimension is at least 1 cm (to ensure it is above the detection
             threshold of PET imaging). Examples include but are not limited to: locally advanced
             squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck to be treated by either initial surgery
             or primary chemoradiotherapy; inoperable non-small cell lung cancer or pancreatic
             carcinoma to be treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, which may be biopsied again at
             the time of percutaneous needle delivery of implanted fiducial markers.

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed malignancies should not have initiated treatment for
             their disease before participating in this study. Patients with recurrent or second
             malignancies may have had prior therapy as appropriate for their disease, but should
             have completed all prior treatment at least 30 days before participation in this study
             and should not have initiated new treatment for the current problem.

          -  Greater than or equal to eighteen years of age.

          -  Sufficiently healthy to tolerate all study procedures.

          -  Organ and marrow function sufficient to undergo planned therapy.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        â€¢ Pregnant or nursing
