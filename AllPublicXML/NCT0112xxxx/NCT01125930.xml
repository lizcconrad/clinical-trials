  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea is a type of rosacea that causes a red face often with
      frequent flushing, topical sensitivity and prominent blood vessels. We think that long term
      damage to skin from the sun (photodamage) may play a role in causing this type of rosacea.
      Tretinoin is a topical medication that is known to improve photodamage. We want to find out
      if Atralin (tretinoin 0.05%) Gel used for up to 46 weeks will improve
      erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR).

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 6, 12, 18, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire was given at each visit. It involves 10 questions that relate to symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships and treatment. The total DLQI score is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <measure>Photodamage</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Photodamage was measured at baseline and Week 24 visits using the nine point Hamilton-Griffiths Photoaging Score categories. The categories were developed using photographs of subject representing grades of photodamge from none (0) to severe (8). A direct comparison is made between the subject and the photographic standards. If an exact match cannot be made, the interstandard scores (1, 3, 5, 7) are used.</description>

        <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire was given at each visit. It involves 10 questions that relate to symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships and treatment. The total DLQI score is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>
