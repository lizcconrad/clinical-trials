      This study is designed as a prediction trial. That is, our primary purpose is to develop a
      model that can be applied clinically as a user-friendly &quot;baseline&quot; questionnaire that is
      capable of predicting &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; based on a patient's pre-surgical expectations
      of their final outcome. In the process, a secondary goal is to develop an outcomes measure.

      Aims:

        1. To develop a novel, psychometrically sound, trauma patient expectation instrument that:
           a) demonstrates content validity; b) considers patient and surgeon expectations; c)
           predicts orthopedic outcomes; d) is reliable; e) is patient friendly; and f) is easy to
           score and interpret. This will be known as the Trauma Expectation Factor (TEF).

        2. To develop a novel, psychometrically sound, trauma patient outcomes instrument that: a)
           demonstrates content validity; b) measures current condition in the same domains as the
           expectation instrument; c) demonstrates construct validity; d) demonstrates criterion
           validity; e) is reliable; f) is patient friendly; and g) is easy to score and interpret.
           This will be known as the Trauma Outcomes Measure (TOM).

      Hypotheses:

      H#1. A simple pre-surgical questionnaire that measures patient expectations (i.e., Trauma
      Expectation Factor) after an ankle fracture requiring surgery will predict an &quot;expected&quot;
      score on a standardized disease-specific ankle instrument (i.e., AAOS Foot and Ankle Core
      Score).

      H#2. A similar instrument that is reworded to assess current condition (i.e., Trauma Outcomes
      Measure) instead of expectations, is a valid, reliable, and responsive measure of a traumatic
      patient's condition.

      H#3. Patient and surgeon expectations of final outcome status are different; however, the
      differences get smaller over time.

          -  Subject has severe dementia or other severe mental health problem that may preclude
             him/her from completing study questionnaires

          -  Subject is participating in other competing clinical research that may interfere with
             participation in this research
