  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current research program aims to study how sleep disordered breathing, age and genetics
      affect memory in older adult veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

      The study will help researchers and clinicians better understand the relationship among PTSD,
      sleep disordered breathing, genetics and memory function.

      The research project will clarify how sleep disordered breathing and Apolipoprotein (APOE)
      status affect cognitive decline in a population already at risk for accelerated
      decline-veterans with PTSD.

      To fill this knowledge gap properly, we will conduct a longitudinal study and data include
      analytic techniques designed specifically to identify moderators and mediators of clinical
      change.
