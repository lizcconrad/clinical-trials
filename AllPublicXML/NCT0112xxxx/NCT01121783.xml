  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the sweet taste receptors in the gut are
      involved in sensing sweet substances and controlling appetite and the amount we eat.
      Lactisole is a substance commonly used in food products to reduce the perceived sweetness of
      certain sugars and sweeteners. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the responses
      to a glucose solution, intragastrically administered to healthy male and female volunteers,
      is affected by the presence of lactisole in the gut. Understanding the mechanisms by which
      nutrients are initially detected in the gut and how they influence food intake is critical to
      the development of novel food products that could reduce food consumption.

      Obesity is epidemically prevalent and a major risk factor for chronic diseases making it
      fundamental to understand the pathways controlling food intake. During the course of a meal
      and afterwards the gut and brain communicate to control how full the eater feels and thus
      control the amount of food eaten. The information relayed from the gut to the brain regarding
      ingested nutrients is of increasing importance and understanding the mechanisms by which
      nutrient molecules are initially detected in the gut and how they signal to the brain to
      influence food intake is critical to the development of novel food products that could induce
      fullness and reduce food consumption. Increasing our understanding of how nutrients are
      sensed in the gut and how this may influence subsequent food intake provides promising
      targets for obesity prevention and treatment. Recent discoveries have shown that sweet taste
      receptors similar to those located in the tongue are present in the gut. It is suggested that
      theses receptors are involved in the way nutrients are sensed and may play an important role
      in appetite control and food intake.

    <description>In order to assess gastric emptying, a stable isotope of carbon, in the form of 13Csodium acetate will be added to the test meal. This is absorbed only once it has passed through the stomach into the duodenum. It is then metabolised and exhaled in the breath as 13Clabelled carbon dioxide (CO2) where it can be measured.</description>
