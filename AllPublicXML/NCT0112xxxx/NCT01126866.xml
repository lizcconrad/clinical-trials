  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to primarily assess the efficacy of an intensified
      chemotherapy consisting of a combination of FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab. The main focus will be
      laid on the rate of patients who achieve secondary complete (R0)-resectable metastases.

      The FOLFIRI + bevacizumab as well as the FOLFOXIRI regimens have been shown previously to be
      both effective in the treatment of advanced CRC with having manageable toxicities. Therefore,
      an intensified chemotherapy combining these two standard regimens might be a promising
      therapeutic approach improving the treatment of metastatic disease and outcome of CRC.

      Patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma of UICC stage IV, and liver and/or lung
      metasta¬ses only, which are not optimally resectable, will be enrolled in this single-arm
      phase II study.

      A minimum of 4 cycles (=8 weeks) of chemo¬therapy prior to surgery is mandatory for all
      patients. However, patients may withdraw from the study at any time upon their own request.
      Treatment with preoperative chemothera¬py will continue until 2-4 weeks prior to surgery with
      the last application of bevacizumab (only FOLFOXIRI) 4 weeks before surgery, at longest 16
      cycles (= 32 weeks) for candidates not eli¬gible for surgery. Treatment will be discontinued
      prematurely at disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      As secondary endpoints the acute and perioperative toxi¬city of preoperative chemotherapy
      according to NCI CTCAE v 3.0 including all peri-and post-surgical complications as well as
      progression free survival and overall survival and quality of life will be assessed.
