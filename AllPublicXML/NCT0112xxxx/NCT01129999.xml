  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive cognitive-behaviour interventions (CBT) combined with pharmacotherapy for smoking
      cessation are well established and have been proved to be efficacious. Nevertheless, they
      yield only long-term abstinence rates about 35%. Considering the high interest of smokers in
      alternative medicine, the availability of a broad range of treatment methods, of which
      smokers choose an intervention according to their preferences, might contribute to improve
      treatment outcome. While hypnotherapy (HT) is an already widely promoted alternative method
      for aiding cessation, considerable methodological shortcomings of studies on this topic limit
      the interpretability of the results. In 2006, the German Academic Advisory Committee for
      Psychotherapy released new guidelines that included HT as an acceptable treatment for smoking
      cessation. The committee conceded, however, that conclusions concerning its efficacy are
      restricted due to the heterogeneity of findings. Hence, further well-designed studies are
      required to better test the efficacy of HT in comparison to accepted treatments. This
      randomised, controlled trial aims to compare the efficacy of CBT and HT for smoking
      cessation. Further, the influence of moderating variables will be investigated. It is
      hypothesized that 1) participants receiving CBT will evince higher abstinence rates than
      those receiving HT, 2) levels of nicotine dependence, self-efficacy and motivation to change
      will moderate the intervention effects and 3) participants with high levels of suggestibility
      will evince higher abstinence rates in the HT-intervention compared to participants with low
      levels of suggestibility. 220 adult healthy smokers will be randomized to receive either CBT
      or HT. Both programmes will be conducted in 6, weekly, 90-minute group sessions. Participants
      will be followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 und 12 month post-treatment. Generalized estimating
      equation models will be conducted to analyse group differences on abstinence rates. The
      models will include the above mentioned moderator variables.
