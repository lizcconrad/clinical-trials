    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the expression of biological markers in induced sputum and
      peripheral blood T lymphocytes of patients with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema
      (CPFE). The features of CPFE would be observed, including pulmonary function tests and
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide （FENO）.

      A new disease including concomitant upper-lobe emphysema and lower-lobe fibrosis in radiology
      has been defined as (combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, CPFE). CPFE has distinct
      clinical characteristics with the emphysema and the pulmonary fibrosis, including gender,
      age, clinical manifestation, pulmonary function tests and prognosis.

      Normally Th1/Th2 is balanced. However, patients with emphysema had a significantly higher
      expression of Th1. On the other hand, higher expression of Th2 is involved in the development
      of pulmonary fibrosis. The expressions of Th1 and Th2 were proved to play a central role in
      pathogenesis of emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, while are still unknown in patients of
      combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. The study would observe the Th1/Th2 expression,
      pulmonary function tests , fractional exhaled nitric oxide （FENO）and other features in CPFE
      patients.
