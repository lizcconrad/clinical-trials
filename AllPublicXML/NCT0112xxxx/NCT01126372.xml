  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurely born infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease (CHD) are at
      increased risk to develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Abnormal left to right blood flow
      through a patent ductus arteriosus can cause intestinal ischemia and compromise the
      gastrointestinal tract as a barrier to infection. In some infants, bacterial translocation
      leads to NEC which may result in death, intestinal perforation, cholestasis and, at the very
      least, feeding problems. Predicting which infants with CHD will develop NEC will potentially
      decrease the severity of disease if interventions were started earlier.

      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows determination of regional oxygen saturation levels
      in tissues such as brain, kidney, and as recently reported, intestine. This study will test
      whether or not decreasing intestinal oxygen saturations can predict the development of NEC in
      this at risk population before the symptoms become severe. NIRS probes will be placed on the
      forehead, flank and abdomen of eligible infants and regional oxygen saturations will be
      recorded prospectively and continuously with the clinical care team blinded to the data. The
      development of NEC and significant feeding problems will then be correlated with the regional
      oxygen saturations to determine whether decreased intestinal oxygen saturations predicted
      early signs and symptoms of NEC.

      We anticipate generating pilot data in 30 infants who meet inclusion criteria. Support of
      this research will be provided partially by Somanetics, the manufacturer of the INVOS
      regional oxygen saturation monitors. They will, however, have no control over the data
      generated by this study.
