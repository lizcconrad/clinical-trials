  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a disease with an extremely poor prognosis. Such poor results are
      largely due to a high incidence of local or peritoneal recurrence even after curative R0
      resection. If occult microscopic metastasis or residual cancer could be predicted correctly
      and identify the high risk of peritoneal recurrence, we may have chance to treat these
      patients by different multimodal locoregional or adjuvant therapy to improve the treatment
      outcome.

      The purpose of this study has three specific aims: (1) to determine the relationship between
      peritoneal washing cytology (PWC) results and clinicopathologic parameters of pancreatic
      cancers, (2) to identify the predictive value of PWC and postoperative drainage cytology on
      the peritoneal recurrence or outcomes, (3) to dissect the molecular mechanism of peritoneal
      recurrence, especially on the PWC-inducing peritoneal seeding process.
