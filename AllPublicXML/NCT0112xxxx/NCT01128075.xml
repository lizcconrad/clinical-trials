    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, two-arm non-comparative, observational, 96 week Phase IV study to
      evaluate treatment adherence when using RebiSmart™ for self-injection of Rebif® in subjects
      with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS).

      Subjects who have a confirmed diagnosis of RMS using McDonald Criteria and meet the
      eligibility criteria during a screening period of up to 28 days will be provided with an
      electronic self-injection device (RebiSmart™) to inject Rebif® for 96 weeks.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate treatment adherence for subjects with RMS over
      24 weeks of treatment when using RebiSmart™ for self-injection of Rebif® in a multi-dose
      cartridge.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females between 18 and 65 years of age.

          -  Have RMS according to the revised McDonald Criteria.

          -  Subject is eligible for Rebif® therapy according to indications and clinical use in
             the Rebif® Product Monograph.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to entering the screening period.

          -  Must register with the Rebif® Multiple Support Program.

          -  Subjects previously on disease modifying drugs (DMDs) must be stable and not be
             experiencing any side effects related to the previous DMDs at the time of enrollment
             into the study, in the opinion of the investigator. Rebif® will be prescribed as per
             Product Monograph and a washout period will be left at the discretion of the
             investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any disease other than MS that could better explain his/her signs and symptoms.

          -  Receive any other injectable medications on a regular basis during the week prior to
             the screening period or throughout the duration of the study. The administration of a
             single injection for treatment or prophylaxis of a condition unrelated to the
             subject's MS (e.g.,influenza or pneumococcus vaccination) will be acceptable.

          -  Are contraindicated for the use of Rebif® according to the Rebif® Product Monograph.

          -  Have a diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).

          -  Participation in any other investigational trial prior to 30 days of Study Day 1.

          -  Any visual or physical impairment that precludes the subject from self-injecting the
             treatment using RebiSmart™

          -  Have received previous treatment with Rebif within 5 years prior to screening.

          -  Subjects have any medical, psychiatric or other conditions that compromise his/her
             ability to understand the subject information, to give informed consent, to comply
             with the study protocol or to complete the study questionnaires.
