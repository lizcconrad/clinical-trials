  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is now well recognized that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic
      disorder of childhood that extends into adulthood for many individuals. A number of
      impairments in daily life functioning have been identified in adults with ADHD, including
      marital distress, risky driving, and using less effective parenting practices (e.g., Barkley,
      2006).

      Specifically, some parents with ADHD have been found to use inconsistent discipline, less
      parental involvement, and less positive reinforcement with their children compared to parents
      without ADHD (e.g., Chen &amp; Johnston, 2007; Chronis-Tuscano, Clarke, Rooney, Diaz, &amp; Pian,
      2008). While there is some evidence that stimulant medication improves parental functioning
      for adults with ADHD, only one study has specifically explored the use of stimulant
      medication and parenting(Chronis-Tuscano, Seymour, Stine, Jones, Jiles, Rooney, et al.,
      2008).

      The purpose of this study is to explore whether or not the stimulant medication,
      lisdexamfetamine, improves parent functioning. Measures of parenting behavior, parental
      psychosocial functioning, and child psychosocial functioning will be collected. It is
      hypothesized that lisdexamfetamine will be associated with some improvement in these
      assessments.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy families with at least one parent (either mother or father who will serve as the
      identified subject) and a school-aged child (ages 5-16) with ADHD will be recruited to
      participate in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of lisdexamfetamine to assess the acute
      and prolonged effects of medication usage on parent-child interactions. The protocol will
      employ traditional self-report measures of parental competency and functioning used in other
      studies, but will supplement them with one of the most widely used observational laboratory
      tasks.

      Families will be recruited on a rolling basis and the length of the study will be
      approximately 8 weeks. In the first three weeks of the study, parents will complete the dose
      optimization phase to find the optimal dose of lisdexamfetamine. Lisdexamfetamine will be
      initiated at a dose of 30mg and increased to 50mg for week 2 and 70mg for week 3. During week
      4, measures of the acute effects of lisdexamfetamine will be collected, and parents will
      complete the observational laboratory parent child interaction tasks two times (i.e., on
      lisdexamfetamine and on placebo- phase I). In the remaining four weeks of the study (phase 2)
      a between subjects comparison will be conducted. Half of the parents will be randomized to
      receive lisdexamfetamine and half will receive a placebo. Measures of parent functioning will
      once again be collected at the end of phase 2 and parents will complete the observational
      laboratory task, which will allow for exploration of prolonged lisdexamfetamine treatment on
      parent-child interactions.

    <description>Observations of parents and children as they interact with each other during a five minute homework task and during a 10 minute non-academic task. Interactions were recorded and later coded by trained observers. Observers counted number of parent and child behaviors. Average number of behaviors per group were computed. Three subjects dropped prior to completing this assessment and one participant completed the other endpoint measures but not the DPICS, which is why the total N for this outcome is 23 at study endpoint. At end of period II (study endpoint), the medication group (n=10) was compared to the placebo group (N=13).</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Side Effects Rating Scale - Percent Present for All Reported Adverse Events Occurring at a Rate of 5% or More</measure>
    <time_frame>end of medication optimization phase/week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Self report of side effects measured during dose titration using the Pittsburgh Side Effects Rating Scale. Consists of 13 items each rated using 0(none) to 3 (severe) scales. Items endorsed as 1 (mild) or above were counted as present. Information on additional adverse events not part of the PSERS was collected by direct interview of the participants. All side effects occurring at a frequency of 5% or more are reported. Initial side effect data is reported for all participants entering pre-randomization med optimization phase who took medication (n=36) vs those formally enrolled (N=27). Also, side effect data for the med titration phase is entered per dose rather than per participant. For example, a person trying the 30, 50 and 70mg dose is entered is entered 4 times (no med as well) vs. just once. This is why baseline N is higher than for other outcomes collected at weeks 4 and 8 where data was only available for those completing the pre-randomization med optimization phase (N=27).</description>

        <description>Parent ratings of their child's symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD). Measure consists of 45 items each rated on a Likert scale that ranges from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Items are averaged to form adhd-inattention, adhd-hyperactive/impulsive, ODD, and CD scores.Within subject comparison of no medication baseline vs. optimal dose medication. ADHD subscale consists of 20 items with range of 0 to 60. ODD subscale consists of 9 items with range of 0 to 27. CD subscale consists of 15 items with range of 0 to 45. For all subscales, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS) - Behavior Percentages</title>
        <description>Observations of parents and children as they interact with each other during a five minute homework task and during a 10 minute non-academic task. Interactions were recorded and later coded by trained observers. Observers counted number of parent and child behaviors with each parent-child dyad counted as one participant. Percentages of behaviors as a function of total verbalizations (for praise, negative talk, demanding) or as a function of commands and questions (for impatient and responsive) were computed. This outcome was part of period I- the within subject comparison of all participating subjects once on placebo (n=26) and once with all subjects on active medication (N=26). (the 27th participant completed this phase but partial data was lost due to mechanical failure with video equipment so their data was not included). All adult participants received both placebo and active medication in this phase that comprised all of period 1.</description>

The PSI is a measure of the source and degree of parenting stress (Abidin, 1995), which contains 120 items which are rated on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale. 101 of these items are used to compute a total stress score (reported below) as the other 19 report on specific life stressors. Range is 101 to 505, for which higher scores indicate higher levels of stress. At endpoint, the medication group (N=9) was compared to the placebo group (N=13).</description>

The PSI is a measure of the source and degree of parenting stress (Abidin, 1995), which contains 120 items which are rated on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale. 101 of these items are used to compute a total stress score (reported below) as the other 19 report on specific life stressors. Range is 101 to 505, for which higher scores indicate higher levels of stress. At endpoint, the medication group (N=9) was compared to the placebo group (N=13).</description>

Items rated using Likert scales that range from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 2 (&quot;often&quot;).At week 8, the medication group (N=10) was compared to the placebo group (N=11). There are two subscales: Problem Behaviors (18 items rated between 0-2 for total score range of 0 to 36) and Social Skills (40 items rated 0-2 with range for total score of 0-80). The total scores for these scales are reported as standard scores, with a population mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. For problem behavior higher scores indicate worse behavior whereas for social skills, higher scores indicate more social (or better behavior).</description>

        <title>Impairment Rating Scale (IRS)</title>
        <description>measures global functioning of child rated by the parent who was the participant in the study. The IRS is a 7 item measure that uses visual-analogue scales to evaluate the child’s problem level and need for treatment in developmentally important areas, such as peer relationships, adult-child relationships, academic performance. Each subscale including overall severity is scored from 0 (no problem) to 6 (extreme problem) with higher scores indicating more impairment. At endpoint, the medication group (N=10) was compared to the placebo group (N=13).</description>

        <description>measures change in parenting practices.The APQ is a 42-item measure (each item ranges from 1/always to 5/never) on which parents are asked to indicate the frequency with which they implement the following parenting practices: involvement (10 items range 10-50- higher scores mean more parental involvement), positive parenting (6 items with range of 6 to 30 and higher scores indicate greater use of praise), poor monitoring/supervision (10 items with range of 10 to 50 and higher scores indicate less supervision/monitoring), inconsistent discipline(6 items with range of 6 to 30 and higher scores indicate greater problems with inconsistent discipline), and corporal punishment (3 items with range of 3-15 and greater scores indicate more use of corporal punishment). Items are rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (“never”) to 5 (“always”). Items summed into composite scales.
At endpoint, the medication group (N=9) was compared to the placebo group (N=13).</description>

        <title>Impairment Rating Scale (IRS)</title>
        <description>self rated measure of global impairment of adult participants derived from the child IRS. The IRS-A assesses impairment overall and in specific domains, including interpersonal relationships, academic performance, and self-esteem, and includes adult-specific domains of functioning, such as employment and romantic relationships. The IRS-A assesses current problems and need for treatment. Each subscale is rated from 0 (no problem) to 6 (extreme problem).At endpoint, the medication group (N=11) was compared to the placebo group (N=13). Overall Impairment is its own subscale and not a composite score of the others.</description>

Interactions were recorded and later coded by trained observers. Observers counted number of parent and child behaviors. Average number of behaviors per group were computed. Three subjects dropped prior to completing this assessment and one participant completed the other endpoint measures but not the DPICS, which is why the total N for this outcome is 23 at study endpoint.

        <title>Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS) - Behavior Percentages</title>
        <description>Observations of parents and children as they interact with each other during a five minute homework task and during a 10 minute non-academic task. Interactions were recorded and later coded by trained observers. Observers counted number of parent and child behaviors. Percentages of behaviors as a function of total verbalizations (for praise, negative talk, demanding) or as a function of commands and questions (for impatient and responsive) were computed.Three subjects dropped prior to completing this assessment and one participant completed the other endpoint measures but not the DPICS, which is why the total N for this outcome is 23 at study endpoint. At end of period II (study endpoint), the medication group (n=10) was compared to the placebo group (N=13).</description>

        <title>Pittsburgh Side Effects Rating Scale - Percent Present for All Reported Adverse Events Occurring at a Rate of 5% or More</title>
        <description>Self report of side effects measured during dose titration using the Pittsburgh Side Effects Rating Scale. Consists of 13 items each rated using 0(none) to 3 (severe) scales. Items endorsed as 1 (mild) or above were counted as present. Information on additional adverse events not part of the PSERS was collected by direct interview of the participants. All side effects occurring at a frequency of 5% or more are reported. Initial side effect data is reported for all participants entering pre-randomization med optimization phase who took medication (n=36) vs those formally enrolled (N=27). Also, side effect data for the med titration phase is entered per dose rather than per participant. For example, a person trying the 30, 50 and 70mg dose is entered is entered 4 times (no med as well) vs. just once. This is why baseline N is higher than for other outcomes collected at weeks 4 and 8 where data was only available for those completing the pre-randomization med optimization phase (N=27).</description>
        <time_frame>end of medication optimization phase/week 4</time_frame>
        <population>Within-subjects analysis; data entered per dose not per subject. For example, if subject 1 took 30mg, 50mg and 70mgdoses during titration, they are recorded as three separate entries. Sample size reduces as dose increases because participants stopped at lowest acceptable dose and only moved to higher dose if they did not meet optimization criteria.</population>

            <description>The PSERS was completed at intake by all 38 participants who consented and met eligibility criteria in order to assess pre-medication rates of side effects. This was done because the PSERS measures commonly occurring events such as insomnia and irritability that can be seen in unmedicated patients with ADHD.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse event data reported for period II (mean duration 8 weeks). While 27 total subjects were randomized to a treatment arm (med vs.placebo), 1 withdrew before med was dispensed which is why we have side effect data for 26 and not 27.</time_frame>
      <desc>Pittsburgh Side Effect Scale (PSERS) was given at every visit to all participants to measure adverse events. It contains 13 items measured medication side effects from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) measured suicide risk. It was given at every visit. Both measures were self completed.</desc>
