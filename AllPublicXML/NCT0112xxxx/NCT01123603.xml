      To the investigators knowledge there is no research data published to date regarding the
      lower urinary tract symptoms in women with leiomyomas. The primary aims of this study are:

        1. To determine prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients who present for care
           for symptomatic leiomyomata.

        2. To compare change in lower urinary tract symptoms within treatment groups measured by
           the UDI-6 total before and at six months after three common treatments for symptomatic
           uterine fibroids including: hysterectomy, myomectomy, or uterine artery embolization.

      The study proposed here will hopefully answer the question if one particular therapy is
      appropriate to treat fibroids and relieve lower urinary tract symptoms.

      1. Uterine fibroids Uterine leiomyomas or fibroids are one of the most common conditions
           affecting women of reproductive age. They account for approximately a third of all
           hysterectomies performed. Symptoms often attributed to uterine leiomyomas include
           excessive menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and so called &quot;bulk symptoms,&quot;
           or symptoms related to pressure on adjacent organs such as ureteral obstruction, urinary
           frequency and urgency, rectal pressure, pelvic pressure and increasing abdominal girth.
           Current treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids includes hysterectomy, myomectomy and
           uterine fibroid embolization.

        2. Lower urinary tract symptoms Although, urinary symptoms like frequency, urgency,
           incontinence, and voiding dysfunction are often attributed to fibroids, the relationship
           between fibroids and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) has been poorly studied. The
           public health burden of fibroids has been studied before and after radical hysterectomy,
           supracervical hysterectomy, and total abdominal hysterectomy.(1-3) What is missing in
           the literature is a comparison of traditional and non-traditional surgical fibroid
           techniques in a prospective fashion. Moreover, there are no studies evaluating the
           relationship between anatomic factors like uterine size or fibroid number or location
           and the presence of LUTS.
