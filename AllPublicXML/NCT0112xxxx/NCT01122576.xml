  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and subject satisfaction with three
      different FDA approved lenses for adults over 40 years of age who desire a reduction in
      spectacle dependence.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a clinically documented diagnosis of age-related bilateral
             cataracts that are considered amenable to treatment with standard phacoemulsification
             cataract extraction.

          -  Subjects must require a spherical lens power from 10.00 D to 33.00 D

          -  Subjects must have the potential for corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 20/32
             or better in both eyes, as documented by a Potential Acuity Meter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with conditions with increased risk of zonular rupture, such as
             pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Zonular rupture during cataract surgery may affect
             postoperative centration, tilt, and stability of the lens.

          -  Subjects who have any active inflammation or edema (swelling) of the cornea, including
             but not limited to the following: keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and keratouveitis.

          -  Subjects with visually significant diabetic retinopathy (proliferative or
             non-proliferative) which reduces potential acuity to 20/32 or worse.
