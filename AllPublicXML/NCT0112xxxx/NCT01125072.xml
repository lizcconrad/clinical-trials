  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest pain is one of the most common complaints that brings a patient to the emergency
      department (ED). The differential diagnosis of chest pain is broad and includes cardiac as
      well as non-cardiac diseases. One of the initial goals in the ED evaluation of a patient
      presenting with chest pain is to rapidly and accurately diagnose the presence or absence of
      acute coronary syndrome. The diagnostic accuracy of the initial routine evaluation is often
      limited and results in frequent admissions for patients presenting with chest pain for
      further diagnostic testing.

      Echocardiography has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute myocardial
      infarction. Tissue Doppler imaging with strain and strain rate (SR) measurement is a new
      echocardiographic technique, which enables accurate assessment of regional left ventricular
      systolic and diastolic function. Prior studies have shown that abnormal strain and SR are
      highly sensitive markers of ischemia. Acute ischemia induces early systolic thinning and a
      delay in the onset of systolic thickening, a progressive decrease in the rate and degree of
      maximal systolic thickening, and an abnormal ischemia-related thickening which occurs after
      aortic valve closure. A major obstacle to the routine use of echocardiography in the ED is
      the need for portable studies, using heavy, bulky portable echo machines. There are currently
      available portable hand-held echo machines (GE-Vivid I) that produce high quality images and
      offer an opportunity to incorporate echocardiography into routine practice in the ED.

      This study will use of early, portable echocardiography, with detailed assessment of wall
      motion and left ventricular function by strain and strain rate measurements, for the
      evaluation of chest pain in the ED. It is hypothesized that an early with detailed left
      ventricular function assessment will be highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of
      myocardial ischemia, and will enable rapid triage of patients who present to the ED with
      chest pain.
