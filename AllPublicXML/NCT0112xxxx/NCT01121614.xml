  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonic cutting-coagulation devices (UCCD) are surgical instruments which use ultrasonic
      energy to cut through and coagulate tissue. An Ethicon version (trademarked &quot;Harmonic
      Scalpel&quot; and &quot;Ultracision&quot;) is used in a variety of surgical procedures. Its surgical
      performance has been directly compared with that of electrically powered diathermy
      instruments in animal and clinical trials. LOTUS is a company based in Ashburton, Devon,
      which has developed a UCCD that works in a slightly different way to the Harmonic Scalpel.
      There are also bipolar feedback diathermy instruments which use electrical energy to seal
      blood vessels, such as LigaSure. The aim of this project is to obtain data to design a fully
      powered trial to answer the research question: do LOTUS and Ethicon UCCDs and LigaSure
      bipolar device reliably seal and divide blood vessels? The investigators will also be
      examining the degree of collateral tissue damage caused by each instrument.

      Hypotheses

        -  LOTUS UCCD, Ethicon Harmonic Scalpel and LigaSure are equivalent at sealing and dividing
           mesenteric blood vessels.

        -  LOTUS UCCD, Ethicon Harmonic Scalpel and LigaSure cause equal amount of collateral
           damage when sealing and dividing blood vessels.
