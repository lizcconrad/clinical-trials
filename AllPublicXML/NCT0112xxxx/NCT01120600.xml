  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that treatment with odanacatib will
      result in increased bone mineral density (BMD) compared to treatment with placebo. This study
      will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of odanacatib for male osteoporosis participants.

      The original study was divided into two parts, with the primary analysis of endpoints to
      occur at 24 months and participants will then remain in the study for an additional 12 months
      (Part 2). Amendment 1 of the protocol removed the additional 12 month period and the Month 36
      BMD analysis was deleted.
