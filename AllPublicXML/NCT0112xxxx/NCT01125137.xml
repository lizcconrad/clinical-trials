      Purpose:

      To compare the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), MMP-8, MMP-13 and tissue
      inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in keloid skin tissue with normal skin in the same
      patient and with normal discarded skin tissue (control). The investigators aim to correlate
      between levels of MMPs in patients with keloid scarring in comparison with normal and
      discarded tissue.

      The investigators anticipate enrolling 20 patients into our study. The COST of the excision
      and related procedures WILL NOT be covered by the research study. Patient and patient's
      health insurance provider will be responsible for all costs of treatment and related
      procedures.

        1. Patients must be at least 18 years old and have a keloid which they will agree to have
           biopsied.

        2. During a screening visit we will obtain determine if patient fulfills
           inclusion/exclusion criteria, obtain informed visit and HIPAA authorization. Demographic
           information and pertinent medical history will be obtained and risk factors will be
           explained to the patient.

        3. A focused dermatological exam will be performed assessing the severity and location of
           the keloid as well as skin phototype of the patient.

        4. A Henry Ford Hospital Dermatosurgeon will excise a biopsy of the keloid tissue and
           normal tissue from enrolled patients and the specimens will be sent to the lab for
           workup. Discarded skin samples will also be collected from Henry Ford Plastic Surgery
           and Dermatology department and analyzed as an additional control for normal skin. The
           discarded skin samples (controls) will be region specific and matched with a keloid
           sample that is from the same area of the body as the biopsy sample.

        5. Levels of MMP's will be measured in keloid, normal tissue samples and discarded skin
           samples.

        6. Levels of TIMPs will be measured in keloid, normal tissue and discarded tissue samples
