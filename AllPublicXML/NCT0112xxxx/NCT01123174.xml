  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The suicidal behaviors are phenomena eminently multifactorial. It is thus always difficult to
      define univocal strategies of prevention of suicide repetition, during the emergency stay,
      i.e. almost in general population. One find 23 clinical trials in this topic in the past 25
      years, and 18 are negative. The majority of the positive trials have the concern of being
      dissociated from an assumption of responsibility of care strictly speaking, to adopt a
      position &quot;méta&quot;, nearer to the concept of &quot;case management&quot;: how to remain in contact with
      the suicide attempter, without forcing it in this every day life, replacing a possible
      proposing, but assumption of responsibility resources reliable and quickly accessible in the
      event of at risk situation? Each one of these studies tests devices which seem more
      appropriate to such or such characteristic of this population, by retaining only simple
      criteria like the sex, the number of former suicide attempts, the proposal or not for an
      assumption of responsibility of care, the observance or not with the plan of care. Thus, it
      would seem interesting to combine these approaches in an algorithm entitled &quot;ALGOS&quot;.

      Main aim: To test the effectiveness of this algorithm of case management, named &quot;ALGOS&quot;, in
      reducing the number of death by suicide, in terms of reduction of suicide re-attempts and the
      number of loss of contact patients in the ALGOS group during 6 months period, compared to a
      control group of suicide attempters treated as usual (i.e. primarily transmitted to the
      attending physician).

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate, according to the method validated by Beecham in 1992,
      direct medico-economic impact in the year which follows the introduction of algorithm ALGOS.
      Reduction of the other suicidal behaviors in 6 months (reduction in the full number of
      suicidal repetitions in each group, evolution of the score of suicidal ideation, etc…). To
      evaluate the effect of the algorithm, at the 13th month. To study the possible differences
      within the time in terms of suicidal repetitions in the 2 groups. To propose different
      profiles of answers according to psychopathology, the number of suicide attempts, suicidal
      character, the sex,…

      Methodology: Comparative simple blind prospective multicentric controlled study

      Evaluations: The subjects will be included in the participating centers following a suicide
      attempt (SA). After checking of the criteria, information and signature of the study consent,
      the subjects will be randomized in one of the 2 groups (ALGOS versus Control). A fax of
      inclusion will be sent to the centralized research team of the Clinical Investigation Center
      (CIC) of Lille. All the subjects included will be then evaluated at the 6th month and 13th
      month after the SA, during a phone call. The final evaluation will be carried out in the
      current of the 13th month, so as to avoid a recontact at the time of the period birthday, too
      charged affectively at the majority with the patients. This phone call, personal, will be
      carried out by an trained psychologist. A mail preventing the subject of the call will be
      addressed approximately 10 days before. During the evaluations at the 6th month and 13th
      month, the number of suicidal repetitions will be reported, consumption of care since
      inclusion will be noted, the scale of suicidal ideation of Beck assessed, and a
      psychopathological evaluation carried out (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview DSM
      IV).

If the subject is not a first attempter : he will be recontacted on the telephone between the 10th and the 21st day following the SA. If the subject is not contacted or little observing in the plan of care, it will receive a series of postcards then regularly, with 4 recoveries: to 2, 3, 4 and 5 months after the attempt.</description>
