  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently observed that many patients who had received high dose
      Interleukin-2 (IL2) and failed to respond to it but who then go immediately to temozolomide
      seemed to enjoy extremely good responses which seem better quality and longer duration than
      typically observed for temozolomide alone. To date, the investigators have observed 5
      sequentially treated patients with metastatic melanoma who had failed high dose IL-2 but who
      then went on to receive immediate temozolomide. Two of these patients had complete responses
      and 3 had very strong partial response. In a recent phase II study of extended low dose
      temozolomide alone given in the same manner as the post IL-2 patients noted above, the
      response rate was 12.5% and all of these were partial responses only. The responses that the
      investigators observed were at a much higher rate of response as well as much better quality
      than expected for temozolomide. The responses were also better than those observed when
      temozolomide was given first and then followed by high dose IL-2. The investigators concluded
      that perhaps the major benefit the investigators observed was a result of the prior high dose
      IL-2 therapy modulated by the temozolomide and that the sequence of treatment was clearly
      crucial for this response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic malignant melanoma remains a disease with a very poor prognosis and median
      survival duration of less than one year. Durable remissions with conventional therapy are
      rare and therefore clinical trials remain a primary treatment modality for metastatic
      disease. There are 2 currently FDA-approved therapies for metastatic melanoma. Chemotherapy
      with single agent parenteral dacarbazine or its oral pro-drug, temozolomide, are capable of
      producing responses in 6.5 to 20% of patients. These responses are usually minor to partial
      at best and are not durable. Combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs has not been
      successful. The immune system also seems to play a role in malignant melanoma. High dose
      Interferon therapy is the current standard therapy for the adjuvant treatment of stage IIB,
      IIC and III melanoma after surgical resection in which it has shown to result in modest
      improvements in disease free survival and overall survival. In metastatic disease, various
      immunologic approaches have been employed as well. High dose IL-2 can produce a response rate
      of about 10-15% in patients with metastatic melanoma. About 5-10% of responses are complete
      and some of these complete responses are durable so that the lucky few patients who have a
      durable complete response are for all intents and purposes cured. Attempts to combine
      chemotherapy with immunotherapy, although improving response rates, has not impacted survival
      as summarized in recent meta-analysis.
