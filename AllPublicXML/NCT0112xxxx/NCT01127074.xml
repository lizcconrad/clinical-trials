  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last few years there has been a great attempt to develop active immunotherapies for
      breast cancer patients (BCPs) using undefined as well as selected antigens to activate tumor
      specific T-lymphocytes. The purpose of this phase-I study was to determine the safety and
      feasibility of vaccinations with an allogeneic breast cancer cell line, KS24.22, genetically
      modified to express CD80 and Her-2/neu, and to evaluate the efficacy of inducing tumor
      antigen-specific immune responses in human leukocyte antigen(HLA)-A*02-matched patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.

      The trial was designed as an open label phase-I. Informed consent was given twice by the
      patients (1st for HLA-typing, 2nd for participation in the vaccination trial).

      The first four vaccinations, which were given every two weeks, were followed by four monthly
      vaccinations. Additional vaccinations were permitted on request for patients who exhibited
      stable disease (SD).

      Immediately before administration, KS24.22 cells were thawed and lethally irradiated. KS24.22
      cells were adjusted to 10E7/ml in Ringer-Lactate-solution, transferred to 1 ml syringes and
      stored on ice until injected within a time frame of 2h. Vaccinations were given i.d. in the
      thigh with a total volume of 1 ml divided between two injection sites.

Immediately before administration, KS24.22 cells were thawed and lethally irradiated (200 gray). KS24.22 cells were adjusted to 107/ml in Ringer-Lactate-solution, transferred to 1 ml syringes and stored on ice until injected within a time frame of 2h. Vaccinations were given i.d. in the thigh with a total volume of 1 ml divided between two injection sites.</description>
