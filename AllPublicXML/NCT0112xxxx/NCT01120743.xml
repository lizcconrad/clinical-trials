  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to identify the source of cytokines that are released
      into circulation during graft reperfusion. Seventeen patients scheduled to have adult
      cadaveric liver transplantation at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center were contacted as
      prospective participants. Blood samples were obtained from the radial artery, the portal
      vein, and from the graft irrigation. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines was verified and
      compared with the amount of catecholamines used to maintain hemodynamic stability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reperfusion of the graft is the most critical part of liver transplantation because of the
      difficulties in managing the resulting severe hemodynamic instability. The patients who are
      accepted to be listed for liver transplantation undergo evaluation of their cardiac function
      and are usually relatively stable with, at most, minimal cardiac problems (a requirement for
      inclusion in the liver transplantation program). Additionally, we observe completely
      unpredictable hemodynamic reactions during and after the graft reperfusion, requiring vastly
      different doses of catecholamine in order to maintain an acceptable level of perfusion
      pressure. The adverse cardiopulmonary effects are thought to be associated with the
      preexisting level of various proinflammatory factors, including cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6)
      and proinflammatory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) produced in the graft as a reaction to the
      conservation solution and cold temperature (necessary to keep the organ capable for
      transplantation) and released into the bloodstream during reperfusion. The massive release of
      cytokines after unclamping of the graft may be responsible for negative inotropy and
      significant vasodilatation.
