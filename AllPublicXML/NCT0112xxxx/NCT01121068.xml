  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferon gamma releasing assay(IGRA) is useful to diagnose latent tuberculosis.
      However,IGRA responses could show within-subject variability. We wanted to determine
      long-term IGRA variability in health-care workers who continuously expose to tuberculosis
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IGRA will be performed monthly in health-care workers with continuous exposure to
      tuberculosis patients for 1 year.
