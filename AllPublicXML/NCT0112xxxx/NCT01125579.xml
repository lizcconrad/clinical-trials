      Purpose: To document data on effectiveness of NEURAPAS® balance (NPB) in the treatment of
      nervous restlessness in children aged 6 to 12.

      Each patient is treated with NPB. No placebo group is established. Course and severity of
      symptoms is documented by a questionnaire on 13 common symptoms of nervous restlessness and a
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A standardized questionnaire (Parent Child Behaviour Checklist
      (CBCL/4-18)) is completed. Choice and doses of therapy are at the respective physician's
      discretion. The planned treatment and observation period is 2 - 4 weeks.

      Purpose: To document data on effectiveness of NEURAPAS® balance (NPB) in the treatment of
      nervous restlessness in children aged 6 to 12.

      Patients and methods: A prospective, non-interventional, non-randomized, observational study
      conducted in German pediatric practices. Each patient is treated with NPB. No placebo group
      is established. As subjective criteria to document course and severity of symptoms, a
      questionnaire on 13 common symptoms of nervous restlessness and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
      is used. As an objective criterion, a standardized questionnaire (Parent Child Behaviour
      Checklist (CBCL/4-18)) is completed. Choice and doses of therapy are at the respective
      physician's discretion. The planned treatment and observation period is 2 - 4 weeks.
