  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADHD has been associated with persistent deficits in the efficient allocation of attention
      and supports the notion that regulation of the cholinergic system may improve these cognitive
      deficits in ADHD. It has been suggested that the effects of nicotine are most pronounced on
      tasks that demand effortful processing (Rusted and Warburton 1994). In addition, a recent
      theory proposes that the cholinergic system allocates additional attentional resources during
      tasks that are demanding (i.e. sustained attention, set shifting, etc; Sarter and Bruno
      1997). Thus it may be that in ADHD, cholinergic systems are under-responsive or
      under-developed and thus stimulation of nicotinic receptors via nicotinic agents may result
      in improved cognitive performance particularly on tests requiring effortful processing.

      A randomized, parallel, forced-titration design is being used to assess effects of TC-5619
      versus placebo on efficacy. A parallel group design allows the effects of TC-5619 to be
      clearly established, and the randomized nature of the design allows minimization of observer
      and subject bias. Because a forced dose up-titration design will be used, effects of
      individual doses will be preliminary, because the design confounds dose with time.

      The doses chosen (1mg, 5mg, and 25mg) reflect an appropriate range around the anticipated
      efficacious dose (3-10 mg), based upon preclinical extrapolations to the human, and upon the
      pro-cognitive effects of TC-5619 identified by CDR in the MRD study (Targacept Study
      TC-5619-238-CLP-002).

      All subjects will be tobacco non-users. It is possible that tobacco (nicotine) interferes
      with α7 NNR-mediated effects.
