    <time_frame>Up to 10 days after discharge (Day 2) in Part A</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.</description>

    <description>Baseline was considered to be Day -1 pre-breakfast value. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline is set to missing as well. If measurements were taken in triplicate, then the mean of the triplicate measurements was used as the Baseline. Weighted mean were assessed for (0-12) and (0-24). AUC with respect to that time interval was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. The weighted mean was determined by dividing the AUC by the observed length of the collection interval (time of last assessment - time of first assessment in hours). In order for the AUC to be calculated, the first and last time points and at least one additional assessment falling between the two must be non-missing.</description>

Hematology parameters: Hematocrit (unit: ratio) and hemoglobin (unit: grams per liter [g/L]), were assessed for abnormal values of PCI. The PCI range for hematocrit was: &gt;0.075 decrease from Baseline (low), &gt;1.02 x upper limit normal (ULN) (high-male), &gt;1.17 x ULN (high-female). The PCI range for hemoglobin was: &gt;25 decrease from Baseline (low), &gt;1.03 x ULN (high-male), &gt;1.13 x ULN (high-female). Data has been presented for the number of participants with hematology data values high from the PCI range in a consolidated format.</description>

        <title>Tmax and Tlag Following Repeat Dose of GSK1292263 (Part B)</title>
        <description>Serial blood samples for the determination of the PK of GSK1292263 were collected on Days 1, 7 and 14. Blood samples for PK were collected on Days 1 and 14, at immediately pre-morning dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24 and 48 hours post-morning dose. On Day 7, blood samples for PK were collected at pre-dose (post-breakfast), 1, 2, 4 (pre-lunch), 6 and 10 (immediately post-dinner, pre-dose for BID regimen). When planned PK sampling resulted in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected. The PK parameters were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis. Tmax was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. Tlag was determined as the time of the sample preceding the first quantifiable concentration, on Day 1 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean for Glucose Value (Part B)</title>
        <description>Baseline was considered to be Day -1 pre-breakfast value. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline is set to missing as well. If measurements were taken in triplicate, then the mean of the triplicate measurements was used as the Baseline. Weighted mean were assessed for (0-12) and (0-24). AUC with respect to that time interval was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. The weighted mean was determined by dividing the AUC by the observed length of the collection interval (time of last assessment – time of first assessment in hours). In order for the AUC to be calculated, the first and last time points and at least one additional assessment falling between the two must be non-missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean for Insulin Value (Part B)</title>
        <description>Baseline was considered to be Day -1 pre-breakfast value. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline is set to missing as well. If measurements were taken in triplicate, then the mean of the triplicate measurements was used as the Baseline. AUC with respect to that time interval was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. The weighted mean was determined by dividing the AUC by the observed length of the collection interval (time of last assessment – time of first assessment in hours). In order for the AUC to be calculated, the first and last time points and at least one additional assessment falling between the two must be non-missing.</description>
