  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the influence of carbohydrate-to-fat balance on
      liking, wanting and food consumption in humans.

      16 normal-weight men (age: 23 ± 3 y)had completed a randomized 4-condition crossover study.
      The sessions differed by the composition of the breakfast which was rich in carbohydrates
      (HCB), low in carbohydrates (LCB), rich in fat (HFB) and low in fat (LFB). The HCB and HFB
      contained 2072 kJ, while the LCB and LFB contained 565 kJ. Two hours and 20 min later, energy
      expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured before olfactory liking for 4
      foods items and then ad libitum energy intake (EI) during a snack (sweet and fatty toast)
      were evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In accordance with the carbohydrate-based models of feeding, one may expect that food choices
      as well as &quot;liking&quot; and &quot;wanting&quot; (the two components of the reward system) could be
      influenced by glycogen stores and the carbohydrate-to-fat balance. More precisely, one may
      expect that a high fat oxidation rate could increase liking and wanting carbohydrates to
      replenish glycogen stores and conversely, that a high carbohydrate oxidation rate could
      produce the reverse. In order to validate this hypothesis, the present study has been
      conducted to investigate in humans the influence of the carbohydrate-to-fat oxidation ratio
      on carbohydrate-to-fat selection and the food reward system.

    <description>Subjects will eat in the morning during breakfast 300g cottage cheese (627kJ - 147kcal; 13.2g carbohydrate, 0.3g fat, 23g protein) plus, according to the situations, either: 90g sucrose, HCB); 6g aspartame; 40g vegetable oil; 40g paraffin oil. Therefore two breakfast will have the same energy content (2072kJ - 495kcal), as did the other two(565 kJ - 135kcal).</description>
