      Study of phase II: Clinical study national, exploratory, multicentric, prospective,
      randomized, as a double blind man evaluating the effectiveness and the tolerance of the
      treatment by a surgical gel of sealing containing polyethylene glycol in the prevention of
      operational adherences post.3 Study of phase III: Clinical study national, multicentric,
      prospective, randomized, controlled, as a double blind man comparing a group controls with a
      group of patients treated by a surgical gel of sealing containing polyethylene glycol in the
      prevention of hepatic adherences of novo post operational.
