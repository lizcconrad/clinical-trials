        <title>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in Mean Weight of Axillary Sweating at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the First Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>A pre-weighed filter paper was placed into the axilla area to collect sweat over a 5-minute period. The paper was removed and weighed to determine the amount of sweat produced. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as follows: (mean weight at each visit minus mean weight at Baseline) * 100/mean weight at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Responders Assessed by the Hyperhidrosis Severity Scale (HDSS) in the First Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The HDSS is a 4-point scale (score range: 1-4) used to assess the impact of disease and the clinical relevance of treatment. Participants selected their underarm sweat condition from the following: 1=Never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities, 2=Tolerable but sometimes interferes with my daily activities, 3=Barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities, and 4=Intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities. A responder was defined as a participant whose change from Baseline was equal to or less than -2.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in HDSS at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 in the First Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The HDSS is a 4-point scale (score range: 1-4) used to assess the impact of disease and the clinical relevance of treatment. Participants selected their underarm sweat condition from the following: 1=Never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities, 2=Tolerable but sometimes interferes with my daily activities, 3=Barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities, and 4=Intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities. Change from Baseline in HDSS was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific, participant-answered questionnaire that allows for comparison of Quality of Life (QOL). DLQI total score (0-30) is a sum of the scores of 6 domains: Symptoms and Feelings, Daily Activities, Leisure, and Personal Relationships (score=0-6 for each); Work and School, and Treatment (score=0-3 for both; 0=not at all or not applicable, 3=very much or yes only in one item of Work and School). A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in the DLQI total score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Symptoms and Feelings Domain Score of the DLQI at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 in the First Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Symptoms and Feelings domain consists of 2 questions (Item 1 and Item 2). Scores range from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much) for each item; therefore, the possible total score for the Symptoms and Feelings domain is 0 to 6. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each domain score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Leisure domain consists of 2 questions (Item 5 and Item 6). Scores range from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much) for each item; therefore, the possible total score for the Leisure domain is 0 to 6. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each domain score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Work and School domain consists of 1 question (Item 7). The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (yes); therefore, the possible total score for the Work and School domain is 0 to 3. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each domain score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Work and School Domain Score of the DLQI at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 in the First Treatment Phase</title>
          <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Work and School domain consists of 1 question (Item 7). The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (yes); therefore, the possible total score for the Work and School domain is 0 to 3. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each domain score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>
          <population>FAS1. The number of participants analyzed varies by week because some participants were prematurely withdrawn, had no efficacy assessment at a particular time point, or were entered into the Second Treatment Phase.</population>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Personal Relationships domain consists of 2 questions (Item 8 and Item 9). Scores range from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much) for each item; therefore, the possible total score for the Personal Relationships domain is 0 to 6. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each domain score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Treatment Domain Score of the DLQI at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 in the First Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Treatment domain consists of 1 question (Item 10). The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much); therefore, the total possible score for the Treatment domain is 0 to 3. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each domain score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 1, participants were asked how itchy, sore, painful or stinging their skin was over the last week. The scores for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 1 is in the Symptoms and Feelings domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 2, participants were asked how embarrassed or self conscious they were because of their skin over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 2 is in the Symptoms and Feelings domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 3, participants were asked how much their skin interfered with them going shopping or looking after their home or garden over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 3 is in the Daily Activities domain. A lower score indicates better condition.

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 4, participants were asked how much their skin interfered with the clothes they wore over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 4 is in the Daily Activities domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

The Score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 5 is in the Leisure domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>
          <population>FAS1. The number of participants analyzed varies by week because some participants were prematurely withdrawn, had no efficacy assessment at a particular time point, or were entered into the Second Treatment Phase.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Item 7 (Problem at Work or Studying) Score of the DLQI at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 in the First Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 7, participants were asked if their skin prevented them from working or studying over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (yes). Item 7 is in the Work and School domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 8, participants were asked how much their skin created problems with their partner or any of their close friends or relatives over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 8 is in the Personal Relationships domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 9, participants were asked how much their skin caused any sexual difficulties over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 9 is in the Personal Relationships domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 10, participants were asked how much of a problem the treatment for their skin was, for example, by making their home messy, or by taking up time. The Score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 10 is in the Work and School domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The participant's global assessment of treatment satisfaction is a method used to evaluate a participant's treatment satisfaction. Participants rated any improvement or worsening of their symptoms compared to Baseline by using the following 9-point scale: +4, Complete abolishment of signs and symptoms; +3, Marked improvement; +2, Moderate improvement; +1, Slight improvement; 0, Unchanged; -1, Slight worsening; -2, Moderate worsening; -3, Marked worsening; and -4, Very marked worsening.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Responders Assessed by the HDSS in the Second Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The HDSS is a 4-point scale (score range: 1-4) used to assess the impact of disease and the clinical relevance of treatment. Participants selected their underarm sweat condition from the following: 1=Never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities, 2=Tolerable but sometimes interferes with my daily activities, 3=Barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities, and 4=Intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities. A responder was defined as a participant whose change from Baseline (Week 0 in the Second Treatment Phase) was equal to or less than -2.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Responders Assessed by the HDSS in the Second Treatment Phase</title>
          <description>The HDSS is a 4-point scale (score range: 1-4) used to assess the impact of disease and the clinical relevance of treatment. Participants selected their underarm sweat condition from the following: 1=Never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities, 2=Tolerable but sometimes interferes with my daily activities, 3=Barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities, and 4=Intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities. A responder was defined as a participant whose change from Baseline (Week 0 in the Second Treatment Phase) was equal to or less than -2.</description>
          <population>FAS2. The number of participants analyzed varies by week because some participants were prematurely withdrawn or had no efficacy assessment at a particular time point.</population>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific, participant-answered questionnaire that allows for comparison of Quality of Life (QOL). DLQI total score (0-30) is a sum of the scores of 6 domains: Symptoms and Feelings, Daily Activities, Leisure, and Personal Relationships (score=0-6 for each); Work and School, and Treatment (score=0-3 for both; 0=not at all or not applicable, 3=very much or yes only in one item of Work and School). A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in the DLQI total score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Symptoms and Feelings Domain Score of the DLQI at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the Second Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Symptoms and Feelings domain consists of 2 questions (Item 1 and Item 2). Scores range from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much) for each item; therefore, the possible total score for the Symptoms and Feelings domain is 0 to 6. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each domain score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Leisure Domain Score of the DLQI at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the Second Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Leisure domain consists of 2 questions (Item 5 and Item 6). Scores range from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much) for each item; therefore, the possible total score for the Leisure domain is 0 to 6. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each domain score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. The Personal Relationships domain consists of 2 questions (Item 8 and Item 9).

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 1, participants were asked how itchy, sore, painful or stinging their skin was over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 1 is in the Symptoms and Feelings domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

          <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 1, participants were asked how itchy, sore, painful or stinging their skin was over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 1 is in the Symptoms and Feelings domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Item 4 (Influenced Clothes You Wear) Score of the DLQI at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the Second Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 4, participants were asked how much their skin interfered with the clothes they wore over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 4 is in the Daily Activities domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Item 6 (Difficult to Do Any Sport) Score of the DLQI at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the Second Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 6, participants were asked how much their skin made it difficult to do any sports over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 6 is in the Leisure domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 8, participants were asked how much their skin created problems with their partner or any of their close friends or relatives over the last week. The score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 8 is in the Personal Relationships domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 10, participants were asked how much of a problem the treatment for their skin was, for example, by making their home messy, or by taking up time. The Score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 10 is in the Work and School domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Item 10 (Problem Caused by Skin Treatment) Score of the DLQI at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the Second Treatment Phase</title>
          <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire that can be quickly answered by the participants and allows for comparison of QOL. In Item 10, participants were asked how much of a problem the treatment for their skin was, for example, by making their home messy, or by taking up time. The Score for this item ranges from 0 (not at all or not applicable) to 3 (very much). Item 10 is in the Work and School domain. A lower score indicates better condition. Change from Baseline in each item score was calculated as follows: score at each visit minus score at Baseline.</description>

BTX 50 U/axilla was injected intradermally to the hyperhidrotic area of both axillae at 10 to 15 injection sites during the Second Treatment Phase. Participants who had a mean sweat production (measured by gravimetric assessment) in both axillae of beyond 50% of their Baseline (Week 0) level at any point in time during Weeks 16, 20, or 24 received an injection of BTX. Only participants who received this second treatment entered into the Second Treatment Phase.</description>
