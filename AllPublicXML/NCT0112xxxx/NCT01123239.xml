    <textblock>
      In this study, we are testing the effectiveness of an intervention known as &quot;Coached Care&quot; to
      improve health outcomes and quality of care of patients being treated for type 2 diabetes,
      particularly patients in underserved populations. The intervention involves training members
      of minority communities who have diabetes to be &quot;coaches&quot;, teaching minority patients the
      skills needed to participate effectively in care during office visits, as they present for
      those visits. Coaches follow patients for 9 routine consecutive visits, reinforcing
      participation skills before and between their routine office visits.

    <description>Coached Care pairs patients with linguistically and ethnically matched peer &quot;coaches&quot; who have been trained to promote patient participation in the medical visit. The coaches, who themselves have diabetes, meet with patients immediately before each of their regularly scheduled medical visits to encourage active involvement in information seeking and decision-making.</description>

    <description>Coached Care pairs patients with linguistically and ethnically matched peer &quot;coaches&quot;, who themselves have diabetes, and have been trained to meet with patients immediately before each of their regularly scheduled medical visits to encourage active involvement in information seeking and decision-making. Using a decision tree algorithm, they help patients identify relevant questions about symptoms, barriers to self-management and treatment options to discuss with doctor. They encourage mutual decision-making about tailoring the patient's medication regimen, diet and physical activities and work with the patients to overcome barriers to communication with their doctor. After the medical visit, the coach and patient review any treatment decisions and goals for self-care.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control group will receive 20 minutes of standardized diabetes education delivered by staff research assistants. Education materials have been adapted from materials developed by the American Diabetes Association. The content of these materials includes information about the causes and complications of diabetes, as well as ways to reduce complication risks. Patients in the control arm will receive 20 minutes of standardized diabetes education before each visit</description>
