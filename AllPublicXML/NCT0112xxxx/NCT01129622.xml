  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a primary investigation to determine the usefulness and safety of a short
      course of a relatively high dose of letrozole (a medication used to decrease the female
      hormone estrogen which is produced locally inside the breast after menopause) in improving
      the performance of of breast MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The inhibition of estrogen in
      the breast by letrozole might help better identifying of suspicious areas in the breast and
      could assist radiologists in distinguishing between benign breast areas and cancer tissue.
      This might help reducing the rate of call backs and unnecessary biopsies for patients. We
      expect to enroll 20 healthy postmenopausal women in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A breast MRI will be performed in the standard way for diagnosis and to serve as a baseline.
      A second MRI will be performed within a month and following administration of letrozole 12.5
      mg daily for three days to reduce breast estrogen levels and in anticipation of lowering
      breast gadolinium dye uptake.

    <time_frame>One month MRI study after letrozole compared to baseline MRI study, both with gadolinium enhancement</time_frame>
    <description>Image analysis was done using the e-film workstation. A region of interest was selected in all images. The signal intensity of enhancement was recorded and the relative enhancement (percentage of increase in signal intensity) was calculated as (SIc − SI)/SI × 100, where SI and SIc are the precontrast and the postcontrast signal intensities, respectively. Relative enhancement was compared at the baseline MRI study and the after one month MRI study for all participants.</description>
