  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial to determine whether orally administered APL A12 at one or
      more doses is superior to placebo in effecting a 25% reduction in interferon (IFN)
      stimulation index in 1(II)-stimulated culture of peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) obtained
      from patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which will be the primary outcome variable. In
      an effort to learn more about the mechanism of action of APL A12, the investigators will
      assess Th1/Th2/Th3 cytokine production in supernatants from 48h and 144h cultures of PBMC
      stimulated by 1(II) and by APL A12 above. The investigators will assess function of CD4+
      CD25+ T regs to determine whether APL A12 improves their suppressive function. Flow cytometry
      combined with intracellular cytokine staining will be used in an effort to determine which T
      cell subset(s) is/are experiencing shifts in cytokine expression.

      The study will have 3 treatment arms each with 10 patients who have demonstrated T cell
      immunity to CII and have an in vitro response to APL A12 at the screening visit. Patients
      will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms. Each of the 3 treatments will be given for
      16 weeks.

      In keeping with a sequential dose escalation strategy, the originally proposed randomization
      scheme will be modified so that subjects will be randomized to receive either the lowest dose
      (30 mg) or placebo (Block 1), followed by the next dose (50 mg) or placebo (Block 2). We will
      begin with the lowest dose (30 g/day) and enroll 6 to receive 30 g/day APL A12 and 2 to
      receive placebo for 16 weeks. Results will be reported to the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
      for a decision to proceed to the next block based on indications of safety. If this dose does
      not cause adverse events or toxicity or worsens RA, we will proceed to enroll patients to
      receive 30 ug, or 50 g/day APL A12 or placebo for 16 weeks. A total of 32 subjects will be
      randomized to obtain 24 subjects who complete the study.

    <description>The study will have 3 treatment arms each with 10-12 patients who have demonstrated T cell immunity to CII and have an in vitro response to APL A12 at the screening visit. Patients will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms. Each of the 3 treatments will be given for 16 weeks.
In keeping with a sequential dose escalation strategy, the originally proposed randomization scheme will be modified so that subjects will be randomized to receive:
either the lowest dose (30 micrograms) or placebo (Block 1). We will begin with the lowest dose (30 micrograms/day) and enroll 6 to receive 30 micrograms/day APL A12 and 2 to receive placebo for 16 weeks.

    <description>IND 103860: The study drug APL A12 is a man made (or synthesized) fragment similar to a portion of natural type II collagen, the major collagen found in joint cartilage. Cartilage is the tough, elastic tissue found in various parts of the body, including the joints. The best dose of APL A12 to use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is not known.</description>
