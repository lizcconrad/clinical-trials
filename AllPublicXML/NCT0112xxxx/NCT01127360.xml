  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in individuals
      over 50 years of age. Bevacizumab and ranibizumab are two agents developed by the American
      pharmaceutical corporation Genentech, both of which inhibit blood vessel growth factors.
      These drugs, when injected intraocularly, reduce the pathological growth of blood vessels in
      the macular area of the eye. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is an antibody developed for intravenous
      treatment of metastasized colon cancer. Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is an antibody fragment
      developed from a similar antibody. It was introduced 2006 as an effective treatment for wet
      AMD. Treatment costs are, however, up to 50 times higher compared to use of bevacizumab.
      Avastin has shown similar effects to ranibizumab, and has been used off-label in many
      countries, both before and after Lucentis received approval. There is thus a recognized need
      for large randomized studies to garner proper scientific proof of Avastin's effectiveness
      regarding exudative AMD.

      LUCAS is a randomized multicenter study, performed in Norway, comparing ranibizumab and
      bevacizumab use for AMD. The goal of the study was to demonstrate if the two agents were
      equivalent regarding both efficacy and safety. A total of 441 patients with objective
      evidence of wet AMD were randomized to a double-blind treatment with ranibizumab or
      bevacizumab over the course of 2 years. The treatment interval was determined by a &quot;Treat and
      Extend&quot; protocol.

      LUCAS (LUcentis Compared to Avastin Study) A randomized, double-blind, prospective
      multicenter study comparing the effect of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (Avastin) to
      ranibizumab (Lucentis) when given to patients with exudative (wet) age-related macular
      degeneration in Norway.

      Version: 4, Protocol: 166-09, EudraCT: 2008-004225-41

      Purpose:

      LUCAS is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study comparing the effects of intravitreal
      injection of bevacizumab (Avastin) with ranibizumab (Lucentis) when given to patients with
      exudative (wet) AMD in Norway.

      The study will include 420 patients to be recruited starting March 2009. The study will
      continue for 2 years after completed enrollment.

      Design:

      LUCAS is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, with 1:1 parallel groups treated with
      either bevacizumab (Avastin) 0.05 ml (25 mg/ml) or ranibizumab (Lucentis) 0,05 ml (10 mg/ml).
      The drug is injected intravitreally according to an &quot;inject and extend&quot; principle (5).

      Randomization will be stratified by center and performed with minimization according to
      prognostic factors.

      Treatment Regimen:

      Bevacizumab (Avastin) will be given as an intravitreal injection of 0.05ml (25 mg/ml) from a
      vial containing 4 ml.

      Ranibizumab (Lucentis) will be given as an intravitreal injection of 0.05 ml (10 mg/ml) from
      a vial containing 0.23 ml.

      Follow-up and treatment will follow a principle called &quot;inject and extend.&quot; This connotes the
      following: initial follow-up and injection with a 4 week intervals until the macula is dry.
      When dry, then follow-up and injection will be increased 2 weeks at a time. If the patient
      has a recurrence of wet AMD, then the interval is reduced by 2 weeks at a time until the
      macula is once again dry. The shortest interval is 4 weeks. When once again extending, the
      treatment interval shall not be as long as the interval of the original recurrence, as this
      could confer risk for new activity. Therefore further follow-up and injection occurs at the
      &quot;ideal&quot; interval which is hereby defined as being 2 weeks less than that of the original
      recurrence. With this method, the patient receives an injection at each follow-up, presuming
      that no complications occur. The maximum interval is limited to 12 weeks. Treatment will
      continue for 2 years. After the study is completed, then the patient is to be offered
      continued treatment, in accordance with the ophthalmology department's routines, If there is
      no response to treatment after 3 injections with a 4 week interval, then the patient shall be
      removed from the study and be offered alternative treatment, such as combination treatment
      with photodynamic therapy (PDT).

             eye is being treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, or develops wet AMD, then
             the same drug being used in the study eye shall be used in the non-study eye.
             Treatment must be given double-blind in the non-study eye as well.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment of CNV in the study eye.

          2. Participation in another AMD study, or use of other investigational medicines.

          4. Earlier or current treatment with systemic anti-VEGF drug.

          5. Subretinal hemorrhage and/or fibrosis that involves â‰¥50 percent of the CNV lesion in
             the study eye.

          6. CNV of other pathogenesis, such as pathologic myopia (defined as having a spherical
             equivalent of &gt;8 diopters myopia) or Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome (POHS).

          7. Presence of retinal diseases other than AMD (diabetic retinopathy, macular hole, etc)
             that lead to loss of visual acuity in the study eye.

          8. Cataract that will presumably require operation within 2 years or other intraocular
             surgery or laser treatment during the last 3 months.

          9. Impaired visualization of the retina (by vitreous hemorrhage, corneal dystrophy, etc.)
             that may hamper adequate diagnosis.

         10. Intraocular pressure â‰¥25 mm Hg, measured before mydriasis, or uncontrolled glaucoma as
             evaluated by the examining ophthalmologist.
