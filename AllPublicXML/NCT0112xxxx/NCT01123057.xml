    <textblock>
      This is a hospital-based interventional prospective study. Patients with clinical keratoconus
      or LASIK keratectasia presenting to the Singapore National Eye Centre who meet the
      eligibility criteria are recruited for this study. The aim of the study is to assess the
      safety and efficacy of riboflavin-UVA induced cross-linking treatment for corneal ectasia

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the safety and efficacy of riboflavin-UVA induced
      cross-linking treatment for corneal ectasia due to keratoconus and LASIK keratectasia. The
      principle of the procedure is to induce collagen crosslinking of the corneal stroma by the
      using riboflavin/UVA-treatment.

      The technique involves topical application of riboflavin/dextran solution onto eye after
      removal of corneal epithelium. After initial riboflavin application for 30 minutes, UVA light
      is shone onto the cornea for another 30 minutes with continued topical riboflavin
      application.

      A thorough examination is performed to evaluate the following pre-operatively:

        -  Manifest refraction results - Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best corrected visual
           acuity (BCVA)

        -  Cycloplegic refraction results - Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best corrected
           visual acuity (BCVA)

        -  Slit-lamp biomicroscopy and photography

        -  Intraocular pressure measurement

        -  Fundoscopy

        -  Corneal topography using Orbscan II and Pentacam

        -  Corneal aberrometry measurement using Technolas Zywave Aberrometer

        -  Endothelial cell count measurement using Konan noncontact endothelial cell analyser

        -  Confocal microscopy

        -  Corneal hysteresis measurement using Ocular Response Analyser

        -  Subjective feedback about quality of vision (VF 14 assessment) Post-operative Assessment
           (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively)

        -  Uncorrected visual acuity and best corrected visual acuity with manifest refraction

        -  Cycloplegic refraction results - uncorrected visual acuity and best corrected visual
           acuity

        -  Subjective visual outcome rating

        -  Slit lamp examination and photography

        -  Fundoscopy

        -  Corneal topography

        -  Aberrometry measurement

        -  Endothelial cell count

        -  Confocal microscopy

        -  Corneal hysteresis measurement

        -  Report adverse events
