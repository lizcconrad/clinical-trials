    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness-based
      cognitive-behavior therapy (MBCT) for improvement of symptoms associated with bipolar
      disorder, by comparing MBCT to supportive psychotherapy. Patients who participate in this
      study will be randomly assigned to receive either

        1. state of the art group MBCT, or

        2. supportive group psychotherapy (which is considered part of the standard care available
           to patients at MGH).

      We will conduct a randomized controlled trial of group MBCT (n=30) vs. SP (n=30) and compare
      the benefits and durability of MBCT vs. SP for decreasing symptoms in DSM-IV bipolar
      individuals over a 12-week period adjunctive to mood stabilizing medications coupled with
      individual-therapy sessions. We will also conduct follow-up assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months after the active phase of the study. Subjects in the MBCT group will receive group
      therapy sessions of standardized yoga-meditation based exercises enhanced by psychoeducation
      and relapse prevention for bipolar disorder. Subjects in the SP group will receive support
      for coping with the symptoms of bipolar disorder, as well as psychoeducation about bipolar
      disorder. The focus of SP is on reflecting and expressing feelings about current life issues.
      Patients are supported and comforted when coping with difficult situations, depression, mood
      swings, or anger. We will assess mood, cognitive and psychosocial functioning before and
      after treatment for participants in both groups. Finally, we will investigate the functional
      neuroanatomy associated with memory impairment, attention, and mindful breathing in subjects
      with bipolar disorder as a predictor of treatment response using functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI).
