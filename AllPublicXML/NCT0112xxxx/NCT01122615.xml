      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the
      combination of sunitinib and temsirolimus that can be given to patients with metastatic
      kidney cancer.

      The Study Drugs:

      Sunitinib is designed to block pathways that control important events (such as the growth of
      blood vessels) that are essential for the growth of cancer.

      Temsirolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to
      die.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of the combination of sunitinib and temsirolimus based on when you joined this study.
      There will be 2 stages in this study.

      Up to 5 dose levels of the study drug combination will be tested in Stage 1. Two (2)
      participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will
      receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest
      tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found.

      During Stage 2, different doses of the individual study drugs will be tested based on the
      highest tolerable combination dose that was found in Stage 1.

      Study Drug Administration:

      During each 3-week &quot;study cycle,&quot; you will take sunitinib 1 time each day (either with or
      without food) for 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest with no study drug.

      You will receive temsirolimus by vein 1 time every week over 30-60 minutes. About 30 minutes
      before you receive temsirolimus, you will receive Benadryl (diphenhydramine) by vein over 30
      minutes to help prevent side effects.

      If you have any side effects from any of the drugs, tell the study doctor right away. The
      study doctor may then lower the dose or keep the dose level the same.

      Study Visits:

      Every week (right before you receive temsirolimus), blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn
      for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests (in addition to the weekly
           blood draw described above).

      Every 6 weeks,:

        -  You will have the same imaging scans (CT and/or MRI scan) that you had at the screening
           visit. If you have stable disease after 2 scans, you will have these every 12 weeks.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check your thyroid function.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Blood Pressure Monitoring:

      During the first 3 weeks of the study, your blood pressure will be checked weekly. This may
      be done at your local doctor's office. You should write down your blood pressure each time it
      is checked in a blood pressure journal that the study staff will give you and bring it with
      you when you see your doctor.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain on study for as long as you are benefiting. You will be taken off study if
      the disease gets worse or if you have intolerable side effects.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After the last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit. At the end-of-study
      visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced since your last visit.

      This is an investigational study. Sunitinib and temsirolimus are both FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer. The use of the drugs in
      combination is investigational.

      Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Response and progression evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the index tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LDof target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

             times the institutional upper limit of normal for subjects with documented liver
             metastases

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a normal serum beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) within 24 hours prior to beginning treatment on the
             study due to the possible teratogenic effect.

          7. Patients of child fathering or childbearing potential must agree to practice a form of
             medically acceptable birth control while on study

          8. Patients must give written informed consent prior to initiation of study-related
             procedures. Patients with a history of major psychiatric illness must be judged able
             to fully understand the investigational nature of the study and the risks associated
             with the therapy

          9. Patients must be able to swallow pills

         10. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No prior malignancy is allowed, except for non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma
             of any site, or other cancers for which the patient has been definitively treated and
             disease free for 2 years. Patients with controlled brain metastases are eligible.

          2. Patients must not be scheduled to receive another anticancer drug while on this study.
             Patients are permitted to be on concomitant bisphosphonates or megestrol acetate

          3. Patients must not have had a stroke or TIA within 6 months

          4. Patients must not have uncontrolled infections that could be worsened by anticancer
             therapy or interfere with this study

          5. Patients must not have clinically significant cardiovascular disease, defined as
             myocardial infarction (or unstable angina) within 6 months, New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac dysrhythmia

          6. Patients must not have uncontrolled hypertension, defined as &gt; 140/90 in either
             systolic or diastolic component (treatment of hypertension with medications is
             permitted)

          7. Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease

          8. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents,
             breast-feeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this trial

          9. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. In addition, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with some of these agents

         10. Patients must not have a clinical history of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis

         11. Concomitant treatment with rifampin, St. John's wort, or the cytochrome p450

         14. Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular
             access device within 7 days prior to study enrollment

         15. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess
