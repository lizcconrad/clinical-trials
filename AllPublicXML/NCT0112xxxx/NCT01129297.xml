  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes and obesity are both multifactorial diseases resulting from gene-environment
      interactions. However, this interaction, as well as the specific effect of each polymorphism,
      remains poorly understood.

      We now proposed a prospective cohort study to improve our understanding of the influence of
      phenotypic characteristics on gene expression in tissues involved in glucose and/or lipid
      metabolism by collecting different biological samples.

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease commonly associated with obesity, which is an important
      risk factor for this condition. More than 80% of the diabetic subjects are obese. By analogy
      with the metabolic syndrome, the close association between obesity and T2D justifies the
      recognition of a new disease entity named by the neologism &quot;diabesity&quot;.

      This study will examine the contribution of different genetic variants on &quot;diabesity&quot;
      development, by integrating multiple genomics approaches (linkage analysis on whole genome,
      transcriptomics and bioinformatics) and analysis of biological pathways in relevant animals
      models and humans.
