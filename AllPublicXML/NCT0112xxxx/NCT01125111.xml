    <measure>The difference in 1 month between two surgical methods in terms of Bladder function.</measure>

    <description>The robotic surgery for rectal cancer seemed to be associated with a much earlier recovery of normal voiding and sexual function compared to those of laparoscopic surgery although it needs to be verified by larger prospective comparative studies</description>
