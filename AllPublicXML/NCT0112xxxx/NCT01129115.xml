  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 26-week study of supervised exercise assessing three doses of exercise
      in sedentary individuals 65 years of age and over with age-related cognitive changes. A total
      of 100 subjects (n=25 in each of four groups) will be randomized to a non-aerobic control
      group, 75 minutes, 150 minutes, or 225 minutes a week of moderate intensity aerobic exercise
      spread over 3 to 5 days a week for 26 weeks. These exercise doses represent 50%, 100%, or
      150% of the recommended exercise dose. Participants will be directly supervised during all
      exercise sessions for the first two months after which direct supervision will occur during
      at least one session a week. This is intended to provide increased flexibility while also
      maintaining direct contact with the participant to enhance adherence. Aerobic fitness,
      physical function, and cognition will be assessed at baseline and 26 weeks to examine the
      dose-response relationships.

    <measure>Visuospatial Processing</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visuospatial Processing is a latent derived variable derived estimated mean.The reported latent means for this trial are created from the well-known neuropsychological tests: Block Design, Stroop Color Reading, Digit Symbol Substitution and Trailmaking Test A.
Latent variables cannot be measured directly but are derived from a theory-driven confirmatory factor analysis in a structural equation model framework. The latent scores are centered around a mean of 0 and standardized so each value represents a fraction of the standard deviation. There are no limits to the scores. Positive number indicate improved performance. Negative numbers indicate worsening performance.</description>

    <measure>Change in Maximal Oxygen Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal Oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is the standard, quantitative measure of aerobic fitness. The physiologic range of scores is approximately 3.5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min) to approximately 90 (ml/kg/min). Higher numbers indicate greater fitness and positive change indicates increasing fitness. Lower number indicate worse fitness</description>

        <description>Verbal Memory is a latent derived variable derived estimated mean. The reported latent means for this trial are created from the well-known neuropsychological tests: Logical Memory, Delayed Logical Memory, Selective Reminding Task - Free Recall Total, Boston Naming Test.
Latent variables cannot be measured directly but are derived from a theory-driven confirmatory factor analysis in a structural equation model framework. The latent scores are centered around a mean of 0 and standardized so each value represents a fraction of the standard deviation. There are no limits to the scores. Positive number indicate improved performance.Negative numbers indicate worsening performance.</description>

          <title>Reasoning</title>
          <description>Reasoning is a latent derived variable derived estimated mean. The reported latent means for this trial are created from the well-known neuropsychological tests:Letter and Word Inductive Reasoning, Matrix Reasoning.
Latent variables cannot be measured directly but are derived from a theory-driven confirmatory factor analysis in a structural equation model framework. The latent scores are centered around a mean of 0 and standardized so each value represents a fraction of the standard deviation. There are no limits to the scores. Positive number indicate improved performance. Negative numbers indicate worsening performance.</description>

        <description>Maximal Oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is the standard, quantitative measure of aerobic fitness. The physiologic range of scores is approximately 3.5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min) to approximately 90 (ml/kg/min). Higher numbers indicate greater fitness and positive change indicates increasing fitness. Lower number indicate worse fitness</description>
