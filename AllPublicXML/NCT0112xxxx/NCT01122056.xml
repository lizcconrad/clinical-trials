  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and tolerability of exercise on side
      effects of injectable disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. The investigators
      main hypothesis is that controlled exercise is safe and can be well tolerated in patients
      with multiple sclerosis and it can improve disease modifying treatment related side effects
      such as fatigue.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient compliance with disease modifying treatment largely depends on relatively common side
      effects of such treatments such as fatigue. Regular exercise can potentially improve these
      side effects. However, Safety and effects of exercise has not been studied in patients with
      multiple sclerosis. Our main aim is to study the safety, tolerability and effects of exercise
      on side effects of subcutaneous interferon-b1b in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.
