  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that total carbohydrate oxidation during exercise is higher after ingestion
      of fructose:glucose mixture than after ingestion of equimolar amounts of glucose alone. This
      may possible contribute to improve performance, provided that the extra carbohydrate
      oxidation induced by fructose:glucose co-ingestion occurs in skeletal muscle. The present
      study aims at assessing the hypothesis that, during exercise, a substantial portion of oral
      fructose is converted into lactate prior to oxidation To identify the major pathways of
      fructose disposal, 7 healthy endurance trained male volunteers will be studied. For each
      participant the following measurement will be performed

        -  a measurement of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) on an ergometric bicycle

        -  a 2 hour exercise protocol with oral administration of a glucose drink. 6,6-2H2 glucose
           (0.44 µmol/kg/min) and 13C3 lactate (2.25 µmol/kg/min) will be infused to calculate
           glucose and lactate kinetics. Indirect calorimetry will be performed to measure total
           carbohydrate oxidation and expired 13CO2 will be monitored to calculate whole body
           lactate oxidation

        -  a 2 hour exercise protocol with oral administration of a glucose:fructose (72 + 48 g
           every hour) mixture. 6,6-2H2 glucose (0.44 µmol/kg/min) and 13C3 lactate (2.25
           µmol/kg/min) will be infused to calculate glucose and lactate kinetics. Indirect
           calorimetry will be performed to measure total carbohydrate oxidation and expired 13CO2
           will be monitored to calculate whole body lactate oxidation

        -  a 2 hour exercise protocol with oral administration of a glucose:fructose (72 + 48 g
           every hour) mixture with fructose labelled with 13C6 fructose to evaluate exogenous
           fructose metabolic fate and oxidation. 6,6-2H2 glucose (0.44 µmol/kg/min) will be
           infused to calculate glucose kinetics. Fructose conversion into lactate and glucose will
           be evaluated by monitoring the systemic appearance of plasma 13C-labelled lactate and
           13C-labelled glucose. Total exogenous fructose oxidation will be measured by monitoring
           13CO2 production.

      Based on these measurements, semi-quantitative estimates of total fructose oxidation,
      fructose conversion into glucose, fructose conversion into lactate, and oxidation of
      fructose-derived lactate will be obtained
