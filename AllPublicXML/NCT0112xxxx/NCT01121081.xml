      This is a double blind, parallel group, randomized study with 12 weeks of daily oral
      administration of Dunaliella or placebo in psoriasis patients undergoing phototherapy.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility at the baseline visit for phototherapy and blood
      tests.

      After screen phase of maximum two weeks the subjects will be randomized at phototherapy
      treatment no. 4 in to one of two treatments groups (2:1): Dunaliella or placebo.

      Each subject will have a final evaluation 4 weeks after the end of study drug treatment .
