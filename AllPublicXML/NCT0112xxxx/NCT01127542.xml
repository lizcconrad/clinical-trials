  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with CLL are diagnosed with early stage disease (Binet stage A or
      Rai stage 0/I). Standard management of such patients is observation, and with median age at
      diagnosis of 72 and median time to progression of &gt;5-10 years, many will never require
      treatment. In contrast, a proportion of patients have more aggressive disease, and over the
      last decade, a number of molecular factors have been identified that may be used to identify
      patients with poor prognosis disease . Each is associated with shortened time to treatment
      (typically less than 3 years in patients with 2 of more factors), reduced survival, with in
      the case of p53/ATM inactivation, resistance to treatment. Whether it is possible to improve
      the outcome of patients with CLL and adverse prognostic factors by early intervention with
      treatment is unknown. Several trials in the 1980's demonstrated that treatment of stage A CLL
      with conventional chemotherapy (chlorambucil) did not alter the natural history of the
      disease, although none of these studies stratified patients according to risk. The choice of
      alternative potential therapeutic agents is limited; they should be effective in patients
      with adverse prognostic factors, have acceptable toxicity, be able to overcome the drug
      resistance associated with p53/ATM inactivation and ideally be orally administered. Two
      recent phase II trials have demonstrated that Lenalidomide is effective in the treatment of
      relapsed/refractory disease. Importantly, both studies included a high proportion of patients
      with adverse prognostic factors including p53 inactivation. The principle objective of this
      study is to investigate the efficacy of Lenalidomide in achieving disease response (complete
      remission and clearance of minimal residual disease) in patients with poor risk early stage
      disease, together with assessment of safety and tolerability.
