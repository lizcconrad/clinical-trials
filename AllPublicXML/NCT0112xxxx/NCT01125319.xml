  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis (HLH) is a rare and severe disease of genetic origin in
      children (familial-HLH, F-HLH) or affecting adults secondary to infections, hematologic
      malignancies or auto-immune diseases (secondary_HLH, S-HLH). F-HLH are due to genetic
      mutations affecting the genes of perforin or proteins involved in its secretion, resulting in
      the complete loss of lymphocyte cytotoxicity without affecting lymphocyte number. In S-HLH,
      the investigators have observed a severe NK cell lymphopenia and a transient loss of
      cytotoxicity of unknown mechanism. In this study, the investigators will dissect macrophage
      activation mechanisms as well as NK cytotoxicity inability in adults patients suffering of
      S-HLH.

      Macrophage activation could result from the loss of the retro-control normally exerted by NK
      cells, thus the investigators will analyze reciprocal interactions of macrophages and NK
      cells during the acute phase and after recovery of S-HLH.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients Hemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis group:

          -  Of more than 18 years old

          -  affected by secondary LH infections with the exception of the HIV, the lymphomes, the
             néoplasies or the autoimmunes / inflammatory diseases following the criteria of the
             HLH Society modified in 2004

        group control

          -  Of more than 18 years old

             B19, HSV), is of lymphome cunning(malignant) not - Hodgkinien or of epithelial
             métastasés cancers, or auto-immune disease (erythemic lupus and disease of Still of
             the adult only) without associated criteria corresponding to the diagnosis of LHS

          -  have agreed to benefit from a pregnancy test and from a screening sérologique by the
