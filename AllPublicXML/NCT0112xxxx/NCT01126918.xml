  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-site effectiveness trial will test whether a brief dissonance-based eating
      disorder prevention program produces intervention effects when college counselors,
      psychologists, and nurses are responsible for participant recruitment, screening, and
      intervention delivery under ecologically valid conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Threshold and subthreshold eating disorders affect over 10% of young women and are associated
      with functional impairment, distress, psychiatric comorbidity, medical complications,
      mortality, and risk for obesity onset. Accordingly, a pressing public healthy priority is to
      develop effective prevention programs for eating pathology. The proposed project will be the
      first effectiveness trial to test whether an eating disorder prevention program with strong
      empirical support from efficacy trials produces effects under ecologically valid conditions
      among high-risk female college students, which is a vital step toward widespread
      dissemination of programs developed with NIH funding. The proposed cost-effectiveness
      analyses and examination of process factors that predict larger intervention effects will
      also represent novel contributions to the literature.
