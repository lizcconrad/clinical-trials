  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative, progressive illness. It is a multi-system
      disease that influences not only the motor but also the cognitive and autonomic systems. The
      main cognitive impairment in individuals with PD is found in executive function (EF). EF is
      defined as a set of cognitive skills necessary for planning, monitoring and executing
      sequences of complex activities.

      The primary study hypothesis is that computer-based training aimed at improving executive
      function will have a beneficial effect on gait functions.

      Parkinson Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative, progressive illness. It is a multi-system
      disease that influences not only the motor but also the cognitive and autonomic systems. The
      main cognitive impairment in individuals with PD is found in executive function (EF). EF is
      defined as a set of cognitive skills necessary for planning, monitoring and executing
      sequences of complex activities. Previous studies have revealed some relation between
      cognitive states and physical functions in healthy adults. Few studies have examined the
      effect of computer-based cognitive training on various populations. These studies showed a
      positive emotional-cognitive effect in those populations. This type of intervention plan was
      also applied to PD patients. However, there are no reports on the effect of intentional
      cognitive training on gait functions. The purpose of the study is to assess whether cognitive
      training, designed to improve EF ability, can also improve gait function in PD patients.

    <description>At enrollment eligible individuals will undergo a thorough baseline assessment using a predefined set of tests and performance measurements. Within a week after enrollment each individual will receive guided training on the use of the intervention tool, the Attengo™ software program. Thereafter they will train at their homes, at least three times a week, for a period of 12 weeks. Follow up assessments will be performed within a week of the end of the training period and 4 weeks thereafter to check for long-term cognitive and motor changes.</description>
