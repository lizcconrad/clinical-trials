      Radiotherapy using tomotherapy is delivered in 5 Gy daily fractions for a total of 25 Gy in 5
      fractions.

      A bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil (400 mg/m2/d)and leucovorin (20 mg/m2/d) is delivered
      concurrently on day 1-5 during radiotherapy.

      Total mesorectal excision is performed within 6±2 weeks. The pathological response of
      downstaing is the study endpoint.
