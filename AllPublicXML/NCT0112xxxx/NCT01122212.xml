      In Patients with minor head injury measurement of protein S100 will be introduced to the
      emergency departement as another tool to rule out intracerebral bleeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe intracerebral bleeding is still a complication even in obvious minor head injury (MHI)
      that makes the use of CT scanning necessary in patients with only few signs of intracerebral
      injury. To reduce the number of cerebral CT scans without pathologic findings measurement of
      protein S100 level in serum will be used in the emergency departement (ED) at our hospital.

      Our hypothesis: with measurement of S100 levels cCT scans and inpatient treatment can be
      reduced, radiation and costs can be reduced.

      From January 1st 2010 for 3-6 months all patients with head injury (all GCS) will be tested
      for their initial S100 level. Cut off level is set at 0,105ng/ml. During this period test
      results will be blinded. Decisions for further diagnostics (x-ray, cCT) and inpatient vs.
      outpatient treatment are made on clinical impressions as they are made now. The test results
      will be monitored and compared with clinical cases. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values will be measured.

      The aim is to identify patients without risk for intracerebral bleeding (ie S100 level lower
      than 0,105ng/ml). Those can be managed in an outpatient way. All other patients will be
      diagnosed and treated as it is now.

      If the test will not miss one intracranial bleeding and will save cCT scans and inpatient
      treatment, measurement of protein S100 will become a routine diagnostic in our ED for
      patients with MHI.
