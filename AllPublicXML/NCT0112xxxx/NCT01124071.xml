      To determine:

        1. the acceptability of a Korean diet to an Australian overweight and obese population

        2. which Korean recipes are easily prepared

        3. the effect of a Korean diet on weight, blood pressure, and metabolic complications of
           obesity in this population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint (Korean diet acceptability) will be assessed by reliability tested
      questionnaire, dietary compliance, and quantities of food returned over the 12 weeks.

      Analysis of differences in weight loss will be based on all participants with a baseline and
      a 12-week weight assessment. In order to investigate the impact of missing data, all subjects
      will be analysed using last weight observation carried forward and baseline weight carried
      forward.

      Other secondary endpoints will determine the effect of the Korean diet on blood pressure,
      metabolic parameters and chronic metabolic disease control in the Australian population.

    <measure>1. To investigate the acceptability of a Korean diet in overweight and obese Australians.</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined at baseline and 4 week timepoints throughout the study by participants completing a Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ). The FAQ addresses 10 components of food acceptability along a 7-point Likeart scale. The FAQ is a recognised instrument for testing food acceptability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>2. To examine the differences in weight loss between the Korean diet intervention and the Western diet intervention in overweight and obese Australians.</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined by assessing differences at baseline and 12 weeks for weight, BMI and percent BMI change.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate changes in a number of indicators of metabolic disease in both groups - including anthropometry, Blood Glucose Levels, insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, liver function, hormone function and inflammatory markers.</measure>
