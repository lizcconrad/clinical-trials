      The purposes of this study are to test whether GAD vaccination can stop the progression of
      newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, to describe the related immunological processes (insulitis)
      in pancreas and small intestines evolving the mechanism of the effect of GAD vaccination and
      finally try to detect viruses and virus receptors directly in the insulin producing beta
      cells of the pancreas in patients with newly diagnosed type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1D).

      The aetiology of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Both genetic and environmental factors seem to
      be important for the destruction of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas. Increasing
      indirect evidences exist that picornaviruses may either directly or indirectly through
      autoimmune processes destroy beta cells. New sensitive assays have been developed to detect
      these viruses and to study the immunological processes, especially T-cell function.
      Microsurgical technology has been refined, now making pancreatic biopsies a safe procedure.
      This study focuses on advanced in depth studies of immunology and virology in pancreatic
      tissue and small intestine at an early stage of disease.
