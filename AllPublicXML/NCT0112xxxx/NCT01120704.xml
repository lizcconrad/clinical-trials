  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many smokers fail to take their smoking cessation medication as recommended. This research is
      designed to identify treatments that improve the use of cessation medications and to
      determine whether an increase in medication use results in increased cessation success. This
      research will also identify treatments that help people stay quit after a quit attempt and
      will pioneer more efficient research methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonadherent use of smoking cessation medications is very common and highly associated with
      cessation failure. However, little is presently known about how to improve adherence and
      whether improved adherence will actually boost cessation success (i.e., its causal role is
      unknown). This research represents groundbreaking integration of 1) basic theory and data on
      tobacco dependence, adherence, and intervention mechanisms with 2) the state-of-the-art
      Intervention Optimization Cycle methodology. This methodology uses factorial designs to
      efficiently engineer and evaluate intervention components, and to develop an optimal
      comprehensive treatment package. Participants in Project 3 will be smokers (N = 544) visiting
      primary care clinics for a regular outpatient visit who, when asked, express an interest in
      quitting and agree to participate in a smoking cessation research study. The experiment will
      comprise five experimental factors (2X2X2X2X2), and participants will have a 50% chance of
      being assigned one of the levels of each factor. The five factors include one medication
      factor (medication duration: 8 vs. 26 weeks), one counseling factor (maintenance counseling
      vs. no maintenance counseling), and three adherence factors: 1) Cognitive Medication
      Adherence Counseling (C-MAC); C-MAC vs. no C-MAC; 2) electronic medication monitoring device
      (the Helping Hand) + Feedback vs. the medication monitoring device alone; and 3) automated
      adherence prompting phone calls vs. no prompting.

    <time_frame>Assessed at 52 weeks after target quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence is a dichotomous outcome with values of 0 and 1 where 0=smoking on one or more of the past 7 days at the assessment endpoint (52 weeks post-quit) and 1=no smoking on any of the past 7 days at the assessment endpoint (i.e., abstinent for the past 7 days); this outcome will be analyzed in a logistic regression analysis model.
Note: This abstinence primary outcome replaces latency to relapse (now designated as a secondary outcome) because reviewers of the now-accepted manuscript (at the journal &quot;Addiction&quot;) advised us to change the primary outcome to the current week 52 Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will receive eight 15-minute phone counseling sessions at Weeks 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18 &amp; 22. The counseling will encourage continued practice of coping skills, and avoidance of danger situations. Another emphasis will be the continued provision of social support as a means of enhancing motivation. Participants who have relapsed will receive counseling aimed at motivating and planning renewed quit attempts. Other aims are enhancing motivation, especially competence self-appraisals, providing intratreatment support, and encouraging pleasurable activities.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will be given a brief (10 minute) session of CAM treatment at both Visits 1 and 2. CAM will include information on NRT such as the following: NRT reduces withdrawal and urges; sustained use reduces the likelihood of relapse; willpower and medication make a good combination; NRT will help a lapsing smoker reachieve abstinence. The tailored counseling component of the CAM intervention is based on brief evaluation of the smoker's beliefs, concerns, and possible misconceptions about smoking cessation medications.</description>

    <description>If randomized to this condition, the case manager will give patients a computer-generated feedback sheet showing the patient's medication self-administration since the last visit. The case manager will provide problem-solving counseling regarding barriers to medication use. This problem-solving counseling intervention will be given in brief in-person sessions (three in-person sessions for those in the 8 week medication condition and five in-person sessions for those in the 26 week medication condition). Medication monitoring counseling will also occur via phone (two 10-minute sessions for those in the 8 week medication condition and four 10-minute sessions for those in the 26 week medication condition).</description>

        <title>Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence</title>
        <description>Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence is a dichotomous outcome with values of 0 and 1 where 0=smoking on one or more of the past 7 days at the assessment endpoint (52 weeks post-quit) and 1=no smoking on any of the past 7 days at the assessment endpoint (i.e., abstinent for the past 7 days); this outcome will be analyzed in a logistic regression analysis model.
Note: This abstinence primary outcome replaces latency to relapse (now designated as a secondary outcome) because reviewers of the now-accepted manuscript (at the journal &quot;Addiction&quot;) advised us to change the primary outcome to the current week 52 Self-Reported 7-Day Point-Prevalence Abstinence.</description>
