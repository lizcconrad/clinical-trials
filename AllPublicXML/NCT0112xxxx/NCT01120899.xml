      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of minocycline as a
      microglia inhibitor in individuals with diabetic macular edema (DME).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United
      States. A frequent manifestation of diabetic retinopathy is diabetic macular edema (DME) for
      which the only proven treatment is laser photocoagulation. In the retina, microglia are
      capable of migrating through the retina to sites of inflammation to associate closely with
      neurons and the vasculature, and are key cellular players in the mediation of processes of
      chronic inflammation implicated in DME. For these reasons, microglia represent a promising
      cellular target for forms of therapy that limit the deleterious inflammatory changes found in
      DR. The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of minocycline as a
      microglia inhibitor in patients with DME.

      Study Population: Eligibility criteria include previous treatment with standard-of-care focal
      laser photocoagulation, or macular edema not amenable to focal laser treatment; retinal
      thickness in the central subfield &gt; 250 microns as measured by optical coherence tomography
      (OCT); and visual acuity between 20/32 and 20/200 in the study eye.

      Design: Five participants will be initially enrolled in this open-label pilot study. However,
      up to an additional three participants may be enrolled to account for participants who
      withdraw from the study prior to receipt of six months of study treatment. Participants will
      take an oral dose of 100 mg of minocycline twice daily for 24 months. During each visit,
      participants will have their visual acuity measured and will undergo OCT testing to measure
      retinal thickness. Beginning at the Month 6 visit, participants will be eligible for focal
      laser therapy unless they show marked improvement in retinal thickness and/or visual acuity
      or if they are not amenable to focal laser treatment. Participants who do not meet the
      criteria for improvement will also be eligible for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) treatments such as bevacizumab (Avastin®) or ranibizumab (Lucentis®). Additionally,
      beginning at the Month 4 visit, participants will be assessed for worsening disease defined
      as loss of ≥ 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters of vision compared
      to baseline or a ≥ 50% increase in total retinal thickness as measured by OCT. Participants
      deemed to have worsening disease will also be eligible for focal laser and/or anti-VEGF
      treatments.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in
      the study eye at 6 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes include the change in
      retinal thickness as measured by OCT at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, change
      in BCVA at 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, as well as changes in fluid leakage in
      the macula as demonstrated by fluorescein angiography at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to
      baseline. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of systemic and ocular toxicities,
      and adverse events.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.
The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye. For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria. The eye not chosen as the study eye is referred to as the &quot;fellow eye.&quot;</description>

             at the National Eye Institute (NEI) clinical center (CC) or by an outside
             ophthalmologist at the discretion of the participant and the investigator.

          4. Retinal thickness in the central subfield on baseline optical coherence tomography
             (OCT) measurement &gt; 250 microns, as measured by Spectral OCT.

          5. Media clarity, pupillary dilation and patient cooperation sufficient for adequate
             fundus photographs.

        Study Eye Exclusion Criteria

          1. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.

             An eye should not be considered eligible if:

               -  The macular edema is considered to be related to cataract extraction or

               -  Clinical exam and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface disease (e.g., a
                  taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the primary cause of the
                  macular edema.

          2. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, non-retinal condition).

          3. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the
             course of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory
             disease, neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).

          4. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

          5. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within four months prior to study
             entry.

          6. History of prior pars plana vitrectomy within six months prior to study entry.

          7. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within three months prior to study entry.

          8. History of yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) capsulotomy performed within two months
             prior to study entry.

          9. History of treatment within three months prior to enrollment with any drug that has
             not received regulatory approval at the time of study entry, such as intravitreal or
             periocular steroids or intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.

        Choice of Study Eye in Cases of Bilateral Disease

        If both eyes of a participant meet the study eye inclusion and exclusion criteria listed
        above, the following will be used to determine the study eye:

          1. If one eye is treatment-naïve and the other is not, the treatment-naïve eye will be
             chosen as the study eye.

          2. If both eyes are treatment-naïve, the eye with the better visual acuity will be chosen
             as the study eye.

          3. If both eyes are treatment-naïve and are equivalent, the choice of study eye will be
             determined at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the participant.

          4. If both eyes have been previously treated, the choice of study eye will be determined
             at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the participant.

        <title>Change in BCVA in the Study Eye at 6 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.
The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye. For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria. The eye not chosen as the study eye is referred to as the &quot;fellow eye.&quot;</description>

          <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.
The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye.

        <title>Number of Study Eyes Demonstrating a Decrease in the Area of Late Leakage, as Measured by Fluorescein Angiography (FA), at 6 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Fluorescein angiography (FA) images from both eyes in each participant were obtained via a standard digital imaging system (OIS, Sacramento, CA) at baseline and at Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, and Month 24. Three retinal specialists independently graded the area of late fluorescein leakage (at approximately 10 minutes)in each eye using a region-of-interest tool in an image analysis software package (NIH ImageJ, Bethesda, MD).
The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye. For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria. The eye not chosen as the study eye is referred to as the &quot;fellow eye.&quot;</description>

          <description>Fluorescein angiography (FA) images from both eyes in each participant were obtained via a standard digital imaging system (OIS, Sacramento, CA) at baseline and at Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, and Month 24. Three retinal specialists independently graded the area of late fluorescein leakage (at approximately 10 minutes)in each eye using a region-of-interest tool in an image analysis software package (NIH ImageJ, Bethesda, MD).
The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye. For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria. The eye not chosen as the study eye is referred to as the &quot;fellow eye.&quot;</description>

        <title>Number of Study Eyes Demonstrating an Increase or Decrease in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of 15 or More Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Letters at 6 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.
The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye.

For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria. The eye not chosen as the study eye is referred to as the &quot;fellow eye.&quot;</description>
