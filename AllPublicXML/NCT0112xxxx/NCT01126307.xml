    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases, affecting 300,000
      Canadians. One in 3 epilepsy patients have refractory seizures meaning that all antiseizure
      drugs fail to control their seizures. This drug resistance in epilepsy may be related to the
      over expression of multidrug resistance proteins (MDR). Varapamil inhibits MDR. We propose to
      add verapamil/placebo to patients' anti epilepsy medication for 3 months. Patients who
      receive placebo will have verapamil added for 3 months after the completion of the
      double-blind treatment period. Seizure frequency/severity will be tracked. Blood samples for
      DNA will be collected. There will be 9 clinic visits over 32 weeks. ECG and echocardiogram
      will be done at baseline and repeated if necessary

      This open label study will consist of three phases: baseline, Double-blind treatment and
      open-label-treatment. There are 9 visits over 32 weeks. During the baseline period, the
      number of seizures will be recorded during 2 months while the patient is on a dose of
      antiseizure drug(s) that was previously established to provide better seizure control. Blood
      work, including blood for DNA baseline ECG and echocardiogram will be done and may be
      repeated if necessary. During the 3 months of double-blind treatment phase, verapamil/placebo
      will be added to the current medications. Visits are every 4 weeks. Vital signs, seizure
      counts and adverse events will be evaluated. All patients who received placebo will be
      offered 3 months of open-label treatment with verapamil.
