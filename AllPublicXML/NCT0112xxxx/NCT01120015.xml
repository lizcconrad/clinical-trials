      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical effectiveness of diacerein as add on
      therapy to diclofenac sodium in Indian patients of osteoarthritis (OA) knee.

    <textblock>
      Currently symptomatic relief is provided by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) but they do not reverse the basic pathology of disease, rather may accelerate it,
      like degeneration of cartilage, inhibition of chondroitin synthesis and suppression of
      proteoglycans synthesis by the chondrocyte.

      Research shows that IL-1β plays a fundamental role in osteoarthritis pathophysiology and
      cartilage destruction. Diacerein, a purified compound with anthraquinonic structure, inhibits
      IL-1β, retarding all pathological processes initiated in OA. Also, Diacerein has proven
      analgesic efficacy comparable to that of diclofenac in patients of osteoarthritis knee12.
      Because of these factors, the present study has been planned to evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness of diacerein as add on therapy to diclofenac sodium in Indian patients of
      symptomatic OA knee.

          -  were having a known hypersensitivity to diclofenac sodium, to diacerein, to similar
             compounds, to the excipients or paracetamol, have history of painful knee conditions
             other than OA

          -  have persistent diarrhoea or laxative use; severe gastrointestinal disorders, severe
