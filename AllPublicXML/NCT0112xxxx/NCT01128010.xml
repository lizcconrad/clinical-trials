  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune dysregulations, including cytokines and chemokines secretions occurs in alcoholic
      liver disease. Serum levels and liver expression of CCL2 are increased in patients with
      alcoholic hepatitis but the role of this chemokine in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver
      disease is nevertheless unknown. The aim of the study is to analyze plasma level and liver
      expression of CCL2 and their relation with liver disease severity and inflammatory infiltrate
      in our cohort of alcoholic patients. We studied also the association between -2518 CCL2
      polymorphism and the severity of alcoholic liver disease.

        Consecutive patients undergoing transjugular liver biopsy for alcoholic liver disease will
        be include in the study to measure plasma levels and hepatic expression of CCL2. We
        determine also the rs1024611 polymorphism of these patients. All these parameters are
        correlated to severity of the disease.

        The frequency of the presence of this polymorphism was also compared to a population of
        healthy subjects.
