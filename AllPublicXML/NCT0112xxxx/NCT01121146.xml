  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether crosslinked Marathon and standard Enduron
      polyethylene liners show differences in bone loss around the hip implant.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several institutions report very low wear rates with highly crosslinked polyethylene based on
      early clinical data. However, since bone loss typically appears after 5-year follow-up, the
      reduction in the incidence and extent of bone loss among total hip replacement patients with
      crosslinked Marathon liners, compared to those with standard Enduron liners, has not been as
      dramatic as the wear reduction. Despite the substantial reduction in wear that we observed at
      5-year follow-up, the patients' perceptions of their outcomes remained similar among the
      Marathon and Enduron groups. This study will evaluate outcome at a minimum of 10-years after
      surgery among the same group of patients whose outcome was previously reported at 5-year
      follow-up. At 10-year follow-up, we anticipate that the reduction in wear associated with
      Marathon polyethylene will be associated with significant reductions in bone loss when
      compared to the Enduron polyethylene.

    <measure>Incidence of Clinically Significant Osteolysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 9-year radiographic follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of clinically significant osteolysis was based on the number of unrevised THAs (total hip arthroplasties) with at least 1.5 square centimeters of pelvic and/or femoral osteolysis. Osteolysis was defined as an area of localized loss of trabecular bone or cortical erosion that was not apparent on the pre-operative or immediate postoperative radiograph. To obtain lesion sizes, the defects were outlined on the anteroposterior pelvic radiograph and the area of the lesion was measured using Martell's Hip Analysis Suite software. Lesions were considered clinically important if the total area of osteolysis around a hip replacement was at least 1.5 square centimeters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Polyethylene Wear</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 9-year radiographic follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A single reviewer, who was blinded to the type of polyethylene liner, evaluated femoral head penetration among all unrevised hips with minimum 9-year radiographic follow-up using serial anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. Two-dimensional head penetration was determined for each follow-up radiograph relative to the immediate post-operative (nominal 6-week follow-up) reference view using Hip Suite Analysis version 8.0 with elliptical correction, a validated, computer-assisted technique. A linear wear rate was evaluated for each hip that had a minimum of three follow-up radiographs by using a least-squares linear regression to calculate the slope of the best-fit line for the wear vector magnitude versus time in situ data. The slope from this regression represented the steady-state linear wear rate. The steady-state linear wear rate data from all hips in a group was used to compute a mean polyethylene wear value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Reoperation</measure>
    <time_frame>10-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of reoperation was based on the number of reoperations in each group. Any additional surgery after a participant's initial hip replacement was considered a reoperation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 9-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score measures outcome after hip replacement and is based on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 9-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction was quantified by asking participants to respond &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the question, &quot;Are you satisfied with the results of your hip operation?&quot;</description>

          <title>Incidence of Clinically Significant Osteolysis</title>
          <description>The incidence of clinically significant osteolysis was based on the number of unrevised THAs (total hip arthroplasties) with at least 1.5 square centimeters of pelvic and/or femoral osteolysis. Osteolysis was defined as an area of localized loss of trabecular bone or cortical erosion that was not apparent on the pre-operative or immediate postoperative radiograph. To obtain lesion sizes, the defects were outlined on the anteroposterior pelvic radiograph and the area of the lesion was measured using Martell's Hip Analysis Suite software. Lesions were considered clinically important if the total area of osteolysis around a hip replacement was at least 1.5 square centimeters.</description>
          <population>Minimum 9-year radiographs used to assess osteolysis were available for 79 unrevised hips with Marathon and 68 unrevised hips with Enduron polyethylene.</population>

        <title>Polyethylene Wear</title>
        <description>A single reviewer, who was blinded to the type of polyethylene liner, evaluated femoral head penetration among all unrevised hips with minimum 9-year radiographic follow-up using serial anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. Two-dimensional head penetration was determined for each follow-up radiograph relative to the immediate post-operative (nominal 6-week follow-up) reference view using Hip Suite Analysis version 8.0 with elliptical correction, a validated, computer-assisted technique. A linear wear rate was evaluated for each hip that had a minimum of three follow-up radiographs by using a least-squares linear regression to calculate the slope of the best-fit line for the wear vector magnitude versus time in situ data. The slope from this regression represented the steady-state linear wear rate. The steady-state linear wear rate data from all hips in a group was used to compute a mean polyethylene wear value.</description>
