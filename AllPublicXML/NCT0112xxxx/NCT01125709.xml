  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed research is to compare two commonly used pediatric strength testing
      measures: handheld myometry (HHM) and CINRG Quantitative Measurement System (CQMS), with the
      goal of identifying a sensitive and valid tool for measuring muscle strength in children with
      DMD. The data obtained from this study will be used to make recommendations for strength
      measurement endpoints in prospective muscular dystrophy trials and provide more reliable and
      accurate recommendations in the clinic for strength assessment. This study will be performed
      at six participating sites in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group
      (CINRG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to compare the reliability of CQMS vs. HHM in the DMD population. The importance
      of this study is to be able to compare the results of clinical trials done by different
      networks using distinct strength endpoints. If results indicate a distinct difference in
      reliability of one tool over the other, a standardized tool could be established for research
      groups throughout the world to interpret strength in the context of clinical trials. If the
      results indicate minor differences then it would be possible to interpret and
      compare/contrast strength measurements used in different studies.

      Understanding the relationship between the HHM vs CQMS will help us examine other surrogate
      measures capable of predicting functionality that are based on strength measurements.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the inter and intra rater reliability of HHM and CQMS by measuring Elbow and Knee Flexor/Extensor Strength in children ages 6-18 diagnosed with DMD tested by experienced clinical evaluators in both HHM and CQMS.</measure>
    <time_frame>two-day visit</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle groups will be tested in a standardized order 1. Knee extension 2. Knee flexion 3. Elbow Flexion 4. Elbow extension with all tests sequencing following a right to left pattern. This will reduce assessment bias and the impact of muscle fatigue per muscle group. Study participants are randomized to two different sequences of four assessments, one sequence performed on one testing day (Visit 1) and another on a different testing day (Visit 2).</description>
