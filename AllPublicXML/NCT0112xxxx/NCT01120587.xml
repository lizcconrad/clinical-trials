      This study has as objective to characterize the start of pharyngeal phase of swallowing, in
      the various food consistencies and volumes, with and without the influence of verbal orders,
      observed on videofluoroscopy of deglutition.

      Quantitative study, transverse and observational study, in the period January to March 2010,
      in the Center Advanced Diagnosis and Treatment Trajan Almeida, in the city of Fortaleza,
      Ceará. The sample was composed by 40 individuals, with mean age 23.5 years, 35 (87.5 %)
      female and five (12.5%) male gender. was carried out an assessment videofluoroscopy
      swallowing in net consistencies (15 ml of water added to 15 ml of barium net), liquid paste
      (25ml of barium net), paste (two spoons of 5ml of thickening for 30ml of barium net) and
      solid (1/2 cracker waffer immersed the barium net), where the individuals remained seated and
      the images were carried out in the lateral position. From the beginning of the rapid movement
      of hyoid bone, verified the beginning of pharyngeal phase of swallowing in each consistency.
