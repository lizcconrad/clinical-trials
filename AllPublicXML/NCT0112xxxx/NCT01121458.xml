  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare blood vessel disorder of the lung in which
      the pressure in the pulmonary artery (PA) rises above normal levels and may become life
      threatening. PAH is frequently misdiagnosed and has often progressed to late stage by the
      time it is accurately diagnosed. PAH has been historically chronic and incurable with a poor
      survival rate. However, new treatments are available which have significantly improved
      prognosis. Right-heart catheterization (RHC) is the most accurate and useful test for PAH,
      and the only test that directly measures the pressure inside the PA. It is performed in all
      patients at least once, to get a definitive diagnosis of PAH.

      The most commonly used medication for this purpose is intravenous nitroprusside, however this
      medication in about 25-30% of patients is not well tolerated as it cause fast heart rates,
      which is not well tolerated by patients with pulmonary hypertension and/or heart failure. The
      CARVE study assesses the effect of Clevidipine, an ultra-short acting vasoselective calcium
      antagonist, on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and its utility for pulmonary
      vasoreactivity testing during right heart catheterization (RHC) of patients with pulmonary
      hypertension (PAH).

      CARVE is a Phase 4 open-label descriptive observational trial in PAH patients undergoing
      invasive vasoreactivity testing in the cath lab at the Dallas VA Medical Center. Patients
      clinically indicated for RHC and assessment of pulmonary artery vasoreactivity will be
      enrolled if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study will involve the following
      tests:

        1. Performance of clinically indicated RHC with assessment of pulmonary hypertension and
           pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).

        2. Performance of clinically indicated pulmonary vasoreactivity assessment with IV
           Nitroprusside (standard of care)

        3. For patients who are responsive to Nitroprusside, or those who have an inconclusive
           result because of intolerability to Nitroprusside, pulmonary vasoreactivity assessment
           with study drug (IV) will be conducted.

    <description>The clevidipine infusion is to be administered via IV infusion at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/hour. The dose may be doubled every three (3) minutes to a maximum dose of 32 mg/hr as tolerated, until a 20% reduction in PVR is achieved or until the patient experiences hypotension (SBP&lt; 80 mmHg), hypertension (SBP&gt;150 mmHg), tachycardia (120 beats per minute), bradycardia (&lt;50 beats per minute), or symptoms of hypotension or ischemia (chest pain, anxiety, nausea, vomiting), allergic reaction (hives, urticaria) or other adverse event. Clevidipine infusion may be terminated at any time for a safety reason or at the investigator's discretion.</description>
