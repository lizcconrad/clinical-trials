    <measure>Plaque Index of Test Mouth Rinse Versus Sterile Water After Day 4 of Treatment Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 post treatment administration</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque scores were assessed using Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index and categorized as 0: No plaque; 1: Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth;2: A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth;3: A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth;4: Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the crown of the tooth;5: Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth. The interproximal plaque index was calculated by taking the average of plaque scores over the mesiofacial, distofacial, mesiolingual and distolingual surfaces in the upper and lower jaws for a participant.</description>

          <description>Plaque scores were assessed using Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index and categorized as 0: No plaque;1: Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth;2: A thin continuous band of plaque (1 millimeter [mm] or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth;3: A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth;4: Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the crown of the tooth;5: Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth. Plaque Index was calculated by taking average of scores over all tooth sites for a participant.</description>

        <title>Plaque Index of Test Mouth Rinse Versus Sterile Water After Day 4 of Treatment Administration</title>
        <description>Plaque scores were assessed using Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index and categorized as 0: No plaque; 1: Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth;2: A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth;3: A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth;4: Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the crown of the tooth;5: Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth. The interproximal plaque index was calculated by taking the average of plaque scores over the mesiofacial, distofacial, mesiolingual and distolingual surfaces in the upper and lower jaws for a participant.</description>

        <description>Plaque scores were assessed using Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index and categorized as 0: No plaque; 1: Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth;2: A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth;3: A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth;4: Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the crown of the tooth;5: Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth. The interproximal plaque index was calculated by taking the average of plaque scores over the mesiofacial, distofacial, mesiolingual and distolingual surfaces in the upper and lower jaws for a participant.</description>
