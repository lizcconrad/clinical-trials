      RATIONALE: Genistein may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well genistein works in treating
      patients with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether genistein treatment will decrease the number of circulating prostate
      cells (CPCs) in the peripheral blood as measured by qRT-PCR for PSA performed on RNA
      extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the natural history of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in a cohort of subjects
      prior to and post radical prostatectomy.

      II. Compare the measurement of PSA between three separate methods: in CPCs by qRT-PCR, in
      serum by the standard clinical chemistry assay (i.e., ELISA), and in plasma and serum by the
      nano-PSA assay.

      III. Measure the effect of genistein on gene and protein expression in prostate tissue by
      qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, for the following genes and their respective
      protein products: HSP27, MMP-2, ALK-2, BASP1, and HCF2.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month
      prior to radical prostatectomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month
      prior to radical prostatectomy.

      All patients undergo radical prostatectomy at least 2 weeks, but not more than 3 months
      following the start of therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months.
