  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most commonly used treatment for
      obstructive sleep apnea. Nasal symptoms such as dryness, itching and congestion are common in
      CPAP users. Nasal and sinus saline irrigation has been shown to improve these symptoms in
      individuals with chronic nasal congestion and sinusitis. This is an 8 week study that
      investigates whether daily saline nasal and sinus irrigation reduces nasal symptoms in
      patients using CPAP, improves quality of life and CPAP compliance.

    <measure>RQLQ (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 28-item, self administered questionnaire measuring nasal symptoms and other domains, including activity limitations and eye symptoms. Subjects will be asked to rate their symptoms on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6=severely impaired). Change in RQLQ with daily saline irrigation in CPAP users is the primary outcome of interest.</description>

    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self administered questionnaire that measures subjective daytime hypersomnia on a scale of 0 to 24.</description>

    <measure>SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short Form health survey (SF-36) is a 36-item questionnaire which measures 8 domains of health: physical functioning, physical problems, emotional problems, social functioning, mental health, energy/vitality, pain, and general perception of health status. This questionnaire has been used as a validated measure of change in the quality of life of OSA patients on CPAP therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CPAP compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CPAP card compliance data will be measured to determine if use of daily sinus rinse is associated with an increase in CPAP use. The % of days CPAP used over 4 weeks and the average number of hours of CPAP use per night are the outcomes of interest.</description>
