  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke shoulder pain is a major rehabilitation problem affecting moderate to severely
      impaired stroke survivors. Surface electrical stimulation (ES) of muscles surrounding the
      hemiparetic shoulder has been demonstrated to be beneficial, but despite the evidence for
      therapeutic benefit, the clinical implementation of surface ES for poststroke shoulder pain
      has been difficult. In order to address the limitations of surface ES, the investigative team
      pioneered the development of percutaneous intramuscular (IM) ES for the treatment of
      post-stroke shoulder pain. However, prior to acceptance by the clinical community, additional
      gaps in the scientific and clinical knowledge need to be addressed. This study begins to do
      so. The primary objective is to estimate the relative pain reduction associated with IM ES
      vs. &quot;usual care.&quot; We hypothesize that the IM ES group will exhibit a larger effect size with
      respect to pain reduction compared to &quot;usual care&quot;. A secondary objective is to estimate the
      effect on health related QOL of IM ES vs. &quot;usual care.&quot; Demonstration of improvement in QOL
      will validate the clinical relevance of the intervention. We hypothesize that the IM ES group
      will exhibit greater improvement in health related QOL compared to &quot;usual care&quot;.

    <measure>Isometric Shoulder Abduction Moment, Ratio Affected to Unaffected</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0); Start of Treatment (Week 1); End of Treatment (EOT, Week 4); EOT + 6 wks (Week 10); EOT + 12 wks (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of isometric strength in response to audio cue. Isometric shoulder abduction moment was measured with a Biodex Biomechanical Measurement System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). The average moment during the last second of the audible tone was calculated for each trial and those values were averaged over the three trials. Subjects underwent testing of both shoulders, non-paretic side first, and the results are presented as the ratio of the paretic shoulder to the non-paretic shoulder to decrease the influence of intra-subject variability between measurements.</description>

    <measure>Delay in Initiation of Shoulder Abduction EMG Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0); Start of Treatment (Week 1); End of Treatment (EOT, Week 4); EOT + 6 wks (Week 10); EOT + 12 wks (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>Electromyographic activity from the deltoid was also measured during the isometric abduction moment trials. Surface EMG recording electrodes (2 cm x 2 cm) were placed over the deltoid muscle and spaced approximately 4 cm apart. The EMG amplifier gain was adjusted to record as high-fidelity an EMG signal as possible during shoulder abduction. Delay of initiation (DOI) was defined as the duration between onset of the audibe tone and the onset of EMG signal. Raw EMG signals were analyzed visually to determine the earliest rise in EMG activity relative to steady state for delay of initiation. The mean DOI of the three trials were calculated, and the ratio of the paretic to non-paretic shoulder DOI were used as summary metrics.</description>

          <description>The IM ES Group will receive electrical stimulation treatment for three weeks (6 hrs daily) with an Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator following a one week electrode stabilization period.
Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator: A sterile percutaneous IM electrode is implanted in the shoulder using a 20-gauge hypodermic needle and connected to an external cable. The exit site and electrode are covered by a bandage, but the cable extends out. After a one week stabilization period, the cable is connected to a stimulator. A self-adhesive surface electrode serves as the indifferent electrode. Stimulation intensity is set by the investigator. The prescription for daily stimulation treatment will be 6 hrs. The duty cycle and daily dose will remain constant throughout the treatment, but stimulus parameters may be adjusted by the research staff as deemed appropriate. The treatment period will be 3 weeks, after which the electrode will be removed.</description>

Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator: A sterile percutaneous IM electrode is implanted in the shoulder using a 20-gauge hypodermic needle and connected to an external cable. The exit site and electrode are covered by a bandage, but the cable extends out. After a one week stabilization period, the cable is connected to a stimulator. A self-adhesive surface electrode serves as the indifferent electrode. Stimulation intensity is set by the investigator. The prescription for daily stimulation treatment will be 6 hrs. The duty cycle and daily dose will remain constant throughout the treatment, but stimulus parameters may be adjusted by the research staff as deemed appropriate. The treatment period will be 3 weeks, after which the electrode will be removed.</description>

        <title>Isometric Shoulder Abduction Moment, Ratio Affected to Unaffected</title>
        <description>A measure of isometric strength in response to audio cue. Isometric shoulder abduction moment was measured with a Biodex Biomechanical Measurement System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). The average moment during the last second of the audible tone was calculated for each trial and those values were averaged over the three trials. Subjects underwent testing of both shoulders, non-paretic side first, and the results are presented as the ratio of the paretic shoulder to the non-paretic shoulder to decrease the influence of intra-subject variability between measurements.</description>

        <title>Delay in Initiation of Shoulder Abduction EMG Activity</title>
        <description>Electromyographic activity from the deltoid was also measured during the isometric abduction moment trials. Surface EMG recording electrodes (2 cm x 2 cm) were placed over the deltoid muscle and spaced approximately 4 cm apart. The EMG amplifier gain was adjusted to record as high-fidelity an EMG signal as possible during shoulder abduction. Delay of initiation (DOI) was defined as the duration between onset of the audibe tone and the onset of EMG signal. Raw EMG signals were analyzed visually to determine the earliest rise in EMG activity relative to steady state for delay of initiation. The mean DOI of the three trials were calculated, and the ratio of the paretic to non-paretic shoulder DOI were used as summary metrics.</description>

        <title>Delay in Termination of Shoulder Abduction EMG Activity</title>
        <description>Electromyographic activity from the deltoid was also measured during the isometric abduction moment trials. Surface EMG recording electrodes (2 cm x 2 cm) were placed over the deltoid muscle and spaced approximately 4 cm apart. The EMG amplifier gain was adjusted to record as high-fidelity an EMG signal as possible during shoulder abduction. Delay of termination (DOT) was defined as the duration between cessation of the audible tone and return of the EMG signal to baseline. Raw EMG signals were analyzed visually to determine the earliest rise in EMG activity relative to steady state for delay of initiation, and return to steady for delay of termination. The mean DOT of the three trials were calculated, and the ratio of the paretic to non-paretic shoulder DOT were used as summary metrics.</description>

            <description>The IM ES Group will receive electrical stimulation treatment for three weeks (6 hrs daily) with an Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator following a one week electrode stabilization period.
Intramuscular Electrical Stimulator: A sterile percutaneous IM electrode is implanted in the shoulder using a 20-gauge hypodermic needle and connected to an external cable. The exit site and electrode are covered by a bandage, but the cable extends out. After a one week stabilization period, the cable is connected to a stimulator. A self-adhesive surface electrode serves as the indifferent electrode. Stimulation intensity is set by the investigator. The prescription for daily stimulation treatment will be 6 hrs. The duty cycle and daily dose will remain constant throughout the treatment, but stimulus parameters may be adjusted by the research staff as deemed appropriate. The treatment period will be 3 weeks, after which the electrode will be removed.</description>
