      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of immediate postoperative adjuvant hormonal
      treatment according to 2 year PSA recurrence rate in high risk localised or locally advanced
      Chinese prostate cancer patients.The secondary objective is to assess the quality of
      life（QoL）of the high risk localised or locally advanced Chinese prostate cancer patients with
      immediate postoperative adjuvant hormonal treatment and get the information of immediate
      postoperative adjuvant hormonal treatment (including the regimen, dosage and duration).

    <description>Localised with one of any high recurrence risk factors, or locally advanced Chinese prostate cancer patients confirmed histologically through radical prostatectomy either with laparoscopy or laparotomy within 1 month after surgery. Before the patient recruitment, the investigator has decided to prescribe immediate postoperative adjuvant hormonal treatment to the patient according to the Chinese routine practice.</description>

             cancer patients confirmed histologically through radical prostatectomy either with
