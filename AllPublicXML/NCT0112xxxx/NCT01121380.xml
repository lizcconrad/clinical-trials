  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BL-1021
      in healthy volunteers. Subsequent clinical studies will be designed to test the safety and
      efficacy of BL-1021 in patients with neuropathic pain based on data obtained from the
      proposal trial described below.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 32 subjects in the single-ascending phase and 24 subjects in the multiple
      ascending phase, who have provided a written informed consent and comply with
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will participate in the study in 4 different cohorts in the
      first phase (cohorts A, B, C and D) and 3 different cohorts in the second phase (cohorts E, F
      and G), each consisting of 8 subjects.

      First part dosing:

      Cohort A - 10 mg Cohort B - 20 mg Cohort C - 30 mg Cohort D - 40 mg

      Second part dosing:

      Cohort E - X mg (X shall be determined using the results of the 1st part) Cohort F - 2X mg
      Cohort G - 4X mg

             Investigator's judgment contraindicate administration of the study medications

          -  Use of another investigational medication/treatment in the past 30 days

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Significant abnormalities in screening physical examination
