  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical treatment of wrist fractures (distal radius bone) has been changed by the
      introduction of a new plate design, the locking plate. This results in improved fixation and
      stabilisation of the fracture fragments allowing early movement.

      This type of plate has been increasingly used throughout the world but questions have been
      raised regarding the potential complications of the surgery, particularly nerve and tendon
      injury. The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital has treated over 250 distal radial fractures with
      this type of plate. The investigators plan to recall these patients to asses their long term
      function, general satisfaction and radiological results.
