    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone (OZURDEX速) as adjunctive
      therapy to ranibizumab (LUCENTIS速) compared with ranibizumab alone in the treatment of
      patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness at Month 12 as Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a laser based non-invasive diagnostic system providing high-resolution imaging sections of the retina, was performed on the study eye after pupil dilation at baseline and Month 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Area Leakage of Choroidal Neovascularization at Month 12 as Measured by Fluorescein Angiography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a technique for examining the circulation of the retina (and detecting any leakage) using a dye-tracing method. Photographs are taken with a specialized low-power microscope with an attached camera designed to photograph the interior of the eye, including the retina and optic disc. FA was performed on the study eye after dilation at baseline and Week 12.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Area Leakage of Choroidal Neovascularization at Month 12 as Measured by Fluorescein Angiography</title>
        <description>Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a technique for examining the circulation of the retina (and detecting any leakage) using a dye-tracing method. Photographs are taken with a specialized low-power microscope with an attached camera designed to photograph the interior of the eye, including the retina and optic disc. FA was performed on the study eye after dilation at baseline and Week 12.</description>
