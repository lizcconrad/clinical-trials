  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study shall evaluate the volume effect and safety of 6 % hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 for
      restoration and maintenance of hemodynamics during the investigational period in patients
      undergoing major elective surgery. Up to 50 mL 6% hydroxyethyl starch/kg body weight will be
      administered from start of surgery until two hours after end of surgery. The study hypothesis
      is that 6 % hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 will have a reliable volume effect and can be safely
      administered up to the dose limit.

    <description>Volume effect will be assessed by evaluating the following parameter:
Saved albumin:
For adult patients: Amount of 6 % hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (HES130) administered during surgery once 1000 mL of HES130 are exceeded.
For pediatric patients: Amount of HES130 administered during surgery once 10 mL HES130/kg body weight are exceeded.
