    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LUSEDRA (fospropofol
      disodium) and to determine whether a dose lower than currently approved can provide effective
      moderate sedation required to complete diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.

      This will be a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, dose-ranging study, in
      age &gt;/= 65 years, and/or weight &lt; 60 kg, and/or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
      Physical Classification Status 3 or 4 subjects using either the approved dose modification or
      1 lower dose, to achieve a moderate level of sedation required to complete the scheduled
      diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. Three subgroups of subjects will be included. For
      Subgroup 1 and Subgroup 2, approximately equal numbers of subjects will be enrolled into 2
      strata: weight &gt;/= 55 kg and weight &lt; 55 kg. For Subgroup 1 and Subgroup 2, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dose groups in a 1:1 ratio within each stratum. For Subgroup 3,
      subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dose groups in a 1:1 ratio.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Sedation Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation success was defined as subjects who met the following 4 criteria: had 3 consecutive Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores at or less than 4 after administration of sedative medication, completed the procedure, did not require the use of alternative sedative medication, and did not require manual/mechanical ventilation. The MOAA/S score was used to clinically rate the level of sedation using a score of 0 to 5 based on the subject's level of responsiveness. A high score on the MOAA/S scale indicated a lower level of sedation.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Modified sedation success was defined as a subject who was a sedation success and did not have a MOAA/S score &lt;2 any time after administration of sedative medication. Sedation success was defined as subjects who had 3 consecutive MOAA/S scores at or less than 4 after administration of sedative medication, completed the procedure, did not require the use of alternative sedative medication, and did not require manual/mechanical ventilation. The MOAA/S score was used to clinically rate the level of sedation using a score of 0 to 5 based on the level of responsiveness.</description>

             and clear fluids up to 3 hours before the procedure (assessed only at Baseline);

          3. Evidence of clinically significant disease or a history of a concomitant medical
             condition (eg, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal disease) that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, could affect the subject's safety or ability to safely
             complete the study;

          4. Subjects with hypersensitivity to LUSEDRA or any other components of LUSEDRA,
             including its active metabolite, propofol;

        <title>Number of Participants With Sedation Success</title>
        <description>Sedation success was defined as subjects who met the following 4 criteria: had 3 consecutive Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores at or less than 4 after administration of sedative medication, completed the procedure, did not require the use of alternative sedative medication, and did not require manual/mechanical ventilation. The MOAA/S score was used to clinically rate the level of sedation using a score of 0 to 5 based on the subject’s level of responsiveness. A high score on the MOAA/S scale indicated a lower level of sedation.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Sedation Success</title>
          <description>Sedation success was defined as subjects who met the following 4 criteria: had 3 consecutive Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores at or less than 4 after administration of sedative medication, completed the procedure, did not require the use of alternative sedative medication, and did not require manual/mechanical ventilation. The MOAA/S score was used to clinically rate the level of sedation using a score of 0 to 5 based on the subject’s level of responsiveness. A high score on the MOAA/S scale indicated a lower level of sedation.</description>
