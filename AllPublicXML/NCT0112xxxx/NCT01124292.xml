      This study was intended to evaluate a new assistive neuro-technology, known as the Tongue
      Drive System (TDS), by its potential end-users, i.e. individuals with severe disabilities,
      who are the best experts for indicating the benefits and possible shortcomings of any new
      ANT. Our goal is to assess the acceptability and usability of the TDS for various tasks that
      are important in daily lives of these individuals, such as computer access, wheeled mobility,
      and environmental control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new assistive neuro-technology (ANT), called the Tongue Drive System (TDS), enables
      individuals with severe disability access their environment with nothing but their tongue
      motion. The human tongue is inherently capable of sophisticated control and manipulation
      tasks with many degrees of freedom. It can move rapidly and accurately within the mouth such
      that the tip can touch every single tooth. The direct connection between the brain and the
      tongue generally allows it to escape damage even in severe spinal cord injuries (SCI). Unlike
      the brain, the tongue is accessible, and its location inside the mouth affords a degree of
      privacy.

      TDS consists of a magnetic tracer, the size of a lentil, attached to the tongue by gluing,
      implantation, or piercing. The tracer generates a magnetic field inside and around the mouth
      that is detected by an array of magnetic sensors mounted on a wireless headset.
      Tongue-movement-induced changes in the magnetic field are sent wirelessly to an ultra-mobile
      computer or smartphone, carried by the user, which processes and translates every tongue
      motion to a particular user-defined function.

      Once an individual with disability is &quot;enabled&quot; to access a computing device, he/she can
      nearly do everything that an able-bodied individual can do with that device. This includes
      communicating, education, training, entertainment, and controlling other devices such as
      powered wheelchairs (PWC), assistive robotic manipulators, and other home/office appliances
      on a local area network (LAN). Even the individual's own natural or prosthetic limbs can be
      manipulated to move by functional electrical stimulation (FES).

      This study was intended to evaluate the TDS by the ultimate intended users, individuals with
      severe disabilities, who are the best experts for indicating the benefits and possible
      shortcomings of any new ANT. Our goal is to assess the acceptability and usability of the TDS
      for various tasks that are important in daily life such as computer access, wheeled mobility,
      and environmental control.

      Three groups of subjects were recruited:

      Group-A: Able-bodied subjects who already have tongue piercing

      Group-B: Able-bodied subjects who wanted to receive tongue piercing as part of this trial

      Group-C: Subjects with high-level disability, who wanted to receive tongue piercing as part
      of this trial

      Each group of subjects participated in a battery of tasks that quantitatively measures their
      performance in accessing computers and driving wheelchairs using the TDS.

      We also devised acceptable procedures for receiving a magnetic tongue piercing (required in
      order to use the TDS), and assess its potential safety issues.

    <measure>Fitts' Law: Horizontal Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, and Mouse (Throughput)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Horizontal Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. This data was then fed into an equation, which provided the throughput measure. The unit of throughput is &quot;bits per second&quot;.
The high value of throughput means better performance. Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>Subjects brush their teeth, and then swish and spit with chlorhexidine mouthwash for 30-60s. Subjects would be placed in a semirecumbent position in a procedure chair. After marking the piercing site using a sterilized surgical marking pen the protruded tongue would be pierced. Anesthesia may be used during the piercing at the discretion of the operator and the subject. A sterilized titanium or surgical grade stainless steel piercing tongue stud would be placed in an appropriate position on the tongue to minimize complications from the piercing but also facilitate good functionality of the TDS.</description>

        <title>Fitts' Law: Horizontal Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, and Mouse (Throughput)</title>
        <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Horizontal Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. This data was then fed into an equation, which provided the throughput measure. The unit of throughput is &quot;bits per second&quot;.
The high value of throughput means better performance. Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. The error rate is the rate of outside of targets vs. total targets.
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Fitts' Law: Vertical Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, and Mouse (Throughput)</title>
        <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Vertical Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. This data was then fed into an equation, which provided the throughput measure. The unit of throughput is &quot;bits per second&quot;.
The high value of throughput means better performance. Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Fitts' Law: Vertical Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, and Mouse (Error Rate)</title>
        <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Vertical Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. The error rate is the rate of outside of targets vs. total targets.
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Fitts' Law: Center-Out Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, Mouse, and SnP (Throughput)</title>
        <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Center-out Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. This data was then fed into an equation, which provided the throughput measure. The unit of throughput is &quot;bits per second&quot;.
The high value of throughput means better performance. This task is tested by the TDS, keypad, mouse and the sip-and-puff device (SnP).
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Fitts' Law: Center-Out Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, Mouse, and SnP (Error Rate)</title>
        <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Center-out Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. The error rate is the rate of outside of targets vs. total targets. This task is tested by the TDS, keypad, mouse and the sip-and-puff device (SnP).
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Fitts' Law: Center-Out Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, Mouse, and SnP (Movement Time)</title>
        <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Center-out Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. The movement time is the cursor movement time from the initial movement to the final movement for each target. This task is tested by the TDS, keypad, mouse and the sip-and-puff device (SnP).
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Fitts' Law: Multi-Directional Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, and Mouse (Throughput)</title>
        <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Multi-directional Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. This data was then fed into an equation, which provided the throughput measure. The unit of throughput is &quot;bits per second&quot;.
The high value of throughput means better performance. Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

          <title>Fitts' Law: Multi-Directional Tapping Using TDS, Keypad, and Mouse (Error Rate)</title>
          <description>Subjects used the tongue drive system (TDS) to move the mouse cursor towards targets with various sizes and distances on the computer screen (Multi-directional Tapping task) and select those targets. The computer measured the time it took for the subjects to reach the targets and the accuracy of their selections from the center of the targets. The error rate is the rate of outside of targets vs. total targets.
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <description>Computer randomly highlights one out of six or four commands and the subjects issue that particular command using the tongue drive system (TDS) and the sip-and-puff device (SnP). Subjects are given a time period (T). The time intervals for the TDS:(Group-A)2.0s,1.5s,1.0s,(Group-B &amp;-C)1.0s,0.7s,0.5s, SnP:(Group-C)1.2s,1.0s,0.7s. The saturated results were observed from the second session during Group-A trials. Therefore, we reduced the time period from the Group-B trial. Moreover, the SnP device needs a certain time period to issue a command and we observed that the minimum possible time period was 0.7 seconds. At the end the percentage of correctly selected commands is calculated and fed into an equation along with the time given to the subjects for each selection.Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Information Transfer Rate (Percentage of Correctly Completed Commands)</title>
        <description>Computer randomly highlights one out of six or four commands and the subjects issue that particular command using the tongue drive system (TDS) and the sip-and-puff device (SnP). Subjects are given a time period (T). The time intervals for the TDS:(Group-A)2.0s,1.5s,1.0s,(Group-B &amp;-C)1.0s,0.7s,0.5s,SnP:(Group-C)1.2s,1.0s,0.7s. The saturated results were observed from the second session during Group-A trials. Therefore, we reduced the time period from the Group-B trial. Moreover, the SnP device needs a certain time period to issue a command and we observed that the minimum possible time period was 0.7 seconds. At the end the percentage of correctly selected commands is calculated and fed into an equation along with the time given to the subjects for each selection.Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>On-screen Maze Using TDS, Keypad, and SnP (Completion Time)</title>
        <description>Subjects were instructed to use four directional commands (Left, Right, Up, and Down) to move the mouse cursor using the tongue drive system (TDS), keypad, and the sip-and-puff device (SnP) as fast and accurately as possible on a maze. One out of eight maze patterns was randomly selected in each round. The performance measures were completion time (CT) from start to end and sum of deviation (SoD) from the track. SoD was calculated as the sum of all areas between the actual trajectory of the cursor when it was out of the track and the closest edge of the track divided by 1000.
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

          <description>Subjects were instructed to use four directional commands (Left, Right, Up, and Down) to move the mouse cursor using the tongue drive system (TDS), keypad, and the sip-and-puff device (SnP) as fast and accurately as possible on a maze. One out of eight maze patterns was randomly selected in each round. The performance measures were completion time (CT) from start to end and sum of deviation (SoD) from the track. SoD was calculated as the sum of all areas between the actual trajectory of the cursor when it was out of the track and the closest edge of the track divided by 1000.
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>On-screen Maze Using TDS, Keypad, and SnP (Sum of Deviation / 1000)</title>
        <description>Subjects were instructed to use four directional commands (Left, Right, Up, and Down) to move the mouse cursor using the tongue drive system (TDS), keypad, and the sip-and-puff device (SnP) as fast and accurately as possible on a maze. One out of eight maze patterns was randomly selected in each round. The performance measures were completion time (CT) from start to end and sum of deviation (SoD) from the track. SoD was calculated as the sum of all areas between the actual trajectory of the cursor when it was out of the track and the closest edge of the track divided by 1000.
Group-A and -B were scheduled for five consecutive TDS trials with intervals ranging from two to ten days. Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Driving a Wheelchair Using TDS vs SnP (Completion Time)</title>
        <description>An obstacle course will be laid out in an open space and the subjects drive an electric powered wheelchair using the tongue drive system (TDS) and the sip-and-puff device (SnP) to drive through the obstacle course. The operator measured the amount of time it takes for the subjects to begin and return back to the starting point and counts the number of collisions with the obstacles.
Unlatched and latched: utilize four TDS commands for forward, backward, left, and right motions.
Unlatched: hold their tongue to keep the PWC moving. Latched: (5 linear speed levels:Backward, Stop, Forward-1, Forward-2, and Forward-3) Issuing the forward or backward commands can increase or decrease the linear speed.
Semi-proportional: Quickly touching the left and right cheeks- forward or backward commands, sliding tongue over the lip- steer the PWC to the left or right.
Group-A&amp;-B:5 consecutive TDS trials (intervals ranging from two to ten days) Group-C:computer and PWC within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Driving a Wheelchair Using TDS vs SnP (Number of Navigation Errors)</title>
        <description>An obstacle course will be laid out in an open space and the subjects drive an electric powered wheelchair using the tongue drive system (TDS) and the sip-and-puff device (SnP) to drive through the obstacle course. The operator measured the amount of time it takes for the subjects to begin and return back to the starting point and counts the number of collisions with the obstacles.
Unlatched and latched: utilize four TDS commands for forward, backward, left, and right motions.
Unlatched: hold their tongue to keep the PWC moving. Latched: (5 linear speed levels:Backward, Stop, Forward-1, Forward-2, and Forward-3) Issuing the forward or backward commands can increase or decrease the linear speed.
Semi-proportional: Quickly touching the left and right cheeks- forward or backward commands, sliding tongue over the lip- steer the PWC to the left or right.
Group-A&amp;-B:5 consecutive TDS trials (intervals ranging from two to ten days) Group-C:computer and PWC within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>

        <description>Randomly selected ten-digit target phone number was visually prompted on the top of the smartphone screen, and the subject entered the same number in the following line as quickly and as accurately as possible. If the wrong number was registered, then the subjects were allowed to delete the one by issuing the deleting command.At the end of the number entering, the subject needs to move the cursor at the green colored “CALL” button, in the middle of the bottom line, and it should be selected to complete the trial. The completion time and error rate were considered to evaluate the performance.
Testing sessions for Group-C were divided into computer access and PWC navigation within a week, over 6 weeks.</description>
