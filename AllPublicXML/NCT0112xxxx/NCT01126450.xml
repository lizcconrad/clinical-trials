      RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways.
      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving lenalidomide together with
      cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when
      given together with cetuximab in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further explore the safety and efficacy profile.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-28 and cetuximab IV once weekly over
      1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
