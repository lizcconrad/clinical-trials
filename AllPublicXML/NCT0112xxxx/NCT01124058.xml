  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized trial to compare the time taken to achieve a therapeutic INR upon
      re-starting warfarin at a &quot;loading&quot; dose (namely 1.5 times the &quot;maintenance&quot; dose for 3 days)
      compared to the known &quot;maintenance&quot; dose.

      Patients will be identified via the University of Alberta Hospital Anticoagulation Management
      Service. Following the receipt of written, informed consent, patients will be randomized to
      re-start warfarin at their &quot;maintenance&quot; dose or at a &quot;loading&quot; dose (1.5 times the
      maintenance dose for 3 days, then resumption of warfarin dosing as per the maintenance dose).
      Randomization will be performed on-line through the EPICORE Centre.

      Assuming Day 1 is the day warfarin is re-started, patients will have INRs done on day 3 and
      at least every 2 days thereafter until a therapeutic INR is obtained. In addition, protein C,
      protein S and factor II levels will be obtained while the patient is on stable maintenance
      dosing of warfarin (i.e., prior to holding warfarin for the procedure), 7 days after
      re-starting warfarin, and 14 days after re-starting warfarin. Complete blood counts (CBCs)
      will be done with each INR if the patient is taking a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
      Patients will have their anticoagulant therapy managed by the AMS for 6 weeks and will
      receive a telephone follow-up by the AMS at 90 days to determine if any bleeding or clotting
      complications occurred.
