      The purpose of this study is to determine if women subjected to laparoscopic supracervical
      hysterectomy in a day-case setting would be less satisfied with the length of hospital stay
      when compared with women who had an overnight stay following their surgical procedure. The
      null hypothesis was that there was no difference in satisfaction with length of hospital
      stay.

      Objective: To determine whether women having day-case laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy
      (LSH) are as satisfied with the length of stay in hospital as women who stay overnight
      following the procedure.

      Design: randomised controlled trial (RCT).

      Setting: Ulleval university hospital, Oslo, Norway.

      Population: 49 women scheduled for LSH were enrolled and 45 patients completed the study (22
      in the inpatient group and 23 in the day-case group).

      Methods: Women were randomised to either day-case care or overnight hospital stay following a
      routine supracervical hysterectomy. The primary outcome measure was satisfaction with the
      length of stay in the hospital (measured on a 10-point visual analogue scale) and secondary
      measures were health-related quality of life (measured using the EuroQol EQ5D), anxiety
      (measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) and general questions
      about their experiences of having the operation. Readmissions, prolonged hospitalisations,
      complications and any contact with a health professional after discharge were also recorded.
      Measures were taken on the day of surgery (postoperatively), and on days 1, 2, 4 and 7
      following surgery. The data were analysed based on an intention to treat.
