  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to train phone counselors working for the New York (NY) State
      Smokers' Quitline to advise callers who drink at hazardous levels to limit or abstain from
      alcohol use to determine whether this improves smoking cessation outcomes so that we can
      establish effect size estimates for a full scale multi-site trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a developmental study to: 1) create and beta test an alcohol counseling protocol with
      25 Quitline callers and 2) train Quitline Specialists to provide an alcohol intervention
      using at least 100 pilot Quitline callers to ensure that Specialists in the alcohol
      intervention + standard care condition provide counseling that addresses hazardous drinking
      with a high level of alcohol intervention strategies and skill. After this phase of the study
      is complete, a developmental randomized clinical trial will be conducted with 1,948 NY
      Quitline callers who drink at hazardous levels to compare practical counseling + smoking
      cessation print materials added to standard care (PC + SC condition) to alcohol intervention
      counseling + alcohol-focused print materials added to standard care (AI + SC condition).
      Efficacy data from this trial will be used to determine effect size estimates for both
      quitdate and 7-month self-reported point prevalence abstinence rates. Reduction in alcohol
      consumption and reduced drinking as a mediator of smoking cessation outcome will be secondary
      outcomes. Other mediators and moderators of alcohol intervention effects will also be
      examined as an exploratory outcome. If the effect size estimates are sufficiently large and
      medically important to pursue a definitive trial, these data will be used to propose a full
      scale multi-site large study. If an alcohol intervention is shown to enhance treatment
      outcome in a large-scale study, alcohol interventions with quitline counselors could be
      translated for use by the entire NY state quitline and other quitlines across the country.
      This may increase the effectiveness of quitline interventions and thus has the potential to
      reach millions of smokers, thereby bolstering tobacco and cancer control efforts across the
      United States.

    <description>To ensure that treatment effects are not due to the longer counseling intervention and additional alcohol intervention workbook in the Alcohol Intervention plus Standard Care condition, we will provide additional smoking cessation advice that will not be specific to alcohol use and an additional smoking cessation workbook for participants in the Practical Counseling plus Standard Care condition. Consistent with the Clinical Practice Guideline Update, we will include 5 minutes of practical counseling, which has been shown empirically to be effective in improving rates of smoking cessation.</description>

    <description>The Alcohol Intervention counseling protocol will be adapted from Dr. Ockene's brief alcohol intervention protocol and Dr. Kahler's brief alcohol intervention for smokers: Feedback and discussion on the relationship between drinking and smoking, and on the potential effects of alcohol consumption on smoking cessation; an emphasis on personal Responsibility for choosing to change one's behavior; Advice to avoid or minimize drinking during the smoking cessation process; a Menu of options for carrying out a change strategy; use of Empathy by the clinician; and encouragement of Self-efficacy (i.e., confidence) for successful change.</description>
