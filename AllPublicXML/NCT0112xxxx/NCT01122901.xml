  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor
      RO4929097 works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma.
      Gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6). (Group A) II. Efficiency of neurosphere
      generation after pretreatment with RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097). (Group B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Radiographic response rate. (Group A) II. Toxicities associated with this regimen. (Group
      A) III. Overall survival. (Group A) IV. Expression levels of Notch pathway components and
      downstream targets. (Group B) V. Tumor propagation. An extension of lifespan by 50% in tumor
      bearing mice (mice bearing fresh tumor tissue). (Group B) VI. Patient event-free survival in
      correlation with expression levels of Notch pathway components and downstream targets.

      VII. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6). VIII. Toxicities associated with this regimen.
      IX. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B (surgical resection indicated): Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling
      pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on days -6 to -1. Patients undergo surgical resection on
      day 0. Within 30 days after surgical resection, patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 as in Group A.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.

Partial Response (PR): &gt;/= to 50% decrease under baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. No progression of evaluable disease. Responders must be on same/decreasing doses of dexamethasone.

          <description>RANO:
Measurable: Bidimensionally measurable lesions w/ clearly defined margins by MRI Evaluable: Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses w/margins not clearly defined.
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all measurable/evaluable disease. No new lesions. No evidence of non-evaluable disease. Patients on minimal/no steroids.
Partial Response (PR): &gt;/= to 50% decrease under baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. No progression of evaluable disease. Responders must be on same/decreasing doses of dexamethasone.
Stable/No Response: Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression.
Progression: 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over BL if no decrease), OR clear worsening of any evaluable disease, OR appearance of any new lesion/site, OR failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer).</description>

          <description>Time to event endpoints for Group A will be measured from the date of first dose. All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the analysis. Time to event endpoints for Group B will be measured from the first post-surgical date (this will be considered start date of treatment). Progression defined as: &gt;25% increase sum of products of perpendicular diameters (bi-dimensional measurements) of enhancing lesions (over baseline (BL) if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. and/or b) Significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared to BL scan or best response following initiation of therapy c) Any new lesion. d) Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor e) Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition.</description>
