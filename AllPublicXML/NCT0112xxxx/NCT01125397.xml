  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an ever increasing public health problem in this country. Bariatric surgery is
      currently the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and two hundred thousand surgeries
      are performed in the United States each year. Unfortunately, despite anatomically successful
      surgery, it is estimated that at most surgical centers about 30 percent of patients will not
      achieve significant weight loss following surgery. It has been proposed that participation in
      preoperative behavior therapy can enhance postoperative outcomes, although empirical evidence
      for this premise is lacking. The current study is a pilot project designed to conduct a
      prospective randomized trial to examine the impact of participation in a 12-week standardized
      preoperative behavioral weight management program on percentage of excess weight loss and
      psychosocial and medical outcomes at six months after roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The
      cost of bariatric surgery is not covered by this study and only patients local to the
      Rochester, Minnesota area are eligible to participate.

      It is hypothesized that patients who complete the 12-week behavioral program will experience
      greater weight loss and improved psychosocial and medical outcomes compared to controls.

    <measure>Psychosocial outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological outcomes that will be assessed at baseline and 6 months postoperatively include quality of life (SF-36), depression (BDI-II, PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), alcohol use (AUDIT), distress tolerance (DTS), emotional eating (EOQ), and eating self-efficacy (WEL). All questionnaires are validated and possess good psychometric properties. All measures except the SF-36 are currently given as routine practice during psychological evaluations of bariatric patients, enhancing feasibility for the current study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resolution of medical comorbidities</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Resolution rates of comorbidities will be assessed 6 months post-surgery defined as follows: diabetes as no longer requiring medication and A1C level &lt;7, hypertension as no longer requiring medication and blood pressure of &lt;140 mm Hg (systolic)/90 mm Hg (diastolic). Patients are typically seen at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively in the surgery clinic and 3 and 6 months in Endocrinology, therefore percentage of follow-up will be calculated as appointments attended/appointments scheduled. Time from initial evaluation until surgery will also be assessed as a possible covariate.</description>
