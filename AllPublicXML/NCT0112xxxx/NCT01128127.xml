    <textblock>
      Background

      Despite the low prevalence of serious complications associated with non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use, there is a widespread use of gastroprotective proton
      pump inhibitors (PPIs) in order to prevent adverse effects. Inappropriate prescribing of PPIs
      includes overprescribing for inappropriate indications and the misuse of first choice in
      their class in terms of efficacy, safety and cost. A series of recommendations, based on the
      best available scientific evidence, has been established to justify prophylaxis with PPIs
      associated to NSAIDs. Therefore, there is the need to encourage the incorporation of this
      knowledge to guide decisions of physicians with the objective of improving patient health and
      sustainability of the Public Health Service. Although since long ago there is a great concern
      regarding rational use of drugs, the available evidence for the most appropriate strategies
      to improve prescribing is scarce. Passive dissemination of research findings are generally
      ineffective and at best result in small changes in practice. Multifaceted intervention
      targeting different barriers to change are more likely to be effective than single
      intervention.

      Objectives

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two educational multifaceted
      strategies aimed at improving PPIs prescription associated to NSAIDs use in primary care. We
      will also compare the cost-effectiveness of such strategies.

      Hypothesis

      It is hypothesized that a quality improvement intervention directed to primary care
      physicians will decrease inappropriate PPIs prescriptions associated to NSAIDs prescription.

      Methodology

      A three-arm prospective quasi-randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of two
      strategies for improving PPI prescription associated to NSAID in primary care context. Three
      of the Canary Islands will be selected and randomized to either a experimental multifaceted
      intervention (group education+audit-feedback+CCDSS) group, a experimental multifaceted
      intervention (audit-feedback+CCDSS) group, or a control group (usual intervention). From each
      of these islands, 6-8 primary care centers will be randomly selected to received the
      intervention practices. All family physicians working at each randomly selected primary care
      center were mandatorily included. Primary outcome measure is reduction of inappropriate PPI
      prescription. The efficacy of the intervention will be examined within a 3, 6 and a 12 month
      follow up.

    <description>Psycho-educational group workshop: two theory-practice sessions on both evidence-based guidelines on PPI-NSAID prescription and communication and negotiation skills to deal with patients. All participants will fill out an initial questionnaire concerning prescribing patterns and barriers to appropriate prescription. All attendees will be given a reminder printed material designed to give the necessary information in a brief fashion and for maximal visual impact.
Audit-Feedback: participants will receive, monthly and by e-mail, an individualized report with data of their own appropriate/inappropriate PPI prescriptions and avoidable costs.
CCDSS: interactive computer program designed to assist physicians with decision making when prescribing PPI associated to NSAID. It consists in pop-up alert screens that aim to influence prescription choice according to each patient characteristics and evidence-based clinical guidelines.</description>

    <description>Usual intervention includes:
Compulsory attendance both to courses (10-12 hours) and to short sessions (around 30 min.) on the rational use of drugs held in groups and during working hours. Each primary care physician attends to 1-2 courses and 3-4 short sessions per year.
Every three months, physicians receive a feedback paper with information on his/her own prescribing overall costs comparing to his/her primary care center average cost.
Distribution of a printed booklet of recommendations, delivered personally or through mass mailings, on the prescribing of PPI-NSAID.</description>
