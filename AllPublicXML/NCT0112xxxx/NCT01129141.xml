      This study continues the investigators' efforts to develop tinnitus management protocols for
      Veterans. More specifically, this study developed and evaluated an adaptation of Progressive
      Tinnitus Management (PTM) for use as a telephone-based program for Veterans and military
      personnel who have experienced TBI. This adaptation, called Tele-PTM, is a telephone-based
      program and has the potential of providing needed tinnitus services to Veterans with and
      without TBI for a relatively small cost and with minimal impact on individual VA hospitals.

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is strongly associated with tinnitus. Tinnitus management for
      Veterans and military members with TBI has become a critical concern. The investigators'
      research has focused on developing effective, evidence-based methods of tinnitus management
      for Veterans. These efforts led to the development of Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM).
      The investigators completed a pilot study to adapt PTM to meet the unique tinnitus management
      needs of Veterans and military members with TBI using a novel home-based telehealth program
      called Tele-PTM. Preliminary data analyses indicated that Tele-PTM is effective. The present
      study modified the PTM program in accordance with pilot study findings and evaluated Tele-PTM
      using a randomized clinical trial design.

      The 4-year study was based at the VA National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research
      (NCRAR). Tele-PTM was implemented and evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Qualified
      candidates were randomized to receive either Tele-PTM or Wait-List Control (WLC). All
      subjects completed questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline.
      The WLC group received Tele-PTM after completing the 6-month questionnaires. The primary
      outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI).

      Tele-PTM involves a series of seven telephone appointments, conducted at approximately 1, 2,
      3, 4, and 5 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after enrollment is finalized. Telephone education was
      provided by the Study Psychologist at weeks 1, 3, and 5, and month 6; and by the Study
      Audiologist at weeks 2 and 4, and month 3.

      Tele-PTM has the potential of providing needed tinnitus services to Veterans and active
      military personnel across the country for a relatively small cost and with minimal impact on
      individual VA hospitals.

    <description>The TFI served as the primary outcome measure. The TFI is a 25-item self-report questionnaire that has documented validity both for scaling the severity and negative impact of tinnitus, and for measuring treatment-related changes in tinnitus (responsiveness) (Meikle et al., 2012). The total score for the TFI ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater problems with tinnitus. The TFI has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .97) and high test-retest reliability (r = .86) (Meikle et al., 2012). The authors of the TFI estimated that a 13-point decrease on the TFI for an individual is likely to reflect a change that feels meaningful to the person.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Potential participants (candidates) were referred to the study by fliers posted at U.S. VA and Military sites. Civilians were not actively recruited for the study, but some discovered it via clinicaltrials.gov or by word of mouth. Candidates contacted the study team and were screened for potential eligibility over the phone.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Candidates must have had a hearing test within the previous 2 years. They were required to get hearing aids if recommended and wear them for at least 1 month before entering the study. Consented candidates were assessed for phone counseling suitability. If current suicidal ideation (SI) was expressed, the subject was excluded from the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Tinnitus Functional Index</title>
        <description>The TFI served as the primary outcome measure. The TFI is a 25-item self-report questionnaire that has documented validity both for scaling the severity and negative impact of tinnitus, and for measuring treatment-related changes in tinnitus (responsiveness) (Meikle et al., 2012). The total score for the TFI ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater problems with tinnitus. The TFI has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .97) and high test-retest reliability (r = .86) (Meikle et al., 2012). The authors of the TFI estimated that a 13-point decrease on the TFI for an individual is likely to reflect a change that feels meaningful to the person.</description>

Telephone education was provided by the Study Psychologist at weeks 1, 3, and 5, and month 6; and by the Study Audiologist at weeks 2 and 4, and month 3.</description>
