  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The total number of military personnel is over 3.5 million and approximately 43% have
      children. The deployment cycle can be associated with depression, anxiety, and behavior
      problems in children as well as psychological distress in the military spouse. Further, the
      health of family members can affect the physical and psychological functioning of the
      military service member during the deployment and re-integration periods. While research and
      federal funding has been dedicated toward developing treatments for the returning service
      member, intervention protocols for mental health problems in the children of military
      families have not been tested. In collaboration with the Family Readiness Program of the
      Rhode Island National Guard &amp; Reserves, the purpose of this proposal is to develop a
      cognitive behavioral treatment protocol for adolescents experiencing depression, anxiety,
      and/or behavior problems associated with the deployment and re-integration phases of the
      military deployment cycle. This protocol will be created by modifying an NIH funded cognitive
      behavioral protocol for the treatment of adolescent mental health problems with initial
      demonstrated efficacy (PI, C. Esposito-Smythers). There are three primary aims in this
      project: 1) develop the manualized intervention protocol for adolescents experiencing mental
      health problems associated with the deployment cycle; 2) refine and pilot the intervention
      protocol with 12 families; and 3) test the intervention in a randomized pilot trial. To
      accomplish these aims, a two step sequence of treatment development is proposed. Stage Ia
      includes initial manual development, focus groups, therapist training, and an open pilot
      trial. Stage Ib includes a randomized pilot trial. Seventy-two adolescents and their
      caretakers will be enrolled through the Rhode Island Family Readiness program and randomly
      assigned to the experimental intervention or non-directive supportive therapy for their
      outpatient care. The experimental intervention includes 12 adolescent group sessions which
      address depression, anxiety, and behavior problems associated with the deployment cycle and
      12 parent group sessions that address stress management and parenting skills. The
      non-directive supportive therapy condition includes 12 adolescent and 12 parent group
      sessions which involve patient initiated discussions focused on issues surrounding military
      deployment and re-integration. Outcome will be assessed at post-treatment and 3 month
      follow-up. The long term objective of this research is to yield an effective outpatient
      intervention for teens of military service members experiencing mental health problems
      associated with the deployment and re-integration phases of the deployment cycle.

    <description>The CBT group therapy protocol will teach adolescents coping, cognitive restructuring, and affect regulation skills to remediate skills deficits that underlie depression, anxiety, and behavior problems associated with the deployment cycle. Parents will also learn stress management and parenting skills in their own group therapy sessions that occur as the same time as the adolescent group.</description>
