    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bevacizumab works in treating patients with
      recurrent or progression meningiomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent or progressive benign
      and atypical/malignant meningiomas, despite prior therapy, as measured by six-month
      progression-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the response rate and overall-survival in this patient population.

      II. To evaluate the safety profile of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent meningiomas.

      III. To perform an exploratory study in patients with hemangioblastoma and
      hemangiopericytoma.

      IV. To assess tissue for VEGF and VEGFR to correlate with response. An exploratory analysis
      of HER-2 will be performed.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks for 6 months. Patients may
      then receive bevacizumab IV every 3 weeks for up to 12 months. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
