  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain kind of neurosurgical procedures require intraoperative alertness of the patient, for
      example to perform speech tests during brain tumor resection. With respect to anaesthesia, it
      is therefore required that the patient is asleep during the beginning and the end of the
      procedure, however fully awake in between. To do so, the anaesthetic propofol is used and an
      accurate knowledge of its pharmacokinetic and -dynamic (pk/pd) parameters is required to
      optimally control anaesthesia. However, diverse pk/pd-parameter sets have been described in
      the literature.

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether the pk/pd model proposed by Marsh et al. or by
      Schnider et al. more accurately describe the pk/pd of propofol during awake craniotomy.

    <description>On the day of surgery, plasma samples will be drawn during induction, maintenance and recovery from anesthesia. Subsequently the actually measured propofol plasma concentration will be compared with the predicted propofol plasma concentration (according to Marsh et al. and Schnider et al.), and the prediction error will be calculated.</description>
