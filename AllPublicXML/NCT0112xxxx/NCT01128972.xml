    <measure>Adjusted Mean Percent Net Erosion Resistance (NER) of Enamel Specimens Exposed to Test Dentifrice + Test MR Relative to: 1) Test Dentifrice+ Sterile Water Rinse 2) Reference Dentifrice+ Sterile Water Rinse 3) Placebo Dentifrice+ Sterile Water Rinse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hours post treatment in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Enamel specimens were exposed to dietary erosive challenge and set of five indentations within each specimen was measured. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine NER which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent NER was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Smaller the negative NER, better is treatment regimen in imparting resistance to enamel.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Percentage Surface Microhardness (SMH) Recovery of Enamel Specimens Exposed to Test Dentifrice + Test MR Relative to: 1)Test Dentifrice+Sterile Water Rinse 2)Reference Dentifrice+Sterile Water Rinse 3)Placebo Dentifrice+ Sterile Water Rinse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hours post treatment in each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1-R)/ (E1-B)]*100.</description>

          <title>Test Dentifrice + Test Mouth Rinse (MR)</title>
          <description>Participants were administered with treatment regimen comprising of test sodium fluoride (NaF) dentifrice [containing 1450 parts per million (ppm) fluoride (F) as NaF and potassium nitrate (KNO3)] and test NaF (450ppmF) MR. The treatment regimen included application of 1.5 gram (g) test NaF dentifrice to a wet study toothbrush, brushing for 25 seconds to create dentifrice slurry, swished the slurry around the mouth for one minute. After one minute, participants expectorated the slurry and rinsed the mouth with tap water. One hour later, the participants rinsed the mouth with 15mL of test MR for one minute.</description>

        <description>Enamel specimens were exposed to dietary erosive challenge and set of five indentations within each specimen was measured. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine NER which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent NER was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Smaller the negative NER, better is treatment regimen in imparting resistance to enamel.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Percentage Surface Microhardness (SMH) Recovery of Enamel Specimens Exposed to Test Dentifrice + Test MR Relative to: 1)Test Dentifrice+Sterile Water Rinse 2)Reference Dentifrice+Sterile Water Rinse 3)Placebo Dentifrice+ Sterile Water Rinse</title>
        <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1-R)/ (E1-B)]*100.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Mean Percentage Surface Microhardness (SMH) Recovery of Enamel Specimens Exposed to Test Dentifrice + Test MR Relative to: 1)Test Dentifrice+Sterile Water Rinse 2)Reference Dentifrice+Sterile Water Rinse 3)Placebo Dentifrice+ Sterile Water Rinse</title>
          <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1-R)/ (E1-B)]*100.</description>

        <description>Enamel specimens were exposed to dietary erosive challenge and set of five indentations within each specimen was measured. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine NER which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent NER was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Smaller the negative NER, better is treatment regimen in imparting resistance to enamel.</description>

        <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMH recovery was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1-R)/ (E1-B)]*100.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Percent NER of Enamel Specimens Exposed to Test Dentifrice +Sterile Water Rinse and Reference Dentifrice +Sterile Water Rinse</title>
        <description>Enamel specimens were exposed to dietary erosive challenge and set of five indentations within each specimen was measured. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine NER which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent NER was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100. Smaller the negative NER, better is treatment regimen in imparting resistance to enamel.</description>

          <title>Test Dentifrice + Test MR</title>
          <description>Participants were administered with treatment regimen comprising of test NaF dentifrice [containing 1450ppmF as NaF and KNO3] and test NaF (450ppmF) MR. The treatment regimen included application of 1.5g test NaF dentifrice to a wet study toothbrush, brushing for 25 seconds to create a dentifrice slurry, swished the slurry around the mouth for one minute. After one minute, participants expectorated the slurry and rinsed the mouth with tap water. One hour later, the participants rinsed the mouth with 15mL of test MR for one minute.</description>
