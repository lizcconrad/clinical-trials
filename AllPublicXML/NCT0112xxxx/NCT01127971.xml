    <description>The primary endpoint of this registry trial is collection and analysis of sufficient data to determine 5 and 10-year local recurrence rates for each PBI type used and for the overall Aurora population. The following endpoints will also be reported and analyzed:
Disease Free Survival
Regional Recurrence
Distant Metastasis
Combined Recurrence</description>
