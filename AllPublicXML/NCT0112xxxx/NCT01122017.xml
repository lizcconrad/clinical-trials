    <textblock>
      The present study was conducted among a group of Iranian patients suffering from varus knee
      in order to compare advantages and disadvantages of ROWHTO (Retro-Tubercle Opening Wedge High
      Tibial Osteotomy) technique when compared with previously described approaches of
      opening-wedge osteotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are various methods for correcting varus deformity; therefore the best surgical method
      must be individualized. We concluded that in a varus knee where only correction in the
      coronal plane without patella infra, changes in Q- angle, tibial plateau inclination is all
      that is needed, a retro- tubercle medial opening- wedge osteotomy is the preferred approach.
