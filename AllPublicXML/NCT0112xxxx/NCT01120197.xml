    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness for
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of a 3-month course of exercises for a group of
      postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who has at least one vertebral fracture versus a
      control group (undertaking their usual activities). The course of exercises is devised in
      accordance with methods recommended in &quot;Rehabilitation treatment guidelines in postmenopausal
      and senile osteoporosis&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Public health policies in most European countries are concerned with how to keep older people
      living independently with a qualitatively good life in the community as long as possible.
      Apart from its personal and human cost, osteoporosis is a major public health problem, which
      has an enormous social and economic impact. Osteoporosis(OP) is a common condition among
      older people,and a non-fatal condition that leads more to changes in the quality of life than
      to change in the length of life. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by
      decreased bone mass. The World Health Organization (WHO) Study Group on Osteoporosis has
      defined osteoporosis as &quot;a hip BMD level of more than 2.5 SDs below the mean BMD for young,
      white, adult women&quot;. Using the WHO definition, approximately 30% of postmenopausal women have
      osteoporosis.

      The most common consequences of osteoporosis are fractures. Furthermore the most common
      conditions associated with osteoporosis are back pain, limitations in physical functioning,
      and psychosocial impairment. Thus, the purpose of this study is to record the effect of the
      programme on mobility, balance, the disease-specific and generic health-related quality of
      life for women with osteoporosis and a history of vertebral fractures. The programme consist
      of a three-hour educational session and a three-month course of exercises in accordance with
      guidelines for women with an increased risk of falls and postmenopausal osteoporotic women
      with a history of fractures.

      Our hypothesis that a three-month course of exercises and a three-hour lesson on how to cope
      with osteoporosis will have a significantly positive effect on the generic and
      disease-specific quality of life, as well as the balance and mobility, of elderly (≥60 years)
      women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and a history of vertebral fractures, both 3 months
      after the intervention and after one year.

      The sample would be recruited from the Osteoporosis Outpatient clinic at the Ostfold
      Hospital, Norway and they their body mineral density (BMD) has been measured using
      Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The design of the study is a randomized controlled
      trial and the sample would be randomized to an intervention group or a control group.

      Subjects in the control group are asked to maintain their current lifestyle. No restrictions
      are placed on their exercise activities. Subjects in the intervention group must participate
      in a training course consisted of 24 sessions over 3 months. The exercises include aerobic,
      stretching, balance and functional training, i.e. circuit exercises focus been on: the
      prevention of falls and fractures, improving balance and coordination, improving posture, and
      informing subjects about risk factors for falls and for osteoporosis and fractures.

      A 3-hour session of information and supervision will be hold for the intervention group by
      the same physiotherapist who leads the training sessions. The focus is on body awareness and
      ergonomic advice in specific, daily-life situations (e.g. lifting/carrying, resting
      positions).

    <description>The maximum distance in centimetres that can be reached forward in a standing position while maintaining a fixed base of support. Subjects will be instructed to stand sideways against a wall in a natural position and stretch one arm forward level with the shoulder. The position of the third metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint was taken as the zero point. With the body tilted forward as far as possible, the subjects continued to stretch the arm parallel to the ground.

    <description>Quality of Life Questionnaire issued by the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41), is a disease-specific questionnaire to be used by patients with vertebral fractures attributed to osteoporosis. QUALEFFO-41 is self-administered and contains questions in five domains: pain, ability to perform physical functions, social functioning, general health perception and mental performance. These five domains can be evaluated individually or be represented in a total score. All scores in all the domains are expressed in values ranging from 0-100, where 0 represents the best and 100 the worst. The total QALEFFO score is calculated as a sum of all answers to items and then linearly transformed on the scale 0-100.
High scores indicate poor quality of life.</description>

GHQ-20 is self-administered and the answers to each item may be treated as a &quot;Likert Scale&quot; and have weights assigned to each position (0-1-2-3) where 0 is no distress, and 3 is severe distress. This gives a possible range for the total GHQ-20 score of 0-60. Higher scores indicating poor qol.</description>

        <description>Quality of Life Questionnaire issued by the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41), is a disease-specific questionnaire to be used by patients with vertebral fractures attributed to osteoporosis. QUALEFFO-41 is self-administered and contains questions in five domains: pain, ability to perform physical functions, social functioning, general health perception and mental performance. These five domains can be evaluated individually or be represented in a total score. All scores in all the domains are expressed in values ranging from 0-100, where 0 represents the best and 100 the worst. The total QALEFFO score is calculated as a sum of all answers to items and then linearly transformed on the scale 0-100.
High scores indicate poor quality of life.</description>

        <description>GHQ-20 is a generic instrument and registers distress and psychopathology. GHQ-20 is self-administered and the answers to each item may be treated as a “Likert Scale” and have weights assigned to each position (0-1-2-3) where 0 is no distress, and 3 is severe distress. This gives a possible range for the total GHQ-20 score of 0-60. Higher scores indicating poor qol.</description>

            <description>Subjects in the intervention group must participate in a training course consisted of 24 sessions over 3 months. The exercises include aerobic, stretching, balance and functional training, i.e. circuit exercises focus been on: the prevention of falls and fractures, improving balance and coordination, improving posture, and informing subjects about risk factors for falls and for osteoporosis and fractures. A 3-hour session of information and supervision will be hold for the intervention group by the same physiotherapist who leads the training sessions. The focus is on body awareness and ergonomic advice in specific, daily-life situations (e.g. lifting/carrying, resting positions).</description>
