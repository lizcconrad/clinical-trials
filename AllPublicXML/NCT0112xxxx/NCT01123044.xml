    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess if transplantation of cultivated corneal epithelial stem
      cells could restore vision in patients with severe ocular surface disorder with a favourable
      safety profile that warrants further comparative study.

      Objectives:

      Efficacy:

      To determine the efficacy of cultivated corneal epithelial stem cells as a treatment for
      patients with severe ocular surface disorder.

      The corneal limbal epithelial stem cell transplant (CLET) successful outcome will be measured
      by improvement of vision, maintenance of corneal re-epithelisation with absence of recurrence
      of surface disease and subjective improvement of symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant females between 18 and 75 years of age.

          2. Written informed consent obtained from patient or parents/guardian.

          3. Patients with unilateral limbal stem deficiency 2-12 months presenting with any of the
             following

               -  Conjunctivalisation

               -  Absence of limbal palisades of Vogts

               -  Stippled appearance of cunjunctivalised cornea with loss of palisades of Vogt

               -  Recurrent and persistent epithelial defects

               -  Superficial vascularisation, scarring, thick fibrovascular pannus, ulceration,

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with any of the following are not eligible for enrollment into the study:

          1. Pregnant or nursing woman or women of childbearing potential except if

          2. Participation in any drug trial in which the patient received an investigational drug
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) preceding the screening phase of
             this study.

          3. Those persons directly involved in the conduct of the study.

          4. Any history of severe infection such as hepatitis, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine
             or neurological disease.

          5. Evidence of corneal stromal scarring, cataract, macular oedema or scarring, retinal
             detachment and conjunctival keratinisation

          6. Positive for HIV, Hepatitis B, C and VDRL

          7. History of Pulmonary tuberculosis, hepatitis B,

          8. History of alcohol or substance abuse

          9. History of malignancy within previous 5 years

         10. History of organ transplant

         11. Any serious medical conditions or disability, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, would interfere with treatment or assessment or preclude completion of
             this study.
