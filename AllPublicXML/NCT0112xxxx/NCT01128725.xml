  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta amyloid immunoreactivity is probably due to a significant number of Ab catabolites
      corresponding to N-terminally truncated and Cterminally truncated or extended forms which
      display distinct propensity to aggregation. Very few things are known concerning the
      mechanisms and proteases by which they are generated. Furthermore, the link between
      truncation and toxicity has not been delineated.

      Finally, little is known concerning Ab fragments in biological fluids and whether they could
      be seen as early biomarkers and thereby, as putative targets for AD diagnostic. The present
      project will allow to examine the human biological samples and to identify various cohorts
      after complete clinical evaluation.

    <description>Secondly, the availability of truncated fragments designed to set up monoclonal antibodies will allow us to estimate their associated toxicity in various cellular models. Furthermore, we will be able to compare the toxicity of soluble monomers and aggregates. Third, we expect to determine the content of these Ab species in the biological fluids of various representative non-demented or AD affected patients.</description>

    <description>The patients coming in consultation for a mnésique complaint will see each other offering the study. During a consultation, the following balance sheet will be accomplished :clinical Maintenance, collection of records and used treatments
psycho-behaviour Valuation through Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and through Inventory Apathy
Valuation of self-government in the activities of daily life (IADL). Further to this balance sheet, it is habitually offered on the subjects of advice (principally centered on the proposals of use of external helps for instance book memo, agenda and internal assistants medium notes-techniques and associations to keep information) and a new consultation 1 year afterwards including the same balance sheet.
In a supplementary way in this clinical valuation, a blood sample will be accomplished at the time of inclusion and 12 months afterwards.</description>
