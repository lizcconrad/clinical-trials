  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Network Support project is part of an ongoing effort to improve treatment for alcohol
      dependent patients. The Network Support Project is designed to help patients change their
      social network from one that reinforces drinking behavior to one that reinforces sobriety.

      160 patients will be assigned to one of two treatments. Each of the treatments will last 12
      weeks. The first is a Network Support (NS) treatment designed to help patients develop new
      acquaintances and social networks. It is expected that alcohol dependent patients will
      benefit from increasing their contact with non-drinking people. This NS condition will be
      compared to a packaged CBT program for alcoholics (PCBT) that is designed to teach a number
      of skills to help people stop drinking, but does not address social networks per se.

      In order to better understand what is happening to the investigators patients, the
      investigators will be using daily computerized telephone calls to ask about people's
      experiences. This will be done both before and after treatment. Patients will also be asked
      to participate in follow-up interviews every 3 months for 2 years following the end of
      treatment.

    <description>Network Support treatment is aimed at helping patients change their social support network so that it supports abstinence. In this treatment patients will be encouraged to attend AA meetings and engage in other activities that would involve non-drinkers. These activities would be determined by the patient, with help from the therapist. Patients would learn about methods of avoiding drinking, making new friends, and getting enjoyment from activities other than drinking. In addition patients will learn specific skills intended to help them make new acquaintances and change their circle of friends.</description>
