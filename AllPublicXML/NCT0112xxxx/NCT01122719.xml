    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Janus OPTIMA Tacrolimus-Eluting Stent (Optima TES,
      CID) for the treatment of de novo coronary lesions when associated with short-term (two
      months) dual antiplatelet (aspirin + clopidogrel) regimen.

    <textblock>
      The present study is a post-market, prospective, international, two-center, single arm study
      involving 60 patients with single, de novo non-complex coronary lesions.

      Enrolled patients will be asked to return for follow-up clinical evaluation at 1, 6, 12 and
      24 months. At 3 months there will be an additional follow-up by phone contact.

      Furthermore, the first 15 patients should undergo angiographic and OCT follow-up at two
      months. The remaining 45 patients should undergo angiographic and IVUS follow-up at 8 months.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    slow inclusion, due to difficulties in obtaining the patients consent for the 2 months invasive
    follow-up, as required by protocol design.
