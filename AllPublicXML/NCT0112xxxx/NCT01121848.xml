  <brief_summary>

      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate that the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Leucovorin (LV)
      will improve the Progression-Free Survival (PFS). Progression is based on RECIST (Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria or death

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate other measures of tumor responses, safety, quality of life (QoL), and health
      utility assessment.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the 3 months of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of disease progression or death from any cause.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is based on RECIST criteria and is the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence, i.e. progressive disease (PD) is determined by RECIST criteria or death</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Controlled Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is also based on RECIST criteria and is defined as the percentage of patients who have a CR, PR or stable disease (SD)</description>

    <measure>Median Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
