      The objective of this study was to explore the efficacy, dose-response and safety of PG201
      tablet in Korean patients with osteoarthritis.

    <textblock>
      In this study, the PG201 extract, the study drug, was administered twice daily after a meal
      to two investigational groups, the lower-dose group and the higher-dose group. The efficacy
      of each of dose group was compared to that of the control group to determine if there was a
      statistically significant difference between the investigational groups and the placebo
      group. In addition, the efficacy between the lower dose group and the high dose group was
      also compared to determine if there was a statistically significant difference.
