    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and pharmacokinetics of Cefazolin 2g
      for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in the DUPLEX® Drug Delivery System to Cefazolin
      1.5g for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in daily doses of 6g in healthy adult
      subjects for 11 days of administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B. Braun Medical Inc. intends to conduct human PK studies and obtain marketing approval for
      Cefazolin 2g in the United States with identical indications of those already approved for
      the 1g strength. A pharmacokinetic study will be conducted with the Cefazolin 2g product
      manufactured by B. Braun Medical Inc. Cefazolin 1.5g dose will be prepared using 10g
      Cefazolin pharmacy bulk with 5% Dextrose. The clinical study proposed in this protocol is
      designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 2g and 1.5g Cefazolin in Dextrose
      in healthy subjects at the maximum recommended infusion dose of 6g per day per FDA's
      recommendation.

      The study is designed to simulate clinical practice and overall experience with cephalosporin
      administration. Cefazolin may be reconstituted with dextrose (or a number of other diluents
      as recommended in the innovator's package insert) in order to achieve an osmolality
      appropriate for intravenous infusion.

      According to B. Braun's approved package insert for Cefazolin 1g, the maximum dose of 1.5g
      Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is 1.5 grams every 6 hours for severe,
      life-threatening infections. In rare instances, doses of up to 12 grams of Cefazolin per day
      have been used. Lower doses are stated in the B. Braun package insert.
