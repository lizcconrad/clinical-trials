  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of ultrasound imaging techniques in regional anaesthesia is rapidly becoming an area
      of increasing interest. It represents one of the largest changes that the field of regional
      anaesthesia has seen. For the first time, the operator is able to view an image of the target
      nerve directly, guide the needle under real-time observation, navigate away from sensitive
      anatomy, and monitor the spread of local anaesthetic (LA).The key to successful regional
      anaesthesia is deposition of LA accurately around the nerve structures.

      In the past, electrical stimulation which relied on surface landmark identification, was used
      for this. However, landmark techniques have limitations; variations in anatomy and nerve
      physiology , as well as equipment accuracy have had an effect on success rates and
      complications.

      However, alongside the enthusiasm of ultrasound guidance in regional anaesthesia, there
      should be a degree of informed scepticism. The widespread use of the various techniques of
      ultrasound-guided regional blocks without adequate training raises the danger of malpractice
      and subsequent impaired outcome.

      Adequate education in the use of regional block techniques under ultrasound guidance is
      essential. Recent technical developments have achieved higher ultrasound frequencies and
      better image resolution, as well as better post-processing and user-friendliness.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether new technical features such as reference
      images, higher ultrasound frequencies, better image resolution and smaller size and weight of
      the ultrasound probes may improve outcome (clinical benefits) and may show an increased
      efficacy and safety. And if the new technology of ultrasound images improves the training
      quality of trainees and novices in the art of ultrasound-guided blocks.
