      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the Hansen Medical
      Sensei Robotic System and Artisan Catheter when used to robotically manipulate RF ablation
      catheters for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeats
      originating in the upper chambers of the heart).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be treated with an RF ablation
      catheter and Artisan guide catheters controlled by the Sensei X Robotic Catheter System.

      Subject will be followed for a period of one year post ablation procedure.

      Follow up visit time frames will be conducted at 7-day, 30-day, 90-day, 180-day and 365-day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who have had two or more spontaneously
             terminating episodes of atrial fibrillation, that last longer than 30 seconds and
             shorter than 7 days, in the nine months prior to enrollment. At least one episode must
             be documented with EKG, TTM, Holter monitor, or telemetry.

          2. Failure of at least one Class I - IV anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) for PAF as evidenced
             by recurrent symptomatic PAF, or intolerable side effects due to AADs. AADs are
             defined in Appendix B.

          3. Signed informed consent.

          4. Age 18 years or older

          5. Able and willing to comply with all pre-, post-, and follow-up testing and
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Atrial fibrillation secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or reversible
             or non-cardiac cause.

          2. Previous ablation for atrial fibrillation.

          3. Atrial fibrillation episodes that last less than 7 days and are terminated by
             cardioversion.

          4. Previous valvular cardiac surgery procedure.

          5. Cardiac artery bypass graft procedure within the previous 180 days.

          6. Previous septal defect repair.

          7. Expecting cardiac transplantation or other cardiac surgery within the next 180 days.

          8. Coronary PTCA/stenting within the previous 180 days.

          9. Documented left atrial thrombus on ultrasound imaging (TEE).

         10. Documented history of a thrombo-embolic event within the previous 365 days.

         11. Diagnosed atrial myxoma.

         16. Women who are pregnant.

         17. Acute illness or active infection at time of index procedure documented by either
             pain, fever, drainage, positive culture and/or leukocytosis (WBC &gt; 11,000 mm3) for
             which antibiotics have been or will be prescribed.

         18. Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl (or &gt; 221 µmol/L).

         23. Contraindication to anticoagulation medications.

         24. Contraindication to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging procedures.

         25. Life expectancy less than 1 year.

         26. Enrollment in another investigational study.

         27. Uncontrolled heart failure (NYHA class III or IV heart failure).

         28. Presence of an intramural thrombus, tumor, or other abnormality that precludes
             catheter introduction or positioning.

         29. Presence of a condition that precludes vascular access.

         30. Left atrial size ≥ 50mm.

         31. INR greater than 3.0 within 24 hours of procedure.
