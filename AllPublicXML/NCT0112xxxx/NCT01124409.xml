      This study aims to study the impact image guided radiotherapy with Cone beam CT will have on
      the outcomes(toxicities and response) of head and neck cancer when compared to 3D conformal
      radiotherapy without CBCT based setup error verification.Also,the various dosimetric
      variations in Adaptive RT will be studied.

      Aims and Objectives

        1. To assess the patient's radiation dose planning for GTV, CTV and PTV for primary and
           nodal regions and derive comparison between IGRT and 3D-CRT.

        2. To assess the dosimetric variation in different phases of adaptive RT due to changes in
           tumor shape and volume during the course of entire treatment in IGRT arm in head and
           neck cancer patients.

        3. To evaluate the optimal setup correction methodology using planar (EPID) and volumetric
           images (CBCT) in HNSCC between 3D-CRT and IGRT treatment delivery respectively.

        4. To compare the early tumour response and acute and chronic radiation morbidities between
           IGRT and 3D-CRT.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>compare the early tumour response between 3DCRT and IGRT in head and neck cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment at post RT week, 1 month after completion of RT and 6 month after completion of RT. Final assessment of last recruited patient is anticipated to be by AUGUST 2011</time_frame>
    <description>The advent of CBCT has increased the verification of Radiation treatment delivery but whether it leads to significant change in tumour response or toxicities when compared to 3D Conformal Radiotherapy without CBCT verification is not known.This study will give insights into this question.</description>

    <description>Assessment will be done by RTOG scoring criteria</description>
