      This open label randomised controlled study will evaluate the induction of immunity following
      varying schedules of vaccination with glyco-conjugate Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C
      (MenC) vaccines in infancy. 498 infants will be enrolled in this multi-centre trial.
      Participants will receive either 0, 1, or 2 priming doses of a MenC-CRM197 conjugate vaccine
      or 1 priming dose of a MenC-TT conjugate vaccine in the first year of life, with all groups
      receiving a dose of a combination Hib-MenC-TT vaccine at 12 months, as well as all other
      concurrent routine vaccinations. All groups will also be further divided into 2 groups to
      receive their routine vaccines in either consistent or alternating limbs to assess the immune
      response to the concurrent infant routine immunisations administered in consistent versus
      alternating limbs. Immune responses will be assessed at 5, 12, 12months +6 days, 13 and 24
      months of age.

             history and clinical examination

          -  Parents or guardians who are willing for their child to participate and who would be
