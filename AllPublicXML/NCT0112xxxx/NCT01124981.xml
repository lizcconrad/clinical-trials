      Fibrinogen concentrate is increasingly used in cardiac surgery to reverse coagulopathy.
      Whether its use reduces blood loss, transfusion and occurrence of clinical adverse events
      remains unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibrinogen concentrate is increasingly used in surgical patients suffering excessive bleeding
      refractory to conventional hemostasis treatment. However, these studies published so far
      comprise small study groups with questionable study designs.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether fibrinogen concentrate reduces blood loss and
      transfusion in patients undergoing elective complex cardiac surgery.

      By choosing the domain of complex cardiac surgery which is prone for excessive blood loss and
      transfusion, we will focus on subjects undergoing high risk procedures. Hereby we hypothesize
      that administration of fibrinogen concentrate improves hemostasis in patients experiencing
      microvascular bleeding during complex cardiac surgery. This improvement of the hemostasis is
      measured by reduced blood loss and transfusion of blood products during surgery and the
      postoperative period.

      Furthermore, we hypothesize that fibrinogen concentrate is safe and well tolerated in
      patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery. This hypothesis will be investigated by a
      detailed study of clinical outcomes.

      Update regarding interim-analysis:

      On 09 August 2013 an interim-analysis was performed as described in the protocol. The outcome
      was discussed during the Steering Committe of 09 October 2013. During that meeting, based on
      the results of the interim-analysis, the continuation of the current study was ordered.
