      This 12-month study is for spouses or significant others of service members who have returned
      from Afghanistan or Iraq. This study will determine if participating in a telephone
      discussion group, offering education, skills building, and support, will help increase
      post-deployment adjustment. There will be 225 spouses recruited for this study.

    <description>Each telephone discussion group will meet 12 times during six months. The one-hour calls will be semi-structured conference calls with education, training in coping skills and cognitive restructuring, and support. A Participant Workbook will include comprehensive materials for all sessions and topics, other resources, and red flag resources - areas that may exacerbate problems, add a level of difficulty or distress, and/or indicate a need for referrals (e.g., unsafe behaviors, substance abuse, spouse abuse, PTSD, depression, traumatic brain injury).</description>
