      The purpose of this study is planned to investigate whether frequently inhaled hypertonic
      saline (HS) can relieve symptoms and signs faster than normal saline (NS) and shorten length
      of stay (LOS) significantly for moderately to severely ill infants with bronchiolitis without
      apparent adverse effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of bronchiolitis remains largely supportive with mechanical ventilatory support
      as needed .Other types of treatment remain controversial.We and other researchers have
      demonstrated that nebulized HS and bronchodilators decreased symptoms and LOS for infants
      with mild to moderate viral bronchiolitis .All the aforementioned studies used 3 times per
      day dosing, which is significantly less than the 3 to 6 times per hour regimens often used in
      children in respiratory distress.Frequently nebulized HS reduced the LOS for infants with
      moderately severe bronchiolitis.The present study is planned to investigate whether
      frequently inhaled HS can relieve symptoms and signs faster than NS and shorten LOS
      significantly for moderately to severely ill infants with bronchiolitis without apparent
      adverse effects.
