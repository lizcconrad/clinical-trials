  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the forehand location for sensor placement has
      less episodes of signal dropout than the finger sensor location. In addition, this study will
      evaluate two finger sensors, which utilize different technology to compare signal quality.

      A comparison study design will be used to evaluate the signal quality of pulse oximetry
      sensors placed in two locations: forehand and finger. Each subject will serve as their own
      control, with measurements of signal quality evaluated at 2 second intervals over a period of
      one hour. The measurements will be recorded simultaneously with a computer program and laptop
      computer. Finger and forehand sensors will be applied according to manufacturer's guidelines.
      An output connection will be made from each pulse oximeter computer unit to a password
      protected, laptop computer for data downloading. Data will be collected for a 1 hour period
      at 2 second increments and stored in the hard drive of the laptop. Following completion of
      data collection, the study sensors will be removed.
