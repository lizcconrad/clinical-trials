  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, single-blinded comparison of two formulations of the rF1V vaccine at
      a single dosage of 80 µg and two 3-dose schedules in 400 healthy, adult volunteers in four
      parallel cohorts. Two rF1V vaccine cohorts (N=160 each) and two rF1V antigen-only cohorts
      (N=40 each) will be vaccinated at two different three-dose schedules (Days 0, 56 and 182 or
      Days 0, 56 and 121).

      The objectives of this trial are: to compare the safety of rF1V vaccine administered in two
      different schedules through 28 days after each vaccination and cumulatively to Day 210; to
      compare the immunogenicity of rF1V vaccine administered in two different schedules through 28
      days after Vaccination 3; to compare the safety and immunogenicity of rF1V vaccine
      administered by two different schedules through 12 months after Vaccination 3; and to assess
      the contribution of the adjuvant to the immunogenicity of the rF1V antigen.
