      The purpose of this research study is to measure the muscles that make up your anal sphincter
      (muscles that control bowel movements) by using ultrasound. The most common way for women to
      injure these muscles is through childbirth. Some physicians think about 30% of women
      delivering their first baby develop some anal sphincter damage, which may or may not lead to
      symptoms such as anal urgency or incontinence (involuntary loss of gas or stool). The purpose
      of the study is to measure muscles in normal women who have never given birth or had an
      injury to their anal sphincter.

      Participants will be asked to complete a one page questionnaire. This questionnaire will
      address whether perineal trauma, sphincter lacerations, anal incontinence, and fecal urgency
      impact the subject on any level. Subjects will also be asked about their bowel habits and
      history of problems with bowel movements. Subjects will then be asked to undergo an
      ultrasound study of the anal sphincter at the time of enrollment. Completing the entire study
      will take no more than 15 minutes. This will be done at the doctor's office. Answering the
      questionnaire will take no more than 5 minutes.

      The endoanal ultrasound is a probe with a diameter equivalent to the index finger. It is
      inserted in the rectum and measures the length and width of the sphincter muscles.

    <description>The subject will be placed in the supine position with their feet in the stirrups and a drape will be used, exposing only the anus and perineum in order to introduce the probe. In order to prevent and minimize any potential discomfort, the lubricated ultrasound probe will be gently inserted into the anal canal up to the anal verge, with minimal manipulation of the probe once inserted. The scan lasts approximately two minutes and the entire exam will take no more than five minutes.</description>
