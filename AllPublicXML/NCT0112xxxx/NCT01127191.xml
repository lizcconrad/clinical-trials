  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Land military missions generally combine prolonged walking/moderate-pace-running and other
      physical actions such as creeping, jumping, shooting,â€¦ which are associated with the direct
      carrying of high to severe loads of equipment and supplies (20-30 to 50 kg) by soldiers. For
      an infantry section, &quot;typical&quot; intervention phases last about 20-24 h and combine variable
      intensity grades. Consequently, military mission characteristics are an interesting
      investigation field of human fatigue. Previous studies have investigated human neuromuscular
      alterations after prolonged &quot;normal&quot; locomotion exercises [Millet et al., 2004, 2009], thus
      the aim of this study is to characterize the neuromuscular determinants of fatigue induced by
      a 24-h Simulated Military Effort (SME) and a 4-h Military Road March (MM), both performed
      with high load carriage. Additionally, the consequences of fatigue on physiological and
      biomechanical parameters of locomotion will be investigated.
