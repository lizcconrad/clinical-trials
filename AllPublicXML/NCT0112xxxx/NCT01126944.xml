  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for heart failure patients is bleak for the advanced stages of the disease,
      with a reported 6-month mortality rate of almost 50% in patients treated with chronic
      inotropic therapy. As well as its very severe prognosis, heart failure is a costly disease.
      Heart transplantation remains the reference treatment for the terminal stage of the disease
      but although this is an effective therapy, it does engender ethical, social, economic and
      legal problems. It also requires irreproachable and costly logistics, immuno-suppressor
      treatment and a lifetime of follow-ups. In particular, the number of donors has been going
      down steadily for several years in most countries which offer a heart transplant programme
      and some patients cannot take advantage of being added to a waiting list for a graft (age,
      co-morbidities…).

      It is in this context that, alongside the medical treatments for cardiac insufficiency, other
      therapeutic strategies were developed, including resynchronization and long-term mechanical
      circulatory support. The progress made in resynchronization is at several levels: better
      understanding of the action mechanisms, the development and improvement of equipment
      specifically dedicated to resynchronization and prospective and randomized clinical trials
      which have scientifically validated this technique.

      Simultaneously, many studies were published evaluating long term support with mechanical
      circulatory support (MCS), excluding light devices, as a bridge to transplant or an
      alternative to a transplant. It is also recognized that mechanical circulatory support with a
      new generation of continuous flow assist device improved the quality of life and functional
      capacity, with a reduced risk of device failure and infrequent need for replacement.

      The &quot;Achilles heel&quot; of cardiac resynchronization remains the 20 to 40% of patients who
      respond barely or not at all. Among this population of patients, some are not candidates for
      a transplantation and long-term mechanical circulatory support by axial pump is an
      alternative to be considered. We elaborated an original randomized pilot study for these
      patients in order to evaluate their survival and their quality of life, to define if they
      should be proposed a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)or not.
