  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the removal of dental biofilm between soft and medium toothbrushes. The
      patients refrained from performing mechanical or chemical plaque control for 96 hours to
      allow dental biofilm accumulation on the tooth surfaces. After the period of dental biofilm
      formation, the quadrants were randomized and the participants brushed different quadrants
      with soft and medium toothbrushes, with or without dentifrice. The plaque indices were
      analyzed by a blinded examiner before and after toothbrushing. The 2Tone was used for plaque
      disclosure and analysis was performed by the Quigley-Hein index modified by Turesky et al.
      (1970).

    <description>All gingival quadrants were analised by photographs made in different experimental times. After that, all photographs were evaluated in a blinded manner, according to the methodology suggested by Danser, et al. (1998), dividing the region to be analyzed in three areas: cervical, interdental and mid-gingival. In each area, the presence of gingival abrasion was assessed dichotomically.</description>

    <description>a randomization was performed in which the participants were allocated to the following experimental procedures: Two quadrants (1 and 3 or 2 and 4) with medium toothbrush Two quadrants with soft toothbrush. All procedures were performed using the same dentifrice. Each quadrant was brushed for 30 seconds by the participant without specific instructions on the technique, under supervision of the person in charge of the randomization.</description>
