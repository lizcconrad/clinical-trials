      The Investigators will test the hypothesis that MGuard net protective stent, the
      investigational device, would be superior to conventional revascularization strategy (i.e.
      bare-metal stenting plus manual thrombectomy), for STEMI patients undergoing urgent
      percutaneous coronary interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Embolization of thrombotic debris still represents a complication for ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

      Distal embolization may decrease coronary and myocardial reperfusion after PCI in STEMI
      setting.

      Unfortunately, intracoronary filters present several important limitations limiting their use
      and their efficacy especially in presence of huge amount of thrombus. In this respect, recent
      trials investigated whether a default manual thrombectomy strategy before stenting would
      ameliorate angiographic as well as clinical outcomes for STEMI patients undergoing
      percutaneous revascularization.

      Of note, the most of embolization occurs when guidewire, and thrombectomy device cross the
      thrombus, and after the stent has been implanted as a consequence of plaque prolapse through
      the stent struts.

      MGuard net protective stent, the investigational device, is a bare-metal stent covered with a
      ultra-thin flexible polyethylene terephthalate (or Dacron) mesh sleeve, that is anchored to
      the external surface of the struts. This biocompatible fiber net (string diameter 10-22 μm)
      has minimal effects on the stents' trackability and deliverability. During stent deployment,
      the net stretches and slides over the expanding stent struts, trapping the thromboembolic
      debris underneath the fiber net and isolating the prothrombotic intima components from the
      blood stream.

      This protocol will test the hypothesis that MGuard stent would be superior to conventional
      revascularization strategy (i.e. bare-metal stenting plus manual thrombectomy), for STEMI
      patients undergoing urgent PCI in terms of angiographic as well as clinical outcomes.
