      Purpose: To compare the change in nasal cell HO-1 expression induced by two different
      preparations of sulforaphane (SFN)-containing nutritional supplements Participants: Healthy
      nonsmoking young adults, age 18-35 Procedures (methods): This pilot study will use a
      randomized crossover design. Subjects will be randomized to receive either the equivalent of
      4 ounces/day of fresh broccoli sprouts (FBS) in food and tea, or the equivalent amount as
      broccoli sprout homogenates (BSH), for 3 consecutive days. Nasal lavage and blood samples
      will be obtained before, during and after this 3-day period. After at least a 2-week washout
      interval, the protocol will be repeated with the alternate supplement. The primary analysis
      will test the hypothesis that broccoli sprouts in food will increase HO-1 expression to a
      similar degree as the equivalent amount of sprouts in BSH

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Broccoli sprouts are a concentrated source of the potent phase 2 enzyme (antioxidant)
      potentiator, sulforaphane (SFN) in the form of its natural precursor, sulforaphane
      glucosinolate (SGSâ„¢). SFN is an isothiocyanate which has generated interest recently as a
      chemopreventive agent in cancer research, and as an antioxidant in inflammation research.
      Recently published data show that 3 days intake of broccoli sprouts in homogenate form is
      followed by significant upregulation of several phase 2 enzymes in nasal cells. Our group's
      research at the UNC Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology (CEMALB)
      focuses on the effects of oxidant pollutants on inflammatory and host defense responses to
      viral infections. One of the aims of our grant is to measure the effects of pre-treatment
      with SFN supplements, on nasal responses to live attenuated influenza virus vaccines. In
      preparation for this larger study, we here propose a pilot study comparing the effects of the
      published BSH supplement, vs. supplementation with foods containing fresh broccoli sprouts,
      on relevant nasal endpoints and serum SFN levels.
