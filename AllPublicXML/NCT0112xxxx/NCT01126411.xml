    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate, if Immunoadsorption of autoantibodies with
      subsequent substitution of immunoglobulins is able to improve haemodynamics in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased pulmonary precapillary vascular resistance due to vasoconstriction and
      vasoproliferative processes is the basic pathophysiological mechanism in the development of
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) production
      of endothelin-1 (ET-1) is increased and elevated ET-1 plasma levels correlate with PH
      severity As recently shown Autoantibodies against the Endothelin-1 Typ A and Angiotensin II
      Typ-1 Receptor, which have a high Incidence in PH-Patients, may also play an important role
      in the pathophysiology of PH (Dandel et al.).

      The concept of this study is that the elimination of these autoantibodies by Immunoadsorption
      with protein A may improve haemodynamics and patient wellbeing. Immunoglobulins are
      substituted after Immunoadsorption to minimize infection risk.
