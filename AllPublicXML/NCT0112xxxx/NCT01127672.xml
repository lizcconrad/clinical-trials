  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to clinically evaluate the efficacy of a
      new treatment for plantar fasciitis. This treatment consists of a platelet rich plasma
      injection into the origin of the plantar fascia. It is thought that plasma rich plasma
      injection will dramatically improve outcomes for patients suffering from plantar fasciitis.

      Subjects will be randomized by choosing a slip of paper from an envelope. This process will
      randomize 25 patients to the experimental group, and 25 patients to the control. The
      experimental group will undergo a blood draw, allowing for an injection of platelet rich
      plasma into the origin of the plantar fascia. The control group will undergo a corticosteroid
      injection into the plantar fascia as the sole treatment. Patients will be followed for three
      months for pain, and will fill out questionnaires at the initial visit prior to receiving the
      injection, as well as six and twelve weeks post injection.

      These questionnaires will give insight into functionality and pain changes that the plantar
      fascia is experiencing due to treatment.

      Subjects will be outpatients. Subjects may include employees, students, minorities, and
      elderly, although no subsets of these will be formed.

      Subjects will be between 18 and 89 years of age.

      In total, subject participation will last approximately 3 months.

    <description>Patients will be asked to fill out 3 questionnaires to provide insight into how their condition is progressing. These questionnaires consist of a visual analog pain score, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society clinical rating system, and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. All these questionnaires are externally validated clinical outcome measures that rate foot and ankle pain and dysfunction on various numerical scales. With the exception of the visual analogue scale pain score, there is a direct relationship to the score and positive patient outcome.</description>

    <description>30 ml of a patient's own blood will be collected via blood draw, maintaining sterile technique. This will then be spun down using a Magellan Autologous Platelet Separator System, yielding platelet rich plasma (PRP).
Under sterile conditions, patients will receive a 3 cc PRP injection (consisting of their own PRP) with 1 cc of 2% lidocaine into the origin of the plantar fascia, administered by an orthopedic surgeon.
This will be done using a plantar approach. A peppering technique spreading in clockwise manner will be used to achieve a more expansive zone of delivery, with a maximum of 10 passes through the fascia itself.
The patient will be monitored for 10 minutes in clinic for adverse reactions.</description>
