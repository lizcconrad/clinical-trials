  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-year study designed to: (1) adapt and refine an existing cognitive-behavioral
      treatment (CBT) intervention to decrease suicidal thoughts and behaviors for use in Substance
      Use Disorder (SUD) treatment settings, and (2) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial
      with 50 patients in treatment for SUDs comparing the CBT intervention to an enhanced control
      condition. Through this pilot randomized controlled trial, the investigators hope to not only
      obtain information about the feasibility of implementing these procedures in residential SUD
      treatment, but to also determine whether this intervention decreases the level of suicidal
      ideation, suicide attempts, hopelessness, and frequency of substance use relative to the
      control condition.

    <textblock>
      Existing research indicates that problematic alcohol and drug use are closely linked to both
      fatal and non-fatal suicide attempts. Given the strong association between substance use and
      suicide, an episode of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment provides a unique opportunity
      to decrease the likelihood of suicidal behaviors. However, there are no data on the
      effectiveness of specific interventions designed to decrease suicidal thoughts and behaviors
      during an episode of SUD treatment in individuals at high risk for suicide. Patients for this
      trial will be screened at the SUD treatment site for a combination of a past suicide attempt
      and current suicidal ideation and will be randomized to CBT or control conditions. All
      participants in the pilot randomized controlled trial will be assessed at baseline, at the
      end of treatment, and at a 3-month follow-up. From a public health perspective, SUD treatment
      programs contain large numbers of patients at high risk for future suicidal behaviors and
      therefore have the potential to play a central role in our nation's efforts to decrease
      suicide.
