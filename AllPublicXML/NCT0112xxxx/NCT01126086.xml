      Primary Objective:

      - To study effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of
      otamixaban.

      Secondary Objective:

      - To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of otamixaban on subjects with mild and moderate
      hepatic impairment and in matched subjects with normal hepatic function.

      The duration of each part of the study for one subject was 28 days of screening, 1 day of
      treatment, with 5 days in the unit (Day -1 to Day 4) and a 8 to 11 days of follow-up after
      start of infusion.
