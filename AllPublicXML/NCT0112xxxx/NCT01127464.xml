  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DCVax-001 is a recombinant protein vaccine designed to prevent and potentially treat human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The vaccine is composed of a fusion protein
      containing a human monoclonal antibody specific for the dendritic cell receptor, DEC-205
      (CD205), and the HIV gag p24 protein. The vaccine is designed to target HIV antigens directly
      to endocytic pathways in dendritic cells (DCs) that allow for efficient processing and
      presentation of multiple HIV peptides on both MHC class I and II products, which will induce
      HIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. This vaccine candidate must be combined with appropriate
      immunostimulants (adjuvants) to induce immunity to the antigen. In the proposed clinical
      trial we will use poly ICLC (Hiltonol) from Oncovir, Inc as the adjuvant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate whether delivery of HIV antigens via immunization with
      anti-DEC-205 p24 monoclonal antibody plus poly ICLC, as an adjuvant, is safe and induces
      either cellular or humoral immunogenicity in healthy volunteers. We propose to assess the
      quality of immunity elicited by DEC targeted vaccines in humans. Immunogenicity after HIV
      antigen delivery directly to dendritic cells could provide the proof-of-concept that
      dendritic cell targeted protein vaccines may serve as a stand-alone vaccine strategy or in
      combination with other vaccine modalities against HIV or other diseases.

      The main hypothesis of this study is to assess the delivery of HIV antigens via immunization
      with anti-DEC-205 p24 monoclonal antibody (DCVax-001) plus poly ICLC (Hiltonol) is safe and
      induces either cellular or humoral immunogenicity in HIV-uninfected, healthy volunteers.
