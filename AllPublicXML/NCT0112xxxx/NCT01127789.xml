  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study motor learning and recovery of patients with brain
      damage caused by traumatic brain injury or stroke with transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS). It is hypothesized that anodal tDCS on the lesion side and/or cathodal
      tDCS on the healthy side of motor cortex could improve the recovery of motor function such as
      learning.

      We aim to apply transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to study the recovery process
      of motor learning on the patients with brain damage caused by traumatic brain injury or
      stroke. Both anodal and cathodal tDCS will be used to test whether the increase of motor
      cortical activity by anodal tDCS over lesional side or the decrease of brain activity by
      cathodal tDCS on healthy side will improve the learning skill (SRTT: serial reaction time
      task). The result could help to understand the mechanism of motor and cognitive recovery
      after brain damage, and further rationalize the application of non-invasive brain stimulation
      such as tDCS for patient rehabilitation.

    <description>Primary outcome measure is the average reaction time of 360 trials from each block -- the task is composed of 8 blocks. After intervention, 3 blocks will be re-tested for 3 times to evaluate the consolidating effect of tDCS on motor learning.</description>
