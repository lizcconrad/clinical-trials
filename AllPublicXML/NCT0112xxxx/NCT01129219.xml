    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled; single-blind parallel group trial carried out with hip
      fracture patients, starting at 12 weeks post fracture. Patients were approached during their
      acute stay in hospital, followed without any extra intervention for 12 weeks, and then
      randomized in a 2:1 manner to either intervention or control for the next 12 weeks. After the
      first 12 weeks intervention the intervention group were divided into two groups and
      randomized to an new single-blind parallel group trial for further intervention.
