  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to test an innovative 8-session intervention, based on Motivational
      Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Skills-Training for the co-occurrence of
      methamphetamine use and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) non-adherence among
      methamphetamine using HIV+ MSM in NYC, compared to an 8-session educational (ED) condition.
      Participants in the intervention condition will report greater reductions in the number of
      days of methamphetamine use and viral load, and greater increases in CD4 counts and
      self-reported and objectively measured adherence than those in the education condition.

    <description>Eight sessions of education with content designed to mirror the information covered in the intervention condition. The content will be as follows: 3 sessions focusing on medication adherence; 3 sessions focusing on the dangers of methamphetamine use; 1 session addressing sexual risk; and 1 session addressing poly-substance use.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Motivational Interviewing + Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The first two sessions will be primarily Motivational Interviewing and begin with an introduction to the nature of treatment, emphasizing the client's autonomy, and explain that the purpose of the sessions is to explore feelings about their medication adherence, meth use, and any other issues, with the eventual goal of working towards any changes the client may wish to make. During the third session, the client will complete an individualized functional analysis of recent occasions when the client missed medication, used MA and/or other substances, and engaged in risky sex (not necessarily all at the same time). Sessions four through seven will focus on Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training for adherence, reducing or stopping meth use, reducing or stopping the combination of meth and other drug use, and avoiding risky sexual behavior. The final session emphasizes maintenance of behavior change and relapse prevention.</description>

    <description>During the first two sessions participants watch the documentary &quot;Rock bottom&quot; to receive information on Crystal Methamphetamine, and the possible interactions between HIV medications and recreational substances. Sessions 3 and 4 focus on the importance of medication adherence, viral replication and mutation, and resistance. Session 5 focuses on the negative effects of several recreational substances as well as the negative effects of mixing substances. Session six discusses HIV stigma, transmission risk sexual behavior, and HIV disclosure. Session 7 revisits medication adherence, focusing on dealing with medication side effects and communicating with health care providers. The final session uses part of the documentary &quot;Meth&quot; which highlights issues of methamphetamine use through interviews with men in various stages of recovery.</description>
