      The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of three exercise programs in patients
      with chronic low back pain: Segmental stabilization, superficial strengthening and
      stretching. Groups were contrasted regarding pain, functional disability and TrA muscle
      activation capacity. The three groups of exercise improved pain and functional disabilities,
      and the Segmental stabilization group was better in the ability to recruit TrA muscle.

      Objective: To contrast the efficacy of three exercise programs, segmental stabilization and
      strengthening of abdominal and trunk muscle and lumbar stretching on pain, functional
      impairment, and activation of the transversus abdominis muscle (TrA), in individuals with
      chronic low back pain.

      Design: Forty-five patients were randomized into three groups namely: Segmental stabilization
      group (ES)(transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus) (n=15, mean age 42,02 ± 8,15),
      superficial strengthening group (FS)(rectus abdominis, oblique abdominal muscles and erector
      spinae muscles) (n=15, mean age 41,71±6,41) and stretching group (AL) (erector spinae,
      posterior connective tissues and ischiotibials muscles) (n=15 mean age 41,53 ± 4,41). Groups
      were contrasted regarding pain (visual analogical scale and McGill pain questionnaire),
      functional disability (Oswestry disability questionnaire) and TrA muscle activation capacity
      (Pressure Biofeedback Unit = PBU). The program lasted 6 weeks, and sessions happened twice a
      week, with duration of 30 minutes each. Analysis of variance was used for inter and
      intragroup comparisons. Significance level was established at 5%.

      Patients attended two weekly sessions during six weeks and were evaluated for pain (visual
      analogue scale and McGill Pain Questionnaire), functional disability (Oswestry disability
      index), and ability to contract the TrA (Pressure biofeedback unit) before and after the
      treatment. The treatment program consisted of 30 minutes sessions. The Anova one-way and
      Tukey´s Post Hoc were used to compare groups. The significance level adopted was 5%.

    <description>Interventions were conducted over 6 weeks, twice per week, lasting 30 minutes each. Sessions were supervised by the investigator, and participants were instructed to report any adverse event. Groups were instructed not to participate in any other physical program during the study. Forty-five patients were randomized into three groups namely: Segmental stabilization group (ES)(transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus), superficial strengthening group (FS)(rectus abdominis, oblique abdominal muscles and erector spinae muscles) and stretching group (AL) (erector spinae, posterior connective tissues and ischiotibials muscles). Patients were evaluated for pain , functional disability,and ability to contract the TrA before and after the treatment.</description>
