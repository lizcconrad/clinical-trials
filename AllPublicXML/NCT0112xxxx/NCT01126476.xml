  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using proton radiotherapy for
      reirradiation of recurrent malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be stratified by treatment site (Head and Neck, Thorax, Abdomen, Pelvis,
      Extremities) and by treatment volume (low volume, high volume) for a total of 10 strata. This
      study will be done in two phases. In the first phase, feasibility will be established using
      the primary objectives set below. The second phase will begin no earlier than 90 days after
      the last patient in the initial phase has completed treatment in each strata and once
      feasibility has been verified. The secondary objectives will serve as the objectives for the
      second phase of the study.

    <measure>Acute Toxicity</measure>

    <description>Acute Toxicity is defined as any grade 4 toxicity observed within 90 days from the initiation of radiotherapy that is felt to be directly related to their proton treatment. Toxicities will be graded by NCI CTC Version 4.0</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>open-ended</time_frame>
    <description>Late toxicity is defined as any grade 3 or higher toxicity observed later than 90 days from start of therapy. Late toxicities will be graded according to the RTOG/EORTC late morbidity scoring system.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed, non-CNS solid malignancies who have been
             previously radiated and have a tumor recurrence in or near prior radiation fields.
             Re-biopsy of the recurrence is not required and left to the discretion of the treating
             physician, although every effort should be made to confirm recurrence.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Status of 60. Life expectancy of 3 months .

          -  Age greater or equal to 18.

          -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent.

          -  Women of child bearing potential as long as she agrees to use a recognized method of
             birth control (e.g. oral contraceptive, IUD, condoms or other barrier methods, etc.)

          -  Hysterectomy or menopause must be clinically documented.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation treatment less than 3 months from planned start of re-irradiation of
             any part of the intended treatment volume.

          -  Pregnant women, women planning to become pregnant and women that are nursing.

          -  Actively being treated on any research study.
