      The purpose of this study is to study the use of neurostimulation in chronic advanced
      refractory heart failure.

      The study is determine if it is safe to use neurostimulation in patients with chronic
      advanced refractory heart failure and to also determine initial observations with regards to
      its potential effect on heart function and quality of life. The investigators hypothesis is
      that this study will show both safe and positive effect of neurostimulation on heart failure
      patients.

      Protocol Summary

      Title EVALUATION OF THE SAFETY OF NEUROSTIMULATION IN PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC HEART FAILURE
      FEASIBILTIY STUDY

      Description A feasibility trial of the use of neurostimulation in chronic advanced refractory
      heart failure.

      Objective To determine the safety of neurostimulation in patients with chronic advanced
      refractory heart failure and to generate initial observations with regards to its potential
      effect on ventricular function and quality of life.

      Design The trial will be a randomized double blind crossover feasibility trial with 2 week
      and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 month clinical follow-up.

      After device implantation, patients enrolled in the trial will have been randomly assigned to
      have device programmed to deliver impulses, active, or to have the device programmed not to
      deliver impulses, inactive, for 3 months.

      After the 3 month initial phase, the devices will be inactivated and a 4 week washout period
      will convene.

      At the end of washout period, patients that were inactive during initial phase will crossover
      to active and similarly patients that were active during initial phase will crossover to
      inactive.

      Patient Population Patients with non-ischemic or ischemic cardiomyopathy with a length of
      illness of at least 6 months who have met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Enrollment Enrollment of a total of 10 intent-to-treat patients Investigational Sites Up to 2
      investigational sites in the US Data Collection Data collection will be obtained in three
      categories: markers of cardiovascular safety, markers of device-device interactions and
      markers of efficacy.

        Inclusion

          1. Male or female ≥18 years;

          2. Chronic heart failure NYHA class III-IV of ischemic and non-ischemic etiology;

          3. Screening Left ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% measured at baseline by
             echocardiography;

          4. Screening 6 minute walk test score of less than 450 meters measured at baseline;

          5. Hospitalization for heart failure or outpatient IV administration of inotropic agents,
             human B-natriuretic peptide or IV diuretics within the past 12 months (stable for at
             least 2 weeks);

          6. On standard optimal medical therapy for CHF before medical therapy.*

          7. No changes in active cardiac medications during the 1 week prior to treatment;

          8. Written informed consent.

               -  Patients with current or prior symptoms of heart failure and reduced LVEF should
                  be on stable optimally uptitrated medical therapy recommended according to
                  current guidelines (Circulation. 2005; 112 (12): e154) as standard of care for
                  heart failure therapy in the United States. This minimally includes an
                  ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I) at stable doses for 1 month prior to enrollment, if
                  tolerated, and a beta blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol)
                  for 3 months prior to enrollment, if tolerated, with a stable up-titrated dose
                  for 1 month prior to enrollment. This also includes an Angiotensin II Receptor
                  Blocker (ARB) at stable doses for 1 month prior to enrollment, if tolerated, when
                  ACE-I is not tolerated. Stable is defined as no more than a 100% increase or a
                  50% decrease in dose. If the patient is intolerant to ACE-I, ARB, or beta
                  blockers, documented evidence must be available. In those intolerant to both
                  ACE-I and ARB, combination therapy with hydralazine and oral nitrate should be
                  considered. Therapeutic equivalence for ACE-I substitutions is allowed within the
                  enrollment stability timelines. Aldosterone inhibitor therapy should be added
                  when NYHA Class III or IV symptoms occur on standard therapy. If aldosterone
                  inhibitor therapy is administered in Class II patients, it must be initiated and
                  optimized prior to enrollment. Eplerenone requires dosage stability for 1 month
                  prior to enrollment. Diuretics may be used as necessary to keep the patient
                  euvolemic.

        Exclusion

          1. Inability to comply with the conditions of the protocol;

             limitations

          3. Presence of a transplanted tissue or organ or LVAD (or the expectation of the same
             within the next 12 months);

          4. Planned AICD or CRT within the next 12 months unless AICD is prescribed for primary
             prevention

          5. Pacemaker dependent patients.

          6. Acute MI, CABG, PTCA, within the past 3 months

          7. Chronic refractory angina or peripheral vascular pain;

          9. Need for chronic intermittent inotropic therapy;

         10. Malignancy: evidence of disease within the previous 5 years;

         11. Known HIV infection or immunodeficiency state;

         12. Chronic active viral infection (such as hepatitis B or C);

         13. Severe systemic infection: defined as patients undergoing treatment with antibiotics;

         14. Active myocarditis or early postpartum cardiomyopathy (within the first 6-months of
             delivery);

         15. Systemic corticosteroids, cytostatics and immunosuppressive drug therapy
             (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, etc.), DNA depleting or
             cytotoxic drugs taken within 4 weeks prior to study treatment;

         16. Patient is pregnant, of childbearing potential and not using adequate contraceptive
             methods, or nursing.;

         17. Patient scheduled for hospice care;

         18. Any other medical, social or geographical factor, which would make it unlikely that
             the patient will comply with study procedures (eg. Alcohol abuse, lack of permanent
