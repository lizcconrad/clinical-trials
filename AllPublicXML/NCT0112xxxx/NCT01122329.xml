  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the brain metabolic effects of AC-1202 (Axona®), a medical food for
      Alzheimer's disease. Subjects who meet entry criteria will undergo H215O positron emission
      tomography prior to and 90 minutes after consumption of Axona® at baseline and then again
      after 45 days of treatment. Cognitive testing will also be conducted at baseline and day 45.
