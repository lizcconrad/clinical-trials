  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common disorder. Despite optimal endoscopic and medical treatment,
      there is a high risk of rebleeding and high mortality. In this study the investigators
      examine whether combined endoscopic haemostasis and angiographic embolization resolves in a
      better outcome than the traditional use of endoscopic haemostasis alone. The study is a
      randomised controlled trail.
