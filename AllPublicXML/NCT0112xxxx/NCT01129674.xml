  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to help answer the following research questions:

      How LY 2140023 can be tolerated by patients with Schizophrenia compared to standard of care
      treatment in 52 weeks time period.

      Whether LY 2140023 can help patients with Schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes 2 treatment periods. Study Period I will begin at patient randomization
      (enrollment into Study HBBO) and continue through the first 2 years of treatment. Study
      Period II will be only for patients randomized to treatment with LY2140023, and will begin
      after the patient has completed the second year of treatment. Patients who qualify for
      enrollment will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio (LY2140023 versus standard of care,
      respectively) into 2 treatment groups: flexible, twice-daily dose of LY2140023 or
      standard-of-care (olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, or quetiapine). Those assigned to
      LY2140023 will have the option to continue on LY2140023 after 2 years if deemed appropriate
      by the investigator.
