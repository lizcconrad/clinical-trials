  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) that will eventually allow
      people who are completely paralyzed to independently control the tilt feature on their power
      wheelchairs. This study will allow healthy volunteers to test the feasibility and accuracy of
      controlling a BCI using only their brain signals while seated in a tilting wheelchair.

    <measure>The Accuracy of BCI Typing While Tilting in a Power Wheelchair and While Sitting Still in a Power Wheelchair.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 1-2 hour sessions over 2-4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will participate in 3 sessions. During each session each subject will copy a &quot;word&quot; in each of 3 conditions (no-movement, self-movement, continuous movement) by typing using only brainwaves. For the no-movement condition, the wheelchair seat remains in a fixed position. For the self-movement condition, the angle of the wheelchair seat changes in response to some of the selections made with the brain-computer interface. For the continuous movement condition, the angle of the wheelchair seat moves continuously. Changes in the wheelchair's position may affect spelling accuracy. The accuracy of the subject's copy spelling of the designated word will be measured for each condition in each session. The order of the conditions is balanced across the three days. The accuracy for each subject in each condition is presented as the average of the accuracies for that condition across the three days.</description>
