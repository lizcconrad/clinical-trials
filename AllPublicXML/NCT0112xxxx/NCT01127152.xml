    <textblock>
      Circulatory failures are the main cause of admissions in the intensive care unit. It is
      recommended to prescribe to these patients an intravenous injection of catecholamine to
      correct this dysfunction and to keep an hemodynamic stability. Electric pumps are used to
      administrate a continuous flow of drugs to patient. When a syringe of drugs ends, it is
      replaced by a full syringe, it is named &quot;relay&quot;. This change may cause a flow interruption
      and hypotension.

      In the intensive care unit at departmental hospital (CHD) Vendee, the manual relays used in
      common practice will cause hemodynamic instabilities : hypotensions in 20% cases. Since 4
      years, new devices are also used to make the relays. It is &quot;smart pumps&quot; allowing to manage
      automated the drug delays. This new method allows to not interrupt the drug flow. It could
      reduce the occurence of hypotension. A 50% decrease of relative number of hypotension will
      show that the use of automatic method is the most sure medical strategy.

      Our study want to compare manual and automatic method watching the variations of medium
      arterial pressure (MAP) during the fifteen minutes after the relay compared to baseline (MAP
      before the relay). Noradrenalin is the catecholamine most administrated so we choose to study
      only the relay for this drug.
