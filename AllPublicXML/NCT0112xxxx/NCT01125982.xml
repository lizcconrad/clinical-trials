      The purpose of this study is to establish validated outcome measures for Postoperative
      Fatigue and Postoperative nausea, and to compare clinical impact of postanaesthetic symptoms
      during first week after Propofol or Desflurane based anaesthesia.

    <description>To ensure validated outcome measures we will perform validation and comparison of two different fatigue scales (Chalder Fatigue Scale and Identity-Consequences Fatigue Scale). This will primarily be performed in a mixed surgical population. In addition the scales will also be validated in palliative patients, patients with possible CFS/ME diagnosis and patients with chronic pain.
Data aquisition will be cross-sectional, but the surgical population will also yield longitudinal data (preop. and 3rd postoperative day)</description>
