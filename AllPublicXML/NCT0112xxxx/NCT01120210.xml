  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (how
      the study medication affects the body) and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the
      body, how it is distributed within the body and removed from the body over time) of an
      intravenous administration of JNJ-39588146 or placebo over a 3-hour period in patients with
      heart failure. The highest tolerated dose received during the first 3 hours of the study will
      be administered to some patients for an additional 18 hours. There will be up to 3 doses
      given throughout the administration period over a total of up to 21 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of
      JNJ-39588146 or placebo (which looks like the drug being studied but has no active
      ingredients) in patients with heart failure. This study is being conducted in two parts. Part
      1 is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      physician nor patient knows the identity of the assigned drug) study of 3 intravenous doses
      of JNJ-39588146 or placebo administered in 1-hr intervals (for a total of 3 hours) in 60
      patients with heart failure. Part 2 is an extended infusion of JNJ-39588146 and placebo that
      will administer the highest tolerated dose from Part 1 for an additional 18 hours. The entire
      duration of the infusion could be as long as 21 hours. There is a 1 in 4 chance of getting
      placebo. The participation period is a maximum of 42 days, including a screening visit, a
      2-day in-clinic period and two follow-up visits. For both parts of the study, patients will
      have a cardiac catheter in place to monitor heart function. Safety evaluations, which will
      include ECG (electrocardiograph, measuring the electrical currents in the heart), vital signs
      and monitoring of side-effects will be performed. Additionally, blood and urine samples will
      be collected for evaluation. Part 1: Patients will receive an intravenous (IV) solution of
      three different doses of JNJ-39588146 or placebo administered over 1 hour periods for a total
      of 3 hours. Part 2: Patients participating in the sub study will continue receiving an IV
      solution for 18 more hours for a total of up to 21 hours of administration.

    <measure>Post-baseline Changes Compared to Placebo (at 1-, 2-, and 3-hours Post Infusion Initiation [ie, at the End of 5, 15 and 30 ng/kg/Min Infusions]) in Cardiac Index (CI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up through 3 hours post infusion initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of JNJ-39588146 on cardiac index (CI), a hemodynamic parameter that relates heart performance to the size of the individual measured in liters per minute per square metre (l/min/m2) was evaluated in patients with heart failure (HF). The primary analysis of this study focused on the differences between the treatment groups in terms of Least Squares (LS) mean change from Baseline at each time point; thus, the results provided below consist of the JNJ-39588146 minus placebo differences in LS means (and associated confidence intervals) for change from Baseline in CI at each time point as well as treatment group LS means and Standard Errors.</description>

        <description>The effect of JNJ-39588146 on cardiac index (CI), a hemodynamic parameter that relates heart performance to the size of the individual measured in liters per minute per square metre (l/min/m2) was evaluated in patients with heart failure (HF). The primary analysis of this study focused on the differences between the treatment groups in terms of Least Squares (LS) mean change from Baseline at each time point; thus, the results provided below consist of the JNJ-39588146 minus placebo differences in LS means (and associated confidence intervals) for change from Baseline in CI at each time point as well as treatment group LS means and Standard Errors.</description>

        <population>The modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had baseline measurement and at least 1 post-baseline measurement value of at least 1 of the primary endpoints.

          <title>Post-baseline Changes Compared to Placebo (at 1-, 2-, and 3-hours Post Infusion Initiation [ie, at the End of 5, 15 and 30 ng/kg/Min Infusions]) in Cardiac Index (CI)</title>
          <description>The effect of JNJ-39588146 on cardiac index (CI), a hemodynamic parameter that relates heart performance to the size of the individual measured in liters per minute per square metre (l/min/m2) was evaluated in patients with heart failure (HF). The primary analysis of this study focused on the differences between the treatment groups in terms of Least Squares (LS) mean change from Baseline at each time point; thus, the results provided below consist of the JNJ-39588146 minus placebo differences in LS means (and associated confidence intervals) for change from Baseline in CI at each time point as well as treatment group LS means and Standard Errors.</description>
          <population>The modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had baseline measurement and at least 1 post-baseline measurement value of at least 1 of the primary endpoints. The efficacy analysis was to be performed using the MITT analysis set.</population>

        <description>The effect of JNJ-39588146 on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was evaluated by administering multiple ascending doses of JNJ-39588146 or placebo over a 3-hour intravenous (IV) infusion period to patients with heart failure. The primary analysis of this study focused on the differences between the treatment groups in terms of Least Squares (LS) mean change from Baseline at each time point; thus, the results provided below consist of the JNJ-39588146 minus placebo differences in LS means (and associated confidence intervals) for change from baseline in PCWP at each time point as well as treatment group LS means and Standard Errors.</description>

        <description>The primary analysis of this study focused on the differences between the treatment groups in terms of Least Squares (LS) mean change from Baseline at each time point; thus, the results provided below consist of the JNJ-39588146 minus placebo differences in LS means (and associated confidence intervals) for change from Baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at each time point as well as treatment group LS means and Standard Errors.</description>

        <description>The primary analysis of this study focused on the differences between the treatment groups in terms of Least Square (LS) mean change from Baseline at each time point; thus, the results provided below consist of the JNJ-39588146 minus placebo differences in LS means (and associated confidence intervals) for change from Baseline in Pulmonary Arterial Diastolic Pressure (PADP) at the end of 5, 15 and 30 ng/kg/min Infusions as well as treatment group LS means and Standard Errors.</description>
