    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure on or After Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until end of study (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure was defined by the occurrence of a uveitis flare (the inability to maintain disease control). To be considered treatment failure, ≥ 1 of these criteria had to be present in at least 1 eye at Week 2 or all other visits:
New active, inflammatory chorioretinal, and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions relative to Baseline
2-step increase relative to Baseline in anterior chamber cell grade or vitreous haze grade
Worsening of best corrected visual acuity by ≥ 15 letters relative to baseline.
Time to treatment failure was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Dropouts for reasons other than treatment failure at any time during the study were censored at the drop out date.
Per protocol, the primary analysis was performed in the Main Study population which included all randomized participants recruited outside Japan; for completeness results are also reported below for the Integrated dataset which includes participants recruited in Japan.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anterior Chamber (AC) Cell Grade in Each Eye From Baseline to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the Final/Early Termination Visit (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Slit lamp examinations were conducted at each visit to assess AC cell count. The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm × 1 mm slit beam was used to determine the grade according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria:
Grade 0 = &lt; 1 cell
Grade 0.5+ = 1 - 5 cells
Grade 1+ = 6 - 15 cells
Grade 2+ = 16 - 25 cells
Grade 3+ = 26 - 50 cells
Grade 4+ = &gt; 50 cells.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vitreous Haze (VH) Grade in Each Eye From Baseline to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Final/Early Termination Visit (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Vitreous haze was measured using dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (DIO) and assessed by the Investigator according to National Eye Institute (NEI) and SUN criteria:
Grade 0: No evident vitreous haze;
Grade 0.5+: Slight blurring of the optic disc margin because of the haze; normal striations and reflex of the nerve fiber layer cannot be visualized;
Grade 1+: Permits a better definition of both the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 2+: Permits better visualization of the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 3+: Permits the observer to see the optic nerve head, but the borders are quite blurry;
Grade 4+: Optic nerve head is obscured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change In Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) In Each Eye From Baseline to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Final/Early Termination Visit (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Using corrective lenses based on that visit's refraction testing, participant's best corrected visual acuity was measured using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR chart. On the logMAR scale, 0 is equivalent to 20/20 visual acuity, the range of normal vision is considered to be from -0.2 - 0.1; higher values indicate visual impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Optimal Coherence Tomography (OCT) Evidence of Macular Edema in At Least 1 Eye On or After Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until the Final Visit (up to 80 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Optical coherence tomography was performed at every visit using 1 of 3 approved machines. Images were evaluated by a central reader. Macular edema was defined as cystoid macular edema.
OCT evidence of macular edema on or after Week 2 was to be counted as an event. Dropouts due to reasons other than OCT evidence of macular edema were to be considered as censored observations at the time of dropping out.</description>

          -  Subject that for ≥ 28 days prior to the Baseline visit has inactive disease and is
             taking ≥ 10 mg of oral prednisone to maintain this inactive state and fulfillment of
             all 3 of the following criteria based on the Investigator's clinical judgment at the
             Screening and Baseline visits for both eyes:

               -  Subject without active, inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal
                  vascular lesions.

               -  Subject with anterior chamber cell grade ≤ 0.5+ according to Standardization of
                  Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria.

               -  Subject with vitreous haze grade ≤ 0.5+ according to National Eye Institute
                  (NEI)/SUN criteria.

          -  Subject is on oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day (or oral corticosteroid equivalent) at
             Baseline and the dose has not been increased in the past 28 days or decreased in the
             past 14 days.

          -  Subject must have a documented history of experiencing at least one disease flare
             within 18 months of the Screening visit. This flare has to occur during or up to a
             maximum of 28 days after tapering off the oral corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Subjects who do not have previous, active or latent tuberculosis (TB). Only one TB
             test is required to allow the subject in the study. Subjects with either negative
             purified protein derivative (PPD) (&lt; 5 mm of induration) or negative QuantiFERON®-TB
             Gold test (or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) equivalent) are eligible. Subjects
             with a repeat indeterminate QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) result are
             not eligible. Note, that only one TB screening test is allowed and required. A repeat
             QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) is not permitted if the PPD skin test
             is positive. The TB screening tests are diagnostic tests. In the event of a negative
             TB screening test, the results are to be interpreted in the context of the patient's
             epidemiology, history, exam findings, etc. and it is the responsibility of the
             investigator to determine if a patient has previous, active or latent tuberculosis or
             not. Under no circumstances can a patient with a positive PPD result or positive
             QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) enter the study.

        <title>Time to Treatment Failure on or After Week 2</title>
        <description>Treatment failure was defined by the occurrence of a uveitis flare (the inability to maintain disease control). To be considered treatment failure, ≥ 1 of these criteria had to be present in at least 1 eye at Week 2 or all other visits:
New active, inflammatory chorioretinal, and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions relative to Baseline
2-step increase relative to Baseline in anterior chamber cell grade or vitreous haze grade
Worsening of best corrected visual acuity by ≥ 15 letters relative to baseline.
Time to treatment failure was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Dropouts for reasons other than treatment failure at any time during the study were censored at the drop out date.
Per protocol, the primary analysis was performed in the Main Study population which included all randomized participants recruited outside Japan; for completeness results are also reported below for the Integrated dataset which includes participants recruited in Japan.</description>

          <description>Slit lamp examinations were conducted at each visit to assess AC cell count. The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm × 1 mm slit beam was used to determine the grade according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria:
Grade 0 = &lt; 1 cell
Grade 0.5+ = 1 - 5 cells
Grade 1+ = 6 - 15 cells
Grade 2+ = 16 - 25 cells
Grade 3+ = 26 - 50 cells
Grade 4+ = &gt; 50 cells.</description>

        <description>Vitreous haze was measured using dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (DIO) and assessed by the Investigator according to National Eye Institute (NEI) and SUN criteria:
Grade 0: No evident vitreous haze;
Grade 0.5+: Slight blurring of the optic disc margin because of the haze; normal striations and reflex of the nerve fiber layer cannot be visualized;
Grade 1+: Permits a better definition of both the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 2+: Permits better visualization of the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 3+: Permits the observer to see the optic nerve head, but the borders are quite blurry;
Grade 4+: Optic nerve head is obscured.</description>

        <description>The National Eye Institute VFQ-25 is an ocular disease-specific survey that measures the influence of visual disability and visual symptoms on generic health domains such as emotional well-being and social functioning, in addition to task-oriented domains related to daily visual functioning.
The VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions plus an additional single-item general health rating question. The overall composite score ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores or increases in score indicate better vision-related functioning.</description>

          <title>Change in VFQ-25 Subscore Ocular Pain From Baseline to the Final/Early Termination Visit</title>
          <description>The National Eye Institute VFQ-25 is an ocular disease-specific survey that measures the influence of visual disability and visual symptoms on generic health domains such as emotional well-being and social functioning, in addition to task-oriented domains related to daily visual functioning.
The VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions plus an additional single-item general health rating question. The ocular pain subscore is calculated form the answers to 2 eye pain questions and ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores or increases in score indicate less pain.</description>
