      The primary objective of this study is to determine the 6-month Progression free survival
      (PFS) when intravenous (IV) AR-67 is administered in adults with confirmed recurrence of GBM
      who have not recently (&gt; 90 days) recurred after treatment bevacizumab (including patients
      who've received temazolamide, but no bevacizumab). The primary objective in the rapid
      bevacizumab failure group (&lt; 90 days) is to determine the 2-month PFS.

             to enrollment.

          5. Patients who have progressed, had surgery, and have no measurable disease are eligible
             as long as they have adequately recovered from the surgery.

          6. Received prior radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment.

          7. Received last chemotherapy or biologic therapy treatment ≥14 days before first dose of
             study drug (≥42 days if nitrosourea or ≥90 days if bevacizumab for the non-bevacizumab

             that have received prior chemotherapy, all toxicities need to have resolved ≤ Grade 1
             prior to the administration of study drug. For the patients in the bevacizumab failure
             cohort, failure must have occurred within the prior 90 days of receiving the last
             bevacizumab dose.

          8. Completed radiotherapy ≥90 days before study starts.

          9. Completed the administration of any investigational agent ≥14 days or 5 half-lives of
             the drugs' PK/dynamics or biologic activities, whichever is longer, before study
             starts.

         10. Karnofsky performance status of ≥60%.

         11. Recovered to Grade 1 or less from the toxic effects of any earlier intervention.

         12. Patients receiving EIADs must be switched to non-EIADs at least 14 days prior to study

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/mcL

               -  Platelets ≥150,000/mcL

               -  Total bilirubin within upper limit of normal (ULN)

                  with creatinine levels above normal limits.

         14. Demonstrated, in the opinion of the investigator, the ability to follow directions
             necessary to participate in the clinical trial.

         15. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods as
             follows:

               -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female patient's entry and is
                  the sole sexual partner for that female.

               -  Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to
                  investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days
                  after the last dose of investigational product.

               -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or
                  film; diaphragm with spermicide, or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

             Note: These methods are to be used consistently and in accordance with both the
             product label and the instructions of the treating physician. Oral contraceptives are
             not reliable due to potential drug-drug interactions and should be used with caution
             if the patient insists on their use as a contraceptive.

             switch to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at least 7 days prior to first dosing
             will be eligible for study participation.

          4. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including active infection requiring intravenous
             antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          5. Known HIV infection.

          6. Any other condition that would compromise treatment and/or evaluation with reasonable
             safety.

          7. Completed intracranial surgery ≤ 14 days before the study starts.

          8. Received an anti-epilpetic drug, which is a CYP3A4 inducer from ≤ 14 days prior to
