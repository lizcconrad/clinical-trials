    <textblock>
      Considering the pathogenesis of several allergic skin diseases to be investigated in this
      study as well as the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of the association of dexamethasone and
      clemastine fumarate, it is believed that the components of topical medication may act
      synergistically in the reduction of signs and symptoms of the diseases in question. Therefore
      it is expected that the association promotes results significantly superior to dexamethasone
      alone.
