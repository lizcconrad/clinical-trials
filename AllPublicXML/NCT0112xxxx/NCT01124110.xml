  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clustered randomized control trial to test the Tobacco Tactics intervention among
      Operating Engineers (heavy equipment workers). The intervention group will be directed to the
      Tobacco Tactics website, and the control group will be directed to the state supported 1-800
      quit-now telephone hotline during routine annual safety training that all Operating Engineers
      are required to attend. The web-based quitting intervention includes provision of
      over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy and will be followed by nurse email and/or
      telephone counseling. It is expected that Operating Engineers who are randomized to the
      Tobacco Tactics website intervention will have at least equal or greater decreases in smoking
      at 30-day and 6-month follow-up compared to those randomized to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW quit line.
      In addition, the investigators expect to find that Operating Engineers randomized to the
      Tobacco Tactics website intervention will: a) be able to accomplish tasks; b) be able to
      accomplish goals with skill and speed; c) be able to operate the system; d) be satisfied with
      the website; e) access the site repeatedly; and f) spend time on the site during the
      intervention period.

    <description>The investigators will measure 7-day point prevalence abstinence by asking the well validated question, &quot;Have you used any tobacco products (even one puff) in the past 7 days?&quot; The investigators will also assess harm reduction (ability to quit at all, number of quit attempts, and number of cigarettes smoked per day).</description>

    <description>The investigators will measure 7-day point prevalence abstinence by asking the well validated question, &quot;Have you used any tobacco products (even one puff) in the past 7 days?&quot; Smoking status will be confirmed by biochemical verification in the form of urinary cotinine test strips. The investigators will also assess harm reduction (ability to quit at all, number of quit attempts, and number of cigarettes smoked per day).</description>

    <description>The control group receives efficacious smoking cessation treatment via the 1-800-QUIT-NOW telephone hotline. The 1-800-QUIT-NOW hotline is a national program. The first time smokers call the hotline, they receive a personal coach who assists them in setting a quit date and making an individualized quit plan. The personal coach also provides on-going support with up to five telephone coaching sessions around the caller's quit date.</description>
