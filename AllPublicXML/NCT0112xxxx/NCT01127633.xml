  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is a questionnaire administered to caregivers that quantifies behavioral changes in dementia. Each of the 12 behavioral domains the caregiver reports as present are scored for Frequency, scale: 1 (Occasionally) to 4 (Very Frequently), and Severity, scale: 1 (Mild) to 3 (Severe). If the domain is reported by the caregiver as 'Not Affected,' that domain is scored as 0. The individual domain scores are calculated by multiplying the frequency times the severity for each domain. NPI Total Score is calculated by adding the individual domain scores together for all 12 domains, with a scores range from 0 to 144. Lower scores indicated less severity and higher scores indicated a greater severity of neuropsychiatric disturbance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Resource Utilization in Dementia - Lite (RUD-Lite) Caregiver Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The RUD-Lite is a caregiver-completed assessment designed to assess the amount of formal and informal resources used by participants and the primary caregiver. It is completed by the caregiver and compiles data on the following resources: length of time the caregiver spends giving care, assisting participants with basic activities of daily living (BADL: eating dressing, grooming, bathing); assisting participants with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs: shopping, cooking, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication, managing finances), and providing supervision. Scores range from 0 to 24 hours. Higher values indicate greater resource use. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Version (EQ-5D Proxy)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D (proxy version) is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument assessing caregiver's impression of participants overall health state. Profile allows caregivers to rate participant's health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale: 1 (no problem), 2 (some problems), and 3 (major problems). These attribute combinations are converted into a weighted Health-State Index Score according to the United States (US) population-based algorithm. EQ-5D US Population-Based Index Scores range from -0.11 to 1.0. A score of 1.0 indicated perfect health. The Overall Health State Index Score is caregiver-reported using a visual analogue scale marked 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health state). LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The QoL-AD (Caregiver Total Score) is a disease-specific measure of quality of life for an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) population administered to the participant's primary caregiver, who answers on behalf of the participant. The assessment consists of 13 items covering physical health, energy, mood, living situations, memory, family, marriage, friends, chores, fun, money, self and life as a whole. The assessment is scored on a 4-point Likert scale with scores ranging from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent). QoL-AD Total Score is defined as the sum of the 13 items with a scores range from 13 to 52. Higher scores denote a better quality of life. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's cognitive function. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention with scores ranging from 0 to 21 (lower scores indicate greater impairment). The second section tests the ability of the participant to name objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures with scores ranging from 0 to 9 (lower scores indicate greater impairment). The range for MMSE Total Score is 0 to 30. Lower scores indicate more impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Amyloid Imaging Parameters in Subjects With Mild Alzheimer's Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Florbetapir PET imaging was used to test for change from baseline. The hypothesis that amyloid burden was reduced in participants between the treatment groups from the feeder studies was tested. The change from baseline to the postbaseline visit of the composite summary standard uptake value ratio of florbetapir F18 was calculated. The composite summary measure is an unweighted average of the 6 smaller regions (anterior cingulate, frontal medial orbital, parietal, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal) normalized to whole cerebellum and to subject-specific white matter.</description>

In addition, the number of participants with 1 or more serious AEs is summarized cumulatively. A serious AE is defined as an event that results in death, initial or prolonged hospitalization, is life-threatening, leads to persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is associated with congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is considered significant by the investigator for any other reason. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive 14-Item Scale (ADAS-Cog14)</title>
        <description>ADAS-Cog14 is ADAS-Cog11 augmented with delayed free recall, digit cancellation, and maze completion measures. A score of 0 to 10 for delayed free recall and a conversion code of 0 to 5 for digit cancellation and maze completion provide total score ranges for this extended ADAS-Cog14 of 0 to 90. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Least Squares (LS) Mean was determined by mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, feeder visit 1 Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) status (mild/moderate), concomitant acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI)/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</title>
        <description>The NPI is a questionnaire administered to caregivers that quantifies behavioral changes in dementia. Each of the 12 behavioral domains the caregiver reports as present are scored for Frequency, scale: 1 (Occasionally) to 4 (Very Frequently), and Severity, scale: 1 (Mild) to 3 (Severe). If the domain is reported by the caregiver as 'Not Affected,' that domain is scored as 0. The individual domain scores are calculated by multiplying the frequency times the severity for each domain. NPI Total Score is calculated by adding the individual domain scores together for all 12 domains, with a scores range from 0 to 144. Lower scores indicated less severity and higher scores indicated a greater severity of neuropsychiatric disturbance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Resource Utilization in Dementia - Lite (RUD-Lite) Caregiver Hours</title>
        <description>The RUD-Lite is a caregiver-completed assessment designed to assess the amount of formal and informal resources used by participants and the primary caregiver. It is completed by the caregiver and compiles data on the following resources: length of time the caregiver spends giving care, assisting participants with basic activities of daily living (BADL: eating dressing, grooming, bathing); assisting participants with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs: shopping, cooking, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, taking medication, managing finances), and providing supervision. Scores range from 0 to 24 hours. Higher values indicate greater resource use. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Version (EQ-5D Proxy)</title>
        <description>EQ-5D (proxy version) is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument assessing caregiver's impression of participants overall health state. Profile allows caregivers to rate participant's health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale: 1 (no problem), 2 (some problems), and 3 (major problems). These attribute combinations are converted into a weighted Health-State Index Score according to the United States (US) population-based algorithm. EQ-5D US Population-Based Index Scores range from -0.11 to 1.0. A score of 1.0 indicated perfect health. The Overall Health State Index Score is caregiver-reported using a visual analogue scale marked 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health state). LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD)</title>
        <description>The QoL-AD (Caregiver Total Score) is a disease-specific measure of quality of life for an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) population administered to the participant's primary caregiver, who answers on behalf of the participant. The assessment consists of 13 items covering physical health, energy, mood, living situations, memory, family, marriage, friends, chores, fun, money, self and life as a whole. The assessment is scored on a 4-point Likert scale with scores ranging from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent). QoL-AD Total Score is defined as the sum of the 13 items with a scores range from 13 to 52. Higher scores denote a better quality of life. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</title>
        <description>The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's cognitive function. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention with scores ranging from 0 to 21 (lower scores indicate greater impairment). The second section tests the ability of the participant to name objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures with scores ranging from 0 to 9 (lower scores indicate greater impairment). The range for MMSE Total Score is 0 to 30. Lower scores indicate more impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 104-week Endpoint in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscore 11-Item Scale (ADAS-Cog11)</title>
        <description>The cognitive subscale of the ADAS (ADAS Cog11) was used as a primary efficacy measure and consists of 11 items assessing areas of function most typically impaired in Alzheimer’s disease: orientation, verbal memory, language, and praxis. The scale ranges from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with baseline, pooled investigator, treatment, visit, feeder visit 1 MMSE status (mild/moderate), concomitant AChEI/Memantine use at baseline (yes/no), baseline age and treatment*visit.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Amyloid Imaging Parameters in Subjects With Mild Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
        <description>Florbetapir PET imaging was used to test for change from baseline. The hypothesis that amyloid burden was reduced in participants between the treatment groups from the feeder studies was tested. The change from baseline to the postbaseline visit of the composite summary standard uptake value ratio of florbetapir F18 was calculated. The composite summary measure is an unweighted average of the 6 smaller regions (anterior cingulate, frontal medial orbital, parietal, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal) normalized to whole cerebellum and to subject-specific white matter.</description>
