      Background:

        -  Severe atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition
           that affects both children and adults and causes severe itching and skin redness.
           Current treatments of atopic dermatitis include topical creams and lotions, light
           therapy, and medications. However, the difficulty with long-term treatment for the
           chronic and severe nature of the disease requires more effective and better-tolerated
           therapeutic options.

        -  Anakinra is a drug that blocks a substance called interleukin-1 (IL-1), which may be
           important in causing the inflammation in atopic dermatitis. Researchers are interested
           in determining whether anakinra can be used to help treat atopic dermatitis. Anakinra
           has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat rheumatoid arthritis in
           adults and children, but it has not been approved for use in adults or children with
           atopic dermatitis and is considered an experimental treatment in this study. In this
           study Anakinra will be administered as an injection under the skin every day for 3
           months

      Objectives:

      - To assess the safety and effectiveness of using anakinra to treat severe atopic dermatitis
      in children.

      Eligibility:

      - Children between 10 and 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with severe atopic
      dermatitis that has not responded to standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  Initial Screening: Participants will have an initial screening visit with a complete
           physical examination and medical history, blood and urine tests, photographs of the skin
           ,skin biopsy, and other tests as required.

        -  Run-in Period: At the screening visit, participants will receive a diary card and will
           be asked to track their atopic dermatitis symptoms on standard treatment for 2 months.

        -  Start of Treatment: At the end of the 2 month Run-in period participants will return for
           an inpatient visit (2 days) to receive the initial dose of anakinra and will be watched
           for any side effects. During the inpatient visit, participants will have additional
           examinations and blood and urine tests, and will be instructed on how to administer the
           anakinra injections at home.

      Treatment Period: - Participants will return once a week for the first 2 weeks of treatment,
      at the end of the first month, and then once a month for the following 2 months, for a
      physical exam and blood tests. Participants will be asked to record symptoms related to their
      atopic dermatitis, anakinra administration and any side effects related to the anakinra on
      the diary card. The diary cards will be reviewed and collected at each visit.-

      End of Treatment Period: At the end of 3 months of treatment with anakinra, participants will
      again be asked to record symptoms related to their atopic dermatitis on the diary card.
      Participants will be seen once a month for 3 months for a physical exam, blood tests and
      review of the diary card. . The final study visit will take place at the end of the 3rd month
      and will include a physical exam, blood tests, photographs and skin biopsy.

      Severe refractory atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory pruritic skin condition that
      affects both children and adults. The disease is marked by periods of exacerbation and
      remission. Symptoms of atopic dermatitis may resolve by adolescence; however, it is estimated
      that the disease may persist in 50 percent of affected children well into adulthood.

      Current possible treatments of atopic dermatitis include the use of topical corticosteroids,
      calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, as well as systemic medications i.e., methotrexate,
      cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and interferon gamma. The difficulty with
      long-term treatment of this disease lies in its chronic nature associated with severe
      episodes. The combination of chronicity and severity of episodes of this diseases demands
      more effective and better-tolerated therapeutic options than those that are currently
      available. While the pathways of allergic inflammation are different than those of other
      inflammatory conditions, certain elements may overlap, providing targets for immune
      modulation. One of these targets is the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor.

      The IL-1 receptor plays an important role in the development and maintenance of Th2
      responses. Genetic, in vivo and in vitro data demonstrate a significant role for IL-1
      signaling allergic and skin inflammatory conditions. This pilot study is therefore designed
      to assess the safety and efficacy of IL-1ra, a natural inhibitor of the IL-1 receptor, in
      disrupting atopic pathophysiologic pathways. Specifically, we will treat severe refractory
      atopic dermatitis associated with evidence of multiple specific allergic sensitivities. Up to
      8 patients ages 10-30 with severe refractory dermatitis will be enrolled. Patients will be
      initially evaluated to establish the diagnosis of severe refractory AD as evidenced by SCORAD
      score greater than 40, followed by a 2 month (8 week) run-in period, a 3 month (12 week)
      treatment period of 3mg/kg/day anakinra given subcutaneously, followed by a 3 month (12 week)
      post-treatment evaluation period. In order to be considered evaluable for response, patients
      must have received a minimum of 67 out of 84 doses (80 percent) of anakinra. The primary
      endpoint is lack of an increase in serious infections, the secondary endpoint is a reduction
      of 30 percent or more in SCORAD score, and tertiary endpoints are cellular phenotypic and
      cytokine responses to IL-1 receptor blockade in atopic patients.

          8. Has a diagnosis of active tuberculosis with consistent findings from a PPD skin test,
             computerized tomography (CT) scan or Chest x-ray. Those subjects found to have a
             positive PPD will be referred back to their primary care physician for appropriate
             management.

          9. Has received a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to therapy or potential need for a
             live vaccine during the study.
