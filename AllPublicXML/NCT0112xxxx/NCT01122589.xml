      The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which an Intentional Behavioral
      Intervention will increase tobacco quit rates post release among incarcerated men and women.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quitting smoking reduces the risks of developing smoking related illnesses as well as the
      morbidity and mortality associated with these illnesses. In 2006 approximately 44.5 million
      American adults smoked an overall prevalence of 20.8%. The prevalence is much higher among
      incarcerated populations and approximately 80% of the women in RI smoked prior to
      incarceration. This proposal is designed to evaluate an intervention utilizing Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to provide the skills necessary to
      maintain smoking abstinence after release. MI utilizes specific techniques for providing
      feedback on an individual's risk and self efficacy. CBT provides the skills necessary to
      maintain abstinence after release. The investigators plan to recruit 350 men and women from
      the Rhode Island Department of Corrections and randomize them to two interventions: an
      Intentional Behavioral Intervention (IBI) with 6 sessions of in jail MI/CBT and two post
      release booster sessions compared to CONcise Tapes Reviewing Obstacles to healthy Living
      (CONTROL) group which will receive a smoking cessation pamphlet and watch a series of six
      weekly 30-45 minutes general wellness videos.
