  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wide excision of head and neck cancer with microsurgical free flap's reconstruction (FFR)
      results to a high cancer cure rate and a good functional recovery. However, this long complex
      procedure is accompanied with considerable complications. Excessive fluid administration
      during this type of surgery has been connected with poor results. There is growing evidence
      that goal-directed fluid management (GDFM) might improve the results in high-risk patients.

      Hypothesis: Goal directed fluid management will reduce intraoperative fluid volume
      administered to patients undergoing head and neck reconstructive surgery.
