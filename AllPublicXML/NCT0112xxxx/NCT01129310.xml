  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize IXO chemotherapy will have an improvement in response rate and
      acceptable toxicity for uncurable metastatic gastric cancer compared to historical controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multicentre, phase II trial in which patients with
      metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be treated with the combination of irinotecan,
      capecitabine, and oxaliplatin (IXO).Patients will receive the combination of irinotecan,
      capecitabine, and oxaliplatin at the recommended phase II dose and sequence determined by the
      completed phase I trial. Patients will be treated on study until disease progression,
      overwhelming toxicity, or consent withdrawal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  histologically documented gastric GEJ adenocarcinoma not previously treated with
             palliative systemic therapy.

          -  Metastatic disease based on the presence of clinically and/or radiologically
             documented measurable disease based on RECIST.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0,1 or 2.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Life expectancy of least 3 months based on discretion of treating oncologist.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy or radiation delivered as part of
             initial curative therapy (i.e. neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy administered alone
             and/or concurrently delivered with radiation and/or surgery) are permitted as long as
             that treatment was completed at least 6 months prior to study start date.

          -  Patients may have received prior palliative radiotherapy (unless radiation was
             curative therapy to pelvis or to ≥25% of bone marrow stores) if this radiation was ≥ 4
             weeks before study entry and patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of
             this treatment.

          -  Patients may have received prior surgery if this surgery was ≥ 4 weeks before study
             entry and patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of this treatment.

          -  Patients must have the ability to read, understand, and sign an informed consent and
             must be willing to comply with study treatment and follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received palliative chemotherapy for their metastatic gastric or GEJ
             tumor.

          -  Prior treatment with &gt; 6 cycles of traditional alkylating agent-based chemotherapy, &gt;
             2 cycles of carboplatin-based chemotherapy, prior treatment with irinotecan or
             oxaliplatin chemotherapy, or concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs or
             anti-cancer therapy.

          -  Curative radiation treatment to the pelvis or radiation therapy to ≥ 25% of bone
             marrow stores.

          -  Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract, malabsorption
             syndrome, short gut syndrome, or history of bowel obstruction due to peritoneal
             metastases.

          -  Previous of concurrent malignancies, excluding curatively treated in situ carcinoma of
             the cervix or non-melanoma skin cancer, unless at least 5 years have elapsed since
             last treatment and the patient is considered cured.

          -  Any serious medical condition within 6 months prior to study entry such as myocardial
             infarction, uncontrolled congestive heart failure,unstable angina, active
             cardiomyopathy, unstable ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular diseases,
             uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled psychiatric disorder,
             serious infection, active peptic ulcer disease, or other medical condition that .....

          -  Gilbert's disease

          -  Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.

          -  Pre-existing neuropathy ≥ grade 2 from any cause.

          -  Patients with unstable metastasis to the central nervous system are excluded. Patients
             who have treated brain metastasis and are off steroids, anticonvulsants, and have
             documented stability of lesions for at least 3 months may be eligible. A CT scan or
             MRI is NOT required to rule out brain metastases unless there is clinical suspicion of
             CNS involvement.
