      Primary Objective:

        -  To study effect of mild, moderate and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of
           Otamixaban.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of Otamixaban on subjects with mild, moderate and
           severe renal impairment and in matched subjects with normal renal function.

      The study period for one subject is broken down as follows:

        -  2 to 28 days of screening,

        -  1 day of treatment,

        -  8 to 11 days of follow-up after start of infusion.

      There are 5 days in the unit starting the day before the start of infusion.
