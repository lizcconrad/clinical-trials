    <textblock>
      Acute low back pain is a common cause for emergency department visits. Controversy remains
      regarding the optimal medication for acute low back pain relief. The investigators
      hypothesized that administration of pharmacological anxiolysis in addition to analgesia will
      improve pain relief and patient management in the emergency department.

      Acute low back pain is a common problem in the emergency department and pain relief is
      usually the first step in patients' management. Numerous medication options are available for
      acute LBP relief,each class of medication has its associated benefits and harms.Controversy
      remains regarding the optimal analgesic treatment.Anxiety has been found to be a predictive
      factor of pain intensity in patients with acute low back pain and anxiolysis by
      non-pharmacological measures has been shown to have a positive effect on pain management in
      the ED setting.

      Promethazine is a first-generation H1 receptor antagonist of the phenothiazine chemical class
      used commonly as an antihistamine antiemetic. It has a strong anxiolytic-sedative effect and
      its safety and efficacy in managing anxiety related to medical procedures is well
      documented.It may be reasonable to assume that pharmacological anxiolysis with promethazine
      may assist in alleviation of acute pain in the strenuous environment of the ED.
