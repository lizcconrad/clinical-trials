  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Proof of Concept study is to determine the therapeutic potential of the
      L19SIP antibody, labeled with the radionuclide 131I in combination with external beam
      radiation, for the treatment of patients with multiple brain metastases following the
      promising results with this agent in previous clinical studies.

      The L19SIP antibody is a fully human antibody, capable of preferential localization around
      tumor blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a
      rare event in the adult (exception made for the female reproductive cycle), but is a
      pathological feature in most aggressive types of cancer. The presented study follows a Phase
      I and a subsequent Phase I/II dose finding and efficacy study with the same agent in patients
      with a variety of cancers where 131I-L19SIP had shown an excellent tolerability and
      therapeutic benefit for some patients enrolled in the study.
