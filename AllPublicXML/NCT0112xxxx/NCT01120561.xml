      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, expanded access study designed to provide
      T-DM1 to patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of T-DM1 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented breast cancer

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer

          -  HER2-positive breast cancer documented as FISH-positive, IHC 3 + or CISH-positive by
             local laboratory assessment

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer: incurable,
             unresectable, locally advanced breast cancer previously treated with multimodality
             therapy or metastatic breast cancer

          -  Prior treatment for breast cancer in the adjuvant, unresectable, locally advanced, or
             metastatic setting must include both: a taxane, alone or in combination with another
             agent, and Trastuzumab, alone or in combination with another agent in the adjuvant,
             unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic setting

          -  Documented progression of incurable unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic
             breast cancer during their most recent treatment regimen

          -  Progression must occur during or after most recent treatment for locally
             advanced/metastatic breast cancer or within 6 months after completing adjuvant therapy

          -  Adequate hematologic and end organ function

          -  Agreement to use an effective form of birth control throughout the study

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 90 days as assessed by the investigator

          -  History of exposure to cumulative doses of select anthracyclines

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or any of

          -  Brain metastases that are untreated or progressive or currently require any type of
             therapy, including radiation, surgery, and/or steroids to control symptoms from brain
             metastases within 30 days before the first study treatment

          -  Peripheral neuropathy of Grade ≥ 3 per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0, at the time of the first study
