      &lt;Research Hypothesis&gt; The dynamics of immune systems by cytotoxic chemotherapy and its
      changes by combination with immuno-oncology agents will be uncovered.

      The combination of Durvalumab/Tremelimumab with gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy is
      feasible and efficacious in chemo-na誰ve biliary tract cancer.

      &lt;Purpose of the study&gt; To assess the effect of Durvalumab/Tremelimumab in combination with
      gemcitabine/cisplatin on response rate (RR) in chemo-na誰ve advanced biliary tract cancer
      patients.

  <detailed_description>

      &lt;Rationale for conducting this study&gt;

        1. Rational #1. The incidence of biliary tract cancer (BTC) is higher in Korea than the
           West. (Korea: 10 new cases/100,000 population every year, the West:1-2 cases/100,100
           population every year). Therefore, to conduct clinical study of BTC in Korea is very
           feasible and efficient.

        2. Rational #2 The Gemcitabine/cisplatin is the current standard of care in 1st-line
           treatment for advanced BTC ((N Engl J Med 2010; 362 (14): 1273-81). No one-targeted
           therapy has been approved in BTC, yet. The overall survival of advanced BTC with
           cytotoxic chemotherapy is only 8-10 months, in general. Therefore, there is a huge unmet
           medical need.

        3. Rational #3 In recent sequencing data of BTC showed the BTC patients with the worse
           prognosis had significant enrichment of hypermutated tumors and a characteristic
           elevation in the expression of immune checkpoint molecules. According, immune-modulating
           therapies also be potentially promising options for these patients (Nat Genet. 2015
           Sep;47(9):1003-10.)

        4. Rational #4 In PDL1 (+) BTC, anti-PD1 Ab shows promising activity as a monotherapy (Bang
           YJ, et al. ECC/ESMO 2015) In one clinical study of pembrolizumab, 37 out of 89 BTC
           patients (41.6%) showed the PDL1 (+) tumor. Among 24 PDL1 (+) patients who were enrolled
           and treated with pembrolizumab, 50% were Asian, 62.5% had ECOG 1, 16.7% had gallbladder
           cancer, 80% were at the 3rd-line or later setting. Four patients showed PR (3 from Seoul
           National University Hospital), 4 patients SD, which led the overall response rate of
           17.4%. A total 40% of patients showed tumor shrinkage. The decreases in tumor size were
           generally maintained over time. This study gives us the evidence that immune checkpoint
           inhibitor is working on BTC likewise other solid tumors.

        5. Rational #5 In recent studies have shown the combination of CTLA4 inhibitor with
           anti-PD1/PDL1 agents shows the enhanced clinical activities, especially, regardless of
           PDL1 status. This combination strategy is being actively under test in many solid
           tumors.

        6. Rational #6 Certain chemotherapeutic drugs stimulate cancer-specific immune responses by
           inducing immunogenic cell death and other effector mechanisms (Immunity 2013, Annu Rev
           Immunol 2013) With the cytotoxic chemotherapy, the PDL-1 is induced and this increased
           expression of PDL1 contributes the resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Successful
           eradication of tumors by immunogenic chemotherapy requires removal of immunosuppressive
           IgA+, PDL1+plasmocytes (Nature 2015). More importantly, still vast majorities of dynamic
           changes of immune system by cytotoxic chemotherapy are unanswered.

           These support that the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy with immuno-oncology agents
           including immune checkpoint inhibitors might be efficacious and needed.

        7. Rational #7 The advantages of &quot;Immunotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy&quot; combination
           are; 1) can explore science on the dynamic immunologic changes by cytotoxic chemotherapy
           and its overcome by immunotherapy 2) easy way to be incorporated in the current clinical
           practice 3) can be applied to variety of tumor types such as NSCLC, urothelial cancer.
           4) relatively affordable than &quot;immunotherapy and targeted agent&quot; combination.
           Durvalumab/Tremelimumab in combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been tested,
           especially in BTC.

      &lt;Sample Size Determination&gt; Primary efficacy endpoint is response rate. In BTC, the response
      rate of 1st-line gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy is about 20% (20% in BT22 clinical trial,
      25% in ABC-02 clinical trial). Therefore, we set H0 as 20%, and H1 as 40%. Using 75% of power
      and a-error of 0.05, a total 28 patients will be needed. When we assume the drop-out rate of
      10%, a total of 31 patients will be enrolled.
