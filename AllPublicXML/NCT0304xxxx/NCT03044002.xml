  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controlled, multicenter, non-inferiority trial to compare the rate of access site
      complications (ASC) in 4French (4F) vs. 6French (6F) femoral access endovascular
      interventions.

    <measure>Peri- and post-procedural access site complications (including homeostasis strategy failure; post-procedural defined as within 30 days post-intervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 days post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Access site complications are defined as a composite of:
Groin hematoma (larger than 5 cm in diameter, visible by sonography, and hemoglobin decrease &lt;3 g/dL)
Pseudoaneurysm
Groin as well as retroperitoneal bleeding (defined as requiring acute intervention for haemostasis, need for blood transfusions, or haemoglobin decrease &gt;3 g/dL)
AV fistula (visible by shunting in colour coded sonography between the common femoral artery and vein)
Arterial dissections at access site (visible with fluoroscopy or sonography as a membrane causing stenosis in the vessel lumen)
Thrombosis
