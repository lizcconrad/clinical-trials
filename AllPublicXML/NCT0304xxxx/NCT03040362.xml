    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, nonrandomized, absorption, metabolism, and excretion study
      of [14C]-lasmiditan administered as a 200-milligrams (mg) (approximately 100
      microcuries[µCi]) oral solution to 8 healthy males and females, following at least a 10 hour
      fast from food to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, and routes and extent of
      elimination of a single oral dose of 200 mg (approximately 100 µCi) [14C] lasmiditan in
      healthy males and females.
