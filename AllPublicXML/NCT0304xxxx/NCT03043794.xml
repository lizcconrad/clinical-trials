    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial of preoperative stereotactic radiation to the breast for low risk
      breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study design, evaluating the pathologic response (primary
      endpoint) as well as toxicity, cosmetic outcome, quality of life, and translational
      correlates (secondary endpoints) to pre-operative stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to
      intact breast tumors in patients with hormone-receptor positive early stage breast cancer.
