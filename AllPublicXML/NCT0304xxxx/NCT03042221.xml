  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparison of baseline tumor characteristics in oncogene-driven cancers to tumor
      characteristics after early response to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) targeted treatment
      will allow identification of early adaptive mechanisms of cell survival. This will facilitate
      targeting and termination of these survival/ resistance pathways before they develop with
      rational combinations of therapeutic agents to improve outcomes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Carry a diagnosis of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with an activating mutation
             determined to respond to an estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) TKI, alkaline
             phosphatase (ALK) or ROS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ROS1) fusion or BRAF V600E.

          -  Aged 18 - 85 years or older

          -  ECOG 0-2

          -  Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR
             sensitizing mutation (including, but not limited to: G719X, del exon 19, or L858R).

          -  No prior therapy for metastatic disease.

          -  Planned treatment with a single agent EGFR TKI including but not limited to:

               1. erlotinib,

               2. gefitinib,

               3. rociletinib (CO-1686),

               4. afatinib, or

               5. osimertinib (AZD-9291).

          -  Patients must have at least one site of measurable disease â‰¥ least 2cm.

          -  Primary disease site or site of metastatic disease must be amenable to biopsy.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed
             consent document.

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo an initial pre-treatment biopsy of tumor tissue
             (or have previously collected frozen tissue) and a follow-up biopsy 2 weeks (+/- 1
             week) after treatment start

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent health problem which would preclude tissue biopsy (eg hemophilia or other
             bleeding predisposition).

          -  Patients whose only source of biopsiable disease is:

               1. intracranial,

               2. pleural effusion or any lesion that is deemed unsafe to biopsy by the treating
                  physician or,

               3. interventional radiology.
