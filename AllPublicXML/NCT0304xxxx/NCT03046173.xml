      To investigate the effects of concentrated growth factors applied in maxillary sinus floor
      elevation via a lateral window approach with simultaneous implant placement on repair of bone
      defects and new bone formation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maxillary sinus floor elevation via a lateral window approach is the most effective method of
      overcoming the shortage of bone mass deficiency in atrophic maxillary posterior region. Bone
      transplantation is considered to be a prerequisite for the success of maxillary sinus floor
      elevation. Platelet-rich plasma and platelet-rich fibrin have been used to accelerate bone
      formation, regeneration, and repair. However, few in-depth studies are reported on the
      effects of concentrated growth factors on new bone formation.
