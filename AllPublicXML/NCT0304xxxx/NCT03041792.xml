    <description>Assessment by adverse event monitoring, 12 lead ECGs, telemetry, vital signs and clinical safety laboratory measurements.
Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a subject who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to Drug was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Subjects with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>
