      Prospectively randomized study in patients with renal pelvic stones who are candidate to
      standard PCNL procedure. One to one, controlled clinical trial. Patients will be randomly
      allocated into two groups, 20 patients in each group. Group A will be scheduled to receive
      routine standard PCNL. Group B will be scheduled to receive Robot assisted pyelolethotomy.

    <description>Percutant nephrolithotomy is a standard procedure for stones treatment over 2 cm.The puncture will be performed with an 18-G nephrostomy needle. The access thus gained guaranteed the transpapillary route of the percutaneous tract, a basic condition for the prevention of bleeding. Subsequently, following withdrawal of the puncture needle and urine drainage, a flexible guidewire will be inserted and advanced to the upper calyx or ureter.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Robot assisted pyelolithotomy, is a new technique to remove stones of more than 2 cm. A 12-mm camera port is placed at the level of the umbilicus and lateral. Two 8-mm robotic trocars are placed under direct vision and a 12-mm assistant port is placed in the midline a 5-8 cm above the umbilicus. After reflecting the colon medially, the renal pelvis will be dissected and identified, a flexible cystoscope will be inserted via an assisted trocar and introduced into the renal pelvis through a minor incision. The kidney stones will then be extracted with a basket and either removed via the port or placed in a specimen retrieval bag.</description>

    <description>A 12-mm camera port is placed at the level of the umbilicus and lateral; this port is moved farther laterally in morbidly obese patients to allow for the instruments to reach the target organs. Two 8-mm robotic trocars are placed under direct vision and a 12-mm assistant port is placed in the midline a 5-8 cm above the umbilicus. For right-sided stones, an additional 5-mm port is placed in the midline just below the xiphoid process for liver retraction. Placement of the trocars can be changed according to surgeon preference. After reflecting the colon medially, the renal pelvis will be dissected and identified, a flexible cystoscope will be inserted via an assisted trocar and introduced into the renal pelvis through a minor incision. The kidney stones will then be extracted with a basket and either removed via the port or placed in a specimen retrieval bag.</description>
