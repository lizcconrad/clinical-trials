  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study designed to determine the feasibility and
      acceptability of objectively measuring physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep using the
      Fitbit Charge HR wristband. 50 patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and are
      planning to initiate chemotherapy will be invited to participate in this study, and we will
      measure general and breast-specific quality-of-life using PROMIS measures for 3-6 months
      after completion of chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 3.1 million women are currently living with a diagnosis of breast cancer in the United
      States (US), representing 41% of all female cancer survivors in the US1. The increased breast
      cancer survival rate has necessitated a shift in cancer care toward developing interventions
      to empower patients to improve their quality-of-life, and perhaps prognosis, during and after
      treatment. Among women diagnosed with early-stage (I or II) breast cancer, around 40% will
      receive chemotherapy. Among women diagnosed with late-stage (III or IV), around 75% will
      receive chemotherapy.1 Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with many side effects, including
      fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, decreased activity, and weight gain.2-5 Women receiving
      chemotherapy gain an average of 2.5 to 6.2 kg during therapy.6 Weight gain increases the risk
      of breast cancer recurrence and mortality, as well as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and
      second primary cancers.7 Physical activity alleviates or reduces both short and long term
      treatment side effects of chemotherapy, including weight gain, and restores physical
      functioning in breast cancer patients.6,8,9Additionally, randomized controlled trials in
      breast cancer patients have shown that adding exercise to chemotherapy programs can improve
      breast cancer outcomes.10 Although there are many benefits of engaging in physical activity
      during cancer treatments, activity levels typically decline throughout treatment.2 Existing
      research has relied on self-reported activity levels, which is a poor measure of
      low-intensity activities and can only capture a periodic snap shot of activity
      levels.2,11,12This study will provide objective physical activity data across the entirety of
      the patient's chemotherapy treatments. This in depth data will provide a new perspective on
      the patterns of activity levels and help to identify if there are critical times in which to
      intervene to prevent physical activity declines.

        Potentially eligible patients who are planning to initiate chemotherapy for breast cancer
        will be identified through the Breast Care Clinic. Our power calculation is based on the
        proportion of patients who successfully complete the study, defined as ≥70% of participants
        wearing the Fitbit and completing the post-chemotherapy follow-up assessment. Using a
        1-sided 1-sample binomial test with α = 0.05, 50 patients, an expected successful
        completion proportion of 70%, we will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis if 53%
        or fewer participants successfully complete the protocol. In other words, the intervention
        will be considered feasible if 27 or more participants in complete the protocol.
