      The overall aim of this research is to adapt and evaluate the efficacy of a parenting program
      compared to a parental self-care program for Active Duty families. A sample of 150 Active
      Duty families with young children who have a parent scheduled to deploy in the next six
      months will be recruited to participate. Families will be assigned either to receive the
      Strong Families Strong Forces Parenting Program, designed to reduce the impact of deployment
      separation on parenting stress and co-parenting, or to the Strong Parents Self-Care program,
      designed to support parents to focus on the importance of self-care throughout the deployment
      cycle. Investigators will compare the two groups on parenting stress, quality of parent-child
      relationships, parenting/co-parenting, and family and child well-being.
