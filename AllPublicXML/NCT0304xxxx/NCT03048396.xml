  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterus transplantation will be performed from live donors to patients with absolute uterine
      factor infertility. Organ procurement from the donor will be performed by laparotomy.
      Transplantation will also be performed by laparotomy. Embryo transfer will be done 10-12
      months after transplantation. After birth of 1-3 children the uterus will be removed by
      hysterectomy.
