    <textblock>
      Arterial flushing is a standard recommendation in deceased donor liver transplantation but
      not in living donor liver transplantation due to the risk of arterial intimal injury and
      short cold ischaemia time. There is recent evidence on benefit of retrograde arterial
      perfusion using hepatic venous occlusion and its benefits on post transplant cholestasis.
      However there is no data on antegrade arterial flushing.

    <textblock>
      Biliary reconstruction has been labeled the &quot;Achilles heel&quot; of liver transplantation and is a
      common cause of postoperative morbidity and also mortality .Living donor liver
      transplantation (LDLT) has a higher incidence of biliary complications of up to 30% which is
      higher than Deceased Donor Liver Transplantation and does not seem to improve significantly
      with experience.The virtually unchanged incidence of biliary strictures suggests that they
      are not simply &quot;technical&quot; in origin, but probably represent a mucosa ischemic injury
      inherent in the transplantation procedure. The blood supply of the bile duct is mainly from
      the arterial system and skeletonisation of the duct during dissection impairs the blood
      supply rendering it ischemic.

      Various donor maneuvers for better flushing and preserving peribiliary vascular plexus and
      biliary mucosa have been studied to decrease biliary complications. LDLT have advantages of
      haemodynamic stable donor and short cold ischemia but also has disadvantages of small graft
      size, small ducts, complicated reconstruction and absence of arterial flush. Conventional
      portal flush in animal livers could not remove warm blood from the arterial system and grafts
      without retrograde arterial flush had higher post operative bilirubin.With further studies in
      Living Donor Liver Transplant, it was concluded that retrograde flushing may ameliorate post
      operative cholestasis. There has not been data published on antegrade arterial flushing and
      its effect on biliary complications in Living Donor Liver Transplant. This study aims to
      compare back table graft arterial and portal flushing with portal flushing alone and evaluate
      biliary and arterial complications.

      Arterial flushing has been made part of standard protocol at our institute and its safety
      established. There are centers which routinely perform back table arterial flush.
