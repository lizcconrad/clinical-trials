  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The contribution of genetic risk factors to the development of focal dystonias is evident.
      However, understanding of how variations in the causative gene expression lead to variations
      in brain abnormalities in different phenotypes of dystonia (e.g., familial, sporadic) remains
      limited. The research program of the investigators is set to determine the relationship
      between brain changes and genetic risk factors in spasmodic dysphonia (or laryngeal
      dystonia). The researchers use a novel approach of combined imaging genetics, next-generation
      DNA sequencing, and clinico-behavioral testing. The use of a cross-disciplinary approach as a
      tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap from DNA sequence
      to pathophysiology of dystonia holds a promise for the understanding of the mechanistic
      aspects of brain function affected by risk gene variants, which can be used reliably for
      discovery of associated genes and neural integrity markers for this disorder. The expected
      outcome of this study may lead to better clinical management of this disorder, including its
      improved detection, accurate diagnosis, and assessment of the risk to develop spasmodic
      dysphonia in family members.

    <textblock>
      Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is an isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective
      impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized
      clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the
      absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of
      understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development
      of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. The objective of this application is to
      identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. The central
      hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by
      underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be
      used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. The rationale for the proposed studies is
      that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by
      establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential
      persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical
      therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging,
      machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, the central hypothesis will
      be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and
      genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and
      (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This
      research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery
      of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD
      pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and
      expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural
      markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected
      to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management
      and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  SD patients with clinically documented adductor or abductor form with and without
             familial history of SD and/or other forms of isolated dystonia

          -  Unaffected relatives with a negative history of laryngeal, neurological, or
             psychiatric problems who are first-degree relatives of patients with sporadic or
             familial SD

          -  Healthy controls with a negative history of laryngeal, neurological, or psychiatric
             problems and a negative family history of dystonia and any other movement disorders

          -  Age from 21 to 80 years.

          -  Native English speakers.

          -  Right-handedness.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are incapable of giving an informed consent.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women until a time when the women are no longer pregnant or
             breastfeeding. All women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test
             performed, which must be negative for participation in the imaging studies.

          -  Subjects with past or present medical history of (a) neurological problems, such as
             stroke, movement disorders (other than SD in the patient groups), brain tumors,
             traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness, ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia
             gravis, demyelinating diseases, alcoholism, drug dependence; (b) psychiatric problems,
             such as schizophrenia, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder; (c)
             laryngeal problems, such as vocal fold paralysis, paresis, vocal fold nodules and
             polyps, carcinoma, chronic laryngitis.

          -  Patients who are not symptomatic at present due to treatment with botulinum toxin
             injections into the laryngeal muscles. The duration of positive effects of botulinum
             toxin vary from patient to patient but last on average for 3-4 months. Prior to
             entering the study, all patients will be evaluated to ensure that they are fully
             symptomatic and are at least 3 months post last injection.

          -  To avoid the possibility of confounding effects of drugs acting upon the central
             nervous system, all study participants will be questioned about any prescribed or
             over-the-counter medications as part of their initial intake screening. Those patients
             who receive medication(s) affecting the central nervous system will be excluded from
             the study.

          -  The patients will be asked whether they have undergone any head and neck surgeries,
             particularly any brain surgery and laryngeal surgeries, such as thyroplasty, laryngeal
             denervation, and selective laryngeal adductor denervation-reinnervation. Because both
             brain and laryngeal surgery may potentially lead to the brain structure and function
             re-organization, patients with history of brain and/or laryngeal surgery might be
             excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects who have extensive tattoos on their head and neck, ferromagnetic objects in
             their bodies (e.g., implanted stimulators, surgical clips, prosthesis, artificial
             heart valve, etc.) that cannot be removed for the purpose of imaging study
             participation.
