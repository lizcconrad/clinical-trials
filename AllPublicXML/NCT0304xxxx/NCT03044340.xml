    <textblock>
      Erythromelalgy (EM) is a vascular syndrome very rare affecting the feet. This disease evolve
      by crisis when the feet extremities become red hot and painful. There are several types of EM
      but this study concern the adult primitive form. For a long time, the physiopathology was not
      described but now we know that there is a vascular form, with microcirculatory dysfunction
      and a neurologic form with small fibers neuropathy. The diagnostic of neurologic form is
      based on clinical evaluation (DN4 questionnaire, UENS scale...) and an electromyography.
      Thermotest, a medical device which measure the thermic sensitivity is used to quantify
      neuropathy. More recently Sudoscan, a device measuring cutaneous impedance to chloride ions
      detect small nervous fiber in diabetic patients with good correlation with Thermotest.

      The purpose of this study is to analyze the vascular side and the neurologic side on patients
      consulting for Erythromelalgy.
