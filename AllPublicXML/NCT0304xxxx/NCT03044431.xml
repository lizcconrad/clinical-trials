  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Lung Institute is to collect and isolate a patient's own cells and
      platelet rich plasma (PRP) and deliver the product back to the patient the same day. Lung
      Institute's treatment is limited to self-funded patients with chronic lung disease- chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and restrictive lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis
      (PF) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient's cells and platelet rich plasma are
      harvested through venous or bone marrow collection techniques.

      The hypothesized outcomes of therapy are safety and minimization of adverse events, a
      perceived improvement in the patient's lung condition (to be determined by their perceived
      quality of life), an improvement in the FEV1 among COPD patients, the ability to reduce
      supplemental oxygen use, the ability to function well without the use of rescue inhalers,
      reduction of secondary pulmonary infections, reduction in emergency room visits and
      exacerbations related to their disease.

      Through the collection of outcomes data, Lung Institute aims to explore and describe the
      safety and efficacy of autologous stem cell treatment for chronic lung disease with
      dissemination to the public and to the medical community for the advancement of regenerative
      medicine. The study aims to confirm the safety of autologous cell therapy, explore the effect
      of autologous cell therapy treatment on pulmonary function over time, and to describe the
      anecdotal quality of life changes of patients following treatment using quantitative and
      qualitative measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are included in treatment by self-referral and after consultation with a
             designated patient coordinator who determines initial eligibility, and then by the
             clinic nurse practitioner or physician of Lung Institute who determines final

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study is limited by a small sample size for post-treatment pulmonary function test returns and the self-reporting of quality of life scores. The CCQ measure quantifiable and can show trends over time, but it remains a subjective measure.</limitations_and_caveats>
