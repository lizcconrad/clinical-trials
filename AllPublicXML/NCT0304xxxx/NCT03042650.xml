      The purpose of this study is to determine if Intensive Referral Intervention increases
      motivation to quit cigarette smoking and quitting-related behaviors in probationers and also
      to determine if Intensive Referral Intervention improves short-term substance use outcomes in
      probationers with substance use disorder.

      This is a longitudinal study of adults on probation who have a Substance Use Disorder (SUD)
      and smoke cigarettes. One-half of probation officers will be trained in the Intensive
      Referral Intervention (IRI) while one-half will deliver Standard Practice which is to
      encourage support group attendance. Research staff will assess fidelity to the IRI in trained
      probation officers. The investigators propose to enroll 150 probationers over a four month
      period and complete 3 and 6-month follow-up interviews to assess smoking and substance use
      measures.
