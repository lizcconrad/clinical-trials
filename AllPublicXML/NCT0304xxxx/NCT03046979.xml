      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with
      advanced HCC.

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver. It is
      lack of effective drugs for systemic treatment of HCC. Currently, Sorafenib is the only
      choice approved by FDA for advanced HCC, although it prolongs the survival for less than 3
      months. The treatment of advanced HCC still has a long way to go.

      At present, the relevant phase II and phase III clinical studies of apatinib on advanced HCC
      are ongoing. Based on our important discovery of our previous clinical studies, we intends to
      enlarge the sample size and make further observation for the efficacy and safety of apatinib
      in patients with advanced HCC.
