    <textblock>
      Recombinant human GM-CSF herpes simplex virus injection (OrienX010) is a genetically
      engineered from Chinese patients oral separation of wild type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV) as
      the carrier insert GM-CSF gene therapy drug.After gene recombination technology successively
      removing ICP34.5, ICP47 and insert the deactivation ICP6 gene, and at the site of the
      original ICP34.5 insert guided by IE promoter of hCMV human gm-csf gene.The drug after tumor
      site local injections of dosing, on the one hand, because of the soluble tumor
      characteristics of herpes simplex virus, reconstructing it after HSV-1 virus carrier at the
      injection site specific &quot;soluble tumor&quot; kill tumor cells;Viral vector expressed in tumor
      site, on the other hand, to produce high concentrations of GM-CSF enhance the antitumor
      immune function, play &quot;beside the destruction effect&quot;, have inhibition effect on the distant
      metastases.

      Subjects were tested drugs within 8 x 107 pfu/ml tumor injection treatment, the injection
      quantity according to tumor lesion size, injection amount shall not exceed 10 ml each time,
      injection frequency for every 2 weeks, 4 times per cycle treatment, treatment 2 cycles.
      Completed at the end of the second cycle after curative effect evaluation, such as the
      researchers determine continue to medicine can bring benefit to the subjects, can continue to
      offer benefits to the subjects' potential drug until disease progression, smaller, not
      tolerance toxicity or participants to withdraw consent.

Research and development of the source and force of recombinant human GM-CSF herpes simplex virus injection (OrienX010), is a genetically engineered type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV - 1) as the carrier insert GM-CSF gene therapy drug.Its carrier is made of isolated from patients with oral Chinese wild single blister virus type I (CL1), after gene recombination technology successively removing ICP34.5, ICP47 and insert the deactivation ICP6 gene, and at the site of the original ICP34.5 insert guided by IE promoter of hCMV human GM-CSF gene.</description>
