    <textblock>
      High-risk obstetrical patient Intervention to promote Birth Interval Spacing utilizing the
      Contraceptive CHOICE project script to reduce Unintended Subsequent pregnancies (HIBISCUS) is
      a collaborative study utilizing qualitative methods to assess the acceptability including a
      family planning specialist's postpartum contraception counseling during and after prenatal
      care among Latina obstetric women with pre-gestational diabetes. The investigators will
      compare the effectiveness of HIBISCUS versus usual contraceptive counseling on Long-Acting
      Reversible Contraception (LARC) use at 3 months postpartum.

      The purpose of this research is to address this gap in long-acting reversible contraception
      (LARC) counseling among Latinas who have pregnancies complicated by pre-gestational diabetes
      in order to promote optimal birth-to-pregnancy spacing and planned pregnancies with optimal
      glucose control. The investigators will utilize Contraceptive CHOICE project which was LARC
      focused counseling script and removed the cost of contraception. This study had a LARC
      utilization of 75% compared to the national use of LARC of 7.2% The investigators will
      conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial among Latina obstetrics patients with
      pre-gestational diabetes involving a prenatal and postpartum visit with a family planning
      specialist versus usual contraceptive counseling. The family planning specialist counseling
      will utilize the Contraceptive CHOICE Project script promoting LARC, 18 month
      birth-to-pregnancy recommendation and preconception counseling. The intervention's name is
      HIBISCUS.
