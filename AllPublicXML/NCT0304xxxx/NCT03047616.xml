  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1 pathway have been developed with
      clinical trials showing an approximately 20% durable response in unselected patients with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). At the moment, no clear biomarker exists to
      accurately predict anti-PD1/PDL1 tumor responsiveness. The goal of this study is to broadly
      discover and evaluate the utility of blood based biomarkers for use in measuring and
      predicting response to immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer.
