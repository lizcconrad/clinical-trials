  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well selumetinib sulfate works in treating patients with
      pancreatic cancer with KRAS G12R mutations that has spread from where it started to nearby
      tissue or lymph nodes or other places in the body. Selumetinib sulfate may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate to selumetinib sulfate (selumetinib) administered as
      75 mg orally twice daily on a continuous schedule in patients with advanced pancreas cancer
      harboring KRAS G12R mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable
      and stage IV pancreas cancer treated with selumetinib monotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the safety of selumetinib in patients with advanced pancreas cancer.

      III. To determine the impact of additional genetic alterations on the response to selumetinib
      in pancreas cancer harboring KRAS G12R mutations.

      IV. To develop a clinically applicable biomarker predicting response to selumetinib in
      pancreas cancer harboring KRAS G12R mutations.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 27 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 52 weeks.

    <description>Will determine whether this novel agent is able to be associated with a response rate (partial response [PR] + complete response) that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of an improved response rate of 30% (p1=0.30).</description>

    <description>If there are 5 or more patients who experience grade 3 or greater toxicity attributable to the agent, then comparisons between this cohort and patients who tolerated the same course of selumetinib without toxicity across grades of toxicity with respect to outcome (response) and clinicopathological parameters (age, sex, type of metastatic involvement vs locally advanced) may be done using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Otherwise, toxicities will be tabulated and described.</description>

    <description>Presence of variants identified in the 50-cancer gene panel will be compared with response, presenting the results in a 2x2 table with findings reported descriptively. Pre-treatment ctDNA levels will be divided into groups to separate aberrant values from the rest. The cutoffs will be &gt; and &lt; 2 standard deviations of the mean, with the cutoffs applied to both ctDNA levels. Based on these groups, resulting in patients with cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) transcripts levels &gt; 2 standard deviation (SD) above the mean, patients with cfDNA transcripts levels &lt; 2 SD below the mean, and the rest in between, the categorical results will be evaluated and reported relative to response vs. non-response in a descriptive manner.</description>

    <description>cfDNA transcript levels will be followed from the start of treatment every (q)2 weeks and the change to pre-treatment will be plotted for each timepoint in a spider plot format. This will be a descriptive presentation only. Variant profile derived from voluntary repeat biopsies will be compared to pre-treatment variant profile and gain of variants (adjusted for similar sequencing depth) will be recorded.
