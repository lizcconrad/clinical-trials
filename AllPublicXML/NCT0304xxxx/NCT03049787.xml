  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate physical therapy (standard of care) and home exercise vs. home
      exercise alone for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with adhesive capsulitis receive a glenohumeral and subacromial injection routinely
      for treatment. In addition, the patients are routinely prescribed physical therapy with a
      home exercise component. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether home exercise alone
      is an alternative option to physical therapy. Patients will be approached about the study
      after they have agreed to receive a glenohumeral and subacromial injection per standard of
      care for their clinical treatment. The hypothesis being tested is whether home exercise is
      alone is as beneficial for pain relief, restoration of range of motion, and improvement in
      shoulder disability from adhesive capsulitis as physical therapy. Additionally sex
      differences, diabetes mellitus, endocrine, and mental health histories will be noted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical Diagnosis of Adhesive Capsulitis (limited range of motion)

          2. Given glenohumeral and subacromial injection as part of standard care.

          3. Capacity to conduct home exercise program or physical therapy (based upon physician
             judgment, proximity to physical therapy office and as decided by patient)

          4. English speaking

          5. 18 years of age or greater

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior glenohumeral or subacromial corticosteroid injection within 6 months

          2. Prior ipsilateral shoulder surgery

          3. Current prescription (narcotic) pain medication use

          4. Pain disorder (ex. Fibromyalgia, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy)

          5. Cervical radiculopathy

          6. Full-thickness rotator cuff tear

          7. Calcific Tendinopathy (past or present)

          8. Advanced Stage osteoarthritis as seen on radiograph

          9. Past/present ipsilateral shoulder fracture

         10. Women that may be pregnant or nursing (self report)

        Past/present physical therapy treatment will be documented, but will not be considered an
        exclusion factor. The reasoning behind this is that the physical therapy likely was not
        properly targeting the adhesive capsulitis for the patient to arrive in an orthopaedic
        clinic and is likely at a similar starting point to most other patients regardless of
        previous physical therapy. All patients currently enrolled in physical therapy will be
        assigned to either our physical therapy or home exercise program.
