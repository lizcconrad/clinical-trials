  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this community-based randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the outcomes
      of a theory-based parent engagement intervention (i.e., culturally-tailored video) aimed at
      promoting the participation of Filipino parents and grandparents in an evidence-based
      preventive parenting intervention.

      Data will be obtained using pre and post surveys with self-report instruments and enrollment
      logs. It is hypothesized that 1) Parents and grandparents in the Intervention Arm will
      demonstrate greater behavioral outcomes (intention to enroll, actual enrollment, and
      participation in parenting intervention sessions) than those in the Control Arm. 2) Parents
      and grandparents in the Intervention Arm will show greater improvements from baseline in
      parent determinants (knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, benefits, and barriers) compared to the
      Control Arm. 3) Parents' intention to enroll, actual enrollment, and participation in IY will
      be predicted by the study arm and parent determinants. This study is expected to have an
      important impact on the uptake of evidence-based parenting interventions among hard-to-reach
      populations and holds the promise of eliminating disparities in behavioral health outcomes in
      this understudied and growing minority population.
