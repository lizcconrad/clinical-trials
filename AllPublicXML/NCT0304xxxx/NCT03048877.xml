  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAIR-DTC) is a great challenge
      in the treatment of thyroid cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), like sorafenib and
      lenvatinib which have been approved by food and drug administration (FDA), could not be
      affordable for most of the Chinese patients. Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor
      and reduces the angiogenesis of tumor efficiently, which had been proven effective in many
      solid tumors, is a Chinese domestic TKI targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      (VEGFR). A phase II study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of apatinib in RAIR-DTC was
      enrolled 20 patients, and 10 of them had obtained a shout-term efficacy,the study demonstrate
      the peculiar potential in treatment of RAIR-DTC. In this study, the investigators aim to
      further explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib in RAIR-DTC.
