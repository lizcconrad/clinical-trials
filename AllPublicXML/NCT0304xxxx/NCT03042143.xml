  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) causes the lungs to fail due to the collection of
      fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema). ARDS is common in severely ill patients in Intensive
      Care Units and is associated with a high mortality and a high morbidity in those who survive.
      There is a large economic burden with direct healthcare costs, but also indirectly due to the
      impact on the carer and patient through the patients inability to return to full time
      employment. There is little evidence for effective drug (pharmacological) treatment for ARDS.
      There is increasing information that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might be important in
      treating ARDS. REALIST will investigate if a single infusion of MSCs will help in the
      treatment of ARDS. The first step will be to first of all determine what dose of MSCs is safe
      and then divide patients suffering from ARDS into two groups, one of which will get MSCs and
      the other a harmless dummy (or placebo) infusion, who will then be followed up to determine
      if lung function improves. If effective this may lead to further research to determine if
      MSCs are effective in patients with ARDS. This project will also provide new information
      about mechanisms in the development of ARDS leading, potentially, to other new treatments

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of MSCs as a novel treatment in ARDS. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are a
      mononuclear cell population that have the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages,
      and bone, cartilage and adipocyte cells in particular. Cell-based therapies have been termed
      the &quot;next pillar of Medicine&quot;. MSCs constitute an innovative approach with substantial
      therapeutic promise for ARDS. MSCs possess several favorable biological characteristics,
      including convenient isolation, ease of expansion in culture while maintaining genetic
      stability, minimal immunogenicity and feasibility for allogenic transplantation.

      MSCs reduce inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance during rodent and murine bacterial
      pneumonia, and augment repair of the animal and human lung. Large animal studies have also
      replicated these beneficial effects. Bone marrow derived (BM) hMSCs decreased acute lung
      injury (ALI), without producing organ toxicity, in endotoxin injured pigs. Two randomised
      small phase 1 studies of plastic adherent MSCs in patients with ARDS have taken place. In
      Japan, investigators used adipose-derived plastic adherent cells in a small cohort (n=12) of
      patients with ARDS randomized 1:1 to MSCs or placebo: showing that the cells were safe and
      well-tolerated in this patient group, and were associated with reduced plasma levels of the
      alveolar epithelial cell injury marker SP-D. In the US Matthay has completed the phase 1
      START trial, using a dose escalation study of plastic adherent bone marrow derived MSCs, in
      patients with moderate to severe ARDS. START showed that marrow derived MSCs at similar doses
      to those proposed in this study are safe and well-tolerated, (n=9), with a trend to reduced
      lung injury in the group treated with the highest (10x106cells/kg) compared with the lower
      doses, 1-5x106cells/kg.

      Research hypothesis:

      In adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS, human umbilical cord derived CD362 +ve MSCs,
      (Cyndacel-C cells) are safe and improve important surrogate clinical outcomes.

      Trial design:

      The phase 1 trial is an open label dose escalation pilot study in which cohorts of subjects
      with moderate to severe ARDS will receive increasing doses of a single infusion of Cyndacel-C
      in a 3+3 design. Initially 3 cohorts with 3 subjects/cohort. Planned doses for the 3 cohorts
      pending absence of safety concerns are 1 x 106 cells/kg, 5 x 106 cells/kg, and 10 x 106
      cells/kg.

      After 7 days of follow-up for all study subjects in the phase 1 study is available the TMG
      will review the data and propose a cell dose for the phase 2 trial. This recommendation will
      be submitted to the DSMB for approval prior to initiating the phase 2 trial. For planning
      purposes, the phase 2 trial has been designed using the 10 x 106 cells/kg, dose assuming it
      will be the maximal tolerated dose.

      The phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, allocation concealed placebo-controlled
      study using the 10x106 cell/kg dose of Cyndacel-C or the maximal tolerable dose as determined
      by the DSMB in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

      Primary objective:

      To assess the safety of a single intravenous infusion of Cyndacel-C cells in patients with
      ARDS.

      Secondary objectives:

      In patients with moderate to severe ARDS to determine the effect of a single intravenous
      infusion of Cyndacel-C cells on:

        1. Physiological indices of respiratory dysfunction reflecting severity of ARDS, as
           measured by oxygenation index (OI), respiratory compliance, and P/F ratio

        2. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score

        3. Alveolar and systemic markers of inflammatory responses

        4. Alveolar and systemic markers of cell specific injury

      Population:

      Patients will be prospectively screened daily. All patients with ARDS will be entered into a
      screening log. If the patient is not recruited the reason will be recorded. A fully
      anonymised minimal dataset will be recorded on these patients (age, gender, APACHE II score,
      worst P/F ratio at time of assessment, reasons for non-enrolment and vital status). APACHE II
      score and vital status will be collected using anonymised linkage to the ICNARC database
      through a defined CMP number (or equivalent). This will allow comparison to identify that the
      study population is representative of the overall cohort of patients. This information is
      required to establish an unbiased study population and to ensure the study can be reported in
      keeping with CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org).

      Patient consent:

      Informed consent procedure:

      The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin
      in the Declaration of Helsinki. The chief investigator (CI) (or designee) is responsible for
      ensuring that informed consent for trial participation is given by each patient or a legal
      representative. An appropriately trained doctor or nurse may take consent. The person taking
      informed consent must be GCP trained, suitably qualified and experienced and have been
      delegated this duty on the delegation log. Appropriate signatures and dates must be obtained
      on the informed consent documentation prior to collection of trial data and administration of
      the trial drug. If no consent is given a patient cannot be randomised into the trial. The
      incapacitating nature of the condition precludes obtaining prospective informed consent from
      participants. In this situation informed consent will be sought from a Personal Legal
      Representative or Professional Legal representative.

      Personal legal representative consent:

      Informed consent will be sought from the patient's personal legal representative (Per LR) who
      may be a relative, partner or close friend. The Per LR will be informed about the trial by
      the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and provided with a copy of the
      covering statement for the Per LR with an attached participant information sheet (PIS) and
      asked to give an opinion as to whether the patient would object to taking part in such
      medical research. If the Per LR decides that the patient would have no objection to
      participating in the trial the Per LR will be asked to sign the Per LR consent form which
      will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The original will be retained in the
      trial site file and a copy given to the Per LR and another copy placed in the patients'
      medical records.

      Professional legal representative consent:

      As the patient is unable to give informed consent and no Per LR is available, a doctor who is
      not connected with the conduct of the trial may act as a professional legal representative
      (Prof LR). The doctor will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a
      member of the research team and given a copy of the PIS. If the doctor decides that the
      patient is suitable for entry into the trial that doctor will be asked to sign the
      professional legal representative consent form. The original will be retained in the trial
      site file and a copy given to the Prof LR and another copy placed in the patients' medical
      records.

      Retrospective patient consent:

      Patients will be informed of their participation in the trial by the responsible clinician or
      a member of the research team once the patient regain capacity to understand the details of
      the trial. The responsible clinician or a member of the research team will discuss the study
      with the patient and the patient will be given a copy of the PIS to keep. The patient will be
      asked for consent to participate in the trial and to sign the consent to continue form which
      will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The original will be retained in the
      trial site file and a copy given to the patient and another copy placed in the patients'
      medical records. Where consent to continue is not obtained, consent from the legal
      representative will remain valid. If the patient refuses consent, permission to use data
      collected to that point and to access medical records for trial data will be requested from
      the patient.

      Withdrawal of consent:

      Patients may withdraw or be withdrawn (by Per LR or Prof LR) from the trial at any time
      without prejudice.

      In the event of a request to withdraw from the study, the researcher will determine which
      elements of the trial are to be withdrawn from the following possibilities and this will be
      documented:

        -  Cyndacel-C administration if ongoing

        -  On-going data collection during hospital admission

        -  Confirmation of vital status

        -  On-going data collection following hospital discharge In the event that the request is
           to withdraw from all elements of the study, only anonymised data recorded up to the
           point of withdrawal will be included in the study analysis.

      Consent will also be requested to use the samples collected to that point.

      Investigational medicinal product:

      The investigational MSC product is allogeneic donor CD362+ human umbilical cord-derived
      mesenchymal stromal cells (CD362+UC-MSC; Cyndacel-C) which is a liquid cell suspension of ex
      vivo cultured human MSCs.

      Storage, thawing and reconstitution of Cyndacel-C cells:

      Trial guidelines will provide detailed information regarding the protocol for storage,
      thawing and reconstitution, and administration of the cell product Cyndacel-C and placebo.

      Drug storage:

      The study drug will be commenced as soon as possible following reconstitution and within 4
      hours.

      Study drug termination criteria:

      Study drug will be continued until one of the following is met:

        1. Study drug related adverse event

        2. Death or discontinuation of active treatment

        3. Request from Per LR or Pro LR to withdraw the patient from the study

        4. Decision by the attending clinician on safety grounds.

      Study drug compliance:

      Any omission of the study drug will be recorded in the CRF to monitor compliance.

      Study drug accountability:

      The clinical trials pharmacist will be responsible for maintaining records of the study drug
      dispensed to patients in ICU. Drug administration will be recorded on the patient's
      prescription chart.

      Study drug return and destruction:

      At the end of the treatment period any remaining unused study drug will be returned to the
      hospital pharmacy. Destruction of trial medication will be in accordance with pharmacy
      department's standard operating procedures (SOPs) and hospital waste management policy. A
      record of destruction will be maintained.

      Data Quality:

      The NICTU will provide training to site staff on trial processes and procedures including CRF
      completion and data collection. Within the NICTU the clinical data management process is
      governed by SOPs to ensure standardisation and adherence to International Conference on
      Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and regulatory requirements. Data
      is to be entered onto the electronic database as per the CRF entry timelines. On-site
      monitoring visits during the trial will check: (i) the accuracy of the data entered into the
      CRF, (ii) entries against source documents alongside adherence to the protocol, (iii) trial
      specific procedures and (iv) Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This monitoring will be carried
      out as per the trial specific Monitoring Plan. Changes to data will be recorded and fully
      auditable. Data errors will be documented and corrective actions implemented. Data validation
      will be implemented and discrepancy reports will be generated following data entry to
      identify data that may be out of range or inconsistent, or protocol deviations, based on data
      validation checks programmed into the clinical trial database. For routinely collected
      clinical data the NHS record will be the source document and for study specific measurements
      the CRF will be the source document.

      Data management:

      The PI (or designee) will collect all data and record this in the CRF. Each participant will
      be allocated a unique participant study number at trial entry, and this, and initials, will
      be used to identify him or her on the CRF for the duration of the trial. Data will be
      collected from the time of trial entry until hospital discharge. Trial data will be entered
      onto a CRF and processed electronically as per NICTU SOPs and the study specific Data
      Management Plan (DMP). Submitted data will be reviewed for completeness and entered onto a
      secure, backed-up custom database. Due care will be taken to ensure data safety and
      integrity, and compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Data queries will be raised
      electronically. The designated site staff will be required to respond to these queries within
      2 weeks and send them back to the CTU after the queries have been reviewed and signed by the
      CI/delegated staff member. Any amended information will then be entered in the study
      database. A copy of the signed data query form should be retained with the CRF at the
      investigator site.

      If the participant is transferred to another hospital the PI or designated member of the site
      study team will liaise with the receiving hospital to ensure complete data capture as per CRF
      instruction. If this is not possible, the primary outcome must be collected as a minimum.
      CRFs are to be submitted to the CTU as per the CRF submission schedule. Data censorship for
      each trial will occur 90 days post randomisation.

      Data analysis:

      The primary analysis will be conducted on all outcome data obtained from all participants
      regardless of protocol adherence, i.e. intention to treat analysis.

      It is possible that some enrolled subjects may not be treated with study drug. Therefore a
      secondary analysis of the all-treated population analysis will be undertaken.

      Statistical methods:

      For the Phase 1 trial no formal statistical analysis will be performed on safety data. The
      primary analysis will be descriptive and will focus on adverse events. The number of
      pre‐specified cell infusion‐associated events will also be reported. The maximal tolerated
      dose up to 10x106cells /kg will be determined by the DSMB and used in the randomized
      controlled clinical trial.

      For the Phase 2 trial, adverse event will be reported as for the phase 1 study. For
      continuously distributed outcomes, differences between groups will be tested using
      independent samples t-tests and analysis of covariance with transformations of variables to
      normality if appropriate, or non-parametric equivalents. Chi-square tests (or Fisher's Exact
      tests) will be used for categorical variables. A p value of 0.05 will be considered as
      significant. A single final analysis is planned at the end of the phase 2 trial. A detailed
      statistical analysis plan will be written before the statistical analysis commences. All the
      power calculations and methodology for data analysis have been confirmed by TBC, Senior
      Biostatiscian, Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit (NICTU).

      Missing data:

      Every effort will be made to minimise missing baseline and outcome data in this trial. The
      level and pattern of the missing data in the baseline variables and outcomes will be
      established by forming appropriate tables and the likely causes of any missing data will be
      investigated. This information will be used to determine whether the level and type of
      missing data has the potential to introduce bias into the analysis results for the proposed
      statistical methods, or substantially reduce the precision of estimates related to treatment
      effects. If necessary, these issues will be dealt with using multiple imputation or Bayesian
      methods for missing data as appropriate.

      Sample size:

      The phase 1 trial will recruit 9-18 participants. Although the primary focus of the phase 2
      trial is safety, there is, however, power to detect a difference in physiological outcomes.
      The primary efficacy outcome measure will be the difference in OI between the Cyndacel-C and
      placebo treated groups at day 7. Based on data from a recently completed clinical trial in
      ARDS, the mean (standard deviation; SD) OI at day 7 in patients with ARDS is 62(51)cmH2O/kPa.
      To allow 2:1 recruitment (Cyndacel-C vs placebo) a sample size of 63 subjects (42 Cyndacel-C,
      21 placebo) will have 80% power at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05 to detect a
      clinically significant difference of 39 cmH2O/kPa in OI between groups. In a previous phase 2
      study of similar size an intervention can demonstrate a change in OI of a similar magnitude
      confirming a treatment effect of this size can be achieved.

      Although few withdrawals or loss to follow-up are anticipated this has been allowed for this
      in the sample size calculation. In previous UK multicentre studies in the critically ill &lt;3%
      withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up. Therefore, a conservative drop-out rate of 5% has
      been estimated and the study will require a total of 66 patients (44 patients in the
      Cyndacel-C and 22 in the placebo group).
