  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, 24% of UK men were obese. However men rarely participate in weight loss programmes.
      This study looks at whether two interventions which show promise can help obese men lose
      weight and keep it off.

      INTERVENTION 1: Sending text messages to a mobile phone. These will be written as though they
      come from other men who are also losing weight and include 'how to do it' diet and physical
      activity tips, combined with friendly humour and support.

      INTERVENTION 2: The same texts plus promising men money at the start contingent on weight
      loss achievement. The money will vary over a year according to whether weight targets are
      met. This is called an endowment incentive and is based on research showing that modest
      payment helps people change their diet and physical activity. At the 3, 6 and 12 month
      weighing appointments, men will have the option of continuing with the original weight loss
      targets of 5%, 10% and 10% or setting lower targets of 5% of body weight at 6 months and 5%
      at 12 months. This is to maintain motivation and hope for men who do not meet the more
      ambitious weight loss targets.

      This study examines if the texts work better with incentives than alone. Both interventions
      are delivered from a computer and have potential to reach large numbers, including men who
      don't use health services. This work is done together with obese men and a charity for men to
      help us find the best ways to deliver the interventions to as many men as possible, including
      men in difficult life situations.

      This study will examine whether it is acceptable and feasible to randomise obese men to three
      groups: texts only; texts and incentive; or to a 'control group' who wait a year and then get
      the texts for 3 months. The feasibility of recruiting 105 obese men from two regions of
      Scotland will be assessed. Half of the men will get an invitation letter from their GP. The
      other half will be approached in the community, given information about the study and invited
      to take part. Men can take part if their waist circumference is 40 inches and more or their
      Body Mass Index is 30 or higher. The study examines how long it takes to find 105 obese men
      who want to take part, how many come back to suitable venues at 3, 6 and 12 months to get
      weighed and answer questions about their quality of life, lifestyle and motivation. At the
      end participants will report about their experiences of weight loss and of being in the
      study.

    <description>A decision whether to proceed to a full effectiveness and cost-effectiveness RCT for the SMS intervention, with or without an incentive, compared to a waiting list control. This will be based on the progression criteria:
Acceptability of the intervention and the control group (willingness to be randomised, intervention engagement, participant retention, qualitative views)
Feasibility of recruiting 105 men in 4 months
12 month outcomes on at least 72 % of men randomised per group
Evidence of mean weight loss of at least 3% of baseline weight at 12 months in any intervention group
An Independent Trial Steering Committee will decide whether the findings support a two or three arm trial or not</description>

There will be no interim measurements or contacts by the research team. Men are therefore free to choose whether to try to lose weight during the 12 months.
Participants in all three trial arms will receive information (web or print) about weight loss and a pedometer.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Narrative SMS</intervention_name>
    <description>Narrative SMS have been defined as interactive life stories based around a range of characters (varying in age and socio-demographics) which can simulate the processes that make group-based interventions successful: humour, banter, peer support, facts about diet and PA and evidence based BCTs. The narrative form draws on real world learning from the film, television and games industry. When theorised, the narrative enables engagement with characters who convey the message of the intervention, and facilitate the viewer's empathy. Through creating an empathic bond with the character, users pay more attention to and become engaged and immersed within the story. This appears to lead to optimal learning and conceptualisation of the target information.</description>
