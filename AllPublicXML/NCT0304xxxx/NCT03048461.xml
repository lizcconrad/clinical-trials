    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
      in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia.

      This is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of autologous platelet rich plasma
      in subjects with moderate androgenetic alopecia. Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized
      into the study. The study is designed as an 18-month study consisting of 2 phases. This study
      was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.

      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be considered for enrollment.
