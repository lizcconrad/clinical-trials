  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn about the influence of two different behavioral
      interventions (lasting 8 weeks) involving sleep for lowering blood pressure, and to study the
      mechanisms involved. There is research evidence that healthy sleep promotes heart-health and
      may decrease blood pressure, and that sensitivity to insufficient or disrupted sleep may be
      influenced by sex. This research will compare two interventions that are each designed to
      improve sleep health, and will investigate sex differences in response. The project includes
      3 in-hospital stays with biological measurements to evaluate the underlying mechanisms
      associated with the effectiveness of two different blood pressure lowering behavioral
      interventions.

      The study involves home-based sleep-wake data collection before and during behavioral
      intervention, and 3 overnight stays in the hospital. For each hospital stay participants will
      be asked to arrive in the afternoon, and stay until the next evening. They will be provided
      dinner on the first day and breakfast, lunch and dinner on the second day. If they are taking
      any blood pressure medication they will continue to take it through the study. During the
      in-hospital stays, blood pressure will be measured continuously using two small finger cuffs.
      In order to monitor and record brain waves to determine sleep and wakefulness, small
      gold-coated disks called electrodes will be placed on the head and body. Heart rate, blood
      pressure and brain activity will be recorded for a little over 24 hours on each in-hospital
      stay. Before as well as during the in-hospital stays questions will be asked about sleep
      times, subjective sleepiness and other indices relating to well-being.
