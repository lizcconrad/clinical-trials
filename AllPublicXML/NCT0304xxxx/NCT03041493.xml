  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is find out if the use of Electronic cigarettes (EC) leads to the same changes that
      we see in blood vessels of traditional cigarettes (TC) users. The investigators will also
      enroll non-smokers as &quot;controls&quot;, against which they will measure changes in blood vessels in
      TC and EC users.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, non-randomized case controlled study of the effects of electronic cigarettes on vascular health. The study population will comprise the three groups based on the criteria EC users (experimental group), (TC) smokers (positive control) and nonsmokers (negative control).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>During the first encounter, blood pressure and endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) will be measured by flow mediated dilatation (FMD), and a small peripheral IV catheter will be placed in the participant's median antecubital or cephalic vein. A blood sample (10 mL) for EPCs and F2-isoprostanes will be collected. One urine sample will also be collected for measurement of urinary F2-isoprostanes, cotinine and creatinine. These will serve as both baseline measures for subsequent acute exposure to nicotine and as measures of chronic nicotine exposure. The second encounter will be scheduled 4 hours after the first encounter. At that time a blood sample (5 mL) for EPCs will be collected followed by harvesting of vascular endothelial cells for eNOS and NF-κB expression.</description>

    <description>During the first encounter, blood pressure and endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) will be measured by flow mediated dilatation (FMD), and a small peripheral IV catheter will be placed in the participant's median antecubital or cephalic vein. A blood sample (10 mL) for EPCs and F2-isoprostanes will be collected. One urine sample will also be collected for measurement of urinary F2-isoprostanes, cotinine and creatinine. These will be compared to the second set of laboratory measurements done at the second encounter that will be scheduled 4 hours after the first encounter. At that time an additional blood sample (5 mL) for EPCs will be collected followed by harvesting of vascular endothelial cells for eNOS and NF-κB expression.</description>
