      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common childhood motor disability. Spasticity and loss of
      dexterity are the major problems for motor disability of upper extremity (UE) in patients
      with CP. This study propose two novel treatment protocols: sensory electrical stimulation
      (SES) and virtual reality constraint-induced therapy (VRCIT) to improve function of UE in
      patients with CP. Investigators hypothesize that combined SES and VRCIT treatment have better
      effect than single therapy (SES or VRCIT).

    <description>The device (Hoggan-5081) for kinetic analysis combined range of motion (ROM), muscle testing (MicroFET3) and grip and pinch gauge (MicroFET4) and data capture software, attached to a computer for more thorough testing. MicroFET4 combined pinch gauge and grip tester in a single device with high test-retest reliability. The Grip Test included Maximum Grip Test, 5 Position Grip Test, Rapid Exchange Grip Test, Hand Grip Fatigue Test. The Pinch Test included key Pinch, palmar Pinch, and tip pinch. MicroFET3 combined Muscle Tester and ROM Gauge. Peak force and average strength were obtained. The padded attachment that was fit in the palm of the hand allowed the administrators to provide direct resistance to movement of the extremity. For arm strength test, the examiner manually stabilized the body parts proximal to the tested limb segment during testing and asked participants to exert a maximal isometric muscle contraction lasting 3-seconds while the dynamometer was held stationary.</description>
