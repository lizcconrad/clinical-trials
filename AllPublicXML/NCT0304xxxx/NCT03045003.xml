  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this phase II study is to test by feasibility and efficacy of two
      interprofessional supportive care interventions with different intensities to facilitate
      resilience in patients and thereby to reduce their unmet supportive care needs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intervention A (tested in arm A) includes screening of resilience and supportive care needs
      as well as direct feed-back of the screening results on a monitoring sheet to nurses and
      oncologists in charge of the patient. Nurses and oncologists follow three training sessions
      to be trained in a) resilience facilitation, b) interventions to adress supportive care
      needs, c) use of the monitoring sheet.

      Intervention B (tested in arm B) includes same intervention as arm A supplemented by 5
      structured nurse led consultations, two face to face (F2F), three by phone (PC) provided by
      clinical nurse specialists and based on a consultation manual.

    <description>Interventions tested in this study are the following: i) educational sessions with oncologists and nurses, ii) direct, electronic feed-back of resilience and needs screening in a monitoring sheet including intervention propositions and iii) consultation provided by a clinical nurse specialist to patients (in intervention B only) Interventions have been developed based on previous studies on the efficacy of screening of patient reported outcomes and direct feed-back to health care professionals and on previous studies on interventions to enhance resilience in nursing or psycho-oncology with proven efficacy. Interventions provided in the monitoring sheet have been validated by experienced Swiss oncology nurses, oncologists and psycho-oncologists.</description>
