    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate temporal organization of future thinking in patients
      with schizophrenia. Patients and control participants will be asked to envision and briefly
      describe ten personal future events using a cue-words list. Then they will be asked to
      describe everything that came to their minds (i.e. to think aloud) while they attempted to
      determine when an event will likely occur. The investigators will compare the proportion of
      several predefined strategies mentioned by the two groups of participants to locate future
      events in time. The investigators predict that patients will envision less personal future
      events and will rely to a lesser extent on strategies to locate events in time, than control
      participants.
