  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective in this study is to test whether propranolol lowers glucose and free
      fatty acid levels during sleep in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and preserves vascular
      function (EndoPAT) versus placebo. The secondary objective is to test whether propranolol
      influences sleep quality, architecture, and hemodynamics in OSA. OSA will be elicited by
      temporarily discontinuing CPAP therapy in patients with a history OSA accustomed to CPAP
      therapy (CPAP withdrawal).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Free fatty acids and glucose elevations occur during the night in obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) patients, and these elevations may be responsible for adverse cardio-metabolic
      consequences of OSA. The sympathetic nervous system is well known to mediate adipose tissue
      lipolysis as well as &quot;stress hyperglycemia&quot;. Thus, investigators may be able to mitigate
      these nocturnal metabolic changes with beta adrenergic blockade. Propranolol is a
      non-selective beta blocker that is used for a variety of indications including hypertension
      and anxiety. In this study investigators will administer propranolol or placebo to patients
      with OSA before sleep. Investigators will compare nocturnal metabolic profiles and
      hemodynamics on/off propranolol in the setting of CPAP withdrawal.

During sleep blood will be sampled from an indwelling IV for measurement of FFA, glucose, insulin, and triglycerides.
