  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experiment aims at investigating whether the doctor-patient communication has an
      influence on patients' willingness to take medication. Patients' attitude towards the
      medication is manipulated via a critical film sequence. Afterwards patients of the two
      experimental groups have a communication with one of the investigators of the study. Patients
      are told that the investigator is a medical doctor. The &quot;doctors&quot; either communicate in a
      patient-centered or doctor-centered style with the patient. Patients in the control group do
      not have the possibility to talk to a &quot;medical doctor&quot;. Afterwards patients are offered the
      aforementioned pill that is supposed to be a cognitive enhancer (actually placebo pill). Pill
      intake is voluntary. The investigators hypothesize that patients in the experimental group
      with the patient-centered style of communication are more likely to take the pill than
      patients in the experimental group with the doctor-centered style of communication or
      patients in the control group.
