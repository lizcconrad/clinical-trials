  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of liraglutide versus placebo
      over a follow-up period of 12 months in patients at least 18 months following Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass (RYGB) who are experiencing weight regain. This study will assess the efficacy
      of liraglutide in improving cardiometabolic risk profile (as indicated by serum lipids,
      HbA1c, and waist circumference) and quality of life (as assessed by PHQ-9 (Patient Health
      Questionnaire), versus placebo in patients at least 18 months following RYGB who are
      experiencing weight regain as well as the safety of liraglutide in this patient population.

      The specific aims of this study are to:

        -  To evaluate the effects of liraglutide on body weight loss in patients who are
           experiencing weight regain following RYGB.

        -  To evaluate the effects of liraglutide on cardiometabolic risk and quality of life in
           patients who are experiencing weight regain following RYGB.

        -  To evaluate the safety of liraglutide in post-RYGB subjects.

        -  To evaluate the changes in obesity-related comorbid conditions in patients who are
           experiencing weight regain following RYGB.
