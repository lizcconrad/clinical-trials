  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to further profile and develop the Lipopolysaccharide, endotoxin
      (LPS) challenge models (both by instillation and inhalation) by investigating the utility of
      various non-invasive monitoring methods.

      The hypothesis of the project is that local inflammatory changes in the lung induced by LPS
      can be captured by gas-enhanced Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analysis of exhaled
      breath. While MRI is able to provide localized information on inflammatory processes, exhaled
      breath analysis can capture integral information over time. Assuming that these novel
      techniques correlate with cellular measures of inflammation, repetitive measurements to
      investigate onset and duration of action of investigational new drugs will be made possible.

      The evaluation whether LPS induced changes in the lung can be captured and monitored by MRI
      will be performed by correlation of multiple endpoints describing the cellular composition of
      the airways with variables derived from MRI and breath analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female healthy subjects, aged 18-65 years. Women will be considered for
             inclusion if they are:

        Not pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test (see flow chart), and not nursing. Of
        non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including
        any female who is pre-menarchial or post-menopausal, with documented proof of hysterectomy
        or tubal ligation, or meets clinical criteria for menopause and has been amenorrhoeic for
        more than 1 year prior to the screening visit).

        Of childbearing potential and using a highly effective method of contraception during the
        entire study (vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence - the lifestyle of the female should
        be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse from two weeks prior to the
        first dose of study medication until at least 72 hours after treatment -, implants,
        injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs or double-barrier methods, i.e.
        any double combination of IUD, condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical
        cap).

          -  Normal lung function with FEV1 predicted ≥ 80%

          -  Nonsmokers with a history of less than 1 pack year having been nonsmokers for at least
             the last five years

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the outcome
             of the study. These diseases include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease,
             malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological disease, neurological
             disease, psychiatric disease, endocrine disease, infectious disease, inflammatory
             disease or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to asthma, tuberculosis,
             bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis)

                  include paracetamol for pain relief, oral contraceptive medication, hormonal
                  replacement therapy, dietary and vitamin supplements

               -  Clinically relevant history of allergy as judged by the investigator

               -  Patient unable to undergo MRI (e.g. due to claustrophobia, cardiac pacemaker,

                  opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
                  participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the
                  subject's ability to participate in the study

               -  Elevated IgE

               -  Intake of systemic or inhaled steroids in the previous 4 weeks before visit 1,
                  visit 2, or visit 3

               -  Risk of non-compliance with study procedures

               -  Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and
                  study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the
