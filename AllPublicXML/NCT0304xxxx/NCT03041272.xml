  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the incidence rate and characteristics of aggressive
      behavior perpetrated by patients and visitors in inpatient medical units and to understand
      the role of missed care events, professional quality of life and self-efficacy in
      relationship to aggressive events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study will examine the incidence of and outcomes associated with
      patient and visitor aggressive behavior towards nursing staff practicing on medical inpatient
      units. Staff on each unit will be informed about the AIMS study and all eligible nursing
      staff will be invited to participate in the study. After completing the informed consent
      nursing staff will be asked to complete the baseline demographic form and survey on
      professional quality of life. For the data collection phase of the study consented
      participants will be educated on use of the AIM log and provided with scenarios to practice
      AIM log use. Consented staff will carry event counters and use the AIM log for all shifts
      worked over the next 2 weeks.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Event counters and logs will be used to record aggressive event data and will be recorded on the AIM log over the 2 week data collection period. The midnight census on each unit will be recorded over the 2 week data collection period and the average number of occupied beds will be used in the calculation of this rate. The formula used will be:
(Number of physical aggression events recorded in 2 week period) divided by (Average number of occupied beds in 2 week period)</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Data on aggressive events and patient characteristics will be aggregated from the AIM Logs, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize events including: frequency of each type of event (verbal, physical or both); severity of event; perpetrator of event; precipitant of event; target of event, objects or body parts used, interventions and consequences of events. In addition written descriptions of events will be qualitatively summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>risk of missed care events</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Missed care event data will be retrieved from aggressive incident and management logs (AIM log). Analysis will include the standard descriptive statistics. An evaluation of the risk of missed care events will be carried out using initially a dichotomous identification of a missed care event (defined as any reason for missed care) using chi-square tests to identify significant differences by characteristics of aggressive events. Categories of missed care involving direct physical intervention (ambulation, turning, mouth care, feeding, bathing/skin care); psychosocial intervention (patient teaching, emotional support); medication related interventions (assessing effectiveness, within 5 minutes of prn medication); or assessment or monitoring (vital signs, Intake &amp; Output documentation, blood glucose monitoring) will be used in analyses to describe missed care types.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Professional Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship of aggressive event exposure rates to scores on the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) will be analyzed using chi-square tests to identify significant differences between stratified groups and logistic regression will be used to evaluate differences between high vs low exposure groups (high defined as greater than the median level of exposure in subjects) and professional quality of life scores with adjustment for potential confounders (age, gender, role, length of experience, length of work on unit).</description>
