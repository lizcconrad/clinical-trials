  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical efficacy of LDL-lowering therapy have been proven with strong evidences and more
      emphasized. However, there are also growing concerns that high-intensity statin would be
      related to increased risk of adverse effects. In addition, there was an inconsistency of
      efficacy of statin according to ethnic population. Asian population showed more profound LDL
      reduction not only from high potent statin but from moderate to low potent statin.
      Conventional strategies for lowering LDL-cholesterol was focused on statins, therefore
      doubling of previously described dose of statin would be common way in patients with
      inadequate lowering LDL-cholesterol level. Additive ezetimibe will also an alternative
      strategy not only to lower LDL-cholesterol level and also to reduce the need of dosage of
      high-intensity statin to fulfill sufficient LDL-cholesterol lowering effect. We will evaluate
      whether additive ezetimibe with rosuvastatin will have comparable clinical efficacy in terms
      of clinical outcomes and goal attainment of LDL-C compared to rosuvastatin monotherapy.
