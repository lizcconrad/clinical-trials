  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled study evaluating the effect of a music-listening
      intervention compared to standard care (control) during patient visit to the emergency
      department (ED). Randomization will be done with consecutive sealed envelopes.

      Data collection will be prospective with administration of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory
      and collection of physiologic parameters (pain level, heart rate, blood pressure).
      Retrospective data will also be collected for covariate analysis (age, race/ethnicity,
      emergency severity index (ESI), pain medications administered during the ED visit, pain
      scores throughout ED visit, chief complaint, and ED discharge diagnosis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A visit to the emergency department (ED) is anxiety provoking for patients by nature.
      Contributing factors may include the sudden timing of the visit, a noisy environment, and
      waiting in anticipation of a serious diagnosis or bad news. Studies suggest that nearly 75%
      of adult ED patients may experience mild to severe anxiety in relation to the ED visit, but
      not directly related to their chief complaint. Anxiety can have deleterious effects on a
      patient in the clinical setting. Patients may report excessive pain complaints and manifest
      the typical signs and symptoms of anxiety (e.g. anorexia, dry mouth, nausea, chest pain),
      which can complicate diagnosis. Patient anxiety can also impose barriers to communication
      with ED staff, hindering successful delivery of important medical information. A visit to the
      ED may be particularly distressing for older adults (age 65+), for they are more likely than
      younger adults to have a greater ED length of stay before discharge home, receive more
      diagnostic tests and venipuncture for intravenous (IV) access, and have poorer pain care.
      Music listening as an anxiolytic has been shown to be effective across a variety of clinical
      settings, however there is a relative paucity of published data on the use of music listening
      for adult patients in the ED. No published studies, to the investigators' knowledge, have
      evaluated the effect of music listening on older adults in the ED.

    <description>The STAI is scored from least/no anxiety (20 points) to severe anxiety (80 points). The mean change in STAI scores from before the intervention to after the intervention will be calculated by subtracting the first score from second score.</description>

    <description>The HR of patients will be recorded before and immediately after the intervention (for control subjects, 1 hour after enrollment). Difference in HR will be calculated by comparing pre to post and mean change calculated for each group.</description>

    <description>All subjects enrolled will respond to questions assessing anxiety using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and pain using a 1-10 numerical score, and will have blood pressure and heart rate taken. Subjects who are randomized to receive a music-listening intervention will listen to a choice of music for 30 to 60 minutes on a loaned iPad with disposable headphones. An hour after enrollment, participants will be asked the same questions assessing anxiety and pain, and will also have blood pressure and heart rate taken again.</description>
