      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of subgingival delivery of
      Rosuvastatin gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in Smokers With Chronic
      Periodontitis (CP) patients.

      Background: Periodontal diseases are multi-factorial in etiology, and bacteria are one among
      these etiologic agents. However, mechanical therapy itself may not always reduce or eliminate
      the anaerobic infection at the base of the pocket, within the gingival tissues. To overcome
      this, various systemic and local drug delivered antimicrobials have been used as an adjunct
      to scaling and root planing (SRP).The present study aims to explore the efficacy of 1.2%
      rosuvastatin (RSV) gel local drug delivery as an adjunct to SRP in smokers with chronic
      periodontitis (CP).

      Methods: Sixty subjects were randomly allocated into two treatment groups: SRP with placebo
      gel (group 1), SRP with 1.2% RSV gel (group 2). Clinical parameters were recorded at
      baseline, 6 and 9 months. Radiographic assessment was done using computer aided software at
      baseline, 6 and 9 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Systemically healthy CP subjects aged between 30-50 years who are current smokers with
             no history of periodontal therapy or use of antibiotics in past 6 months, having sites
             with intrabony defect depth (IBD) ≥ 3mm (distance between alveolar crest and base of
             the defect on intraoral periapical radiograph) along with PPD ≥5 mm or CAL ≥3 mm in an
             asymptomatic tooth were included in the study.

        A subject was considered as a current smoker if he regularly smoked more than 10
        cigarettes/day for a minimum of 5 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Former smokers, i.e. subjects who had previously been smokers but stopped their habit,
             and non-smokers were excluded. Subjects allergic to statins, on systemic statin
             therapy, with any known systemic disease or any other systemic inflammation/ infection
             which could alter the course of periodontal disease and users of tobacco in any other
             form than cigarettes were excluded from the study
