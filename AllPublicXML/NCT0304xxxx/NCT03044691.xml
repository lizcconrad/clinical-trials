  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of our study is to conduct a pilot, practice-based intervention focused
      on increasing adherence to the 6As for youth ages 11 through 17 years. The 6As are: (1)
      &quot;Anticipate&quot; (future use), (2) &quot;Ask&quot; (about tobacco use), (3) &quot;Advise&quot; (advise the patient to
      quit using tobacco), (4) &quot;Assess&quot; (the patient's readiness to quit using tobacco), (5)
      &quot;Assist&quot; (by setting a quit date, providing materials on quitting tobacco, providing tobacco
      cessation medications, and referring the patient for additional services and/or counseling) ,
      and (6) &quot;Arrange&quot; (by re-contacting the patient after their quit date and arranging a
      follow-up visit).

      Investigators will incorporate American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) best practice
      recommendations to screen and counsel parents. The specific aims of this study are to: (1)
      Develop and deploy an electronic short screening tool for tobacco and nicotine product use
      into pediatric primary care workflow in conjunction with clinician and office staff training
      on the 6As and parent screening through the use of trained Clinical Practice Facilitators,
      clinician-engaged adaptations of the intervention to fit their practice workflow, and support
      for Maintenance of Certification (MOC) to engage pediatricians in implementing the best
      practices; (2) Gather pilot data about the effectiveness of the intervention on clinician
      adherence to best practices and changes in practice capacity for change, adaptive reserve,
      and clinician self-efficacy; and (3) Examine the congruence between documentation of the
      intervention in the electronic health record (EHR) and youth report of the intervention.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>During the baseline periods, investigators will request and review medical records to identify the following primary outcome measures: discussion of patient's tobacco use, advice to quit, and discussion of parent's tobacco use. Since this is a pre-post design with one intervention group and one control group, investigators will perform ANCOVA-type analyses assuming that the patients and providers are independent of each other. For each outcome, investigators will fit a logistic regression model in which the dependent variable is the post-intervention measure of the outcome. The main independent variables will be the pre-intervention measure of the outcome, group (binary: intervention vs. control), and pre-intervention measure by group interaction. In all models, investigators will also control for age, gender, and race, and clinic (multi-nominal: clinics 1-4).</description>

    <measure>Intervention effect on practice characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Practice characteristic data will be measured from the Change Process Capability Questionnaire. Investigators will collect the practice characteristic data twice, once at baseline and once at 9 months. Therefore, investigators will fit ANCOVA models for data analysis, assuming the practices are independent of each other. The characteristics include meeting frequency, clinician/staff performance evaluation, and planned communication. The primary predictor of interest is group (intervention vs. control). The model building process will follow guidelines provided by Muller and Fetterman. Investigators will perform residual analysis to check the normality assumption of the models. Investigators will perform box-cox transformation if there is a violation of the normality assumption.</description>

    <description>Within 30 days post primary care visit, patients will be contacted via telephone to complete the Tobacco and Nicotine Product Primary Care Questionnaire (TNP-PCQ), which asks about their recollection of the tobacco and nicotine product discussions with their providers during the primary care visit. For each outcome in the TNP-PCQ survey, investigators will perform a concordance analysis to evaluate the agreement between the medical record review data and patient-reported data. Concordance will be evaluated using the following statistics: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and the Kappa statistic. Differences in concordance will be tested with the Pearson chi-square test.</description>

    <description>Intervention practices will complete the Adaptive Reserve and Change Process Capability Questionnaire and Clinician Survey at baseline and 9 months and participate in the medical record review at baseline and 6 months. The clinic will first administer the eligibility questionnaire to determine if patients are between the ages of 11-17 years old. Then they will be asked to complete the Youth Tobacco and Nicotine Product Questionnaire and Parent Brief Questionnaire (PBQ) using the ResearchACTS software at the point of care. A follow-up survey Youth Tobacco and Nicotine Product Primary Care survey will be administered to participants at least 30 days after their clinic visit.</description>

    <description>The Change Process Capability Questionnaire (CPCQ) will be administered to all participating practices at the beginning and end of the study (baseline and 9 months). The CPCQ is designed to assess three domains: (1) the practices' history of change; (2) capacity for internal improvement and refinement; and (3) capacity to initiate and sustain change.</description>

    <description>Each clinician in the practice who will be participating in the study will be asked to complete a 10 minute survey about their knowledge of and current practices related to tobacco and nicotine product screening and interventions with their patients.

    <description>At baseline, approximately 190 patients per practice in the intervention and control groups will be asked to complete a set of tobacco/nicotine product use questions while waiting for their clinician visit (either in the waiting room or another area designated by the practice without the parent being present). The questions were taken from the National Youth Tobacco Survey, a national survey designed to measure middle and high school youth's attitudes toward and behaviors related to tobacco and nicotine products.</description>
