  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lexical semantic disorders are described in Alzheimer's disease, and their incidence in
      everyday life is important to the extent that these disorders affect expression and
      comprehension.

      Providing a tactile tablet stimulation, independent and complementary to speech therapy,
      could help to maintain certain abilities and reinforce the feeling of autonomy of the
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a monocentric, controlled, randomized, parallel-group, single-blind clinical trial.

      For each of the two forms of Alzheimer's Disease (young or late), it compares two groups of
      patients: a group benefiting from a tactile tablet semantic stimulation (tablet group) and a
      control group All patients benefit from a clinical evaluation and a language assessment at
      M0, M3 and M6. The analyzes will be conducted in intention to treat.

      The main criterion is the 3-month variation of the Lexis 3 subtests scores. The two groups
      will be compared by the Student test.

      The number of subjects required is based on the following assumptions: a 10% increase over
      three months of the Lexis subtests scores in the tablet group and a stability of the scores
      in the control group. The standard deviation of the variation is assumed to be identical in
      both groups and equal to 13% at the most. Three scores being compared, tests will be
      conducted at the 1.67% threshold (Bonferroni correction) to ensure a 5% overall risk of first
      species. The inclusion of 36 patients in each of the two treatment groups will give 80% power
      to the study.

             Scale) between 0.5 inclusive and 2 inclusive and MMS score greater than or equal to 10
             and lower strictly at 27

          4. Lexical-semantic disorder

          5. Treatment with pro-cognitive drugs at stable doses for at least 3 months,

        For the early onset group, patients should have started the disease before 65 years of age.
        The randomization will be stratified according to age (&lt;65 years or&gt; 65 years), enabling to
        include 2 groups of identical size of young AD (Alzheimer Disease) and Late (Alzheimer
        Disease) patients, each half distributed in the tablet or control group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Confusion,

          4. Cerebral MRI (or scanner for contraindication to MRI), obtained in the context of
             routine care compatible with a pathological process other than that related to
             Alzheimer's disease. A discrete or moderate leukoaraiosis (stages 1 and 2 of Fazekas)
             will not be considered as a criterion of non-inclusion.

          5. Uncorrected hearing or visual impairment

          6. Inclusion in another intervention protocol.
