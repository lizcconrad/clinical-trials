    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subject - as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee
             based on medical evaluations including medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

          -  Gender: Male.

          -  Age: 45 to 65 years (inclusive) at the screening visit.

          -  Race: White.

          -  Body mass index (BMI): ≥18.0 and ≤30 kg/m2.

          -  Agree to use condoms as an effective contraception barrier method and refrain from
             sperm donation during the whole study (starting after informed consent) and for 3
             months after the end of treatment with ODM-201. In addition, participants must agree
             to utilize a second reliable method of contraception simultaneously. The second method
             which has to be used by a female partner of childbearing potential can be one of the
             following methods: diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide or intra-uterine device
             or hormone-based contraception.

          -  Results of alcohol tests are negative at screening and on Study Day -1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical and surgical history

          -  Existing relevant diseases of vital organs (e.g. liver diseases, heart diseases),
             central nervous system (for example seizures) or other organs (e.g. diabetes
             mellitus).

        Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases for which it can be assumed that the absorption,
        distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the study drugs will not be normal.

          -  Febrile illness within 1 week before the first study drug administration.

          -  A medical history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g. family history of Long
             QT Syndrome) or other arrhythmias.

          -  Known severe allergies, non-allergic drug reactions, or (multiple) drug allergies
             (excluding untreated, asymptomatic seasonal allergies like non-severe hay fever during
             the time of study conduct).

          -  Known history of hypersensitivity (or known allergic reaction) to itraconazole,
             rifampicin or ODM-201.

          -  Relevant hepatic disorders like cholestasis, disturbances of bilirubin metabolism, any
             progressive liver disease.

          -  Relevant renal disorders like recurrent glomerulonephritis, renal injury, and renal
             insufficiency. However, a history of a single episode of uncomplicated nephrolithiasis
             will not prevent participation.

          -  Subjects with porphyria.

          -  Subjects with diagnosed malignancy within the past 5 years except for cured skin basal
             carcinoma.
