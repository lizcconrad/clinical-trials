  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      RSV is a virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages. Healthy adults who are infected
      generally have mild cold symptoms for a week or two. But it can also be serious, especially
      for infants and older adults. It can be spread by direct or indirect contact with respiratory
      secretions. Researchers want to study a new vaccine to prevent RSV.

      Objective:

      To see if a vaccine for RSV is safe and if it causes side effects.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults 18-50 years old

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in a different protocol.

      Participants will have 13 visits over 1 year.

      Some participants will receive just vaccine. Some will receive vaccine mixed with alum, which
      could make the body respond to the vaccine better.

      All will receive their dose by injection in the upper arm. They will receive two doses, one
      at the beginning of the study and another 12 weeks later.

      Participants will be watched for 1 hour after injection. They will be called 1 day after.

      They will keep track of their temperature and side effects for 7 days after.

      Participants will receive a ruler to measure any changes on their skin at the injection site.

      At all visits, participants will be checked for health changes or problems. They may have
      blood drawn.

      At some visits, participants will have samples taken from their nose and mouth.

      This is a Phase I, open label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-RSVRGP084-00-VP alone or with alum adjuvant in a
      2-injection regimen. The hypotheses are that the vaccine will be safe and tolerable for human
      administration, and will induce detectable immune response. The primary objective is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine at 3 dose levels
      administered alone or with alum adjuvant as a homologous boost in healthy adults. Secondary
      objectives relate to humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine
      regimen.
