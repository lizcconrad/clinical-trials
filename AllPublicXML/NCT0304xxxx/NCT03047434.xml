      2.1Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the chronology of postoperative pain in
      patients undergoing shoulder, knee, ankle arthroscopy. Further, within this population the
      predictive validity of the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale will be assessed for
      persistent post surgical pain.

      2.2 Research Design: This is a prospective descriptive correlational design looking to
      characterize postoperative pain variables across various procedures that historically have
      significant levels of persistent post-surgical pain. Further, bivariate correlations at
      different time points will be examined to see how DVPRS along with Pain Assessment Screening
      Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) correlates with other measures.

      2.3 Methodology/Technical Approach A total goal of 250 participants will be queried regarding
      their postoperative pain experience following shoulder arthroscopy and knee arthroscopy.
      Descriptive multidimensional tools (the DVPRS and the electronic Pain Assessment Screening
      Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR)) will be used preoperative either during their
      preoperative surgical visit or the day of surgery and extending to 6 months postoperatively.
      As these tools have been utilized in previous studies for the prediction of persistent post
      surgical pain, the DVPRS will additionally be evaluated for its predictive validity as it is
      a short, easy-to-administer, bedside tool.

    <time_frame>3-months and 6-months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Describe biopsychosocial functioning, as indicated by PROMIS domain scales and the DVPRS, at each time point, as well as longitudinal, polynomial data patterns for the aggregated sample.
Examine whether longitudinal patterns vary according to surgical factors (e.g. procedure type, type of regional intervention received).
Identify factors associated with low functioning and persistent opioid use at 3-months and 6-months post-surgery.</description>

    <description>) When accounting for baseline levels, does postoperative Day 7 DVPRS scores predict persistent post- surgical pain at 3 months, as defined as 1 SD worse functioning on PROMIS Pain Interference? b) When accounting for baseline levels, does postoperative Day 7 DVPRS scores predict persistent post-surgical pain at 3 months, as defined as 1 SD worse functioning on PROMIS Neuropathic? c) What are the optimal cut-offs for the DVPRS at Day 7 in predicting persistent post-surgical pain at 3 months, as defined as 1 SD worse functioning on PROMIS Pain Interference?</description>

        1. Male and female military health care beneficiaries age 18 years and older presenting
             any of the following surgeries: total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty.

          2. The recruitment and participation in this study will have minimal impact on
             surrounding health care activities. This study is measuring pain in a more specific
             manner than usual to describe the perioperative pain experience and evaluate the
             predictive capability of the DVPRS. Measurements in this study will not be used to
             make therapeutic decisions. Participants will be screened from the Surgical Scheduling
             System (S3) and joint arthroplasty surgeon's scheduling nurse prior to surgery and
             approached upon their preoperative visit with their surgeon.
