      HOPPSA is a register based randomized controlled trial (R-RCT), with the objective to examine
      if opportunistic salpingectomy compared with no salpingectomy, at the time of hysterectomy
      for a benign reason

        -  has no increased risk of complications

        -  has no negative side effects on ovarian function and subsequent cardiovascular disease
           or incidence of fractures

        -  implies reduced risk of subsequent ovarian cancer Randomization and follow-up will be
           conducted within national registers.
