  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the insertion of double balloon device (DBD) for cervical ripening
      for 12 h vs 6 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study is designed to:

        1. To assess and compare the Bishop score when removing the DBD 12 hours' vs 6hours' after
           insertion.

        2. To compare the efficacy (vaginal delivery rate and time to VD) in the two arm groups

      200 women are expected to be randomized in to two arms. One will be randomized to DBD removal
      after 12 hours and the other to DBD removal after 6 hours.

      Each patient will sign an informed consent.

      The following screening will be completed: medical and gynecological history, general
      physical and gynecological examination, ultrasonography to exclude contraindication to
      vaginal delivery or insertion if the DBD and non stress test (NST) for baseline. Bishop score
      will be assessed.

      After confirming eligibility for study, randomization into the following groups will take
      place.

      Insertion of the DBD and removal 6 hours following its insertion. Insertion of the DBD and
      removal 12 hours following its insertion.

    <description>This arm is the standard management that includes insertion of the DBD into the cervical canal according to manufacture guidelines, removal after 12 hours followed by artificial rupture of membranes and oxytocin infusion according to departments protocol. (a total of 10 units of oxytocin is infused, initiated with 10 cc/h, increased by 10cc every 20-30 min until 3-5 contractions are present, total of not more than 120 cc\h)</description>
