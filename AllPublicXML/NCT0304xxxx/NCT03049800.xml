  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform longitudinal high-resolution 7T MRI in participants
      with first-episode psychosis (FEP) enrolled in our ongoing randomized controlled clinical
      trial (RCT) of cognitive training. The investigators seek to determine whether a 12-week
      course of intensive cognitive training of auditory processing in young FEP patients delivered
      remotely as a stand-alone treatment is neuroprotective against neural tissue loss in auditory
      cortex (superior temporal gyrus, STG), and possibly in other cortical regions. The
      investigators will also observe the effects of training on white matter integrity in the
      brain.

      This study will seek to enroll 60 participants. 40 participants will be considered First
      Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients, meaning that they have been diagnosed with a psychotic
      illness with their first psychotic episode occurring within the last two years at time of
      enrollment. These participants will be recruited from a separate study protocol conducted by
      Dr. Sophia Vinogradov which examines remote cognitive training in FEP subjects (application
      in progress). 20 of these participants will receive treatment as usual (TAU), while 20 will
      be assigned to Targeted Cognitive Training (TCT). Additionally, the investigators will enroll
      20 healthy, age and gender matched controls (HC). All participants will undergo 2 MRI scans
      approximately one year apart. Each MRI scan should last about one hour. The outcome
      measurements of this study will be changes in functional, structural, and diffusion weight
      images over time within subjects and between groups.
