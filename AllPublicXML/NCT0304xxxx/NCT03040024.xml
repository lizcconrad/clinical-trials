  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective randomized double blinded placebo controlled study is to
      investigate if a single dose of ketamine in addition to standard anesthesia will reduce the
      risk of delirium in otolaryngeal cancer patients postoperatively. Ketamine's effect on
      post-operative pain and opioid use will be measured as well. Electroencephalogram (EEG) will
      be utilized during the surgical procedure to evaluate its potential as a possible predictive
      device for delirium.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective randomized double blinded placebo controlled study.

      The primary aim of the study is to optimize the intraoperative treatment protocol for head
      and neck cancer patients to reduce the incidence of delirium and associated postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction. Secondary aims are to determine the dose response relationship for
      intraoperative ketamine and delirium reduction, determine if a single dose of ketamine will
      reduce post-operative pain and opioid requirements, determine if raw electroencephalogram
      (EEG) data can predict postoperative delirium during general anesthesia, and to evaluate
      length of intensive care unit (ICU) and length of hospital stay.

      Participants will be randomized to one of three groups after administration of general
      anesthesia; one dose of .5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) Ketamine, 1.0 mg/kg of IV Ketamine, or IV
      placebo.

      An EEG will be used during the surgical procedure to gather raw data for off line analysis
      among patients developing post-operative delirium.

    <measure>Change in Confusion Assessment Method fo Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) Delirium Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Operative Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The CAM-ICU assesses four features: 1) acute change or fluctuation in mental status from baseline, 2) inattention, 3) altered level of consciousness, and 4) disorganized thinking. The measure reports whether a participant meets criteria for delirium by summing the number of features answered as &quot;present&quot;. Feature 1 plus 2 and either 3 or 4 present = deliriuim positive.</description>

    <measure>Richmond Agitation and Sedation (RASS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Operation (Up to 6 Hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The RASS is a medical scale used to measure the agitation or sedation level of a patient. Scores range from -5 to +4; -5 representing &quot;unarousable&quot; and +4 representing &quot;combative&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mini Cog Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Surgery (Up to 6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Cog is a 3-minute instrument that can increase detection of cognitive impairment. A score ranging from 0-2 indicates positive screen for dementia. A score ranging from 3-5 indicates negative screen for dementia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Surgery (Up to 6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. Any score greater than or equal to 24 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (â‰¤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Surgery (Up to 6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ is a 25-item self-report measure of failures in attention, perception, memory, and action. Participants are asked to indicate on a 5-point scale how often they have experienced each failure in the past months, from 0 (never) to 5 (very often). Scores range from 0 to 100 a higher score indicating more failures in attention.</description>
