  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic disease with a significant
      medical and economic impact. Its prevalence is increasing and is estimated at 7.5% of people
      over 40 in France. COPD is responsible for a significant impairment of quality of life and
      was the 3rd leading cause of death in the world in 2010 when it was 4th place 20 years ago.

      However, about 75% of patients with COPD are not diagnosed. Spirometry is the only
      examination for the diagnosis of COPD. Patients identified at risk for COPD are
      insufficiently using spirometry and general practitioners (GPs) underestimate the severity of
      COPD when they do not practice spirometry in their patients. COPD is often diagnosed too
      late, the disease being discovered at the stage of complications requiring hospitalization.
      The underdiagnosis is mainly due to poor knowledge of patients, their difficulty in accessing
      a specialist performing spirometry, their reluctance to perform spirometry, and the
      insufficient involvement of general practitioners.

      Currently in France, targeted screening for COPD and diagnosis in primary care is a major
      challenge. The international (GOLD 2014) and French (HAS 2014) recommendations do not
      indicate a systematic screening in the general population for COPD but advocate targeted
      screening of patients by five questions to identify risk factors and symptoms of COPD. The
      presence of at least one of these factors in an adult over the age of 40 requires spirometry.

      Recent studies suggest the relevance of finding primary care variables for smoking and
      respiratory symptoms in order to identify new cases of COPD.

      However, the impact of the use of these questionnaires on the prevalence of diagnoses of COPD
      in general practice has not been demonstrated. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the provision
      of care according to the territories limits a fast or easy access (distance) to the
      spirometry.

      It is therefore necessary to evaluate in primary care the interest of a targeted screening of
      COPD and the interest of a coordination of care for the realization of a spirometry, in order
      to improve the rate of diagnosis of the disease.
