  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct survey-based assessments for the safety of air travel in
      patients with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD). The study will enroll patients through the
      clinic network at Rare Lung Disease Consortium (RLDC) and through the BHD foundation website.
      Patients will have access to the questionnaire via REDCap (an online data management system)
      and each patient will be provided with a link to complete the survey. The investigators plan
      on enrolling approximately 100 patients with BHD for the purpose of this study. Secondary
      aims of this study include further characterization of the clinical aspects of disease and to
      establish a contact registry for these patients, in order to facilitate future studies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax during or within 24 hours following air travel</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the number of pneumothoraces that occur either during air travel, or within 24 hours of air travel among patients with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. The incidence of air travel related pneumothorax will be calculated by dividing the number of pneumothoraces to the total number of flights undertaken by the entire cohort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of recurrent pneumothorax in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will catalogue the number roof spontaneous pneumothoraces experienced by patients with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. These results will be used to calculate the proportion of patients who experience at least one recurrence of their pneumothorax, as well as the average number of pneumothoraces experienced per patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of pleurodesis in reducing the risk of recurrent pneumothoraces in Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the incidence of ipsilateral pneumothorax following pleurodesis in order to determine the efficacy (as measured by the rate of pneumothorax recurrence following pleurodesis). These results will be calculated separately for chemical and surgical pleurodesis.</description>
