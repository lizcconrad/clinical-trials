  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of behavioral feedback plus
      economic incentives to promote treatment adherence among a large diverse population of
      adolescents and young adults (AYA) with kidney transplant (KT) or spina bifida (SB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this five-year, phase II, randomized clinical trial is to improve
      poor long-term health outcomes in both adolescents and young adults (AYA) with either a
      kidney transplant (KT) or spina bifida (SB), respectively. More specifically, this study will
      focus on decreasing premature allograft loss in subjects with kidney transplant (KT) due to
      medication nonadherence and kidney damage in subjects with SB due to urinary non-continence.
      To achieve these goals, this study will implement a real-time feedback system, Way to Health
      (WTH), that will provide education and support, increase awareness and incentivize positive
      health behavior, in addition to standard of care. Further, this study will investigate the
      mechanisms of behavior change by examining the role of financial incentives, positive
      feedback and the relationship between the two. The study will compare two cohorts of KT and
      SB subjects, which will undergo varied levels of financial incentives and positive feedback.
      Data from KT and SB subjects will be analyzed jointly and separately. This innovative mobile
      health (mhealth) strategy will improve our current measures of adherence and increase our
      understanding of factors that influence adherence for two AYA populations, KT and SB
      subjects, respectively. The study will contribute novel insight to inform the design of
      future interventions targeting persistence of behavior change and can be used in other
      centers and for other chronic disease groups.

      The study intervention will use the WTH web-based platform to support AYA with KT or SB as
      they navigate their daily treatment burdens. This will be achieved via bi-directional text
      messaging, including the sending of reminders and positive feedback by WTH and the messaging
      of pictures of medication or catheter in hand at time of treatment by the participant. This
      intervention will assess sustainability of this novel bi-directional messaging system and the
      impact of providing education and support, increasing awareness and incentivizing positive
      health behavior in real-time.

    <description>Subjects will receive daily text message reminders and report real-time treatment adherence with photos. They will receive compensation to encourage real-time adherence reporting. Subjects will also be able to log into a personal dashboard with a visual display of their weekly adherence performance and educational resources related to their primary disease. Every month, participants will receive a text encouraging them to visit their personal dashboard. The dashboard is able to track usage of the modules by individual. Parents/legal guardians will have access to these same educational materials via their own portals. Additionally, to mitigate the minimal risk of this study, parents/legal guardians will be notified if their child is excessively non-adherent.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive daily text message reminders and report real-time treatment adherence with photos, and will have web access to the educational modules through their portal. Every month, participants will receive a text encouraging them to visit their portals. In contrast to Arm 1, they will receive their weekly performance results by text to their phone with tailored feedback. In Arm 2, subjects will receive a larger incentive if they perform their desired treatment behavior. Incentive notification will be texted to participants. Similarly to Arm 1, parents/legal guardians will have access to the same educational materials via their own WTH portals. Additionally, to mitigate the minimal risk of this study, parents/legal guardians will be notified if their child is excessively non-adherent.</description>
