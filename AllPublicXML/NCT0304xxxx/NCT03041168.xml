      The proposed study is evaluating a novel technology, Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS), developed
      by the sponsor, CVR Global. Study Design. This is a prospective cohort study that will
      compare a new application of a technology, the CSS device, to reference standards for
      assessment of carotid disease.

    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of this study are to demonstrate that the Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS)
      can accurately detect significant carotid artery stenosis.

      Secondary objective is to relate changes in CSS signal to different degrees of stenosis. We
      obtain a &quot;proof of concept&quot; if the device correlates strongly with the established
      classification of atherosclerotic carotid disease derived various imaging modalities
      including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computer tomographic angiography (CTA),
      conventional angiography, or carotid ultrasound.

    <description>Each subject will have been scheduled for a carotid ultrasound, or other imaging test of the neck (carotids) as ordered by his/her physician for clinical or screening purposes. These studies will be read by a Jefferson radiologist and a report generated for standard clinical purposes. These reports and the images will be collected and de-identified to be used as comparator measurements to the CSS results. The CSS device is shaped like a stethoscope with 3 small gel pads. It is positioned with a gel pad on either side of the neck and one on the front of the chest. The scan takes about 1-2 minutes to provide an image on the screen of the device cart. The scan device pads just lie on the skin and do not use any invasive techniques to provide the image.</description>

        The study population will consist of patients presenting to a Jefferson facility for
        carotid imaging studies. Subjects scheduled for carotid artery assessments will be
        identified prior to the day of study using radiology scheduling.
