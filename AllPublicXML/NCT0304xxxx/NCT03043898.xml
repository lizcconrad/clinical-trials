    <textblock>
      This study addresses the question, how does sound propagate from a source in the chest to the
      chest wall? Using sound recorded at the chest as a diagnostic technique has the advantage of
      being non-invasive and non-radioactive, but compared to other techniques it cannot currently
      differentiate well between different diseases. Our aim is to improve our ability to
      differentiate between different diseases using sound recorded at the chest by improving our
      fundamental understanding of mechanisms by which sound propagates through the chest.

      Examples of conditions that could be diagnosed using audible lung sounds are bronchomalacia,
      asthma, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The
      methodology of the study will be to place a sound source at a known location in the chest and
      measure the acoustic response on the chest wall with a microphone array.

      The sound source will be created by playing sound down the working channel of a bronchoscope
      and located anatomically using direct imaging. By placing a sound source inside the chest we
      will be able to generate an acoustic map of the chest and test the relative importance of
      different propagation mechanisms. This will be an advance on previous work, which placed a
      sound source at the mouth.

      Subjects will be selected for the study by asking patients undergoing a bronchoscopy
      procedure whether they would be willing to take part in the experiment in addition to their
      standard procedure.

      Procedures will take place in the Bronchoscopy Unit at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge.
      The Unit runs regional speciality clinics in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
      asthma, lung cancer, bronchomalacia and interstitial lung disease and has a nationally
      significant interventional bronchoscopy service.

      A subsidiary part of the study will collect sound recordings from healthy volunteers and
      patients with common respiratory diseases using the same microphone array. This is to create
      a database of lung sounds and quantify inter-subject variability.

      The study will last approximately 30 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two parts, A and B. Both parts are observational studies of the sounds heard at
      the chest as recorded by an acoustic array.

      In Part A, healthy volunteers and patients at Addenbrooke's hospital will have the chest
      sounds at their back recorded using a microphone array. This will be done in a single session
      lasting approximately 30 minutes. 25 healthy volunteers and 25 patients will be included.

      In Part B, 50 patients undergoing a bronchoscopy at Addenbrooke's hospital will have their
      bronchoscopy extended by 5-10 minutes so that sounds can be played through a catheter in the
      working channel of the bronchoscope and recorded by a microphone array at the chest. Part B
      will investigate 25 patients with structurally 'normal' hearts (for example patients with
      Chronic Cough) (Part B(i)), and 25 patients with lung disease that has resulted in an
      'abnormal' lung structure (Part B(ii)).

      The consultant bronchoscopist will assign the patient to the relevant group based on
      information from their medical history and their CT scan. For Part B of the study an existing
      CT scan is an inclusion criteria. CT scans will not be carried out specifically for this
      study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of sound propagation through the human chest in subjects with 'normal' and 'abnormal' lung structure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed when all data for Part B of the study has been collected. Up to 30 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This will use a hypothesis test on features extracted from the time-series array data in Part B of the study. As the sound source will be the same for all cases a comparison of the measured acoustic response at the chest is equivalent to a comparison of sound propagation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of sound propagation through the human chest in subjects before and after the addition of fluid to the lung.</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed when all data for Part B of the study has been collected. Up to 30 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This will use a hypothesis test on features extracted from the time-series array data in Part B of the study, for each patient assessed for this metric there will be two data sets, corresponding to acoustic response measurements before and after the injection of fluid into the lung (as the result of a lavage). As the sound source will be the same for all cases a comparison of the measured acoustic response at the chest is equivalent to a comparison of sound propagation.
As it is unclear how many of the patients will undergo a lavage there may be limited statistical power. In this case a more qualitative approach will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of measured acoustic response at the chest to prescribed sound source and acoustic response at the chest predicted for the same sound source by current propagation models.</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed when all data for Part B of the study has been collected. Up to 30 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by using a hypothesis test on the measured and simulated data. A graphical comparison will also be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of sound source location predicted by localisation algorithms and the true source location.</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed when all data for Part B of the study has been collected. Up to 30 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by evaluating the correlation between the measured and computed response, and by performing a hypothesis test. Graphical comparison of the results and a &quot;goodness of fit&quot; statistical test may also be employed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison between sounds from healthy and unhealthy subjects in Part A.</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed when all data for Part A of the study has been collected. Up to 30 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This will use a hypothesis test on features extracted from the time-series array data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of sounds heard during bronchial Lavage and crackle sounds.</measure>
    <time_frame>This metric will be assessed when the data collection for Part B and Part A(ii) is complete. Up to 30 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective graphical comparison of the spectrograms of two datasets will be carried out. These two data sets are:
The special cases in Part B of the study where a recording has been carried out during a lavage.
The special cases in Part A(ii) of the study where a clinician has identified the patient to have crackles.
If there is sufficient data to give a reasonable statistical power, then a hypothesis test will be carried out on features extracted from the time-series array data.</description>
