  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased plasma DPP4 activity (DPP4a) could predict both subclinical and new-onset
      atherosclerosis, and our previous study has found that the DPP4a was significantly lower in
      MI patients compared with patients having chest pain or unstable angina alone, and DPP4a is
      associated with no-reflow and major bleeding events in STEMI patients during hospital stay.
      As no-reflow phenomenon and major bleeding events independently associates with a worse
      in-hospital and long-term prognosis. One may speculate that the DPP4a is associated with
      long-term follow-up adverse cardiovascular events in these patients.The hypothesis was tested
      in this study.
