      This will be a randomized investigator blinded study of 40 men age 20-60 (inclusive) with
      symptoms of mild-moderate PFB based on Investigator Global Assessment (IGA). Subjects will be
      divided into two groups: the Control group of 20 subjects and the Experimental group of 20
      Subjects. Subjects will be seen at Screening/Baseline, and 6 weeks.

      All subjects will use their normal razors and shave products during the six week study. The
      Experimental group of subjects will also be given the study product Pre-Shave Gel and
      Cleansing Brush.

      This will be a randomized investigator blinded study of up to 40 men age 20-60 (inclusive)
      with symptoms of mild-moderate PFB based on Investigator Global Assessment (IGA). Subjects
      will be divided into two groups: the Control group of 20 subjects and the Experimental group
      of 20 Subjects. Subjects will be seen at Screening/Baseline, and 6 weeks.

      All subjects will use their normal razors and shave products during the six week study. The
      Experimental group of subjects will also be given the study product Pre-Shave Gel and
      Cleansing Brush. The study gel and brush will be used prior to their normal shave
      routine.Quantitative lesion counts will be done by trained clinicians at each visit. Efficacy
      assessments include Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scoring

        <description>A total of the Patientâ€™s Global Assessment of mechanics of shaving based on following scale:
How easy is it toâ€¦ (please rank each phrase from 1 to 4; 1 = very easy, 2 = easy, 3 = difficult, 4 = very difficult)
A) get a smooth shave after shaving? __________
B) shave stubborn hairs? __________
C) shave against the grain with little irritation? __________
D) shave with the grain with little irritation? __________
E) glide comfortably over your skin with the razor blade?
For each subject, the total score could range from 5 -20, with lower numbers indicating better shave mechanics</description>
