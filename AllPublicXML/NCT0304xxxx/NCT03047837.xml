  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies and cardiovascular prevention trials have shown that low-dose aspirin
      (ASA) can inhibit colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, including inhibition of
      distant metastases. Metformin (MET) has also been associated with decreased CRC incidence and
      mortality in meta-analyses of epidemiological studies in diabetics and has been shown to
      decrease by 40% colorectal adenoma recurrence in a randomized trial. Recent studies have
      shown that ASA is an inhibitor of mTOR/S6K1 and an activator of AMPK, targeting regulators of
      intracellular energy homeostasis and metabolism, and that the combination of ASA and MET,
      another AMPK activator and S6K1 inhibitor, has a striking additive effect on AMPK activation
      and mTOR inhibition, with increased autophagy and decreased cell growth in CRC cell lines.
      While both drugs are being tested as single agents, their combination has not been tested in
      trials.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, 2x2 biomarker trial of ASA and MET to
      test the activity of either agent alone and the potential synergism of their combination on a
      set of surrogate biomarkers of colorectal carcinogenesis. After surgery 160 patients with
      stage I-III colon cancer will randomly be assigned in a four-arm trial to either ASA, 100 mg
      day, MET 850 mg bid, their combination, or placebo for one year. The primary endpoint
      biomarker is the change, defined as the difference between pre- and post-treatment expression
      of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB), in the unaffected mucosa of proximal and distal colon
      obtained by multiple biopsies in two paired colonoscopies one year apart. Additional
      biomarkers will include: 1) the genomic profile of candidate genes, pathways, and overall
      genomic patterns in tissue biopsies by genome wide gene expression arrays; 2) the IHC
      expression of tissue pS6K, p53, beta-catenin, PI3K; 3) the associations of mutations and SNPs
      with treatment response by next generation sequencing of primary tumors; 4) the measurement
      of circulating IL-6, CRP and VEGF and 5) plasma and colonic MET concentrations and their
      correlation with biomarker profiles.

    <description>It will be measured the change, defined as the difference between post- and pre-treatment levels, in NFκB expression in normal colonic tissue. The NFκB transcription factor family is composed of the p65, RelB, c-Rel, p105, andt p100 subunits, and activation of the NFκB pathway is defined by the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit. Therefore, cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of p65 will be immunohistochemically assessed as an indicator of NFκB activity. The analysis of expression will be performed by semi quantitative assessment: NFκB expression will be measured primarily as the percentage of positive nuclear areas for NFkB over the total nuclear areas in 10 section fields.</description>
