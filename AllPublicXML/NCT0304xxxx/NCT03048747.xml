    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan based on
      the change in serum sodium concentration following administration of tolvaptan oral tablets
      at 7.5 to 60 mg/day for up to 30 days in patients with hyponatremia in the SIADH.
