      The purpose of this study is to discover whether certain Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene
      polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
      and/or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in an Alabama population. Participant
      demographic information such as physical characteristics (e.g., ethnicity), family history,
      and cancer diagnosis will be collected in order to determine if there are relationships
      between the gene polymorphisms, cancer diagnosis, and these characteristics.
