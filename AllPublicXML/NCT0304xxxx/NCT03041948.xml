  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical intervention to treat a inguinal hernia is a very common pediatric surgical
      procedure, often performed using an inguinal incision. Children who undergo hernia repair can
      suffer from a significant degree of discomfort postoperatively. The investigators are
      evaluating the effectiveness of an ultrasound guided caudal-epidural (CE) block to an US
      guided ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric (IIG/IHG) nerve block in achieving post operative
      analgesia following a hernia repair. It is hypothesized that US guided IIG/IHG nerve block
      leads to more effective pain control post-operatively while in hospital relative to an US
      guided CE block for inguinal hernia surgery.

      Surgical intervention to treat a inguinal hernia is a very common pediatric surgical
      procedure, often performed using an inguinal incision. Children who undergo hernia repair can
      suffer from a significant degree of discomfort postoperatively. A multimodal pain management
      approach including medications such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      and opioids have traditionally been used in combination with a regional anesthetic technique.
      Regional anesthetic techniques include surgical infiltration of local anesthetic,
      caudal-epidural (CE) block or an ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric (IIG/IHG) nerve block.

      Regional anesthetic techniques such as CE and ultrasound (US) guided IIG/IHG are
      well-established methods shown to reduce the use of intraoperative anesthetics and the need
      post operative rescue analgesia. Traditionally, IIG/IHG nerve blocks were completed using a
      landmark-based approach but due to unpredictable block results with failure rates over 30%
      and potentially serious complications such as unintentional intraperitoneal injection, many
      anesthesiologists preferred the more reliable CE technique. However, while the CE provides
      excellent intraoperative anesthesia it provides short duration of post-operative analgesia
      (4-6 hours) and can be associated with lower limb motor block and urinary retention. Recent
      literature has demonstrated that an US guided IIG/IHG can be completed with smaller volume of
      local anesthetic with a success rate of up to 100% with low risk of complications.
      Furthermore there is evidence to suggest that it provides an increased duration of
      postoperative analgesia for pediatric patients undergoing groin surgery. Finally, two
      publications retrospectively reviewing complications in over 45000 regional anesthetic blocks
      suggest that US guided peripheral nerve blocks (e.g., IIG/IHG) should be favoured over
      neuraxial techniques such as epidural and caudal anesthetics due to the risk-benefit profile.
      A recent meta-analysis comparing IIG/IIH block to the CE block in children notes that
      additional comparative studies are required as previous studies comparing these two
      techniques have many methodological limitations including small sample sizes, using blind
      (non-US guided) regional anesthetic techniques and grouping patients undergoing various
      surgical procedures (e.g., orchiopexy and hernia repair) despite significant differences in
      recovery pain profiles.

      The investigators are proposing to complete a prospective randomized single-blinded
      non-inferiority study to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of an US guided CE block to
      an US guided IIG/IHG nerve block in achieving post operative analgesia following a hernia
      repair. Currently, a number of Pediatric Anesthesiologists at the Alberta Children's Hospital
      do not routinely complete IIG/IIH or CE blocks under ultrasound guidance. As part of this
      study investigators hope to provide necessary knowledge (sonoanatomy, technique) and offer
      supervised clinical training to anesthesiologists who are interested in participating in the
      study. While a hernia repair remains a common procedure, no studies have compared the use of
      US guided CE to US guided IIG/IHG. The aim of this study is to establish non-inferiority in
      post-operative pain while in hospital as assessed through the Face, Leg, Activity, Cry,
      Consolability (FLACC) scale for the US guided IIG/IHG as compared to US guided CE following
      hernia repair surgery. Secondary objectives will assess for group differences in need for
      rescue analgesia in hospital, analgesia administered at home, and postoperative pain measures
      within 24 hours post hospital discharge.

      Investigators hypothesize that a US guided IIG/IHG nerve block leads to non-inferior
      objectively measured FLACC pain scores (≤ 1 point on FLACC scale) post-operatively while in
      hospital relative to an US guided CE block for inguinal hernia surgery.
