      This study are to:

        -  Evaluate effect of magnetic therapy on peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients.

        -  Evaluate effect of laser therapy on peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients.

        -  Compare effects of magnetic therapy with that of laser therapy on peripheral neuropathy
           in diabetic patients.

      Sixty- five male and female diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy will be selected to
      participate in this study. They will be equally divided into two groups Group-I: Twenty five
      patient with diabetic peripheral neuropathy will be exposed to low intensity pulsed magnetic
      therapy Group-II: Twenty five patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy will be exposed
      for 24 treatment sessions of laser therapy Group-III 15 patient received only medical
      treatment

    <description>it is used for measuring motor and sensory conduction velocity: For this purpose nerve conduction studies (NCSs) will be performed for all patients including evaluation of bilateral peroneal and tibia motor nerves and sural sensory nerves (Asad 2009). Patients with NCV from 33-48m /sec will be recruited in this study (Pericz and Cvetkovic 2006 , and Graak 2009). All measurement will be done at stander room temperature of 25 c. The skin temperature of the leg was maintained at 37á´„. (Asad et al 2009).</description>
