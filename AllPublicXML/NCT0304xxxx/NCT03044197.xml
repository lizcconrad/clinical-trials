  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate biopsies are currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Many
      biopsies, however, are unnecessary or cannot detect significant prostate cancer (PCa). With
      multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) we now potentially have a way of
      increasing the detection of detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) while
      decreasing the detection of non-significant PCa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In men with previously negative prostate biopsy and persistent elevated prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) value, it is unclear which biopsy strategy offers the highest detection rate
      for significant prostate cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that targeted MRI/ultrasound
      fusion-guided biopsy improves the detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancers
      (csPCa) compared with systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.

      Patients who full-fills all eligibility criteria and have provided written consent will be
      randomized to undergo MRI followed by biopsies (arm A) or TRUS transrectal biopsy (arm-B).
      Patients will be randomly assigned to arm A or arm B following a 1:1 simple randomization
      procedure according to a computer-generated randomization list. The primary end point will be
      the comparison of detection rates csPCa between arm A and arm B. csPCa will be defined
      according to the Standards of Reporting for MRI-targeted Biopsy Studies (START) criteria for
      targeted biopsy Gleason Score ≥ 7 or maximum CCL ≥ 5 mm and the updated Epstein criteria for
      SB (Gleason score ≥ 7, PSA density ≥ 0.15, Gleason score ≥ 2 positive cores, and bilateral
      cancer). The secondary end points will be (1) Comparison of the overall detection rate of PCa
      and csPCa between arm A mpMRI+, arm A mpMRI-, and arm B and (2) Comparison of complication
      rates between arm A mpMRI+ and arm B.

    <description>In arm A, all patients with positive mpMRI evidence of lesions suspicious for PCa, i.e. PI RADS ≥ 3 will be submitted to transperineal mpMRI-targeted prostate biopsy (arm A MRI+). The gland and the regions of interest will be contoured, and the prostate contour will be fused in real time with the TRUS image. Biopsies will be performed via a transperineal approach in the operating room. The patient will be placed in dorsal lithotomy position. mpMRI-targeted biopsies will be performed on regions of interest, and three to six cores will be obtained for biopsy from each lesion and is standard of care according to START criteria for targeted biopsy. In cases of negative mpMRI results i.e. PI RADS&lt;3, arm A patients will undergo TRUS-guided transrectal 12-core prostate biopsy (arm A MRI-) as described in arm B.</description>

    <description>TRUS-guided transrectal prostate biopsy will be performed using a disposable 18-gauge biopsy gun with a specimen size of 18-22 mm (Bard Medical, Covington, GA, USA). The 12 cores will be obtained from 12 separate anatomical regions of the prostate which is standard practice in performing TRUS-guided transrectal prostate biopsy: left medial apex, left lateral apex, left medial midgland, left lateral midgland, left medial base, left lateral base, right medial apex, right lateral apex, right medial midgland, right lateral midgland, right medial base and right lateral base.</description>
