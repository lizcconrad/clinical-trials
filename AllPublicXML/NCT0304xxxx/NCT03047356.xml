    <description>The main outcome measure was adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, &amp; Kupfer, 1989), and was designed to tap both quantity and quality of sleep. Sleep quantity was assessed by asking: &quot;How many hours of actual sleep do you normally get on a night before school? _________ hours,&quot; &quot;What time do you normally go to bed on a night before school? __________ pm,&quot; and &quot;What time do you normally get up on a school day? __________ am.&quot;</description>

    <description>Sniehotta, Nagy, and Scholz's (2006) six items were used to capture three facets of action control (Karoly, 1993) on 7-point (+1 to +7) strongly disagree-strongly agree scales. (e.g., &quot;During the last month I constantly monitored my sleep on the nights before school&quot;)</description>

    <description>Gardner et al.'s (2012) self-report behavioral automaticity index, which consists of four items measured on 7-point strongly disagree-strongly agree scales. The items are: &quot;Getting 9 hours' sleep on the nights before school is something I do automatically,&quot; &quot;Getting 9 hours' sleep on the nights before school is something I do without thinking,&quot; &quot;Getting 9 hours' sleep on the nights before school is something I do without having to consciously remember,&quot; and &quot;Getting 9 hours' sleep on the nights before school is something I start doing before I realize I'm doing it.&quot;</description>
