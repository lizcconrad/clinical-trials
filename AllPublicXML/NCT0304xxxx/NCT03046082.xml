      Observation of prescription usage of anaerobic antibiotics for patients admitted to the ICU
      with pneumonia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is a common admitting diagnosis in the intensive care unit (ICU). When aspiration
      is suspected, antibiotics to cover anaerobes are frequently used , but in the absence of
      clear risk factors, current guidelines have questioned their role. It is unknown how
      frequently these guidelines are followed.
