  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to identify and use our knowledge on the barriers and
      facilitators to using systematic reviews (SR) by health care managers (HCM) and policy
      markers (PM) to develop and test a novel format for presentation of SR for HCM and PM. We
      will invite HCM and PM from hospitals and regional authorities in Ontario, Alberta, and
      British Columbia to participate in a randomized-control trial. Participants will receive a
      link to an online consent survey, and then be randomly allocated to receive access to a novel
      SR or its traditional presentation. There is no time limit to completing the task, and
      participants are able to save their responses and finish later. Participants are able to
      withdraw from the study by not completing the task.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in the conduct and reporting of traditional systematic reviews, current
      evidence suggests that they are used infrequently by health care managers and policy makers
      in decision making. Managers and policy makers have suggested that concise presentation
      positively affects the use of systematic reviews. The purpose of this randomized controlled
      trial is to assess the impact of a traditional systematic review format compared with the
      innovative format on the ability of health care managers and policy makers to understand the
      evidence in the review and apply it to a relevant health care decision making scenario.

      The two end-user groups have different formatting needs and we will therefore run 2 parallel
      studies, randomizing each group separately. Once participants have consented to participate,
      a computer generated randomization process will allocate them to one of 2 arms (1:1 ratio).
      Participants will either receive either a traditional format or a novel format. Unequal block
      randomization will be used and allocation will be concealed through central assignment.
      Outcomes assessors will be blinded and participants will be blinded to the citation of the
      review so that the traditional version will not be easily accessible in its original format
      from the relevant journal.

      This study will be the first study to engage health care managers and policy makers in the
      testing of formats for presentation of research evidence relevant to their needs. The results
      of the project will help increase the uptake of systematic review results in health care
      management policy decision-making, ultimately leading to informed decision making and
      positively impacting the health of Canadians.

A panel of 4 health care managers or policy makers from our research team and 2 content experts. Their answers will provide the definition of appropriate application of the evidence. Two investigators who will be blind to allocation will independently determine if the participant's answer agrees with that from the expert panel. Disagreements will be resolved by a third investigator, independently. Agreement between investigators will be reported using the kappa statistic.</description>
