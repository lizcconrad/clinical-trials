  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if colistin dosage adjustment using 4hr CrCl contribute
      to better clinical outcomes compared with drug dosage adjustment using eGFR in critical ill
      patients. In control group, colistin maintenance dosage will be decided using serum
      creatinine based eGFR (in ml/min). In study group, colistin maintenance dosage will be
      decided using 4hr CrCl.

      1. Screening periods (From 'informed consents' to 'randomization')

             -  Check of inclusion/exclusion criteria ② Measurement of 4hr CrCl &amp; eGFR in ml/min

                  -  calculation of maintenance dose ③ Baseline characteristics &amp; laboratory
                     findings ④ Randomization

        2. Colistin dosage Loading dose : 5 x body weight (not exceeding 300mg) Maintenance dose
           (after 12 hours from loading dose)

           : 2.5 x ([1.5 x GFR] + 30) (divided doses every 12hours), GFR in ml/min

           During the study period, daily morning serm creatinine levels are measured. Whenever
           serum creatinine concentration changes by more than 10% compared with baseline, 4hr CrCl
           will be mearued. At the every time of 4hr CrCl measurements, colistin dose wil be
           modified according to new GFR values (4hr CrCl in study group, eGFR in control group)

        3. Blood sampling for Colistin trough level measurement Peripheral blood will be sampled
           twice between 72 hrs and 144 hours after loading dose, just before colistin infusion.
           The samples were collected in heparined tubes and centrifuged at 4 °C within 1 hr of
           collection. The resulting plasma was stored at - 70°C . And two values will be averaged
           out.

        4. End of randomization (7 days after colistin initiation) ① Nephrotoxicity ② Treatment
           outcome microbiological outcome: eradication / no eradication clinical outcome: complete
           response / partial response / treatment failure
