  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate whether 12 weeks of IMM-124E in
      children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in combination with standard of care
      treatment will decrease inflammation in the liver as measured by alanine transaminase (ALT).
      Specifically, investigators will measure percent change in ALT from Week 0 to Week 12 in
      treatment compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, three month treatment trial of
      children aged 6-19 years. Participants will be recruited from the Children's Healthcare of
      Atlanta pediatric liver clinical practice.The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a three
      month treatment with IMM-124E (a bovine colostrum enriched with anti-LPS antibodies) in
      combination with standard of care lifestyle advice is safe and leads to greater improvement
      in hepatic inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and blood lipids in children with nonalcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD) compared to placebo with standard of care treatment.
      Investigators also seek to define the mechanism of action in response to three months of
      treatment with IMM-124E.
