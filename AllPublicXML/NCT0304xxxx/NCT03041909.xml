    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm study which will enroll up to 16 subjects with SCD who
      previously participated in the GBT440-001 study.

      Dosing of study drug will be for 2 to 6 months, depending on subject's dose assignment in the
      last administration of study drug in GBT440-001.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to a
      total of 6 months dosing of subjects with SCD who participated in the GBT440-001 study.
