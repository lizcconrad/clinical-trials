    <textblock>
      The 6-minute walk (6MWT) test is used in adults and children affected by a wide range of
      chronic diseases to evaluate their sub-maximal exercise capacity. It reflects the global
      response of various physiological systems (respiratory, cardio-vascular, neurologic,
      metabolic and musculosquelettic) in a situation simulating a daily life activity. In children
      with sickle cell disease, the 6MWT is correlated with a low level of hemoglobin, a low level
      of fetal hemoglobin and low red cell deformability. Our team previously reported that in a
      population of children with sickle cell disease, highly treated with hydroxyurea, the sole
      factor which was independently linked to the 6MWT was the presence of silence infarct.

      As the cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular injury in sickle cell disease are directly
      correlated with hemolysis, the investigators aim to evaluate a) the clinical relevance of
      endothelial and inflammation parameters and new hemolysis markers and b) if the presence of
      silent infarct and the 6MWT are correlated with this biological markers.

      This cross-sectional study will include sickle cell disease patients regularly followed for
      more than 5 years at Hôpital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, Centre Hospitalier
      Universitaire (CHU)-Brugmann, Centre Hospitalier Etterbeek-Ixelles, CHU Saint-Pierre,
      Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Bruxelles, Belgium). Inclusion criteria are: sickle cell
      disease (SS, Sbeta°, SC, Sbeta+), age range : 6 to 25 years, signed informed consent.
      Exclusion criteria are: transplanted patients, inability to perform the 6MWT (severe
      cognitive disability, femoral osteonecrosis with functional impairment), hospitalization and/
      or transfusion in the last 3 months for acute event.

      Demographic data and clinical data will be retrospectively recorded. Blood test and 6MWT will
      be performed in steady state. Studied analysis will be: coagulation factors, free hemoglobin,
      Pro-B type natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP), High sensitivity C reactive protein (HS-CRP),
      Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule (VCAM) and Selectins.

      With this study, the investigators expect to validate new predictive markers for
      cardio-vascular or cerebrovascular injury and to identify patients at high risk to develop
      these complications.
