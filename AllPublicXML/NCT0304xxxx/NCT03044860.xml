      Investigation of the anatomical distribution of enteroendocrine cells by a systematic
      approach along the entire human intestinal tract in healthy individuals and patients with
      type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enteroendocrine K and L cells are pivotal in regulating appetite and glucose homeostasis, but
      knowledge of their distribution in man is sparse and it is unknown whether alterations occur
      in type 2 diabetes. Twelve patients with type 2 diabetes and 12 age and BMI-matched healthy
      individuals underwent upper and lower double-balloon enteroscopy with mucosal biopsy
      retrieval from every ~30 cm of the small intestine and specific locations in the large
      intestine. The investigators evaluated the distribution of enteroendocrine cells (using IHC
      staining for their specific hormonal products) and evaluated mRNA expression of the
      corresponding genes along the entire intestinal tract in patients with type 2 diabetes and in
      healthy individuals.

    <description>Using a double-balloon enteroscopy device, mucosal biopsies are obtained from the entire intestinal tract in 12 healthy individuals and 12 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The biopsies are analysed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mRNA expression analysis.
Positively stained enteroendocrine cells (from IHC) are counted and divided by the epithelial area providing 'density' (cells/mm2).
The data obtained from cell count and mRNA expression analysis present the variation in number of enteroendocrine cells (density) and the expression of hormonal products along the intestinal tract.</description>
