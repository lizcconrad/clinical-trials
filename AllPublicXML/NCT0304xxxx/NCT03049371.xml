  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will explore behavioral, surgical and biological neovaginal and rectal HIV
      transmission risks and feasibility of collection of blood and ano-genital samples (rectal,
      genital and neo-vaginal, including urine) for microbiological, immunological and cytological
      characterization in the context of antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of HIV
      infection in TGW. This includes the feasibility of home self-collection of ano-genital
      samples prior to habitual cleansing of the anatomical collection site.

      A computer-administered questionnaire will collect quantitative demographic information and
      details about surgical history, neovaginal health, neovaginal practices, and sexual behavior
      including neovaginal intercourse and drug use history from each participant. The
      questionnaire can be completed online from any location or at the study clinic and will take
      about 15-20 minutes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be recruited through existing social networks among TGW and from the Thai
        Red Cross Anonymous and Tangerine Clinics providing HIV testing, care and treatment
        services. TGW attending clinic services will be offered enrollment in the study. Particular
        attention will be paid to offering enrollment to those attending HIV treatment and care
        services. The current study offers medical evaluation and a range of laboratory testing
        specific to the health of TGW, which may be of interest and beneficial to them. At the same
        time, the study may benefit from their participation.
