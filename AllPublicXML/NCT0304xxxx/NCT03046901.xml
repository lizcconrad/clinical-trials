  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of oral vancomycin in
      patients with recurrent Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) after liver transplantation. The
      primary endpoint is looking at the effect of the drug on liver function tests, an important
      surrogate of PSC disease activity at 12 weeks on treatment. Secondary endpoints include a
      decrease in liver function tests at 1 year, changes in bilirubin and adverse events.
      Effective treatment at the onset of PSC recurrence may lead to decreases in disease
      progression, recurrent liver failure, and repeat liver transplantation.

    <description>Vancomycin belongs to the family of medicines called antibiotics.When taken by mouth, is used to treat Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (also called C diff). C diff is a type of bacteria that causes severe diarrhea. Oral Vancomycin is also used to treat enterocolitis caused by a certain bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus). Subjects enrolled in the study will take 500 mg capsule, 3 times per day for 3-12 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. History of prior orthotopic liver transplant or liver and kidney transplant.

          2. Recurrent PSC confirmed by clinical labs (AST/ALT greater than 19 or ALKP greater than
             normal), imaging (MRCP or ERCP), and/or liver biopsy consistent with recurrent PSC.

          3. No clinical evidence of liver transplant rejection and stability of post-transplant
             immune suppression dosing for three months prior to enrollment in the study

          4. No changes to therapy for inflammatory bowel disease for at least three months prior
             to enrollment (for patients with history of IBD)

          5. Patients on ursodiol must have been on a stable dose for two weeks prior to enrollment
             and dose must be stable for the remainder of the clinical trial.

          6. All patients with inflammatory bowel disease must have had a colonoscopy within a year
             prior to enrollment

          7. No antibiotics for 2 months before starting vancomycin

          8. No probiotics for 1 month prior to starting vancomycin or during study period

          4. Inability to provide consent

          5. Findings suggestive of liver disease of other etiology such as chronic alcoholic liver
             disease, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary
             cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or congenital biliary disease.

          6. Current biliary obstruction
