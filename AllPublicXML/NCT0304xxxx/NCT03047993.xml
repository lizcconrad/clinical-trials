  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if CB-839 given in combination with
      azacitidine can help to control the disease in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. CB-839 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes only. Azacitidine is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of MDS. Its use in combination with CB-839 is investigational.
      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 46 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <textblock>
      Study Drug Administration:

      Every study cycle is 28 days.

        -  You will take CB-839 by mouth 2 times per day while you are on study. You should take
           each dose with food, and about 12 hours apart.

        -  You will receive azacitidine by vein over about 10-40 minutes, or as an injection under
           the skin about 1 hour after taking CB-839 on Days 1-7 of every cycle. If needed, you may
           receive azacitidine at your local doctor's office.

      It is important that you tell the study doctor about any drugs you are taking during the
      study. This includes prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, natural or herbal medicines,
      alternative medicines, and vitamins.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the End-of-Study visit.

      Study Visits:

      You may visit your regular home doctor for any study visits in which PD or PK testing is not
      taking place. However, you will need to come to MD Anderson on Day 1 of each cycle in order
      to get your supply of CB-839.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and pharmacokinetic (PK)
           testing before the dose of CB-839. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the
           body at different time points.

        -  Blood (about 8 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction
           to the study drug.

        -  You will have two EKGs within 2-4 hours after the dose.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, and Day 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn
      for PK testing before the dose. You should not take the morning dose of CB-839 at home before
      the clinic visits.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing, including
           genetic biomarkers.

      You will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate for biomarker and pharmacodynamic (PD)
      testing and to check the status of the disease on Day 1 of Cycles 1,2,4,6 and every 3 cycles
      after that. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the
      disease.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 28 days of the last dose of the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate for biomarker and PD testing. You may
           also have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for this sample instead.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 tablespoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.
