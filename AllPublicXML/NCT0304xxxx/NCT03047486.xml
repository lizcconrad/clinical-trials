  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reference treatment of the type 1 diabetes is intensified insulin therapy by insulin
      pump. The CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) is a technology available for a decade, which
      allows the continuous measure of interstitial glucose rate. The results are available in real
      time to the user, who can so use them to optimize the adjustment of its treatment by insulin
      pump. Since a few years, several research programs aim for finalizing an automated system
      using the data of real time interstitial glucose to adjust automatically, via an algorithm,
      the release of insulin by the pump. This type of closed-loop system is for the moment only
      experimental, not still widely available in routine. On the other hand, rudimentary
      regulation systems partially automated already exist and can be used in common clinical
      practice. One of these systems, Smartguard ®, allows this type of regulation to decrease the
      hypoglycemic risk of the patients treated by insulin pump. It is indeed a hypo minimizer
      which interrupts the basal output when the algorithm embarked on the pump determines thanks
      to the CGM data what a hypoglycemia risks to occur in the 30 minutes. The efficiency of this
      system to reduce hypoglycemias was proved by several studies in pediatric and adult
      populations of subjects with DT1 (Diabetes Care on 2015; 38:1197-1204. J Diabetes Sci
      Technol. 2016 May 20. Pii: 1932296816645119). However, to date, there are no published data
      concerning the method of use of this system (sensor et pump initial configuration; patient
      education), nor the evolution of the sensor and pump parameters during the use.

      The aim of this observationnelle study is to collect the data of efficiency, safety and use
      of the system Smartguard ® in common clinical practice in an adult population of subjects
      DT1.

        This prospective trial involved adult patients with Type 1 Diabetes for at least 1 year,
        and a treatement by insulin pump (CSII) for at least 6 months, to study and describe the
        efficacy and safety of the predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) system in real life, in
        difficult diabetes (severe hypoglycemia, unawared hypoglycemia, brittle diabetes).
