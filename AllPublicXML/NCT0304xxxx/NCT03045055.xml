  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke, which is due to the occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel, comprises nearly
      90% of all strokes. Currently, reperfusion of the salvageable tissue via thrombolytic drug or
      endovascular treatment is the most effective strategy to reduce brain damage. However, after
      recanalizing the occluded vessels, subsequent reperfusion injury is inevitable. It may not
      only weaken the therapeutic effects of timely reperfusion but also impede patients' recovery.
      Moreover, thousands of neuroprotective drugs effective in experimental models have been
      proved to be unsuccessful in clinical trials. Therefore, effective strategies are urgently
      needed to prevent and treat cerebral reperfusion injury and further improve the prognosis of
      acute ischemic stroke.

      Researchers applied remote ischemic conditioning to mouse model of focal cerebral reperfusion
      injury and found that it could reduce cerebral infarct size. And clinical researches
      demonstrated that remote ischemic conditioning was an effective strategy to improve cerebral
      perfusion and prevent recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke. However, whether
      remote ischemic conditioning is safe and effective in protecting patients with large-vessel
      ischemic stroke and undergoing endovascular treatment is still unclear. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that RIC is a safe and effective strategy to reduce brain injuries in stroke
      patients undergoing endovascular treatment.
