  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effect of the oral probiotic Lactobacillus
      reuteri Prodentis (PerioBalance®, Sunstar, Switzerland) on implants with mucositis or
      periimplantitis, as a coadjuvant treatment of mechanical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 44 patients, 22 with mucositis and 22 with periimplantitis, were randomly assigned
      to either the control or the test group, so that 11 patients received placebo and 11
      probiotic treatment. After the baseline clinical, radiological and microbiological
      examination, and once the study group was randomly assigned (probiotic or placebo),
      supragingival prophylaxis was performed in the mucositis group and subgingival mechanical
      therapy in the periimplantitis group. Then they get a container with 30 probiotic or placebo
      tablets and instructions on how and when to take them. At 30 and 90 days after beginning the
      treatment, a clinical, radiological and microbiological examination was performed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Probing pocket depth</measure>
    <time_frame>Differences between baseline and 30 and 90 days will be calculated.</time_frame>
    <description>The probing pocket depth was recorded, in millimeters and at six points per tooth and implant, as the distance from the gingival margin to the bottom of the periodontal pocket and peri-implant mucosa. Measurements will be performed by a masked and calibrated investigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>Differences between baseline and 30 and 90 days will be calculated.</time_frame>
    <description>The general plaque index (PI) was recorded according to O'Leary et al., dichotomously assigning the presence or absence of plaque on four surfaces per tooth and implant. The implant plaque index (IPI) was recorded by assigning a dichotomous value to the presence or absence of plaque (1 indicating presence of plaque and 0 absence of plaque) of the implant under study. Measurements will be performed by a masked and calibrated investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding on probing</measure>
    <time_frame>Differences between baseline and 30 and 90 days will be calculated.</time_frame>
    <description>The general bleeding on probing (BOP) was determined according to Ainamo and Bay, evaluating dichotomously the presence or absence of bleeding on the mesial, distal, buccal and lingual/palatal dental or implant surfaces. The implant bleeding on probing (BOPI) was recorded using a dichotomous value depending on whether the implant under study presented bleeding or not (1 indicated bleeding and 0 no bleeding). Measurements will be performed by a masked and calibrated investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Microbiological tests</measure>
    <time_frame>Differences between baseline and 30 and 90 days will be calculated.</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological tests were performed in the deepest periimplant pocket, using the Guidor Perio-Implant Diagnostic Test® (Sunstar S.A, Switzerland), which by means of Real-Time PCR identified and quantified the total bacterial load of A. actinomycetemcomitans (DSM 8324), T. forsythia (CIP 105220), P. gingivalis (DSM 20709), T. denticola (DSM 14222), P. intermedia (DSM 20706), P. micros (DSM 20468), F. nucleatum (DSM 20482), C. rectus (LMG 18530) and E. corrodens (DSM 8340). Measurements will be performed by a masked and calibrated investigator.</description>
