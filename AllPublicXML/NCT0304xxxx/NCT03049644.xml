  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical diagnosis and treatment (MDT) and Manual Therapy (MT) have both demonstrated
      efficacy in the management of CLBP. The use of a Point of Care (POC) design in this study
      will allow for comparison of these two treatment modalities in a clinical setting. The
      purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling and
      collecting outcome data on CLBP patients utilizing the POC methodology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 new patients entering the chiropractic clinic who meet inclusion criteria including
      demonstrating a directional preference upon physical examination during their initial
      evaluation will be recruited. Patients will be queried as to interest and those interested
      will be consented. Patients will then be randomized utilizing a computer generated
      randomization chart to receive either MDT or MT delivered in a pragmatic manner. Outcomes
      will include: Pain (PEG), Quality of Life (PROMIS Global Health Survey (GHS)), psychosocial
      questions and Self Efficacy (2 Question). Outcomes will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks and
      8 weeks post baseline.
