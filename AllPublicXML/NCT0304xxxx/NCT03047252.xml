  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to compare the outcomes of a home-based rehabilitation program using a
      novel kinematic biofeedback system in the rehabilitation after total knee replacement.

      This system allows the patients to perform independent rehabilitation sessions at home, under
      remote monitoring from the clinical team.

      The investigators hypothesize that the clinical outcomes of a home-based rehabilitation
      program will be at least similar to the outcomes of a traditional home-based rehabilitation
      with face-to-face sessions.

      This is a randomized controlled trial with active comparator. Patients will be enrolled
      pre-operatively and divided into 2 groups: experimental group and conventional rehabilitation
      group. Both groups will perform 8 weeks of rehabilitation starting between day 7 and 10 after
      surgery.

      The experimental group will perform daily rehabilitation sessions at home using the system,
      under remote monitoring from a physical therapist. The conventional rehabilitation group will
      perform 1h rehabilitation sessions 3 times a week, at home, given by a physical therapist.

      Outcomes will be measured at weeks 4 and 8 and then at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome is
      the change in performance in the Timed-up-and-Go (TUG) test in comparison with the
      pre-operative score. Secondary outcomes will be measured in terms of: b) Knee Osteoarthritis
      Outcome Score); c) range of motion of the knee joint (flexion/extension);

    <description>The system will be used independently by the patients to perform rehabilitation sessions at home, under remote monitoring from the clinical team. A tailored rehabilitation program will be prescribed, based on the following principles:
STAGE 1 (Weeks 0-2) Open kinetic chain exercises without added resistance: lying, sitting and standing (with support) Strengthening of hip flexors and extensors Ice pack application after each session and throughout the day as needed STAGE 2 (weeks 3-6) Open kinetic chain exercises with added resistance, progressing to closed kinetic chain exercises, with strengthening of knee flexors and extensors and knee stabilization Progression to standing exercises without support lying, sitting and standing (with support) Exercises with steps Ice pack application after each session and throughout the day as needed STAGE 3 (Weeks 7-8) Eccentric strengthening exercises Exercises involving steps Multi-directional exercises</description>
