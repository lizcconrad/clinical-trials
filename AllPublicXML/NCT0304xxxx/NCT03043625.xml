  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Non-specific neck pain (NS-NP) is characterized by pain in structures located in
      the region between the superior nuchal line and the spinal process of the first thoracic
      vertebra, without association with any specific systemic disease provided by multifactorial
      and/or little known causes.

      Objective: The objective of the present study will be to verify the clinical effects of MV
      through visceral nociceptive inhibition in NS-NP patients with functional dyspepsia.

      Methods: In this study sixty NS-NP patients with functional dyspepsia (age: 18 and 50 years)
      will be randomized in into two groups: visceral manipulation group (VMG) (n =30) and control
      group (CG) (n =30). The VMG will be treated with visceral manipulation to the stomach and
      liver wile CG received placebo treatment. The immediate effects and 7 days after treatment
      will be evaluated through pain, cervical range, and electromyographic activity of the upper
      trapezius.

    <description>Participants will be instructed to lie down comfortably on a stretcher in the supine position, with lower limbs flexed and abdomen exposed, and the physiotherapist positioned to the right side of the patient. The therapeutic intervention will be began with the left hand of the physiotherapist in contact with the lower region of the stomach, to which a force will be applied so that the organ was moved in an upper and lateral left direction while the right hand controlled and directed the knees of the patient to the right side until the moment when the physiotherapist notice an increase in tension in the stomach region. For the liver manipulation, the same procedures will be followed, however, with contact in the right epigastric region and the knees directed to the left side. The same position will be maintained for each organ treated until the physiotherapist could feel, through touch, a decrease in the tension of the viscera. The mean treatment time will 5 minutes.</description>
