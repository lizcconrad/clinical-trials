      Metabolic acidosis is a frequent problem in cardiopulmonary bypass. The cause is poorly
      understood, but it appears to be multifactorial. It is assumed to be result of hypoperfusion
      with resultant lactatemia. And other theories include bicarbonate dilution to excessive
      proton activity and diluting fluid.The main three contributors for the development of
      metabolic acidosis are stress of anaesthesia, surgery and Cardio Pulmonary Bypass(CPB)
      prime.Even after research discussion and debate, there is no agreement upon ideal prime.The
      literature is extensive, comparing different types of colloids, colloids versus crystalloids,
      synthetic versus organic, and inclusion of numerous additions in an attempt to make a grossly
      unphysiological state the least disruptive to the body as possible

      REVIEW OF LITERATURE The ideal prime for Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) has never been fully
      established. The development of acid-base disorders during some routine cases and the
      possible contribution to this from priming fluids caused this hospital to question its
      protocol.

      Plasma Lyte-A injection, pH 7.4, is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution, for
      intravenous administration. Each 100mL contains 368mg of Sodium acetate Trihydrate,
      (C2H3NaO2.3H2O), 502 mg of Sodium gluconate (C6H11NaO7), 526 mg of sodium chloride, (NaCl),
      30 mg of Magnesium chloride (MgCl2.6H2O) ,37 mg of Potassium chloride, (KCl). It contains no
      anti microbial agents. pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide. Its pH is 7.4 (6.5 to 8).

      One litre has an ionic concentration of 27mEq of acetate, and 23mEq of gluconate, 5mEq of
      potassium, 140mEq sodium, 3mEq of magnesium, 98mEq of chloride. The osmolarity of 294mOsm/ml.
      Normal physiological osmolarity range is 280 to 310mOsm/lit. Administration of substantially
      hypertonic solutions may cause vein damage. The calorie content is 21 k.Cal/lit.

      100ml of Ringer's lactate contains 320mg of sodium lactate, 600mg of sodium chloride, 40mg of
      potassium chloride, and 27mg of calcium chloride. It is equivalent to sodium of 130mEq,
      calcium of 3mEq, potassium of 4mEq, bicarbonate of 28mEq and chloride of 109mEq. Hence it has
      value as source of water, electrolytes and calories.

      Infusion fluids that do not contain the physiological buffer base bicarbonate tend to produce
      dilutional acidosis because infusion of such solution dilutes (reduces) the HCO3-
      concentration (buffer base) of the entire extracellular compartment, while the partial
      pressure of CO2 (buffer acid) remains constant. Dilution may be isovolemic (normovolemic),
      i.e., HCO3- is lost along with the blood and the blood or extracellular fluid volume is
      restored to normal with a solution that is free of HCO3-, or the ECFV is expanded with a
      bicarbonate-free solution to produce hypervolemia. A decrease in arterial pH to 7.20 was
      observed in a dog model after infusion of 1,500mL of 0.9 % NaCl solution in 5 minutes, while
      no such effect was observed in dogs infused with the same volume of a solution containing
      30mmol/L of NaHCO3. In summary, dilutional acidosis is predictable and defined as an
      iatrogenic disruption brought on by bicarbonate dilution in the entire extracellular space
      which may be associated with hyperchloremia or hypochloremia depending on whether dilution
      was produced by infusion of a hyperchloremic or hypochloremic solution.

      Dilutional acidosis can be prevented by the use of adequate concentrations of metabolizable
      anions to replace HCO3-.The following anions of organic acids, acetate (acetic acid), lactate
      (lactic acid), gluconate (gluconicacid), malate or hydrogen malate (malic acid), and citrate
      (citric acid) may be used as metabolizable bases. Consuming H+ ions and oxygen in the
      process, these anions are metabolized in the intact liver (mainly lactate) or in muscle
      (mainly acetate and malate) to produce HCO3-. At pH 7.40, carbonic acid (H2CO3) is the only
      H+ ion source of the body (while supplied at a low concentration of 1.2mmol/L, H2CO3 can be
      synthesized freely from CO2 + H2O). HCO3- is therefore released in equimolar amounts. For
      every mole of acetate, gluconate, or lactate oxidized, one mole of bicarbonate is produced,
      while for every mole of malate or citrate oxidized, 2 or 3 moles of bicarbonate are produced,
      respectively. The two latter metabolizable anions would thus produce excessively high,
      unphysiological bicarbonate concentrations. If an infusion fluid contains metabolizable
      anions in concentrations exceeding the lack of bicarbonate, infusion-induced alkalosis is a
      likely consequence, called rebound alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis is always iatrogenic. The
      normal plasma acetate concentration is very low and has been reported to range from 0.06 to
      0.2mmol/L. Patients undergoing acetate hemodialysis have had plasma acetate levels as high as
      6.5mmol/L.

      Acetate Metabolism

      Any metabolic pathway must be electro-neutral on balance. Acetate (the base the patient is
      infused with) is therefore oxidized in the form of acetic acid (after taking up H+). Two
      moles of O2 are required per mole of acetic acid. The chemical equation for the reaction of
      sodium acetate with oxygen is:

      CH3-COONa + 2 O2&lt;------&gt; CO2 + H2O + NaHCO3

      Two important conclusions can be drawn from this equation:

        1. For every mole of acetate oxidized, one mole of bicarbonate is produced; this is the
           expected effect of acetate for HCO3- replacement or alkalization.

        2. For every two moles of O2 consumed, only one mole of CO2 is produced. This is a
           surprising &quot;side&quot; effect in that the respiratory quotient (RQ) for acetate is only 0.5.
           Compared with glucose (dextrose), which has a RQ of 1.0, this means that the metabolism
           of acetate causes only half the inhaled O2 to be exhaled as CO2.

      Compared with HCO3-, acetate has practically the same effect Lactate Metabolism CH3-CH-COONa
      + 3 O2 &lt;-----&gt;CO2 + 2H2O + 2NaOH CO2 +H2O &lt;-----&gt;H2CO3 H2CO3 + NaOH&lt;----&gt;NaHCO3+H2O Summary :
      Na lactate +3O2 &lt;-----&gt; 2CO2+2 H2O+NaHCO3 At the basal metabolic rate (BMR), the myocardium,
      muscle, brain, intestinal mucosa, and red blood cells produce approximately 1mmol of
      lactate/kg/h, and more than half of it is eliminated by the liver.

      At the BMR, gluconeogenesis accounts for approximately 20 % and oxidation for approximately
      80 % of lactate metabolism. When lactate is supplied exogenously, up to 70 % of lactate can
      be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Intrahepatic gluconeogenesis ceases once pH falls
      below 7.1, or a base excess (BE) of -15mmol/L. Incipient hepatic dysfunction (increases in
      bilirubin and SGOT) quickly results in lactate concentrations as high as 8mmol/L, which are
      associated with very high mortality. Compared with acetate, lactate infusion is characterized
      by a relatively slow onset of alkalization and, therefore, has been called &quot;delayed HCO3-
      infusion&quot;. Peak lactate turnover has been reported to be approximately 450mmol/h. As glucose
      levels may increase quite significantly after lactate administration, it comes as no surprise
      that intra-operatively administered Ringer's lactate may cause glucose concentrations to
      double in diabetics. Plasma lactate has similarly high predictive power to base excess for
      mortality in patients with various forms of shock including cardiac, hemorrhagic, and septic
      shock. Subsequent mortality is approximately 50 % when plasma lactate (not blood lactate)
      exceeds 4 to 7mmol/L in the first 24 to 48 hours of shock. An initial value of only 3mmol/L
      plasma lactate concentration predicts a 25 % mortality of cardiac, hemorrhagic, and septic
      shock patients.

      Many physicians apparently are not aware that the use of lactate-containing infusion fluids
      (such as Ringer's lactate) or blood products (such as packed red cells) and the diagnostic
      use of lactate as a marker of hypoxia are mutually exclusive.

      Lilley A et al conducted a survey to analyze practice of CPB circuit priming. The response
      rate was 74%. It was found that no two units in the UK used the same prime. The most common
      reason for fluid choice was historical beliefs and there appeared to be little perceived
      association between prime and acidosis on bypass. The results revealed that there is no
      consensus in the UK of the preferential prime for CPB, suggesting the effect this aspect has
      is not fully understood.

      Liskaser FJ et al studied role of pump prime in the etiology and pathogenesis of CPB acidosis
      and reported that fluid with no lactate significantly limits the increase in the serum
      lactate concentrations in post operative period. In this study he has compared the Ringer's
      solution and Plasma Lyte-A. He has done a prospective, double blind randomized trial, which
      was conducted in a tertiary health care centre with 22 patients, undergoing CPB for coronary
      artery bypass surgery. He concluded that CPB induced metabolic acidosis appears to be
      iatrogenic in nature and derived from effect of pump prime fluid on acid-base balance. The
      extent of such acidosis and its duration varies according the type of pump prime.

      Hayhoe M et al conducted a study and concluded that in patients receiving pump prime rich in
      chloride and polygeline, metabolic acidosis in CPB is mainly due to iatrogenic chloride
      concentration and unmeasured strong anions.Sampling of arterial blood at four time intervals:
      post-induction, on CPB during cooling and rewarming, and at skin closure. Measurement of
      serum Na+ K+, Mg++ ,Ca++, Cl-, bicarbonate, and phosphate concentrations, arterial blood
      gases, and serum albumin, lactate, and pyruvate concentrations at each collection point.
      Analysis of findings according to quantitative physicochemical principles, including
      calculation of the strong ion difference apparent, the strong ion difference effective, and
      the strong ion gap (SIG). All patients developed a mild metabolic acidosis. The median serum
      standard bicarbonate concentration decreased from 25.0mEq/l post-induction to 22.3mEq/l at
      cooling and 22.2mEq/l at rewarming (p &lt; 0.05).The standard base excess decreased from a
      median of 1.55mEq/l prior to CPB, to ±2.50mEq/l at cooling,±1.65mEq/l at rewarming
      and,±0.85mEq/l at skin closure(p &lt;0.001). This mild metabolic acidosis occurred despite a
      decrease in the median serum lactate concentration from 3.20mEq/l post-induction to 1.83,
      1.80, and 1.58mEq/l at the three other time points. The increase in the median serum chloride
      concentration from 104.9mEq/l post induction to111.0,111.1,and110.0mEq/l at the subsequent
      time points (p&lt;0.0001) was the main cause of the acidosis. There was also a significant
      increase in the SIG of 3.8mEq/l at cooling and rewarming (p&lt;0.0001), suggesting a role for
      other unmeasured anions (polygeline) in the genesis of this acidosis. He has concluded that
      using quantitative biophysical methods, it can be demonstrated that, in patients receiving a
      pump prime rich in chloride and polygeline, the metabolic acidosis of CPB is mostly due to
      iatrogenic increases in serum chloride concentration and unmeasured strong anions (SIG). Its
      development is partially attenuated by iatrogenic hypoalbuminaemia. Changes in lactate
      concentrations did not play a role in the development of metabolic acidosis in the patients.

      Himpe D et al conducted a study by adding lactate to prime fluid during CPB and concluded
      that exogenous lactate attenuated the CPB related acidosis. He has conducted study on twenty
      patients scheduled for coronary surgery was studied prospectively. All patients were treated
      identically, except for the prime, which either contained lactate or was lactate free. Just
      before bypass and before coming off bypass, haemoglobin, glucose, plasma osmolality and
      colloid osmotic pressure were determined; albumin, lactate, sodium, potassium, ionized
      calcium, magnesium, phosphate, arterial pH, pCO2, bicarbonate, and base excess were measured
      for use in Stewart's analysis. Metabolic acidosis had resolved by the end of bypass with the
      lactated prime. Although the strong ion gap (apparent minus effective strong ion difference)
      increased significantly in both groups, its composition differed significantly between the
      groups. The Stewart technique detected polyanionic gelatin as a weak acid component
      contributing to the unidentified anion fraction. Colloid osmotic pressure was maintained in
      both groups. He concluded that exogenous lactate attenuates acidosis related to CPB.

      Weinberg LD et al conducted a randomized blinded study of 50 adult patients undergoing
      elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft or heart valve replacement. Both groups received a
      prime solution of 2000mL; anions lactate and chloride (Hartmann's), or anions acetate,
      gluconate and chloride (Plasma Lyte-A).Blood was collected immediately prior to CPB (BL),
      2-minutes (T2), 5-minutes (T5), 10-minutes (T10), 30-minutes (T30), and 60-minutes (T60) on
      CPB. Patient characteristics were evenly matched. On delivery of pump prime both groups
      developed metabolic acidosis. Plasma Lyte-A, standard BE: 0.53mmol/L (BL) to -3.03mmol/L
      (T2), P&lt;0.001; Hartmann's standard BE: 0.42mmol/L (BL) to -2.20mmol/L (T2), P&lt;0.001. There
      was a surge in the Plasma Lyte-A group's SIG - 1.39mEq/L (BL) to 12.13mEq/L (T2), P&lt;0.001,
      remaining elevated at T60 (6.22mEq/L). The SIG in the Hartmann's group increased from
      0.43mEq/L (BL) to 2.00mEq/L (T2). The Hartmann's group experienced a significant lactate
      surge at 2 minutes (P&lt;0.001) remaining elevated at T60; there was no hyperlactatemia in the
      Plasma Lyte-A group. There was significant hyperchloraemia with Hartmann's compared to Plasma
      Lyte-A. He concluded that the mechanism of acidosis with Hartmann's solution was due to
      combination of iatrogenic hyperlactatemia and hyperchloraemia. The mechanism with Plasma
      Lyte-A was a production of unmeasured anions (likely acetate and gluconate). Metabolic
      acidosis can be treated or minimized by widening the strong ion difference (alkalinizing
      effect), maintaining a higher sodium concentration (use of sodium bicarbonate), while
      decreasing the chloride through use of intravenous fluids with lower chloride concentrations
      compared the Hartmann's solution and Plasma Lyte-A.

      Morgan TJ et al designed a bicarbonate based crystalloid based circuit balanced on
      physio-chemical principles with a strong ion difference of 24mEq/l compared its acid base
      effects with those of Plasma-Lyte 148 a multiple electrolyte replacement solution containing
      acetate and gluconate (total 50mEq/l). Twenty patients with normal acid base status
      undergoing elective cardiac study were randomized 1:1 to a 2 litres prime of either
      bicarbonate based fluid or Plasma-Lyte 148. With the trial fluid metabolic acid base status
      was normal following cardiopulmonary bypass initiation (standard base excess 0.1 (1.3) mEq/l,
      mean, SD), whereas plasma Lyte - 148 produced a slight metabolic acidosis (standard base
      excess 2.2 (2.1)mEq/l, mean, SD). Estimated group difference after baseline adjustment was
      3.6mEq/l (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 5.1 p=0.0001). By late bypass mean standard base
      excess in both groups was normal (0.8(2.2)mEq/l Vs -0.8 (1.3) p=0.5). Strong ion gap values
      were unaltered with trial fluid, but with the Plasma Lyte - 148 increased significantly on
      bypass initiation. (15.2(2.5)mEq/l Vs 2.5(1.5)mEq p&lt;0.0001 )remaining elevated in late
      bypass. (8.4(3.4)mEq/l Vs5.8(2.4)mEq/l p&lt;0.05). They have concluded that bicarbonate based
      crystalloid with strong ion difference of 24mEq/l is balanced for cardiopulmonary bypass in
      patients with normal acid base status, whereas Plasma-Lyte 148 trigger a surge of unmeasured
      anions, persisting throughout the bypass. These are likely to be acetate and gluconate.

      Alston RP et al studied the effects of changing the solutions back to Hartmann's on metabolic
      acidosis that develops during CPB in patients undergoing heart surgery. He has taken two
      groups of patients were studied. The first received Ringer's (n = 63) and the second
      Hartmann's solution (n = 66). Arterial blood samples were taken before induction of
      anaesthesia and towards the end of CPB. Samples were analyzed in a blood gas analyzer.
      Results: Hydrogen ion concentration increased from 38 (4) to 41 (7)mmol/L in the Ringer's
      group, but decreased from 38 (5) to 36 (6)mmol L-1 in the Hartmann's group. Changes in PaCO2
      (0.77, p &lt; 0.001) and volume of fluid administered (r = 0.23, p &lt; 0.01) were significant
      univariate correlates of change in hydrogen ion concentration, but haemoglobin concentration
      was not (r &lt; 0.01, p = 0.97). Analysis of variance for repeated measures found significant
      difference between subject effects on the change in hydrogen ion concentration during CPB
      caused by the choice of intravascular solution used (p &lt; 0.001) and PaCO2 (p = 0.001), but
      not as a result of the volume of solution administered (p &gt; 0.10). He concluded that changing
      the solutions used for priming and intravascular volume replacement from Ringer's to
      Hartmann's was associated with a reduction in metabolic acidosis that developed during CPB.

      Murray DM et at al conducted a study to define the true incidence and nature of acidosis in
      paediatric patients post cardiac surgery. In their study Tissue acidosis occurred overall in
      60 of 150 samples. This was due to raised unmeasured acids alone in 44 of 60 (73.3%), raised
      lactate alone in six of 60 (10%), and a combination of the two in ten of 60 (16.6%).
      Hyperchloremia occurred in 19 of 150 samples overall and 12 of 25 (48%) samples immediately
      after cardiopulmonary bypass. Measured base deficit showed a poor correlation with true
      tissue acidosis (p &lt; 0.001) and the worst discriminatory ability. They concluded that
      metabolic acidosis occurs frequently post cardiac surgery and is largely due to raised
      unmeasured acids and less commonly raised lactate. Hyperchloremia is common, particularly
      after cardiopulmonary bypass.

      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Primary Objective To study whether Ringer's lactate and Plasma Lyte-A, as

      STASTISTICAL ANALYSIS As discussed in methodology, the primary objective is to compare Plasma
      Lyte-A and Ringer's lactate as cardiopulmonary bypass prime on the basis of ABG.

      Hence the lactate is primary outcome variable which is quantitative in nature. It is presumed
      that the variable lactate will follow normal distribution and therefore, the appropriate
      statistical test to study the significant difference at each condition between the two groups
      will be independent t-test.

      If it doesn't follow normal distribution non-parametric alternative of independent t-test
      will be used like Mann-Whitney U-test.

      To see the trend within the group at different time intervals, repeated measure ANOVA will be
      used.

      Summary statistics for the quantitative variables will be represented by mean, SD and for the
      qualitative variable will be represented by number or percentage.

      To see the trend, line chart will be used. All the proposed tests will be used at 5% level of
      significance (α) All the statistical computation will be done on Statistical Package for
      Social Sciences software (SPSS version 22.0) on windows operating system.

      ETHICAL JUSTIFICATION Recent studies have demonstrated that better outcomes in terms of
      acidosis with the use of Plasma Lyte-A (Acetate containing balanced crystalloid solution) as
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass prime, being more physiological to plasma in composition. Thus, the
      present study compares the effects of Plasma Lyte-A as a priming fluid with respect to ringer
      lactate.

      According to the guidelines set up by Indian Council of Medical Research (1994) and Helsinki
      Declaration (modified 2000), the following will be adhered to in all patients enrolled in the
      study.

           FORM Part-A: Patient Information Sheet We at PGIMER, Chandigarh are conducting research
           on Plasma Lyte-A as a CPB priming fluid. (Study title: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS BETWEEN
           RINGER'S LACTATE VS ACETATE CONTAINING BALANCED CRYSTALLOID SOLUTION (PLASMA LYTE-A) AS
           CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS PRIME). I am going to give you information and invite you to be
           part of this research. You will have full rights to decide whether or not you will
           participate in the research. Before you decide, you can talk to anyone (or your family
           physician) you feel comfortable with about the research. There may be some words that
           you do not understand. Please ask me to stop as we go through the information and I will
           take time to explain. If you have questions later, you can ask them of me, the study
           doctor or the staff).

           Purpose of the research Recent studies have demonstrated that better outcomes in terms
           of acidosis with the use of Plasma Lyte-A as Cardiopulmonary Bypass prime, being more
           physiological to plasma in composition. Thus, the present study compares the effects of
           Plasma Lyte-A as a priming flud with respect to ringer lactate.

           Type of Research Intervention This research will compare the possible effects of Plasma
           Lyte-A as CPB prime with respect to conventionally using ringer lactate in our
           institute.

           Participant selection We are inviting all patients of age &gt;18 years undergoing
           Cardiopulmonary bypass for the coronary artery disease and heart valve surgeries in the
