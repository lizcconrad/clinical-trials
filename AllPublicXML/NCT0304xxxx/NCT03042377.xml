    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative
      pain after retreatment using different techniques. Patients whom need retreatment were
      included. The presence of postoperative pain was assessed after retreatment cases at 1, 6,
      12, 24 and 48 hrs.

      The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the intensity and duration of postoperative
      pain after single-visit and multiple-visit root canal retreatment procedures. Patients who
      have asymptomatic failed endodontically treated teeth were included in this study and routine
      channel treatment procedure will be applied to these teeth. All of the patients have been
      recruited from the Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. Eighty
      asymptomatic teeth were randomly participated into four treatment groups in terms of
      intracanal medicament applied. The presence of postoperative pain was assessed after 1, 6,
      12, 24 and 48 hrs. Postoperative pain was recorded by each patient by using visual analogue
      pain scale. Before the retreatments, the nature of the study, complications and associated
      risks were totally explained and written informed consent was obtained from all study
      participants. The patients were offered local anesthetic before the treatment start. The
      routine root canal retreatment procedure was applied. Different intracanal medicaments used
      between sessions in accordance to the manufacturers' instructions. At the end of retreatment,
      each patient was given an evaluation sheet, explained the treatment procedure and using of
      visual analogue pain scales, and informed to be returned during the following one week. After
      one week the teeth was examined according to for pain intensity, percussion &amp; palpation
      sensitivity, swelling, analgesic intake and clinical status.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of the study was to assess if different intracanal medicaments and single-visit root retreatment influence the occurrence of postoperative pain.Postoperative pain was assessed using a well defined Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (VAS) scale. Each patient recorded the pain level on a 170-mm VAS scale experimental basis for revising the graphic rating scale for pain in well-defined categories at 5 time intervals as 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after treatment.The mm marks were removed from the scale and the scale was divided into 4 categories: No pain or faint pain corresponded to 0 mm. Mild pain was defined as greater than 0 mm and less than or equal to 54 mm. Mild pain included the descriptors of weak and mild pain. Moderate pain was defined as greater than 54 mm and less than 144 mm. Intense pain was defined as equal to or greater than 144 mm. Intense pain included the descriptors of strong, severe, and maximum possible.</description>
