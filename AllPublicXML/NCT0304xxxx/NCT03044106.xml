      Purpose: To conduct a pilot study of the effect of Cranial Laser Reflex Technique (CLRT)
      compared with sham laser on hamstring muscle flexibility, strength, and pain pressure
      threshold.

      Participants: Active, young adults ages 18 to 35.

      Procedures: In a single, blinded crossover fashion, subjects will complete three functional
      hamstring tests after CLRT and after sham laser treatment. Subjects will also complete
      questionnaires to assess their expectations and perceptions of the interventions.

      First Visit. The research staff will schedule all study visits in the Neurophysiology Lab or
      other appropriate site in the UNC Healthcare system or medical school. The baseline phase of
      the first visit will include review of inclusion/exclusion criteria and the components of the
      study. Those who wish to sign the consent will complete a brief questionnaire on their
      activity level, history of hamstring injuries, and perceived hamstring tightness.

      Randomization/Random Allocation. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and give consent
      will be randomized to one of the following for the first treatment period: 1) active CLRT; or
      2) sham laser. At the first intervention visit, the research assistant will enter the
      subject's assigned ID into an online computer program (selected by study biostatistician) to
      determine assignment to one of the two periods. The study biostatistician will use
      computer-generated random numbers to generate the allocation sequence using random blocks of
      random sizes. The program documents treatment assignment in an un-editable form including a
      date stamp.

      Post Randomization. After randomization, subjects will be asked to complete the three
      functional hamstring tests: KEA, HHD, and PPT. Subjects will have direct contact with the
      investigator and research assistant at each visit to facilitate adverse event reporting.

      Assessments. KEA: The 90-90 Knee Extension Angle test is a functional assessment designed to
      assess lower extremity flexibility and is considered the gold standard for hamstring length.
      The participant will be in the supine position on a treatment table. The tested extremity
      (the right leg in each subject) will be placed in a 90째 hip and 90째 knee position with the
      contralateral lower extremity placed flat on the table. A digital inclinometer will be
      consistently placed at the level of the medial malleoli and the superior pole of the patella.
      The examiner will maintain 90째 of hip flexion. Pelvic position will be monitored by palpation
      of the anterior superior iliac spine and lumbar spinous processes to maintain a neutral
      pelvic position. The examiner will passively extend the knee to the point of a ''strong, but
      tolerable stretch,&quot; as reported by the subject. The examiner will read the angle of the
      inclinometer and record the mean value of three attempts. A greater angle indicates greater
      degree of flexibility.

      Hand held Dynamometry (HHD) is currently considered a reliable and valid measurement of peak
      muscle contraction. The subject will be prone on the table with right leg bent to 90째. The
      tester will place the dynamometer (microFET2; Hoggan Health Industries, Salt Lake City, UT)
      at the heel of the participant and apply force to the heel, gradually increasing in 3 to 5
      seconds. Participants will be instructed to resist the applied force and maximally contract
      the hamstring muscle against the HHD device. The test ends once they are no longer able to
      resist the force and the leg begins to move (break point). The investigator will record the
      mean value of three attempts.

      Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) is a reliable, accurate and valid method for measuring muscle
      pain sensitivity and response to treatment. The digital algometer (FDX, Wagner Instruments,
      Greenwich, CT) is a hand-held muscle tester with a range of 0-100 lbf that consists of a
      padded disc with a diameter of 0.5&quot; attached to a microprocessor-control unit that measures
      peak force (pounds or kilograms). The unit has a digital readout for peak-applied pressure
      and provides a built-in calibration routine that verifies a valid calibration. In order to
      determine PPT, the researcher will apply the tip of the algometer to a tender spot in the
      participant's hamstrings and increase the amount of pressure until the participant verbally
      informs the researcher when the sensation of pressure became pain. At this point the
      algometer is removed and the peak force recorded. The mean of three repeated measures will be
      reported.

      Intervention:

      Cranial Laser Reflex Technique (CLRT) is a novel complementary and alternative (CAM) medicine
      intervention for musculoskeletal conditions that incorporates principles of laser acupuncture
      with chiropractic cranial reflexology(26). Developed in 2006 by Dr. Nick Wise (PI), CLRT has
      been incorporated into clinical practice by hundreds of practitioners around the world. It
      involves non-invasive laser stimulation of a distinct cranial microsystem discovered by
      chiropractors. It was postulated that these cranial reflexes are similar in nature to
      acupuncture points and would likewise respond to photobiomodulation (PBM) from a low level
      laser. Clinical experience by the PI and others confirmed that cranial reflexes are indeed
      responsive to low doses (0.5-5 J/cm2) of laser light: the length, strength, and pain in a
      specific muscle could be improved rapidly, even in cases of chronic post-stroke muscle
      spasms.

      Procedure: Subject will don protective eyewear and remain in the prone position. The
      hamstring reflexes are two lines on the posterior portion of the top of the head,
      approximately 2 cm long and 2 cm apart, running parallel to the sagittal suture (fig. 1). The
      posterior end of the reflexes can be located by finding the vertex, or CZ point in the
      standardized 10-20 EEG system, and moving laterally approximately 1 cm.

      Sequence: In order to determine the optimal direction of stimulation, the investigator will
      first perform a brief manual muscle test of the hamstring. The subject will bend knee to 90
      degrees. The investigator will quickly drag a finger along the cranial reflex for the
      extremity to be tested with moderate pressure, swiping first from anterior to posterior
      (a-b). The subject will be asked to contract the hamstring and resist the investigator's
      attempt to straighten the leg for 2 seconds. Then the investigator will swipe quickly in the
      opposite direction (b-a) and repeat the muscle test. The direction that provides the stronger
      response as determined by the investigator will be used for the laser stimulation for that
      subject.

      If the a-b direction is chosen, the aperture of the laser probe will be placed at point (a),
      turned on and moved to point (b) at a speed of approximately 2 cm/s. The laser will be turned
      off and quickly returned to point (a), turned on and moved to point (b) again. This will be
      repeated for a total of 30 times. If the manual muscle test response was equivocal, the laser
      will be left powered on as the probe is moved for a total of 15 passes in each direction. The
      probe will make light contact with the scalp during the powered laser pass, moving aside as
      much hair as possible.

      Device: The treatment device to be used in this study is a Class IIIB 810nm 200mW
      near-infrared GAAlAS diode laser (THOR Photomedicine Ltd, Great Britain) that is currently
      marketed in the US. The laser probe is FDA-cleared and classified as a non-significant risk
      device. The spot size is 0.0364 cm2, and the treatment time is 30 seconds. Current
      best-practice recommendations for laser acupuncture(35) recommend a dosage between 1-4 J/cm2
      per point. Since the CRP is a line of 2 cm, for the purposes of calculating dosage, we will
      treat it as a series of 10 connected points each with a diameter of 2mm. With the scanning
      rate of 2cm/s, each &quot;point&quot; on the line will receive 1/10 of each pass, totaling 3s (out of
      30s total) exposure time per point. The dose per point for this intervention is calculated to
      be approximately 1.65 J/cm2.

      There will be a one-week washout and the subject will return for the second treatment period.

      Primary Outcome:

      90-90 Knee Extension Angle Test. KEA is a functional test designed to assess lower extremity
      flexibility and is considered the gold standard test for assessing hamstring length (53).
      Results will be recorded as degrees of knee flexion angle. A clinically significant effect
      size is an increase of 5 degrees.

      Secondary Outcomes Handheld Dynamometry. HHD is currently considered a reliable and valid
      measurement of peak muscle contraction. The subject will be prone on the table with right leg
      bent to 90째 and will maximally contract the hamstring muscle for 4-5 seconds against the HHD
      device. The investigator will record the mean value of three attempts.

      Pain Pressure Threshold. PPT is a reliable, accurate and valid method for measuring muscle
      pain sensitivity and response to treatment(54). In order to determine PPT, the researcher
      will apply the tip of the algometer to a tender spot in the participant's hamstrings and
      increase the amount of pressure until the participant verbally informs the researcher when
      the sensation of pressure became pain. At this point the algometer is removed and the peak
      force recorded. The mean of three repeated measures will be reported. An increase in PPT
      signifies an increase in pain tolerance.

      Additional Variables Age, gender, activity level, perceived hamstring tightness, perceived
      hamstring flexibility and perceived hamstring strength will be assessed at baseline and
      subsequent follow up visit.

      Sample Size and Power: Based on previously published results(55), we would consider a mean
      increase of 5쨘 on the KEA (e.g., from 135쨘 to 140쨘) to be clinically meaningful, and we
      assume a common standard deviation of 15쨘. We further assume that correlation between
      repeated measurements from the same individual will be at least 0.75 (likely a conservative
      assumption). Under these assumptions, enrolling 38 participants would provide at least 80%
      power using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level.

After each treatment session, the participants will complete a de-blinding questionnaire administrated by the assessor providing a dichotomous 'yes' or 'no' answer as to whether active treatment was received. This response will be followed by a second question regarding how certain they were that active treatment was received on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), where 0 represents absolutely uncertain and 10 represents absolutely certain.</masking_description>
