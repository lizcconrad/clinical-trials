    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the new wearable hip assist
      robot, gait enhancing mechatronic system (GEMS) developed by Samsung Advanced Institute of
      Technology (Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd., Korea) on gait, sit-to-stand movement and brain
      activity in elderly adults and stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on gait and sit-to-stand
      movement in elderly adults.

      Secondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on sit-to-stand
      movement and brain activity in stroke patients.

      In elderly adults,

        1. Spatio temporal characteristics, muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are
           measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA, USA),
           surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and F-Scan Mobile
           system (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA) during 10m walking test.

        2. Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface
           electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during five times sit-to-stand test.

        3. Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface
           electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during stair climbing.

      In stroke patients,

        1. Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface
           electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during five times sit-to-stand test.

        2. Brain activity is measured by functional Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (NIRScout,
           NIRx, Germany) during treadmill gait.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 10 meter walk test from baseline in gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>1hour</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of self selected speeds by measuring the time it takes an individual to walk 10 meters. To perform the test, patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: &quot;Please walk this distance at your normal pace when I say go.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is a 14-item objective measure designed to assess static balance and fall risk in adult populations and is a well-accepted measure in the stroke literature. The functional activities that are assessed include sitting and standing balance during transfers, altered base of support, reaching, turning, eyes open and closed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Efficacy Scale (FES)</measure>
    <time_frame>20minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Fall Efficacy Scale (FES) is a 10-item questionnaire designed confidence in their ability to perform 10 daily tasks without falling as an indicator of how one's fear of falling impacts physical performance. Each item is rated from 1 (&quot;very confident&quot;) to 10 (&quot;not confident at all&quot;), and the per item ratings are added to generate a summary total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual Muscle Test (MMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>20minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Manual muscle testing (MMT) is a procedure for the evaluation of the function and strength of individual muscles and muscle groups based on the effective performance of a movement in relation to the forces of gravity and manual resistance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>20minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Range of Motion (ROM) testing is the measurement of movement around a specific joint or body part.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>20minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>20minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability.</description>
