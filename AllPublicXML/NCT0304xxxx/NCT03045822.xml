  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are an increase number of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs)
      such as pacemakers (PM) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) worldwide. The
      current medical practice guidelines warn on performing bioimpedance analysis (BIA) in this
      group of patients to avoid any electromagnetic interference. These recommendations restrict
      the use of BIA in many patients with heart failure in whom BIA might be of great interest in
      detecting peripheral congestion and in guidance of treatment. However, it is not well known
      whether BIA can affect the function of cardiac devices. Investigators aimed to test the
      incidence of electromagnetic interference between BIA and CIEDs.

      Patients enrollment were during routine face-to-face consultations, scheduled for PM and ICDs
      interrogations. Investigators recorded before and after each BIA measure, the battery voltage
      of the device, lead impedance and stimulation thresholds. The device electrograms were
      monitored during BIA measurements to detect any electromagnetic interference or oversensing.
