  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently when defining the upper limit of normal (ULN) or 99th percentile of a troponin
      assay manufacturer's use a healthy population traditionally aged 18-40. The 99th percentile
      value is the recommended value to use when diagnosing patients with an acute myocardial
      infarction. With the advent of the new highly sensitive troponin assays it has become clear
      that many patients have a troponin level above the 99th percentile when they have not
      suffered a myocardial infarction. We believe part of the problem with interpreting the the
      troponin values for patients is that the 99th percentile value which determines the ULN has
      been derived from population that is very different to the hospital population of patients.
      This study aims to demonstrate what the 99th percentile is for the population of people who
      use the hospital services who are traditionally older and have more comorbidities when
      compared to the population traditionally used to define the 99th percentile of a troponin
      assay.
