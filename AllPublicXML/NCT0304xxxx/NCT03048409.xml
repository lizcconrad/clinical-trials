    <textblock>
      A retrospective chart review to assess feeding tolerance in adults who had been switched from
      an intact protein formula to a peptide-based formula due to feeding intolerance in a complex
      continuing care facility.

        The population studied retrospectively will be adult patients in a chronic care facility
        dependent on enteral nutrition for 90% or more of their nutritional needs and meeting the
        inclusion/ exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &gt; 18 years of age on admission to facility

          -  Prescribed enteral nutrition with the goal to provide at least 90% of estimated daily
             calorie and protein requirements for ≥ 2 weeks prior to switch

          -  Received enteral nutrition with an intact protein formula for a minimum of three days
             prior to a switch to a peptide-based formula

          -  Have documentation of intolerance to an intact protein formula, followed by a switch
             in formula received to a peptide-based formula

          -  Receiving a peptide-based formula formula for ≥ 2 weeks

          -  Have documentation of an assessment of feeding tolerance following the switch

          -  Formulas received must be indicated for use in adults.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abdominal surgery (within past 30 days prior to switch)

          -  Having any infection, including upper respiratory, viral, gastroenteritis,wound
             infections, c difficile, at time of switch

          -  Having documented cow's milk protein allergy at time of switch

          -  Medical records lacking information on rationale for switch to a peptide-based formula
             and/or response to change (positive, neutral or negative).
