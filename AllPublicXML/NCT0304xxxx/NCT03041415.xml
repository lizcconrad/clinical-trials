  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While low-income midlife and older adults are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases
      that can be alleviated by regular physical activity, few physical activity programs have been
      developed specifically with their needs in mind. Those programs that are available typically
      do not address the recognized local environmental factors that can impact physical activity.
      This research aims to evaluate the added effects on two-year physical activity levels of a
      novel citizen science neighborhood engagement program (called Our Voice) when combined with
      an evidence-based, individually-focused physical activity program (Active Living Every Day),
      relative to the individually-focused program alone. The programs will be delivered in
      affordable housing settings, and represent a potentially scalable means for promoting
      physical activity across broader income groups in the US.

      The major objective of this project is to enhance the potential scalability and
      sustainability of person-level physical activity (PA) interventions by leveraging the
      capacity of residents themselves as local data gatherers and solution generators for
      neighborhood environmental change. The primary aim of the group-randomized trial is to
      systematically compare the sustained (two-year) multi-level impacts of a lay
      advisor-delivered, person-level PA intervention that has demonstrated efficacy and
      translatability (Active Living Every Day) [ALED Alone arm], versus the ALED program in
      combination with a novel neighborhood-level intervention, called Our Voice [ALED+Our Voice
      arm]. The Our Voice program teaches residents to use a simple mobile application to
      individually and collectively identify neighborhood barriers to daily PA. They then convey
      this information to local stakeholders and decision-makers in ways that can facilitate
      potentially sustainable neighborhood-level improvements in support of regular PA. Up to
      sixteen affordable housing sites serving low-income, ethnically diverse midlife and older
      adults will be randomized to one of the two interventions.

    <description>The ALED physical activity program is combined with the Our Voice citizen science engagement program, which teaches participants how to assess the barriers and enablers of neighborhood physical activity using a simple mobile app.
Residents then share their data and build consensus around major barriers and potential solutions, which they share with local decision makers.</description>

    <ipd_description>Commensurate with current requirements, once the study data have undergone final data cleaning, analysis, and planned publication, the investigators will make the final data collected as part of the proposed research available in electronic form to researchers who request them. The investigators will request that researchers submit a data request in writing to the project principal investigator so that the requested data can be made available while protecting the confidentiality of study participants. By setting up a centralized data request process, the investigators will be able to provide requestors with information that will help to inform external research groups about duplicate data analysis activities on the part of other research groups related to the data set in question.</ipd_description>
