  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of additional ablation targeting
      complex fractionated atrial electrogram area within low voltage zone identified by high
      resolution mapping in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty patients with persistent atrial fibrillation will be randomized a 1:1 ratio to each
      group. A test group includes those who undergoing ablation targeting low voltage areas which
      contains complex fractionated trial electrogram in addition to pulmonary vein isolation and a
      control group includes who undergoing pulmonary vein isolation only.

    <description>Pulmonary isolation will be performed
Complex fractionated atrial electrogram(CFAE) and voltage mapping will be performed if atrial fibrillation the patient is still in atrial fibrillation after pulmonary vein isolation
CFAE and voltage mapping will be performed simultaneously using small electrode Pentaray® Catheter with CARTO®3 MEM version or CARTO®3 CONFIDENSE™
Automatic characterization of CFAE signals will be performed with an CARTO® CFAE software module.
CFAE areas within low voltage zone in the left atrium should be targeted first. If atrial fibrillation persist after left atrial ablation, target areas in the right atrium should be mapped and ablated. (Low-Voltage &amp; CFAE guided ablation)</description>

    <description>In CFAE guided ablation,. Within low voltage zone, CFAE areas defined by shortest SCI and high ICL are identified.-Areas with the shortest SCI and high ICL within low voltage areas should be targeted first, followed by longer SCI regions (up to 120ms). Radiofrequency energy is delivered at target sites for 30-60 sec until the local electrogram is completely eliminated.</description>
