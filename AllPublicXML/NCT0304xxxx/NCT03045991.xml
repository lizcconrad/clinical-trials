      The purpose of this study is to determine the treatment effects of sequential combination of
      aerobic exercise and cognitive training on cognitive function, physiological markers, daily
      function, physical function, social participation and quality of life in stroke patients with
      cognitive decline.

    <description>The participants in the SEQ group will first undergo aerobic exercise training for 30 minutes followed by 30 minutes of cognitive-based training.
Before and after the treatment, a total of 2 evaluations were conducted, including clinical assessments and blood test (each 18c.c.). A saliva sample (2 mL) will only be collected once from each subject. A follow-up assessment of clinical outcomes will be conducted at six month after the end of the course of treatment.</description>
