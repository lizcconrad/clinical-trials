    <textblock>
      The decentralization study will describe children taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a
      larger health facility in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, between the years of
      2004-2013. The study will be conducted at Dora Nginza Hospital (DNH). The study will measure
      how many children stay in care and how many die, as well as their health status. The study
      will also compare whether children do better if they stay in care a large hospitals or if
      they get health care at smaller clinics. A second part of the study will find children in the
      community who have stopped coming for health care and find out what happened to them and what
      their health status is.

      The investigators propose to conduct a two part study which will include a retrospective
      cohort study to examine care outcomes among pediatric patients 0-14 years of age initiated on
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2004-2013 at a larger peri-urban health facility in the
      Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The study will be conducted at Dora Nginza Hospital
      (DNH). The outcomes measured in the study will include retention and mortality, as well as
      virologic suppression rates for children initiated on ART. In addition to reporting outcomes
      for all children with available data, the study will compare outcomes for children retained
      in care at DNH (where they initiated ART) to those children who were referred out after
      initiation for routine follow-up at community health clinics and primary care clinics (&quot;down
      referred&quot;). A second part of the study will trace pediatric patients in the community who
      have been lost to follow-up (LTF) to ascertain their outcomes after they left care at the
      health facility.

    <description>This group includes children who were transferred from DNH to a study facility. The investigators will first abstract data from the electronic data system 'Tier.net' for these children, which will tell us where they were down-referred.

    <description>This group includes children who began ART at DNH and were subsequently LTF. The investigators will first abstract data from the electronic data system 'Tier.net', which will classify them as LTF followed by examination of the the NHLS laboratory data to determine whether these children had received care at another facility since they were LTF.</description>

    <description>This group includes the caregivers of a subset of children in the 'LTF from DNH' and 'down-referred from DNH' groups. Among those children down-referred and LTF from DNH, the investigators will use their clinical and laboratory data to determine whether they are still receiving care or not. For children identified as LTF based on their abstracted data will be traced in order to contact their caregivers. If located, caregivers will be interviewed to ascertain if and why these children are no longer in care through a 'Tracing questionnaire'.</description>

        This study consists of two parts. The first part is a retrospective records review of
        electronic and medical records of children starting ART at a large hospital facility
        2004-2013 (no sampling or recruitment). We expect that 1600 children started ART during
        this period. The second part of the study will be a community tracing study of children who
        have been lost to follow-up, in which we will interview caregivers of children. We will
        randomly sample 75 patients who have been LTF will be generated using the data from the
        retrospective records review.
