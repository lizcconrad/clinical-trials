  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will examine the feasibility of conducting a strict whole-food, plant-based
      dietary intervention in women with stable metastatic breast cancer currently undergoing
      conventional treatments. In addition, this research will provide preliminary data on dietary
      intakes and the effect of plant-based nutrition on numerous outcomes reflecting cancer
      prognosis and overall health using advanced imaging, various blood biomarkers linked to
      cancer progression, and numerous symptom questionnaires.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with a confirmed diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer on systemic treatment
             with radiographically stable disease, demonstrated by at least one imaging test (CT
             scan, bone scan, or PET/CT) within last 6 months which was interpreted as stable
             compared to prior imaging study.

          -  If patient had previously received palliative radiation to a metastatic site, there
             must be at least one additional unirradiated metastatic site. Brain and small (&lt;1cm)
             liver and lung mets do not qualify as they are not reliably measured by PET.

          -  Systemic therapy may consist of any conventional treatment including anti-hormonal,
             cytotoxic, targeted monoclonal antibody or small molecule kinase inhibitors or any
             combination of the above.

          -  Expected to survive for at least 6 months.

          -  No changes in cancer treatment regimens in the past 2 months.

          -  Eligibility classification for enrollment into the study - T: any; N: any; M:1.

          -  Any ER/PR/HER2 status is eligible.

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  Must be willing to adopt a strict, whole-foods, plant-based diet.

          -  Participant must be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of

          -  Diabetes (both type 1 and type 2)

          -  The following metastatic lesions will not qualify for study: brain or small (&lt;1cm)
             liver and lung lesions due to limitations of PET measurements.

          -  Active malabsorption syndrome at time of consent (ie. Crohn's disease, major bowel
             resection leading to permanent malabsorption).

          -  Current eating disorder.

          -  Uncontrolled diarrhea.

          -  Plant-based food allergies or intolerances.

          -  Recent consumption (in the past 6 months) of a vegan diet.

          -  GFR &lt; 30 on 2 or more lab tests in the past 90 days.

          -  Serum potassium &gt; 5.3 on 2 or more lab tests in the past 90 days.

          -  Major surgery within 2 months of starting study program.

          -  Psychiatric disorder that prohibits giving informed consent.

          -  Current smoking.

          -  Current high risk alcohol use (&gt; 7 drinks per week).
