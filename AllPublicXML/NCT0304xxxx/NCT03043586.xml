  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a human, prospective and retrospective, single-center study of patients who have
      undergone treatment for acromegaly in New York City since 1981. The project will
      characterize, among other factors, the treatment methods received by patients, who
      administered the treatments and the success of this therapy in terms of biochemical control.

      The first phase of this study will be to contact all subjects in the cohort by a mailing
      introducing them to the study. This will be followed by a phone call and administration of a
      questionnaire by phone or by mail. The questionnaire will collect current information on
      acromegaly treatment, morbidities other relevant history. Subjects will provide verbal
      consent to participate in this questionnaire part of the study and review of their medical
      records by the Principal Investigator (PI) and study staff.

      In the second phase of the study, subjects will be invited to come for a visit that will be
      conducted by the PI and study staff at the Pituitary Center of Columbia University Medical
      Center. At this visit written informed consent will be obtained. The investigators will
      review the subjects' medical history that is obtained from the subject and review any records
      and laboratory test results provided by the subject and conduct clinical and laboratory
      assessments. Although all subjects participating in Phase 1 will be invited to participate,
      it is estimated that 120 of the subjects invited will come for the one visit over the 2-year
      time frame of this study.

      In the third phase of the study a chart review for collection will be conducted and all data
      will be compiled. All subjects agreeing to participate, both in person and by mail, a chart
      review of all relevant patient data including demographic, clinical, biochemical, surgical
      and follow up information. Data from questionnaires and record reviews will be compiled for
      analysis.

        The population for this study is a cohort of 520 adult patients who have undergone
        treatment for acromegaly in NYC since 1981. The cohort is predetermined based on the
        patients who have previously undergone pituitary surgery for acromegaly with our two
        collaborating Neurosurgeons. Based on prior studies, the population has no gender
        predilection and no racial or ethnic predisposition and thus the ethnic mix of the cohort
        reflects the population of the NY metropolitan area that is referred to the study center.
