  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 60% of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients have REM sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), a
      parasomnia characterized by partial or complete loss of REM sleep muscle atonia and
      dream-enacting behaviors, usually associated to vivid dreams. The REM Sleep without atonia is
      the polysomnographic hallmark of RBD, and its quantification is necessary for the diagnosis.

      RBD in PD is believed to be a marker of a more widespread degenerative process and a marker
      of malignant phenotype. Therefore, PD patients with RBD (PD-RBD) are more severely impaired
      in both motor and non-motor domains, compared to those without RBD, with an increased risk of
      dementia. However, little is know about the relationship between the evolution of RBD, clinic
      and video-polysomnographic, and the progression of PD. Besides, an improvement of RBD
      symptoms is anecdotally reported in PD patients over time. Longitudinal evaluation of RBD in
      PD, assessed by questionnaires, led to controversial results, but so far, no longitudinal
      vPSG study has been performed in PD-RBD population.

      Thus, the main objective of this study is to longitudinally evaluate clinical and
      video-polysomnographic features of RBD, including measure of REM Sleep without atonia, in
      patients with PD-RBD, after three years from the diagnosis of RBD, in order to ascertain
      whether RBD features remain stable over time. The possible remission of RBD with the
      progression of PD would question indeed its reliability as prognostic bio-marker.

      Type of study: longitudinal study, interventional, cross-sectional;

      Number of centres: 1 (Clermont-Ferrand)

      Patients: patients with Parkinson's Disease associated with REM sleep behavior disorder
      (PD-RBD) having already underwent video-polysomnography recording, clinical and
      neuropsychological evaluation in clinical setting or in the study &quot;RBHP 2013 DURIF &quot; at least
      three years ago.

      Study performance:

      This study will be developed in two phases:

        -  Phase 1 (Day 0):

        -  Verify inclusion criteria, receive informed and written consent;

        -  Demographic and clinical characteristics;

        -  Neurological evaluation: RBD (RBD severity scale), motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's
           Disease Rating Scale, Hoeh et Yahr scale), orthostatic hypotension (Scale for outcomes
           in PD autonomic questionnaire), behavioral disorders hyper-dopaminergic and
           hypo-dopaminergic (Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease), impulsivity (Test
           Kirby and Stop signal reaction time)

        -  Dreams contents: all patients will receive 3-weeks dream diary;

        -  vPSG recording;

        -  Self-assessment questionnaires: Non-motor symptoms Questionnaire, Epworth sleepiness
           scale, Urgency premeditation perseverance and sensation seeking test, Aggressive
           questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale

        -  Phase 2 (+1day): Neuropsychological assessment of:

        -  Cognitive function, namely executive functions, visuo-spatial functions,
           visuo-perceptive functions (Mini mental state examination, California Verbal Learning
           Test, verbal fluency test, Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, test de Stroop, Digit
           span, Visual Object and Space Perception Battery, Luria motor sequences, Rey-Osterrieth
           complex figure)

        -  Limbic functions: emotion recognition (Ekman test), apathy (Lille Apathy Rating Scale);

        -  Impulsivity and decision-making (Iowa Gambling test).
