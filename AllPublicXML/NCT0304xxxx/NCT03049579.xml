  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a probiotic supplementation on
      adult volunteers with having caught the common cold more than 4 times in the past year. This
      study is a single center, double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-designed,
      prospective trial. Subjects received a probiotic drink containing probiotics of Lactobacillus
      paracasei (108 colony forming units (CFU)/ml), Lactobacilluscasei431® (108CFU/ml) and
      Lactobacillus fermentiumPCC® (106CFU/ml) or an identical placebo without probiotics for a
      12-week study period.

      The incidence of flue and cold during the study period were compared between study groups.

      Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Fecal
      samples were collected for the secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) analysis. Blood sample was
      drawn for interferon γ (IFN-γ), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 10 (IL-10), immunoglobulin
      A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) analysis.
