  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK2292767 to humans. The study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and repeat
      inhaled doses of GSK2292767 in healthy smokers. This study is intended to provide sufficient
      confidence in the safety of the molecule and preliminary information on target engagement to
      allow progression to further repeat dose and proof of mechanism studies. This is a two part,
      single site, randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo controlled study. Part A will
      consist of two 3-period interlocking cohorts to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of ascending single doses of GSK2292767 administered as a dry powder
      inhalation. Part B is planned to follow Part A and progression will be based on an acceptable
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles. Subjects will receive repeat doses of
      GSK2292767 once daily for 14 days during Part B.

             (medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring). A
             participant with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference
             range expected for them and the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator believes that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures or outcomes
