  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of head and neck movement in children on endotracheal tube
      (ETT) tip displacement undergoing head-and-neck surgeries. The tube-tip displacement will be
      measured using flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In clinical application, especially in head-and-neck surgeries, the operators often change
      the position of children's head-neck for easy operating. Flexing the head resulted in the ETT
      moving towards the carina, and extension resulted in the tube being displaced in the opposite
      direction. Head and neck movement change the length of trachea as well: extending the head
      resulted in the extension of trachea, while flexing resulted in the opposite. Serious
      complications following from head and neck movement, such as accidental extubation and
      endobronchial intubation, threat children's life.

      In pediatric anesthesia, insertion depth (cm) of orotracheal intubation equals to age/2+12,
      according to classic intubation formulae. The ETT will be put in the depth calculated by the
      classic formulae under general anesthesia. The distance of ETT-tip displacement and the
      length change of trachea will be measured as the head and neck placed as follows: fully
      extended, neutral position, or fully flexed. These three head and neck positions imitate the
      head-neck movement during those head-and-neck surgeries.
