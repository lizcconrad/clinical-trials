    <textblock>
      This study evaluates differences in the extent of myocardial necrosis noted by cardiac MRI in
      patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction randomized to receive cangrelor during their
      percutaneous coronary intervention and compares them to patients randomized to not receive
      cangrelor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cangrelor is a direct-acting and reversible intravenously administered platelet inhibitor
      approved as an adjunct to percutaneous intervention (PCI) for reducing the risk of
      periprocedural myocardial infarction, repeat coronary revascularization, and stent
      thrombosis. As it has a quick onset of action (2 minutes) compared to traditional oral
      platelet inhibitors, cangrelor is emerging as an important new option for use in patients
      undergoing percutaneous intervention who have not been treated with oral platelet inhibitors.

      Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated that patients with ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI) who undergo emergent PCI do not have optimal platelet inhibition even
      after administration of a loading dose of traditional oral platelet inhibitors. However, the
      clinical significance of complete platelet inhibition around the time of PCI is not fully
      understood.

      The primary objective is to characterize the utility of immediate platelet inhibition with
      intravenous cangrelor in patients presenting with an acute STEMI by assessing the extent of
      infarct size (either enzymatically or by imaging). If the findings are favorable, this may
      suggest that immediate platelet inhibition is an important part of care in this patient
      population.
