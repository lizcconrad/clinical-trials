      Klorsept is a debridement solution of necrotic infected tissue promoting wound healing. The
      aim of this study is to elaborate the effectiveness and safety of this solution.

      This study will include 50 patients suffering from necrotic and infected wounds. Several
      parameters will be evaluated in order to provide the effectiveness and safety of this
      treatment.

    <description>General outcome: Pain will be assessed by the VAS scale. Score above 3 will be considered an abnormal value. Fever ( in C0) above 37.5 an abnormal value. Pulse rate elevated from the baseline patient by 15% will be an abnormal value. Systolic Blood pressure elevated from the baseline of the patient by 15% will be an abnormal value. Number of breathing which will be elevated from the baseline of the patient by 15% will be an abnormal value. Saturation which will be reduced by 5% from the baseline will be an abnormal value.
Local Outcome: redness/ edema /odor/discharge will be evaluated by a score from 0 to 3 (0- no redness/edema/odor/discharge ; 3- severe redness /edema/odor/discharge). Skin eruption will be evaluated as no/yes.
The results will be aggregated to arrive at one reported value (e.g., Number of Participants with Abnormal Laboratory Values and/or Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment)</description>
