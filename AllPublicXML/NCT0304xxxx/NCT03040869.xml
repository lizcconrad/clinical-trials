  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading global cause of human death. Over the past
      decade, level of overall diagnosis and treatment of CHD has been greatly improved due to the
      progression of clinical research and development of technical means and the mortality of CHD
      has decreased by nearly 50% in western countries [1]. However, there are surveys shows that
      with the improvement of living standards and changes in lifestyle, the incidence of CHD is
      still rising in China and other developing countries, and the prevalence trend is obvious
      younger [2]. The so-called young CHD, generally refers to the age at onset of CHD is less
      than or equal to 45 years. Compared with other age-group CHD, young CHD has the following
      characteristics: 1. Genetic factors have a stronger effect at younger onset ages, and
      incidence with obvious familial aggregation[3]; 2 Often with the onset of acute coronary
      syndrome, presumably may be associated with strong inflammation of the lesion; 3. Two
      extremes often exists in coronary lesions: mild or no atherosclerosis and severe
      triple-vessel disease; 4 Rapid progression of atherosclerotic lesions, stent restenosis in
      the same site repeated after interventional treatment, rapid progress of lesion in
      non-intervention site;5 Surgical mortality is low in regardless of interventional therapy or
      bypass surgery, but the rate of revascularization is significantly higher in following 10
      years.

      Study method

        -  Recruited the patients meet the inclusion criteria since March 2016, collected the
           information of the change of risk factors, angina in pre-operation, mode of onset,
           characteristics of coronary artery, morbility of treatment,clinical follow-up; ② Collect
           the following information in clinical cases: gender, age, history of hypertension,
           history of diabetes, cholesterol level, triglyceride level, sedentary, body index,
           family history of CHD, genotype of ALDH2 and MTHFR, history of myocardial infarction,
           coronary artery lesions and operation situation; ③ The follow-up was performed through
           clinic and telephone every half or one year. The details include whether recurrence of
           angina, the main symptom, the cause of attack, lasting time, the efficacy of taking
           nitroglycerin, whether performed electrocardiography examination, whether occurred
           myocardial infarction and the attack site. whether performed interventional therapy and
           CABG surgery again and the cause of surgery, whether re-examined coronary
           arteriongraphy, whether death and the cause, and the occurred date in above events; ④
           Analysis the pathogenic intensity with each risk factors with other age group CHD.
