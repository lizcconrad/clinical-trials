  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no clear indication if exercise is safe and if it confers health benefits
      for adults undergoing preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer - a
      population who may have limited exercise tolerance and who may be at an increased risk for
      adverse events associated with exercise. In this prospective single-arm feasibility trial, we
      aim to examine the safety and feasibility of a 12-week exercise intervention for adults
      undergoing preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer to inform the
      development of a large-scale randomized controlled trial that will assess the efficacy of
      exercise administered during preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer.
      Adults diagnosed with rectal cancer and scheduled for preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation
      will be recruited over a 12-month period into a supervised exercise intervention consisting
      of aerobic and strength training to be done 3 times per week. Feasibility, safety,
      patient-reported outcomes, and physical tests will be performed pre-intervention and
      post-intervention. This study will provide data on the feasibility of an exercise
      intervention and will help determine if it is safe to progress with a large-scale randomized
      controlled trial to test the benefits of exercise for adults undergoing preoperative
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer. It will also provide initial estimates of the
      parameters for patient-reported outcomes, which are required to calculate the sample size for
      the large-scale randomized controlled trial to ensure it is sufficiently powered.

        Exclusion criteria are:

          1. Congestive heart failure, clinically significant aortic stenosis, history of cardiac
             arrest, use of a cardiac defibrillator, uncontrolled angina, uncontrolled arrhythmia,
             myocardial infarction, major heart surgery, stroke, or pulmonary embolus;

          2. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure&gt;200 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;110 mm Hg);

          3. The use of supplemental oxygen;

          4. Severe arthritis (i.e., osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis);

          5. History of chest pain or severe shortness of breath either at rest or when engaging in
             physical activity;

        Of note, in addition to the exclusion criteria listed above, healthcare providers will also
        employ clinical judgment concerning participant safety; that is, if the healthcare provider
        judges the patient to be at high risk for adverse events or medical complications if they
        participate in the intervention given their health status, they will not approach the
        patient to obtain permission for research personnel from the University of Ottawa to
        contact them.
