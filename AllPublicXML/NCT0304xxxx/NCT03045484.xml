      Background:Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy is effective for improving disease-free
      survival and overall survival in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
      However,the oral mucositis pain evoked by the chemoradiotherapy itself reduces food intake
      and frequently halts the treatment. Thus, pain control is an important problem in
      chemoradiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.We performed to examine whether early
      induction of low-dose, opioid from moderate pain reduced total dose of Oxycodone during
      chemoradiotherapy, while improves the quality of life and reduce weight loss.

      Objective:Present clinical trial to investigate the early introduction of opioids suppressed
      the transient increase in the numeric rating scales(NRS) score for pain and compared with
      conventional treatment.

      Methodology:The subjects will recruit 70 patients who were hospitalized for nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. 70 patients were divided into two groups, depending on whether the pain was
      moderate or severe when an opioid was introduced.Differences between groups were compared
      using T test protected least significant difference for one-factor analysis of variance. All
      statistical analyses were performed using SPSS(Statistic Package for Social Science)
      software.P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

      Controlled-release oxycodone (CRO) was used in this study. The patients kept a daily record
      of the intensity of pain. CRO is effective for 12 h, so that the patient takes it only twice
      a day.The minimum oral unit of CRO is a 10 mg tablet, so the minimum daily dose was 20 mg.
      Thus, we began at a dose of 20 mg by default. When the pain worsened, the dose was quickly
      titrated.When a patient who was suffering from moderate pain in the mouth, pharynx, or larynx
      consented to take oxycodone, oxycodone was begun at the level of moderate pain. We called
      this the mild group. In contrast, those patients who did not ask for oxycodone until the pain
      reached a severe level were called the severe group. Because all patients agreed to use an
      opioid at some point, the patients were classified into two groups, moderate and severe,
      according to when the opioid was introduced.

      Total dose of oxycodone was defined as the total dose of oxycodone taking during the
      treatment of chemoradiotherapy. Pain Remission Rate was defined as pain remission after 24h
      from the start of opioid administration.Evaluating quality of life were conducted once every
      two weeks.We also evaluated the weight loss as parameters for food intake once a week,until
      the radiotherapy.All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software.
