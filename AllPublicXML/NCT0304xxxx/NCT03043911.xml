  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator intend to perform an observational study, by adding Respiratory Rate
      monitoring to an already existing Patient SafetyNet system with SpO2 (Oxygen Saturation) and
      PR (Pulse Rate) monitoring. RRa will be blinded to the clinicians and all RRa alarms will be
      deactivated. Retrospective analysis of the observational data collected will be utilized to
      evaluate the potential benefits of additional continuous respiratory rate monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Addition of acoustic respiratory rate monitoring to an already existing standard of care
      patient surveillance system that includes oxygen saturation and heart rate monitoring by
      pulse oximetry will result in earlier and more sensitive detection of respiratory events and
      possibly early stages of developing sepsis in a post-surgical/orthopedic study population.

      An observational study with RRa is an additional blinded parameter to the already existing
      standard of care monitoring with SpO2 and PR on one post-surgical floor, (includes Trauma and
      orthopedic patients), where patients receive opioids for pain management. 300 consecutive
      patients will be enrolled and monitored with RRa for at least the first 24hours post-surgery,
      after discharge from the Recovery Room, &amp; upon admission to the Surgical floor.
