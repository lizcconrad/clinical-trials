  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical
      trial,aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Firehawk™ sirolimus target-eluting
      coronary stent system with abluminal grooves containing a biodegradable polymer (Firehawk™)
      comparing the XIENCE everolimus-eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of subjects
      with total coronary occlusion lesion(s).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 196 subjects with total coronary occlusion lesion(s) in coronary
      arteries ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter and ≤100 mm in length (by visual estimate) in no
      more than 10 research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be
      1:1 randomized to receive Firehawk™ sirolimus target-eluting coronary stent or XIENCE
      everolimus-eluting coronary stent.

      Optical Coherent Tomography (OCT) sub study: the first 44 consecutive subjects who consented
      to participate in the OCT sub study will undergo OCT assessment at 3 months and 12 months
      post index procedure. The OCT sub study will be performed in 3-5 pre-selected sites. The
      clinical follow-up will be carried out at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months,and 2-5
      years post-index procedure.The primary endpoint is in-stent late lumen loss at 12 months
      post-index procedure.The secondary endpoint is neo-intimal thickness by Optical Coherent
      Tomography (OCT) at 3 months post-index procedure.
