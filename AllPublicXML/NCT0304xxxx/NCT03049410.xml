  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing the outcomes from
      Intracorporeal RARC (iRARC) with open radical cystectomy (ORC) in patients with bladder
      cancer. The study will recruit patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) or
      muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who have selected radical cystectomy for the treatment
      of bladder cancer. The time of interest for measurement of the primary outcomes will be 90
      days post-surgery.

      Eligible patients will include those receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (typically
      gemcitabine and cisplatin) and those having either an ileal conduit or a neo-bladder
      reconstruction.

      Patients who have selected radical cystectomy after appropriate counselling and following a
      specialist multi-disciplinary team (SMDT) recommendation, will be approached and asked to
      consent for this study.

      Consenting participants will be randomised 1:1 to either iRARC or ORC. Patients will be
      followed for a minimum of 90 days post-surgery.

      The study will be conducted in NHS Trusts designated as Cancer Centres. Patients will be
      stratified by

        -  Type of urinary diversion (Continent diversion or ileal conduit)

        -  Performance status

        -  Centre Trial assessments will be conducted at baseline (before surgery), whilst
           participants are on admission and then 5, 12, 24 weeks and 1 year post surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radical cystectomy (RC) represents the gold standard treatment for invasive bladder cancer.
      Reductions in morbidity and mortality from this operation have occurred in recent years
      through refined anaesthesia, surgical techniques, and centralization of services in high
      volume centres. The multimodal concept of enhanced recovery after RC (ERAS), which includes
      pre, intra and post operative steps, has also helped to reduce the length of stay and
      complications after RC further.

      For most abdominal surgery, it is recognized that minimally invasive surgery is less morbid
      than open surgery, and produces improvements in post-operative recovery without altering the
      curative nature of the procedure. However, to date, there is little or conflicting evidence
      of any benefit from minimally invasive surgery over open surgery for RC. This may reflect the
      complex nature of this procedure (involving surgery to both the urinary and gastro-intestinal
      tracts), limitations of the current evidence or that there is no benefit. To date, three
      prospective trials have compared RARC with open RC (ORC). However, each has been limited by
      sample size and design, or their application of RARC with extra-corporeal reconstruction or
      have yet to report.

      The investigators believe that there are no studies (reported or planned) that have compared
      optimal RARC (e.g. with intra-corporeal reconstruction) with optimal ORC (e.g. high volume
      centre using ERAS). In addition, the investigators believe none have adequately assessed the
      rehabilitation from RC. As such, the investigators now propose a prospective RCT to randomize
      eligible patients to either ORC or RARC. The investigators will focus upon measures of
      functional recovery and the return to normal activities.
