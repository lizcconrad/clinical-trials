  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn how frequently cancer patients in the Supportive
      Care Center have chronic, non-malignant pain. Chronic, non-malignant pain is pain that is
      neither related to cancer nor its treatment and lasts beyond the normal tissue healing time
      of 3 months.

      If participant is found to be eligible and agrees to take part in this study, participant
      will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires about participant's pain, pain level, and what
      drugs participant takes to treat participant's pain. Participant will also be asked a few
      questions about tobacco use. These questionnaires should take about 20 minutes to complete.

      Researchers will also collect information from participant's medical record such as
      participant's date of birth, sex, race, marital status, economic background, and medical
      history.

      Length of Study:

      Participation on this study will be over after participant has completed the last
      questionnaire.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
