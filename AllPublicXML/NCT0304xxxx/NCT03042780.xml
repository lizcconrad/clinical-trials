    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRINOX in patients with
      gastroenteropancreatic high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas.

      This is a prospective Phase II open-label trial, stratifying gastroenteropancreatic high
      grade neuroendocrine carcinomas participants equally into two cohorts (first-line versus
      beyond first-line).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Radiographic Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is objective response rate as determined by radiology review, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete Response (CR): complete disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient decrease to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS: from initiation date of therapy to disease progression or death. Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Related Morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety analysis will be analyzed by collecting date on treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Investigators will collect data on frequency, type and severity of all adverse events that occur on or after Cycle 1, Day 1 according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE; Version 4.0).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive modified FOLFIRINOX which consists of 85 mg/m^2 of oxaliplatin, 400 mg/m^2 of leucovorin over the first 2 hours, 165 mg/m^2 of irinotecan in a 90-minute infusion on day 1, followed by a continuous, 46-hour infusion of 5-FU at a dosage of 2,400 mg/m^2. A cycle will be repeated every 14 days. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis will be allowed after each cycle. Participants will undergo re-staging studies every 8 weeks. Participants will receive up to 12 cycles during the study. Additional cycles will be determined per investigators' discretion.</description>

    <description>The FOLFIRINOX regimen consists of oxaliplatin given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, immediately followed by leucovorin given as a 2-hour intra-venous infusion, with the addition, after 30 minutes, of irinotecan given as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. This study treatment is immediately followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) over a 46-hour period every 2 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed neuroendocrine carcinoma of the
             gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Potential participants with unknown origin for the
             neuroendocrine carcinoma in which a gastroenteropancreatic origin is suspected (per
             pathologist or investigator discretion) will be eligible for the study.

          -  Tumors must have a Ki-67 index greater than 20% and/or &gt;20 mitotic figures/10
             high-power fields.

          -  Must have metastatic disease.

          -  Must measurable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) 1.1.

          -  Any line of treatment (first line versus beyond first line).

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Untreated brain or meningeal metastases.

          -  Prior treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan or oxaliplatin.

          -  Pre-treatment peripheral neuropathy greater than grade 1 per the CTCAE, version 4.0.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements.
