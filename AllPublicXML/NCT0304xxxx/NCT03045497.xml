    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial compares the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound to
      contrast-enhanced magnetic response imaging (MRI), the current clinical standard, in
      predicting treatment response in patients with liver cancer receiving transarterial
      chemoembolization with drug eluting beads. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures before
      and after transarterial chemoembolization may help doctors predict a patient's response to
      treatment and help plan the best treatment. It is not yet known if contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound works better than contrast-enhanced MRI in predicting treatment response in
      patients with liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate if contrast-enhanced ultrasound of hepatocellular carcinomas at one to two weeks
      and one month correlate with the clinical evaluation standard of a contrast-enhanced MRI at
      one month (the current clinical standard) in patients who have undergone transarterial
      chemoembolization with drug eluting beads.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish whether changes in quantitative blood flow parameters relative to baseline
      correlate with effective embolization.

    <description>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of hepatocellular carcinomas at one month will be evaluated to see if it correlates with the clinical evaluation standard of a contrast-enhanced MRI at one month. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value will be calculated for the contrast-enhanced ultrasound exam. Correlations between these findings and both contrast-enhanced MRI findings and patient outcomes will be compared using the Fisher exact test. Inter- and intra-observer variability will also be calculated.</description>

    <description>Patients receive perflutren lipid microspheres IV and then undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging over approximately 1 hour prior to transarterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads, at 1-2 weeks and 1 month post transarterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads. Patients also undergo contrast-enhanced MRI at 1 month post-treatment per standard of care.</description>
