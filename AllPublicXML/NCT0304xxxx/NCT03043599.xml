      The purpose of the safety run in Phase I portion of this study is to confirm the recommended
      Phase II dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab among participants treated with combined thoracic
      radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) and nivolumab/ipilimumab following standard
      treatment with 4-6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy.

      The purpose of the Phase II portion of this study is to estimate the 6-month Progression Free
      Survival (PFS) rate among participants treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab with thoracic
      radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) after standard treatment with 4 to 6 cycles of
      platinum based chemotherapy.
