      Objectives:

      The aim of the present study is to assess the significance of metabolomics and genetics in
      diagnosing and survival evaluation for pNET in the periodic follow-up of MEN1 patients.

      Aim 1: To evaluate the relationship of serum global metabolic profiles with subsequent
      development of aggressive PNET and evaluate patients survival in a nested case-control study
      of MEN1 patients who have developed aggressive PNETs (cases) and MEN1 patients who have
      developed non-aggressive PNETs (controls).

      Aim 2: Validate the top serum metabolites identified from Aim 1 in MEN1 patients who have
      developed aggressive PNETs and MEN1 patients who have developed non-aggressive PNETs, using a
      targeted metabolomics approach.

      Aim 3: Prospectively identify the potential miRNA biomarkers of serum with miRNA sequencing
      in MEN1 patients who have developed aggressive PNETs (cases) and MEN1 patients who have
      developed non-aggressive PNETs (controls).

      Aim 4: Validate the potential miRNA biomarkers identified from Aim 1 in MEN1 patients who
      have developed aggressive PNETs and in MEN1 patients who have developed non-aggressive PNETs,
      using a targeted qRT-PCR approach (in serums), as well as to see the relationship of
      potential miRNA biomarkers with patients survival.
