  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity during chemotherapy has been shown to increase patient health and wellbeing
      as well as improve outcomes in breast cancer patients. The primary aim of this project is to
      determine the feasibility of incorporating wearable sensors into clinical care by having
      breast cancer patients, undergoing chemotherapy, wear a commercially available monitor
      (Fitbit) that tracks physical activity, sleep, and heart rate monitor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there are many benefits of engaging in physical activity during cancer treatments,
      activity levels typically decline throughout treatment. Existing research has primarily
      relied on self-reported activity levels and only captured periodic snap shots or
      retrospective reports of activity levels, which are subject to recall bias. Exactly how
      activity levels change throughout chemotherapy is not known. This study will provide
      minute-by-minute level objective physical activity data across the entirety of the patient's
      chemotherapy treatments. This in depth data will provide a new perspective on the patterns of
      activity levels and help to identify if there are critical times in which to intervene to
      prevent declines in physical activity.

      The investigators will assess the feasibility of the pre-treatment recruitment by documenting
      recruitment rates and participant acceptance of wearing the accelerometer.

    <description>Women enrolled in the study will be asked to wear a Fitbit from one week prior to chemotherapy until six months post-chemotherapy. The Fitbit is a watch-sized, wrist worn, physical activity tracker. A button, when pressed, displays the wearer's accumulated daily steps, mileage, and steps climbed.</description>
