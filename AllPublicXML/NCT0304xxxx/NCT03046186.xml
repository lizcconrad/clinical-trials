  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After gastric sleeve patients undergo a substantial weight loss, but the physiological
      mechanisms behind the weight loss is not fully elucidated. Studies suggest that gut-hormone
      secretion is altered comparable to what is also seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, however
      to which extent is not fully established and furthermore, the mechanisms behind an altered
      secretion are unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate absorption and
      postprandial metabolism of glucose and protein in addition to gut hormonal responses after
      gastric sleeve compared with a group of un-operated subjects machted on sex, age and BMI.
      Furter, a group of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operated patients matched on pre-operative BMI,
      current BMI, sex and age will be included for comparison.
