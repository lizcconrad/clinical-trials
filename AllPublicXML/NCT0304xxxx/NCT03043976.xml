    <textblock>
      This study will collect information about physical activity in patients affected by pulmonary
      hypertension, through a specific device that can be worn on the wrist, and which measures
      daily step count. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate whether providing patients with
      their daily step count can increase their levels of daily activity if they have some basic
      targets to achieve. Investigators also wish to compare the effects of this approach in
      increasing daily physical activity, with the benefit gained when a drug therapy for pulmonary
      hypertension is initiated, in patients that have just been diagnosed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare and progressive disorder and shortness of breath and
      fatigue, especially during exercise, are very common symptoms, resulting in a reduced
      capacity to perform daily activities and in an impaired quality of life. Furthermore, reduced
      exercise capacity in PH is associated with depression and anxiety disorders. Recent
      literature reveals a strong association of sedentary time with adverse cardiovascular
      outcomes, so that the development of therapeutic strategies to avoid this event is pivotal in
      the management of PH, in addition to the beneficial results of modern medical treatment.
      Recently the role of exercise and rehabilitation in different respiratory and cardiac
      conditions has been evaluated in the literature, overtaking the concerns raised in the past
      that exercise could worsen the condition and thus the progression of these kind of diseases,
      but just a few studies have been done in patients affected by PH.

      International guidelines on pulmonary hypertension recommend avoiding strenuous exercise that
      leads to distressing symptoms, while encourage low level graded aerobic exercise, such as
      walking, as tolerated. Nonetheless, little is still known about the effects of lifestyle
      changes, such as the amount of physical activity that patients can or should practice.
      Pedometers have been used to enhance the daily physical activity and to improve, when
      assessed, some prognosis related outcomes, both in healthy subjects and those affected by
      different pathological conditions, in particular cardiac and respiratory diseases. However, a
      training model based on step count targets has never been evaluated in PH, to our knowledge.
      Step counting devices have recently experienced a surge in popularity as a tool for
      motivating and monitoring physical activity in the general population, especially combined
      with applications for smartphones, that provide feedback, such as an overview of the data
      recorded. Thus, it seems reasonable to explore the opportunity to develop a step count based
      training model to enhance daily exercise in PH patients, through these non-invasive, patient
      friendly and relatively inexpensive devices.

    <description>At the baseline, patients will fill a questionnaire about their quality of life (SF36), will perform a 6'walk test (6MWT), will undertake a blood sample (BNP). In the run-in period (1 week) patients will wear an Actigraph GT9X Link device which only displays the time and the battery level; all activity data will be recorded. Then participants will wear an Actigraph GT9X Link device which shows real time data about the number of steps and will upload their data via the Study Admin Mobile application for smartphones/tablets. Patients will be asked to aim for an average specified number of steps/day week by week and will receive a weekly report with results from the previous week and targets to achieve. After 8 weeks, patients will attend visit 2 (6MWT, SF36 and BNP assessment) and will carry on wearing the activated device for 8 weeks receiving weekly feedbacks and targets. After 8 weeks patients will attend visit 3 (6MWD, SF36 and BNP will be assessed) which is the end of the study.</description>

    <description>At the baseline, patients will fill a questionnaire about their quality of life (SF36), will perform a 6'WT and will undertake a blood sample (BNP). After a run-in period (1 week) with an Actigraph GT9X Link device disabled from showing the number of steps, patients will wear an Actigraph GT9X Link device which still only displays time and battery level and will upload data via the Study Admin Mobile application for smartphones/tablets without receiving any feedback. After 8 weeks, patients will be assessed (SF36, 6'WT, BNP) and will start to wear a new device enabled to display the daily step count. Patients will be asked to aim for an average specified number of steps/day, receiving a weekly summary of the previous week with targets to achieve week by week. After 8 weeks, patients will be assessed (6'WT, SF36, BNP) and will carry on wearing the device and receiving feedbacks and targets for a further 8 week period, after that patients will be finally assessed (SF36, 6'WT, BNP)</description>

    <description>In the week leading up to their inpatient admission for diagnostic investigations, patients who are treatment-na√Øve will be given the Actigraph GT9X Link device which will only display the time and the charge level of the battery. Patients will be asked, as well, to fill a questionnaire about their quality of life, to perform a 6MWT and a blood sample (BNP). As soon as patients start the drug therapy, patients will wear a second Actigraph GT9X Link device still disabled from showing real time data about the number of daily steps. Participants will not receive any feedback during the whole period and will be asked, as well, to upload the data collected through the remote mobile system. At their first clinical assessment (after about 4 or 5 weeks), 6'WT, BNP and questionnaire about quality of life will be reassessed.
If patients are not being started on drug therapy then they will be withdrawn from the study</description>
