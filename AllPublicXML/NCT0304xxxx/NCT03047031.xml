      This is an active surveillance study to monitor the real world safety of nintedanib in Indian
      patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. The safety of nintedanib has been assessed in
      clinical trials. Since only 20 patients from India were enrolled in the INPULSIS trials, the
      safety data on Indian patients is limited. In this active surveillance, the safety of
      nintedanib in IPF patients will be examined in Indian real world setting
