  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if netupitant/palonosetron can help to
      decrease chronic nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer. The safety of the study drug
      will also be studied.

      Some participants will receive the study drug and some will receive a placebo. A placebo is
      not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness.
      It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real
      effect.

      This is an investigational study. Netupitant/palonosetron is FDA approved and commercially
      available to help prevent short-term nausea and vomiting. Giving it to patients with chronic
      nausea and vomiting is investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 42 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are still eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in
      the roll of dice) to 1 of 2 groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is
      better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have a 2 in 3 chance of being
      assigned to the netupitant/palonosetron group.

      You will take 1 capsule of netupitant/palonosetron/placebo by mouth on Days 1, 6, and 11. You
      will report the time you take these doses to the study staff.

      For the Day 1 dose, you will not know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo. For
      the Days 6 and 11 doses, neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the
      study drug or the placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able
      to find out what you are receiving.

      You will take the Day 1 dose in the clinic or at home. The Days 6 and 11 doses may be mailed
      to you separately and should not be taken until you have instructed to by the study staff.

      You will be given a patient diary to keep track of your daily nausea, vomiting, and rescue
      nausea medication on Days 1-15. You should complete it at the end of each day before you go
      to sleep.

      Length of Study:

      You may take the study drug/placebo until Day 11. You will no longer be able to take the
      study drug/placebo if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after your last visit/call. There is also an
      optional 10-day extension described below.

      Study Visits/Calls:

      On Day 4 (+/- 1 day), the research staff will call you to ask about your level of nausea in
      the past 24 hours, your average level of nausea over the past 5 days, and your feeling of
      nausea and vomiting in the last 12 hours. This is information you would have recorded in your
      patient diary. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      On Day 10 (+/- 2 days), the research staff will call you to ask about your average level of
      nausea over the past 5 days, your level of nausea and vomiting in the past 5 days, your
      symptoms in the past 24 hours, and any side effects from taking the study drug or placebo.
      This call should last about 15 minutes.

      On Day 15 (+/- 2 days), you will complete questionnaires about your average level of nausea
      over the past 5 days, your nausea/vomiting symptoms, side effects, your opinion on whether
      you received the study drug or placebo, and your opinion about taking part in the study.
      These questionnaires should take about 20 minutes to complete. If you are unable to return to
      the clinic, the research staff will call you to ask you to answer these questions by phone.
