  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that placement of LAMS plus an overlapping double pigtail stent for
      endoscopic transmural drainage of PFCs with solid debris will result in improved drainage and
      require fewer endoscopic interventions compared to placement of LAMS alone.

    <description>Subjects randomized to LAMS plus double pigtail stent will undergo EUS-guided transmural placement of a single Axios stent with a 15 mm luminal diameter. Following this, wire access across the stent lumen will be achieved using a 0.035 inch hydrophilic guidewire, and a double pigtail plastic biliary stent (6 French, 7 French, or 10 French at the discretion of the endoscopist) will be deployed over the wire.</description>
