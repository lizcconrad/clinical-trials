  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed from adapting and combining two evidence-based programs, Project CONNECT (a
      linkage-to-services program that targets barriers within the probation and substance abuse
      treatment systems) and TIES (a program that teaches family engagement skills to providers),
      Family CONNECT is a linkage-to-services program that targets both family and system-level
      factors to increase youth use of and retention in substance use services. Using Linkage
      Specialists embedded within probation departments, Family CONNECT will be implemented in two
      NYS probation departments. This proposed study will evaluate the impact of Family CONNECT on
      (1) youth referral from probation to substance abuse treatment, (2) youth and family
      engagement in substance abuse treatment, (3) youth enrollment/retention in substance abuse
      treatment, and (4) youth substance use and recidivism. This study will also identify family
      and probation organizational factors influencing Family CONNECT implementation in probation
      settings. 50 (+2 pre-pilot) caregiver-youth dyads and up to 36 probation officers will be
      recruited as participants in the study. Caregiver-youth dyads will be evaluated at baseline,
      2 and 6 months; probation officers at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months; linkage specialists at
      baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Counts of youth referred, youth who start treatment, and
      youth retained in treatment will be obtained from the juvenile justice agency at
      pre-implementation, baseline, 2 and 6 months, counts of youth recidivism will be obtained at
      2 and 6 months.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized control trial. Caregiver-youth dyads are randomized to either the control (standard of care) or experimental (Family CONNECT) group based on the youth's probation officer (randomization occurs at the level of the youth's probation officer). If randomized to the control (standard of care) group, caregiver-youth dyads will work with their probation officer as usual to link to substance use services. If randomized to the experimental (Family CONNECT) group, caregiver-youth dyads will work with a linkage specialist to link to substance use services.</intervention_model_description>
