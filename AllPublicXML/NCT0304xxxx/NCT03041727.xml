      The study purpose is to compare the effects of Fascial Manipulation added to standard
      exercises protocol versus the simple exercises protocol.

      The shoulder degenerative diseases are recurring in hospital employees. The early approach,
      as we see in literature, has high probability to reduce the pain and the disfunction in the
      long term.

      In particular stretching and strengthening exercises are the standard protocol applied.

      The Fascial Manipulation is a manual therapy that works on the connective tissue, by
      increasing mobility and reducing pain.

      We have added the Fascial Manipulation to prove if it make a faster recovery and a pain
      reduction in the short and the middle term.
