  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is effective
      in preventing serious infectious complications (those that require hospitalization or lead to
      death) in patients with lupus erythematosus that receive intermediate or high dose steroids.
