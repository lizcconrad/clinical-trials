    <textblock>
      NTM-1634 drug product is a mixture of four human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies (XC41, XC42,
      XC44, and XC84) which bind to non-overlapping epitopes on BoNT/C/D.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled dose escalation study of three
      dose cohorts. Cohort A: 0.33mg/kg; B: 0.66mg/kg; and C: 1 mg/kg.
