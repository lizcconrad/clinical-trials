  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In tumors with a defect in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, double-strand break
      repair is partly impaired. Patients with HR deficient tumors benefit from therapies that
      induce DNA lesions requiring HR for repair. These therapies include platinum compounds and
      inhibitors of the enzyme PARP-1. At this moment, selection for PARP inhibitor treatment
      relies on detection of germ-line or somatic mutations in the HR pathway genes BRCA1 or BRCA2.
      However, not all HR deficient tumors have a BRCA gene mutation, the BRCA genes can also be
      silenced by promoter methylation. Moreover, the HR pathway can be defective due to mutations
      in other HR genes. In addition, the presence of a BRCA gene mutation does not guarantee
      defective HR since mutations in other genes (e.g. TP53BP1) can restore HR despite the
      presence of a BRCA1 mutation. Since all patients with tumors that are HR deficient may
      benefit from PARP inhibition, better tools are required to identify these patients. Recently,
      a functional ex vivo test for HR deficiency (the RAD51 assay) became available for clinical
      use. The RAD51 assay can identify patients with functional defects in HR-repair and may
      predict which cancer patients are likely to benefit from PARP inhibition. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate whether the RAD51 assay can select patients who will benefit from
      treatment with the PARP-inhibitor veliparib.

In case of a RAD51 assay indicating HR proficiency, patients will not be eligible for treatment in this study and cannot be included. Patients with a RAD51 assay indicating HR deficiency will be included. Eligible patients will be treated with veliparib monotherapy until at least the first tumor assessment after 8 weeks of treatment.
