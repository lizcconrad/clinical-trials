  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PTA-Registry (PTA-REG) is a prospective health services research registry to monitor and
      follow-up patients with peripheral arterial disease undergoing endovascular peripheral
      intervention. The PTA-REG has an interdisciplinary approach: cardiologists, angiologists, and
      radiologists contributed actively to this registry.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry was created for the following purposes: evaluation of the clinical
      effectiveness, safety and quality of the endovascular therapy, and history of the disease
      after endovascular therapy. The resulting specific research questions were determination of
      the technical and clinical success of the procedure, monitoring of periinterventional
      complications, evaluation of vessel patency, amputation rate, mortality, and major adverse
      cardiac events during the follow-up. In addition, the quality of life after endovascular
      peripheral intervention over a period of two years was evaluated.

        Male and female patients with peripheral arterial disease of the iliac and lower extremity
        arteries and appropriate clinical indication for treatment with PTA according to current
        guidelines were included in the registry. Presence of written informed consent for
        participating in the registry was mandatory. There were no exclusion criteria and no age
