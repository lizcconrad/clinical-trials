    <textblock>
      Psychological distress is a natural reaction following the death of a loved one.
      Nevertheless, research has shown that for a significant minority of bereaved individuals the
      grieving process is complicated. Instead of decreasing, these individuals experience an
      intense grief reaction that becomes abnormally persistent and increasingly debilitating
      across time. It has been suggested that this intense, persistent grief reaction meets
      criteria to be considered a distinct mental disorder. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) has been
      proposed to capture this condition and is expected to be included in the forthcoming ICD-11.
      The proposed project aims to prepare healthcare services to use the diagnosis of prolonged
      grief disorder (PGD) by determining the frequency of PDG in a population sample of bereaved
      spouses and their adult children. It will also identify early predictors of PGD and common
      trajectories of natural and prolonged grief. The mapping of grief trajectories may turn out
      to be a potential prognostic tool to identify individuals with high versus low risk of
      developing PGD.

      BACKGROUND:

      Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) is a new diagnosis that may occur after the death of a
      partner, parent, child, or other person close to the bereaved. PGD is characterized by a
      persistent and pervasive grief response including longing for the deceased or persistent
      preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain (e.g. sadness, guilt,
      anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death). The disorder is expected to be
      admitted as an official diagnosis when the 11th revision of the WHO's diagnostic system is
      published in 2018 (ICD-11). When introducing the diagnosis with ICD-11, health care services
      are obliged to identify and treat PGD.

      PURPOSE AND AIMS:

      The primary purpose of the study is to prepare healthcare services to use the diagnosis of
      PGD. More specifically, the project aims to determine the frequency of PDG in a population
      sample of bereaved spouses and their adult children. It will also identify early predictors
      of PGD and common trajectories of natural and prolonged grief. Finally, the project will also
      assess the socioeconomic costs of PGD by analyzing health data registries.

      HYPOTHESES:

      Based on existing bereavement literature and empirical research, the project explores the
      following hypotheses:

        1. High rumination, low quality of life, loss of spouse versus loss of parent, and presence
           of psychopathology at time of loss will predict degree of PGD symptoms among the
           bereaved at 6 and 11 months post-loss.

        2. The majority of bereaved individuals will exhibit a grief trajectory with a gradual
           decline in PGD symptoms over time, while a significant minority of bereaved individuals
           will show a trajectory with high levels of PGD symptoms across all measured time-points.

        3. PGD, PTSD, depression, and anxiety will be distinct constructs.

      PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURES:

      Individuals (age 25-85) will be consecutively recruited through the Danish Civil Registration
      System (CPR) from the Central Region of Denmark. After the loss, participants are contacted
      with a letter of condolence and a brief introduction to the study. Two months post-loss,
      potential participants are telephoned and invited to participate in the study. Participants
      are asked to complete three self-report questionnaires, respectively at 2 (T1), 6 (T2) and 11
      (T3) months post-loss. To meet different needs, participants can choose to fill in the
      questionnaire online or by postal service.

      Bereaved individuals constitute a highly vulnerable group with a heightened risk of suicide,
      social isolation, depression, etc. In the event, participants appear suicidal or particularly
      distressed (e.g. high score on suicidal ideation) they will be contacted by the researchers
      and a suicide risk screening is performed.
