  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have already revealed the involvement of the serotoninergic system in the
      social behavior process. For example, more serotonin (5HT) was found in dominant male adult
      monkeys. Little is known about the serotoninergic implication in human's social behavior. The
      project aims to clarify the role of the serotoninergic system in social behavior in relation
      to the process of social hierarchical information. In order to determine how serotoninergic
      system is involved, the investigator will use a new technic TEP-fMRI. This technic allows us
      to measure the brain activity and the serotoninergic transporter occupancy (using the
      [C11]-DASB) at the same time. The current study aims to investigate whether serotonin
      transporter (5-HTT) activity correlates with the neural response (BOLD) during the detection
      of social dominance in facial expressions or other measures of social information processing.
      Blood sample, SLC6A4 (allele coding for the 5HT transporter) genotyping and
      neuropsychological questionnaires will give at the investigator more information and allow to
      investigate whether performance on social information processing is modulated by personality
      trait and genotype.

    <description>The BOLD signal will be measured using a MRI scanner, and simultaneously we will record the level of serotonin transporter with [11C]DASB marker of the serotonin transmission, using a PET signal. We will use the Scatchard method in order to determine the level of [11C]DASB bonded to the transporter. Our reference region will be the cerebellum.</description>
