  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ileus occurs from hypomotility of the gastrointestinal tract. Causes of Paralytic ileus
      include post-operation, stroke, and bed-ridden for a long time. Medicine treatment is less
      and less effective over time. Some study revealed that Moxibustion and Acupuncture are
      effective in Paralytic ileus. Investigators try to find other treatment except of medicine.
      Laser Acupuncture is a safe and non-invasive choice. This study is to evaluate effect of
      Laser Acupuncture on Paralytic ileus.

      This study's sample consisted of 94 adult participants who had Paralytic ileus. Patients
      experiencing skin disease or wounds, pregnancy, less than 20 years old, and who take
      Immunosuppressants drugs or Morphine, Mechanical obstruction were excluded. These 94 patients
      were randomly divided into two groups: a Laser Acupuncture group and a control group. At the
      beginning of study, check X-ray(KUB), collect serum Gastrin, Motilin, and Pancreatic
      polypeptide, and record bowel sound per minute, frequent of enema, average amount of stool
      per day. 47 patients received Laser Acupuncture therapy three times a week in acupoints RN6,
      RN4, and RN12. The whole duration of treatment is 8 weeks. The control group patients receive
      pseudo laser acupuncture. In the end of 4th and 8th week, check X-ray(KUB), collect serum
      Gastrin, Motilin, and Pancreatic polypeptide, and record bowel sound per minute, observe the
      daily record and then calculate frequent of enema and average amount of stool per day. After
      the end of treatment, the investigators keep follow up for 4 weeks. The outcome parameters
      include:

        1. KUB,

        2. the average amount of stool every day,

        3. frequency of bowel sound,

        4. frequency of enema, (Indication of enema: the amount of stool less than 200g within 3
           days),

        5. the change of serum Gastrin, Motilin, and Pancreatic polypeptide.

    <description>Gastrin is secreted by G cell at stomach. It stimulates parietal cells of the stomach to secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl)/gastric acid. It also increases antral muscle mobility and promotes stomach contractions. Collect serum 3cc before study, and on the end of 4th, 8th, 12th week. Check serum Gastrin. Is serum Gastrin increased after Laser Acupuncture Therapy?</description>

    <description>Motilin is secreted by endocrine M cells that are numerous in crypts of the small intestine, especially in the duodenum and jejunum. It's the most important factor in controlling the inter-digestive migrating contractions. Collect serum 3cc before study, and on the end of 4th, 8th, 12th week. Check serum Motilin. Is serum Motilin increased after Laser Acupuncture Therapy?</description>
