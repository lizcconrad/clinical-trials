      The aim of the study is to determine the toxicity of Idronoxil (NOX66) when used in
      combination with palliative radiotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer
    </textblock>

      Who is it for? Patient may be eligible for this study if they have late stage metastatic
      prostate cancer which is castrate resistant and have metastatic lesions that are suitable for
      radiotherapy.

      Study details There are two groups of patients in this study and no randomisation. The two
      groups will have two different doses of idronoxil (NOX66), representing a 2-step dose
      escalation. Both groups receive the same standard radiotherapy dose.

      Group 1 will receive the lower dose (400 mg) of idronoxil suppository daily and Group 2 800
      mg daily.

      Recruitment into Group 2 will only commence once all Group 1 patients have completed the
      13-day treatment course of idronoxil suppository without excessive unexpected toxicity. The
      total treatment duration is 26 days for both groups.

      WEEK 1: Days 1-5: 1 or 2 lesions will receive 20-25 Gy (radiotherapy dose unit) radiotherapy
      in 5 daily fractionated doses .

      WEEK 2: Rest week. No radiotherapy. Start NOX66 on Day 14

      WEEK 3: DAYS 15-19: NOX66 therapy. DAYS 15-19: Remaining lesions (maximum 3 lesions) each to
      receive 20-25 Gy RT in 5 daily fractionated doses.

      WEEK 4: DAYS 20-26: NOX66 therapy.

      Both groups will have prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography
      (PSMA-PET) scans before starting treatment and three months after the last fraction of
      radiotherapy to assess treatment response.
