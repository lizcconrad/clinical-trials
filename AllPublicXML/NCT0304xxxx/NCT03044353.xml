  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to evaluate whether monthly repeated courses of administration of
      GSK2315698 followed by GSK2398852 is associated with a reduction in cardiac amyloid load in
      patients with cardiac amyloidosis, monitored by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and
      echocardiography (ECHO), and whether this is associated with an improvement in cardiac
      function. Cohort 1 is transthyretin cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) , cohort 2 is patients with
      immunoglobulin light chain (AL) systemic amyloidosis at greater than 6 months post
      chemotherapy, cohort 3 newly diagnosed AL systemic amyloidosis undergoing chemotherapy.
      Primary objectives for the study are assessment of reduction in cardiac amyloid load after
      repeated administrations of Anti-SAP treatment as evaluated by CMR in all study groups and
      assessment of safety &amp; tolerability of repeated administration of Anti-SAP treatment,
      including compatibility with chemotherapy treatment in patients with AL systemic amyloidosis.
      This is an open label, non-randomised, three-group, monthly repeat Anti-SAP treatment study
      in systemic amyloidosis patients with cardiac dysfunction caused by cardiac amyloidosis.
      Subjects will receive up to 6 courses of Anti-SAP treatment. Maximum total duration for a
      subject in the study is approximately 18 months.

        Males:

        Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the
        following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication for a
        cycle of spermatogenesis following five terminal half-lives after the last dose of study
        medication. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia.

        (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when
        used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label.
        For non-product methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is
        consistent and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the
        International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of
        Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).

        The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use
        these methods of contraception.

        stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to
        laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on HRT and whose menopausal
        status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception
        methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
        discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.
