  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CareWell will enable the delivery of integrated healthcare to frail elderly patients in a
      pilot setting through comprehensive multidisciplinary integrated care programmes where the
      role of ICTs can foster the coordination and patient centered delivery care. Carewell will
      focus in particular complex, multi-morbid elderly patients, who the patients most in need of
      health and social care resources (35% the total cost of Health Care System) and more complex
      interventions due to their frailty and comorbidities (health and social care coordination,
      monitoring, self-management of the patient and informal care giver). ICT platforms and
      communication channels that allow sharing information between healthcare and social care
      professionals involved in the delivery care of these patients, facilitating their
      coordination, increasing their resoluteness and avoiding duplicities when tackling patients´
      diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitation or monitoring needs. Additionally, ICT-based
      platforms can improve the adherence to treatment, enhance self-care and increase patient
      awareness about their health status , as well as, improve the empowerment of informal
      caregivers, who usually take care of these patients.

      According to this, it is hypothesized that the benefit of integrated care programmes based on
      (1) integrated care coordination and (2) patient empowerment &amp; home support pathways
      supported by ICT is greater and essential for these patients. Care pathways will cut across
      organisational boundaries and will activate the most appropriate resources across the entire
      spectrum of healthcare and social care services available for both scheduled and emergency
      care. CareWell aims to scale up the services in pioneer regions and share their approach,
      learning from and supporting the other pilot sites which are at different levels of maturity
      in respect to designing, developing and implementing new ways of providing integrated care
      services.

    <textblock>
      Frail elderly patients are characterised as having complex health and social care needs; they
      are at risk of hospital or residential care home admission, and require a range of high level
      interventions due to their frailty and multiple chronic conditions. A growing proportion of
      the population in OECD countries are age 65 and over: 15% in 2010, and expected to reach 22%
      by 2030. More than half of all older people have at least three chronic conditions, and a
      significant proportion have five or more.

      A recent US study indicates that more than 95% of Medicare patients with a chronic disease
      such as congestive heart failure, depression, or diabetes have at least one other chronic
      condition, and the majority (80%, 71%, and 56%, respectively) have four or more chronic
      conditions. The CareWell project deals with multimorbid frail patients. Typically these
      patients have several diagnoses, the most frequent ones are:

        -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),

        -  Diabetes and

        -  Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).

      The main objective of the CareWell study is to explore the data collection and analysis of
      health services' use. All sites are requested to upload their available data regarding
      service use, their flow chart on recruitment, and the demographic characteristics of end
      users. The evaluation has been conducted using the MAST multi-dimensional evaluation
      methodology adapted to the needs of CareWell project focusing on integrated healthcare.

      MAST includes assessment of the outcomes of telemedicine applications divided into the
      following seven domains:

        1. health problem and characteristics of the application;

        2. safety;

        3. clinical effectiveness;

        4. patient perspectives;

        5. economic aspects;

        6. organisational aspects and

        7. socio-cultural, ethical and legal aspects. Each domain will be addressed and studied
           through a range of methodological approaches, quantitative, qualitative and modelling.

      Patients distributed in six sites will be recruited and assessed at baseline and be followed
      up during a period of six months. Data is to be collected from different sources, including
      administrative databases, questionnaires and personal interviews.

      All 6 CareWell sites are to conduct cohort studies, which means that a group of people with
      similar characteristics are followed over a period of time. Potential participants are
      selected by screening electronic healthcare records and/or the hospital / national databases
      and/or during long term condition annual reviews in the community setting.

      Candidates are informed about the nature and the objectives of the evaluation. Once
      candidates have signed the informed consent form, if necessary, they participate in the
      evaluation.

          4. Participants have to be able to understand and to comply with study instructions and
             requirement, either independently or with help from a carer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have either been registered with an active cancer diagnosis under
             treatment, have undergone an organ transplant, or are undergoing dialysis prior to
             enrolment.

          2. Subjects who are candidates for palliative care (with life expectancy less than one
             year, clinically evaluated).

          3. People with an AIDS diagnosis.

          4. People living in care homes where their daily health, care and wellbeing needs are met
             by staff (nurses and support staff) employed within the home.
