      The study aimed to investigate the effectivity of bupivacaine 0,5% as post-operative
      analgesia in intravitreal silicone evacutaion surgery

      Approval from Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia was acquired
      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study
      and randomized into two groups. Intravenous (IV) cannule with Ringer Lactate fluid,
      non-invasive blood pressure monitor, electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse-oxymetry were set on
      the subjects in the operation room. Co-induction was done with midazolam 0,05 mg/kg and
      fentanyl 2 mcg/kg. Induction was done with propofol 1-2 mg/kg, followed by Laryngeal Mask
      insertion facilitated by atracurium 0,5 mg/kg. Maintenance was done with sevoflurane 1-2
      vol%, O2:H2O = 1:2, flow 2 liter/minute. Surgery started. After final stitching, Group 1
      received subconjunctival bupivacaine 0,5% 2,5ml in between stitches; Group 2 received
      subconjunctival NaCl 0,9% in between stitches. Both groups received paracetamol 20 mg/kgBW IV
      as post-operative analgesics. Hemodynamic, pain degree (using Visual Analog Scale / VAS), and
      nausea/vomiting incidence, and the time for first requested additional analgesia were
      recorded. Data was analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scientist), for
      numerical data using unpaired T-test or Mann-Whitney-U test, for categorical data using
      Chi-square test or Fischer Exact's Test. Data normality was tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov
      test. Significant value is p&lt;0.05.
