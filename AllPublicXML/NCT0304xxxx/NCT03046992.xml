  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      YH25448 is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective and irreversible EGFR Tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing
      wild type-EGFR. YH25448 is expected to beneficial for the NSCLC patients with brain
      metastasis due to good blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration property as well as for the
      treatment of primary lung lesion and extracranial lesions. This study will be conducted to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of YH25448 in locally advanced or metastatic
      NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first time in patient study primarily designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of YH25448 in in patients with EGFR mutation positive (EGFRm+)
      advanced NSCLC with or without asymptomatic brain metastasis who progressed following prior
      therapy with an EGFR TKIs agent. This study is composed of 3 parts; part A is a dose
      escalation phase, part B is a dose expansion phase and part C is a dose extension phase.

      In dose escalation phase, YH25448 will be escalated to reach either a maximum tolerated or
      absorbable dose in patients as defined by dose-limiting toxicity in NSCLC patients who
      progressed following prior EGFR TKIs treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability. In
      dose expansion phase, further safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic(PK) and efficacy will be
      evaluated at each dose level(s) of dose escalation phase in NSCLC patients who progressed
      following prior EGFR TKIs treatment and harbouring confirmed T790M mutation. In dose
      extension phase, additional 3 cohorts (2nd line therapy cohort, 1st line therapy cohort, and
      brain metastasis cohort) will be enrolled to further assess the efficacy, safety,
      tolerability, and PK of YH25448 at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose (RD)
      defined through dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase. Results of these studies will
      serve as the evidence for further clinical development.

      This study will also characterize the metabolite(s) profile of YH25448 and determine PK of
      its metabolite(s) in biological samples if necessary. Also, exploratory correlation between
      biomarker profiles and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics will be analyzed.
