      Study activities were carried out to adapt and test a family-strengthening intervention to
      improve child development outcomes among families facing adversity in Rwanda.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qualitative research from past studies was used to adapt an existing family-strengthening
      intervention for HIV-AIDS affected families to extremely vulnerable families with children
      0-3 in order to improve early childhood development outcomes. This small scale pilot was
      carried out to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention for extremely
      vulnerable families with young children in Rwanda.

      In the first 10 families the intervention consisted of 21 modules, in the second iteration of
      the study with an additional 10 families, the curriculum was summarized into 15 modules.
      Modules were delivered by trained bachelor-level interventionists/home-visiting coaches and
      were delivered to families one on one in their respective homes. Modules were delivered on a
      weekly to biweekly basis and were flexible to the families needs and other responsibilities.

    <description>Vulnerable Households (ubudehe 1 or 2) in the Government of Rwanda's poverty classification system, when categories ranged from 1 to 6; the system has since been restructured to have four categories only. Often a way to identify households for public works opportunities or other government assistance programs. For this arm, families had to be Ubudehe 1 or 2 and have a child aged 0-3 years. Households meeting these criteria in the catchment area(s) received the FSI ECD home-based parenting intervention from bachelor-level interventionists/&quot;coaches.&quot;</description>
