  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the biophysical impact of biophysical Impact of Transcutaneous Spinal Cord
      Stimulation (TSCS) within a single session. We hypothesize that subjects will demonstrate
      increased volitional muscle strength with TSCS. This will be assessed by isokinetic strength
      testing of post-injury dominant-side knee extension. Subjects will be tested in both
      Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation and sham conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct isokinetic strength testing (via the Biodex) of post-injury,
      dominant-side knee extension before, during, and after TSCS and a sham condition.
      Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation will be applied (via the Vectra Neo) using a 5cm x10cm
      oval electrode placed midline on the skin between spinous process T11 -T12 as a cathode and
      two 7.5cm x 13cm rectangular electrodes placed symmetrically on the skin over the lower
      abdomen as anodes. A symmetrical biphasic rectangular waveform, at 50Hz and 1millisecond,
      will be used to provide 30 continuous minutes of stimulation. As sham procedures for this
      intervention have not been established, the investigators will follow sham procedures well
      documented in Transcranial DC Stimulation (tDCS). Electrodes will be placed as they are in
      the Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation condition. Stimulation will be applied at
      subject's maximum intensity for 30 seconds and then discontinued. Subjects will participate
      in two testing sessions, each approximately one hour in length, separated by at least 24
      hours.

      Subject's starting condition will be randomized. Subjects will be informed that two
      stimulation conditions are being tested, but will not be told which is the experimental
      condition.

    <description>Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation is a non-invasive mechanism to enhance excitation of spinal neural circuitry and represents a promising supplement to existing physical therapy programs. Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation will be applied (via the Vectra Neo) using a 5cm x10cm oval electrode placed midline on the skin between spinous process T11 -T12 as a cathode and two 7.5cm x 13cm rectangular electrodes placed symmetrically on the skin over the lower abdomen as anodes.7,9 A symmetrical biphasic rectangular waveform, at 50Hz and 1millisecond, will be used to provide 30 continuous minutes of stimulation.</description>
