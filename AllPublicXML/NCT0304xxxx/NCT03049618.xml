  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies how well recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab
      work in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in
      the body or head and neck squamous cell cancer that has come back or spread to other places
      in the body. Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving
      recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients
      with non-small cell lung or head and neck squamous cell cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate of the combination of pembrolizumab and recombinant EphB4-HSA
      fusion protein (sEphB4-HSA) as combination therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the biomarkers of response. II. Determine the unique toxicities of the
      combination of pembrolizumab and sEphB4-HSA.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and recombinant
      EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 3
      weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
