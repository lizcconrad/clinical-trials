      Objectives:

      The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of preoperative administration of
      single-dose of paracetamol-codeine, in the relieving of acute post-operative pain after the
      surgical removal of an impacted mandibular third molar.

      Materials and Methods:

      The study cohort consisted of 32 Caucasian outpatients, giving a total of 64 bilateral
      symmetrical impacted mandibles. Patients were randomized in two experimental groups to
      receive a preoperative oral dose of paracetamol-codeine (analgesic group) or a placebo
      (placebo group) at the first and second surgeries. Study participants were asked to record
      pain intensity scores during the operation and the next 2 days, the time of the first request
      for rescue analgesic, and the total number of postoperative-supplement paracetamol-codeine
      tablets.
