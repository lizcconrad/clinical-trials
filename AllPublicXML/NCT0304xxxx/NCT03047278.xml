    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the influence of the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes (DM2)
      and of cetirizine (OCT2 inhibitor) on gabapentin kinetics disposition and
      pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) in patients with neuropathic pain. Thus,
      non-diabetic patients (Control Group, n=10), patients with controlled diabetes (n=10) and
      patients with uncontrolled diabetes (n=10), all with neuropathic pain of intensity ≥ 4 in
      pain visual analog scale (0-10) are being investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), expressed in the basolateral membrane of the kidney
      proximal tubules, promotes the elimination of endogenous compounds and clinically used drugs.
      Gabapentin (GBP) an anticonvulsant used for neuropathic pain treatment, is eliminated
      primarily by renal excretion, dependent of OCT2 activity. Studies in rats with diabetes
      suggest that hyperglycemia reduces OCT2 activity in approximately 50%. The aim of this study
      is to investigate the influence of the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and of
      cetirizine (OCT2 inhibitor) on gabapentin kinetics disposition and
      pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) in patients with neuropathic pain. Non-diabetic
      patients (Control Group, n=10), patients with controlled diabetes (n=10) and patients with
      uncontrolled diabetes (n=10), all with neuropathic pain of intensity ≥ 4 in pain visual
      analog scale (0-10) are being recruited and included in the research protocol. Patients are
      being treated with oral single dose of GBP 300 mg (Phase I) or cetirizine (20 mg/day) for 5
      days and single dose of GBP on the last day (Phase II). Only the patients of Control Group
      will participate of Phase II. Serial blood samples are being collected and until 36 hours
      after GBP administration, and urine is being collected in 0-8 hours, 8-16 hours, 16-24 hours
      and 24-36 hours intervals. The intensity of pain is being evaluated at the same time of blood
      sampling, using the visual analog scale. GBP concentration in plasma is being validated by
      LC-MS, and GBP concentration in urine will be validated by Liquid Chromatography-Mass
      Spectrometer (LC-MS). Patients will be genotyped for the polimorphism 808 G&gt;T of Solute
      Carrier 22A2 (SLC22A2) gene. Pharmacokinetics parameters area under the curve (AUC), total
      clearance, renal clearance, volume of distribution and elimination half-life will be
      estimated by non-compartmental analysis. Based on the results, it will be possible to
      evaluate the relevance of OCT2 activity on GBP pharmacokinetics, and the necessity of dose
      adjustment of GBP in patients with DM2.

    <description>Adult patients (18 - 59 years old) with neuropathic pain of score ≥ 4 that do not use gabapentin are being recruited. All patients are receiving oral single dose of gabapentin (300 mg) as capsules after 12 hour-fasting (phase I). To investigate GBP pharmacokinetics, blood samples are being collected in heparinized tubes up to 36 hours after GBP administration. The urine of the patients is being collected up to 36 hours after GBP administration. The intensity of pain is being evaluated in each time of blood sampling through the visual analog scale (0-10). In phase II, after 15 days (wash-out) from phase I, cetirizine hydrochloride (10 mg) is being administered orally, twice a day, as pills, for five days. On the last day of cetirizine treatment, an oral single dose of gabapentin (300 mg), as capsule, is being administered. Serial blood and urine samples are being collected up to 36 hours after GBP administration. The intensity of pain is being evaluated in each time of blood sampling.</description>
