  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Laparoscopic surgical procedures have become increasingly established in
      operative medicine. They require special motor, haptic, and spatial-visual skills to perform
      the interventions safely and effectively. The basic skills are often learned in the operating
      room on the patient. This is economically inefficient and can be improved with regard to
      patient safety. Against the background of this problem, various simulators were developed in
      order to train laparoscopic basic skills outside the surgery. The Lübecker Toolbox (LTB)
      curriculum is a video-based trainer, which - unlike the other trainees on the market - has
      standardized and validated exercises with concrete targets, based on the skills of experts in
      minimally invasive surgery (MIC). Against the background of different, non-validated training
      programs and simulators with ambiguous objectives, it is not known how training programs and
      simulators improve the skills of the advanced physicians in performing laparoscopic-assisted
      operations. An evidence of effectiveness in the practice transfer could have a considerable
      relevance with regard to the integration of the training programs into the specialist
      doctoral training.

      Aim of the study: The aim of the study is to investigate whether physicians in the first
      years of further education are able to improve laparoscopic skills required to perform
      laparoscopic operations, if they have successfully completed the LTB curriculum.

      In the prospective study, the subjects are randomized into two groups, one group completing
      the LTB curriculum after the first own laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the other not. After
      2 months, both groups will perform their first laparoscopic cholecystectomy again. The
      laparoscopic video recordings will be analysed and compared using the Global Operational
      Assessment of Laparoscopic Skill (GOALS) score.

    <description>The Lübeck Toolbox (LTB) curriculum has a structured training program, in which the laparoscopic basic skills are to be learned in six consecutive exercises. In doing so, the curriculum has precise targets for each of the six exercises based on the abilities of 15 experts of the minimally invasive surgeons demonstrated in the system as a benchmark. The objectives and the learning curves were additionally validated in prospective studies. The LTB curriculum is thus a structured training program with clear objectives that enable the technical learning of laparoscopic basic skills comparable to the expert level.</description>
