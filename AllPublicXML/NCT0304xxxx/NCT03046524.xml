      Objectives:

        1. Identify the clinical characteristics of parathyroid (PTH) cancer and PTH atypical
           neoplasms

        2. Investigate if PTH carcinoma and atypical neoplasm present a biological behaviour and
           have a different impact on the health of the patients
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data between the years of 1/1/2002 and 12/31/2013 will be analyzed. The medical records of
      all adult patients that had a parathyroidectomy for primary PHPT in MD Anderson Cancer Center
      will be screened in order to identify patients that had a histopathological diagnosis of
      parathyroid carcinoma or atypical parathyroid neoplasm.
