  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) remains a persistent problem
      for investigators in part because of the wide array of pathogenic mechanisms that contribute
      to these disorders as well as the lack of adequately powered, controlled trials. While
      glucocorticoids remain the primary therapy for many forms of protein uric glomerular
      diseases, prolonged use is associated with significant morbidities including steroid induced
      diabetes, metabolic bone disease, and excessive weight gain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple agents have been investigated in the treatment of patients with SRNS, but there is
      no consensus on what constitutes optimal therapy. Previous studies have examined the efficacy
      of combining intravenous cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids and have shown complete and
      partial response rates between 40% and 60%. More recently, calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have
      become an effective second line therapy with similar response rates between 50%-70%. However,
      both treatment regiments are limited by the risk for infection as well as the development of
      CNI-induced nephrotoxicity and progressive renal disease. Acthar gel is a porcine pituitary
      preparation composed of ACTH and other proopiomelanocortin peptides and is currently approved
      for treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Previous studies, as well as more current
      studies, have shown that ACTHar gel can effectively reduce proteinuria in idiopathic
      membranous glomerulonephritis and other forms of glomerulopathy including focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and advanced diabetic nephropathy. While the mechanism is unknown,
      previous studies have shown that melanocortin 1-receptors are expressed in glomerular
      podocytes and that activation of this receptor pathway could be involved in the protein
      lowering effects of ACTHar gel. Incubation of cultured podocytes with ACTH leads to
      activation of MCR-1 receptors and the subsequent stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA)
      through a G-protein-dependent pathway. The downstream phosphorylation and stabilization of
      Rho GTPases, synaptopodin and other cell-cytoskeletal associated proteins may stabilize
      podocyte function and density.
