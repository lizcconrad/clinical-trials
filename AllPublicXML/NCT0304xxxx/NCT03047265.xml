      This is a Phase II Randomized Trial to Compare Paclitaxel combined with DDP Plus Concurrent
      Chemoradiotherapy With DDP Plus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Locoregionally

    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in South China.
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Concurrent
      chemoradiation has become a standard treatment for locally advanced stage III-IVb
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, The recommended single-agent DDP concurrent chemotherapy
      regimen for high-risk patients (IVa-IVb period) to improve the efficacy was not significant.
      Paclitaxel combined with platinum in the same period of chemotherapy regimen has been widely
      used in head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and lung
      cancer and other tumors, a number of studies have shown that it has good tolerance and
      efficacy. And a number of previous studies have shown that paclitaxel combined with platinum
      chemotherapy in the same period of head and neck cancer or nasopharyngeal cancer in multiple
      phase II clinical trials to achieve encouraging results. Based on the above background and
      basis, for the high risk (IVa-IVb) nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment, the applicant intends
      to carry out the first IMRT + paclitaxel + DDP concurrent chemotherapy compared with DDP
      single drug concurrent chemotherapy regimen Pharyngeal cancer in a prospective randomized
      controlled phase Ⅱ clinical trial for paclitaxel + DDP dual-chemotherapy regimen for the
      treatment of high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma to provide evidence-based basis. (IVa-IVb)
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and to provide a high-level evidence-based evidence-based
      approach to the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma at high risk (stage IVa-IVb). The
      results of this study will be used in international guidelines to optimize high- Treatment of
      cancer patients.
