    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of an out-of-school diabetes
      prevention program for youth (ages 7-15) with a family history of pre-diabetes or type 2
      diabetes.

      The Insulin Superheroes Club (ISC) is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program for adults
      (Knowler WC et al., 2002), which was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC). We have adapted the curriculum for youth to serve a supplement to the adult
      program. This program lasts 12 months, and the goals are to improve participants' health and
      reduce their risk of developing pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. The ISC program includes 16
      weekly (Phase 1), 3 bi-weekly (Phase 2), and 6 monthly (Phase 3) sessions. Sessions include
      60 minutes of physical fitness and 30 minutes of education. The education portion includes
      interactive teaching of a health-related topic (e.g., nutrition, exercise, physiology,
      mindfulness, and stress reduction) using a hand-on learning activity (e.g., cooking, crafts,
      games, and role play). All physical fitness activities incorporate moderate intensity
      exercises (e.g., push-ups, yoga, basketball, tag, and dance).
