  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since memantine may not only inhibit overactivity of microglial cell, but also repair the
      damaged neurons and neurogenesis through activation of astroglial cell and release of
      neurotrophic factors, the investigators propose that the neurotrophic effect of memantine may
      benefit neurodegenerative diseases including bipolar disorders (BP) and alcohol dependence.
      In the current study, the investigator will investigate whether add-on memantine at a dose of
      5 mg/day has a beneficial effect on BP comorbid with alcohol dependence.

      Each individual enter into this project will receive regulate treatment adding-on memantine
      medication. During each visit, patients will receive evaluation for their symptoms and plasma
      Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF), cytokines (e.g.., Interleukin-6(IL-6), IL-8) and
      neuropsychological performance.
