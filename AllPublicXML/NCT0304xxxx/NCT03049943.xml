    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of different wave lengths of LLLT on
      salivation in participants suffering from hyposalivation.

      This study included 30 participants whose major salivary glands were treated with low
      intensity diode laser BTL2000 (Medical Technologies, s.r.o., Czech Republic) during 10
      consecutive days. Patients were randomly assigned in two groups, each of 15 patients, and
      treated with LLLT of 830 nm and LLLT of 685 nm, respectively. The whole unstimulated and
      stimulated saliva was measured each day during 10 days, before and after laser treatment and
      10th day after treatment was ended.

      Low level laser treatment has proved to be effective for a wide range of oral pathologies
      including oral dryness, but the literature still lacks reports of clinical trials and
      protocols. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different laser wave
      lengths on salivation of patients suffering from hyposalivation. This with purpose to
      possibly find the optimum laser wavelength for the treatment, and to determine the better
      protocol for the patients suffering from hyposalivation. This study included 30 patients
      whose major salivary glands were treated with low intensity diode laser BTL2000 (Medical
      Technologies, s.r.o., Czech Republic) during 10 consecutive days. Patients were randomly
      assigned in two groups, each of 15 patients, and treated with LLLT of 830 nm and LLLT of 685
      nm, respectively. The whole unstimulated and stimulated saliva was measured in graduated
      tubes each day during 10 days, before and after laser treatment and 10th day after treatment
      was ended.
