    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for advanced myeloid
      malignancies including AML (acute myeloid leukemia), MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) and MPN
      (myeloproliferative neoplasms)

      The intervention involved in this study is:

      -Regorafenib (Stivarga)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Regorafenib for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking for the best dose of Regorafenib to
      treat the participant's disease with. Researchers will also look at how effective the study
      drug is in treating the participant's disease and if any side effects occur.
