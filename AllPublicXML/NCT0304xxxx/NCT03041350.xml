  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Direct medical control using video conferencing capabilities of smartphones has never been
      conducted in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. This study was conducted to investigate
      its feasibility and treatment effectiveness in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients
      using a real-time smartphone video call.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If cardiac arrest is suspected, the EMS personnel contacted the medical director before
      arriving at the scene. Upon the arrival at the scene of the two activated paramedic teams,
      they rapidly switch to ALS under teamwork-based BLS and video medical control. Using this
      video medical control, high-quality CPR, cardiac arrest rhythm confirmation, defibrillation,
      proper drug administration instructions, advanced airway insertion, etc. are performed. The
      medical director then decides on patient transfer if the asystole and pulseless electrical
      activity findings are persistent even after more than 20-minutes of ALS. After initiating the
      transfer, the medical director contacts the hospital where the patient is to be transferred
      to after completing the video medical control. The medical director provides an explanation
      of the treatment to the caregiver via video. After returning to the fire station, the EMS
      personnel who had completed the patient's transfer the enters the information by hand on the
      separate form, takes a picture of the document, and uploads it to SNS within 24 hours.
      Through this information shared via SNS, the research staff the provides a direct feedback to
      the EMS personnel, and further discussion performed within the SNS. All the incident cases of
      OHCA during the before and during interventional periods were registered using an EMS run
      sheet for basic ambulance operation information, the EMS cardiac arrest registry for the
      Utstein factors, and the OHCA registry for the hospital care and survival outcomes. The EMS
      run sheet and EMS cardiac arrest registry were collected by the EMS providers. The medical
      records for hospital care and outcomes were abstracted by the trained reviewer for this study

    <description>As an preparation for this study, personnel training in mock advanced life support (ALS) simulation including the smartphone video call methodology was conducted. The smartphones were not separately purchased or produced; commercially available smartphones already owned by the emergency medical service (EMS) personnel and medical directors were used. To facilitate the smartphone video call between the medical director and the EMS personnel and to prevent the caregivers or others nearby from hearing the conversation, Bluetooth earphone sets were used. Data were collected using the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) recording form uploaded in SNS which consisted of EMS personnel and medical directors, and the quality of CPR was evaluated</description>
