  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transforaminal epidural block (TFEB) with local anesthetics and steroid is effective to treat
      spinal radicular pain. However, inadvertent intravascular injection can lead to severe
      neurologic complications. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) during epidural block might
      increase the detection rate of intravascular penetration, compared to real-time fluoroscopy
      (RTF). But, DSA has disadvantages, such as additional radiation exposure to physicians and
      participants and the high cost of the new and upgraded fluoroscopic equipment. In this study,
      it was designed to compare DSA and RTF for detection of intravascular penetration in the same
      participant who underwent cervical TFEB.

      The investigators prospectively examined the participants who received cervical TFEB. The
      needle position was confirmed using biplanar fluoroscopy and 2 ml of nonionic contrast media
      was injected at the rate of 0.5 ml/sec under RTF. Thirty seconds later, 2 ml of nonionic
      contrast media was injected at the rate of 0.5 ml/sec under DSA.
