  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (IUPP) is a difficult to treat complication that
      causes a profound negative impact on the individual's quality of life, as well as seriously
      disrupts the physician-patient relationship and is a substantial public health problem .
      Urinary incontinence (UI) can occur both in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia
      (BPH) and in the treatment of prostate cancer.

      In the treatment of benign disease, this complication is associated with a very low
      prevalence, initially of 9% and about 1% in 12 months postoperatively. In radical
      prostatectomy, the prevalence is higher, varying from 2% to 87%, depending on the populations
      and sites studied, the definitions used, the different methodologies employed in the
      evaluation of incontinence, and also the different degrees of intensity of the disease .
      Several authors have evaluated the incidence of incontinence after robotic radical
      prostatectomy, open and laparoscopically. With these techniques, the reported total UI
      incidence varies from 4% to 40% .

      With the high prevalence of IUPP, accelerating the recovery of urinary control is an
      important priority for patients and their caregivers, and the search for effective and
      low-risk treatments is a constant. Thus, the possibility of treatment with the radiofrequency
      (RF) feature arises.

      A current treatment proposal is the use of radiofrequency, which is a diathermic process
      generated by the radiation of an electromagnetic spectrum, resulting in an immediate
      retraction of existing collagen and subsequent activation of fibroblasts causing a
      neocollagenesis. In studies using radiofrequency to treat SUI, a therapeutic response to 50%
      was shown. Representing a more cost-effective treatment than surgery.

    <description>The ICIQ-SF is a self-administered questionnaire composed of four questions that assess the frequency, severity and impact of UI, as well as a set of eight self-diagnosis items related to the causes or UI situations experienced by the respondents. The final score is found from the sum of the score of questions 3, 4 and 5. The overall score ranges from 0 to 21 points and the higher the score the greater the impact on the quality of life. The impact on the quality of life is divided in such a way: no impact (0 point); Light impact (from 1 to 3 points); Moderate impact (from 4 to 6 points); Serious impact (from 7 to 9 points); And very serious impact (10 or more points</description>

Kinesiotherapy will be done once a week, totaling five sessions. Initially, verbal information about location, function, and the correct way to contract the pelvic floor (PA) will be given. In addition, at this point will be advised on the performance of &quot;The Knack&quot;, which is a pre-contraction of the PA during the performance of some abdominal effort such as coughing, sneezing or laughing.</description>

    <description>The radiofrequency application protocol will be used in the form of capacitive electrical transfer, bipolar configuration, with CAPENERGY device (Figure 1), which has two electrodes: an active one, which will be introduced into the anal region, using a condom and gel to The emission of radiofrequency and another electrode, dispersive, coupled to the patient's hip, which will function as earth. The active electrode has at its end a sensor capable of capturing the temperature. The temperature used in the treatment will be 41 ° C, which this parameter will be placed in the equipment. Upon reaching the desired heating, the apparatus maintains the temperature and thus the application of the radiofrequency will be maintained for 2 minutes.</description>
