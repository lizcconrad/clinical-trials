    <textblock>
      Surgical abortion is one of the most frequently surgery of women in the world. 43 millions
      are annually performed in the world.

      90% of the abortions are performed during the first trimester of pregnancy before 13 weeks.
      Legal surgical abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy is a low risk intervention
      with a mortality rate lower than 1/100 000 abortions, with a risk of complications from 0.3 %
      to 3.4 %.

      Surgical abortion is one of the most frequently surgery of women in the world. 43 millions
      are annually performed in the world.

      Legal surgical abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy is a low risk intervention
      with a mortality rate lower than 1/100 000 abortions, with a risk of complications from 0.3 %
      to 3.4 %. In France, about 75 % of the surgical abortions are performed under general
      anesthesia (GA). Nevertheless, the risk of complications is higher under GA. The risk of
      death is more important (0,58 for 100 000) with GA. GA increases by a factor 1,7 the risk of
      bleeding, 2,2 the risk of uterine perforation, 8,2 the risk of intra-abdominal bleeding, 2,9
      the risk of cervical tearing, and 5 the risk of transfusion. The difficulty of pain control
      under local anesthetia (LA) explains this method is less choosen by the women. Indeed, a lot
      of women consider the surgical abortion under LA extremely uncomfortable. The paracervical
      block for the abortion under LA in the first trimester demonstrated its efficiency in the
      reduction of the per-operating pain whatever the term of the pregnancy compared with the
      absence of anesthesia. The cervical preparation demonstrated benefits in term of cervical
      dilation, per-operating bleeding, and complications incidence. The misoprostol and the
      mifepristone are 2 molecules recommended for the cervical preparation on the first trimester

    <intervention_model_description>The women will be randomized into two groups: Mifépristone group and Misoprostol group. The main endpoint will be the per-operating pain. The other endpoints are the pre and post-operative pain, the complications (cervical tearing, uterine perforation, hemorrhage requiring the use of blood products or an hemostatic intervention), the surgical time necessary to terminate the pregnancy, the side-effects of the drugs. The amount of per-operating bleeding and the duration of the intervention . We assume that the use of Mifepristone in the cervical preparation of the surgical abortion under LA would reduce the per-operating pain. The number of patients required is 55 in each arm.</intervention_model_description>
