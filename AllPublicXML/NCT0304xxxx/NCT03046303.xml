      This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial. The study protocol
      was approved by the Ethics Committee at the First Hospital of Jilin University.ERAS is
      combined with the laprascopic gastrectomy to assess the efficacy and safety in patients with
      advanced gastric carcinoma.The hospitalized patients were randomly divided into ERAS group
      and conventional pathway group . Inter-group differences were evaluated for clinical recovery
      index, economic indicators, length of hospital stay, 3 years to 5 years long-term survival,
      etc.
