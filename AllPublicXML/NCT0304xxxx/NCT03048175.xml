    <textblock>
      Third molar (wisdom teeth) extraction is one of the most frequent intervention in dentistry.
      Nevertheless, little is known about the level of general body inflammation of subjects with
      impacted or semi-impacted third molars. Moreover, The possible effects of surgical removal of
      wisdom teeth on the overall health are not known.

      Thus, a study in which 40 subjects has been designed. Twenty subjects were affected by
      bilateral wisdom tooth pathology necessitating for extraction of both teeth. Control group
      comprised 20 subjects with absence of wisdom teeth or completely erupted wisdom teeth without
      pathology associated to or history of previous extraction of both wisdom teeth.

      In both groups a medical and dental examination will be performed at the baseline and 3
      months after baseline for the control group or after the second third molar extraction in the
      control group. Blood will be also withdrawn to assess systemic inflammation and other
      systemic parameters.

      Parameter were evaluated via high sensitive c reactive protein (CRP), lipids, fibrinogen,
      oxidative stress and endothelial function analysis.

      Third molar extraction is one of the most frequent intervention in dentistry. Nevertheless,
      little is known about the systemic aspect of subjects with impacted or semi-impacted third
      molars and the possible effects of surgical removal on their systemic parameters. A
      case-control study of 40 subjects has been designed to evaluate i) the overall systemic
      inflammation and metabolism of subjects with bilateral third molars compared to subjects with
      no third molars and ii) the effect of bilateral removal in the immediate and medium
      postsurgical period. Systemic parameters are evaluated via high sensitive c reactive protein
      (CRP), lipids, fibrinogen, oxidative stress and endothelial function analysis.

    <description>After inferior dental and buccal nerve anesthesia a triangular full thickness flap with releasing incision on the mesio-buccal aspect of the second molar is designed. Ostectomy is then performed and tooth is sectioned and gently elevated. Once all the tooth components are extracted, the socket is carefully inspected and flap is sutured with interrupted sutures.</description>
