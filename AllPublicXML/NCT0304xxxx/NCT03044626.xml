      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent and any locally-required authorization (EU Data Privacy
             Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject prior to performing any
             protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations.

          2. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow
             up.

          3. Age &gt; 18 years at time of study entry.

          4. ECOG performance status 0-1.

          5. Expected life expectancy of ≥ 6 months.

          6. Patients with measurable disease (at least one uni-dimensionally measurable target
             lesion by CT-scan or MRI) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST 1.1) are eligible. For patients in Group A, non-measurable and measurable
             lesions may be chosen for irradiation. However, in order to allow for evaluation of
             abscopal effects, patients in Group A must have at least one measurable lesion beside
             the lesion planned to be irradiated. Lesions planned to be irradiated may not be
             defined as a measurable target lesion. Radiographic tumor assessment must be performed
             within 28 days before initiation of study treatment.

          7. Target Lesions may be located in a previously irradiated field if there is documented
             (radiographic) disease progression in that site.

          8. Patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in 2nd-line and
             3rd-line treatment and:

               1. no necessity of radiotherapy or

               2. the necessity of radiotherapy of a metastatic bone lesion or soft tissue lesion.

                    -  Patients with intrathoracic metastases or intrathoracic progressive disease
                       will be included if radiotherapy of the lung parenchyma is NOT required

                    -  Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases are eligible if metastases have
                       been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of
                       progression for 12 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days
                       prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must also be no
                       requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10
                       mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug
                       administration. Moreover, patients with stable (asymptomatic) brain
                       metastases that do not require local therapy with WBI (whole brain
                       irradiation) can be included.

          9. Patients who will receive study therapy after acceptable prior therapy as specified
             below are eligible:

             a) Patients who will receive study therapy as 2nd-line or 3rd-line of treatment:

             • Patients must have experienced disease recurrence or progression during or after one
             prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease.

             First line therapy is defined as therapy used to treat advanced disease. Each
             subsequent line of therapy is preceded by disease progression. A switch of an agent
             within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the start of a new line
             of therapy. Subjects must have received at least 2 cycles of platinum doublet based
             chemotherapy before discontinuation for toxicity.

             Experimental therapies when given as separate regimen are considered as separate line
             of therapy.

             Maintenance therapy following platinum doublet-based chemotherapy is not considered as
             a separate regimen of therapy and could comprise continuation of one or more of the
             agents used in the first-line therapy regimen or switch to another non cross-resistant
             agent. The initiation of maintenance therapy requires the lack of progressive disease
             with front-line therapy.

             Treatment given for locally advanced disease is not considered as a line of therapy
             for advanced disease. Subjects with recurrent disease &gt; 6 months after
             platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation therapy given
             for locally advanced disease, who also subsequently progressed during or after a
             platinum doublet-based regimen given to treat the recurrence, are eligible.

             • Patients who received platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive
             chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease, and developed recurrent
             (local or metastatic) disease within 6 months of completing therapy are eligible.

             Adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy (after surgery and/or radiation
             therapy) followed by recurrent or metastatic disease within 6 months of completing
             therapy is considered as first line therapy for advanced disease.

         10. A formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block (archival or recent) or
             a minimum of 15 unstained slides of tumor sample (slices must be recent and collected
             on slides provided by the sponsor) must be available for biomarker (PD-L1) evaluation.
             Biopsy should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is
             insufficient.

         11. Prior therapies and surgeries are allowed if completed 2 weeks (for minor surgery) or
             12 weeks (for palliative radiotherapy for bone pain), respectively prior to start of
             treatment and patient recovered from toxic effects.

         12. Subjects must have recovered from the effects of major surgery or significant
             traumatic injury at least 14 days before the first dose of study treatment.

         13. Adequate blood count, liver-enzymes, and renal function (obtained no later than 14
             days prior to start of treatment):

               -  WBC ≥ 2000/μL

               -  Neutrophils ≥ 1500/μL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x10^3/μL

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min (if using
                  the Cockcroft-Gault formula)

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN

               -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have
                  total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

         14. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30
             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last
             dose of nivolumab.

         15. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the
             start of nivolumab or radiotherapy.

         16. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31
             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous malignancy (other than NSCLC), which either progresses or requires active
             treatment. Subjects with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and
             the following in situ cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia,
             endometrial, melanoma, or breast) are excluded unless a complete remission was
             achieved at least 2 years prior to study entry AND no additional therapy is required
             or anticipated to be required during the study period.

          2. Brain metastases mandating active treatment in terms of WBI (whole brain irradiation).
             Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been treated and there
             is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for 12 weeks after
             treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab
             administration. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of
             systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks
             prior to study drug administration.

          3. Known activating EGFR mutation or a known ALK translocation.

          4. Prior therapy with anti-tumor vaccines or other immuno-stimulatory antitumor agents.

             antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T‑cell co-stimulation
             or immune checkpoint pathways

          7. All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue
             must have resolved to grade 1 (NCI CTCAE version 4) or baseline before administration
