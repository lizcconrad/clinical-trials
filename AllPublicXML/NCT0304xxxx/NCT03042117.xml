  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and the
      world. Many interventions relating to prevention have been emphasized as more risk factors
      for this devastating disease are discovered. Periodontal disease is known to have a close
      association with cardiovascular disease, but its role as a risk factor is still not well
      understood. Inflammation is a driving force in both of these diseases, creating a potential
      bridge between the two. Specifically, periodontal disease can cause an inflammatory reaction
      in the body, which may predispose or even directly contribute to atheroma formation in the
      coronary arteries. In this study, the investigators will study the link between the
      inflammatory state of the body and will search for a correlation with levels of coronary
      artery disease and periodontal disease. Inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and immunoglobulin G (IgG)
      levels in the patient's blood will be analyzed and correlated to clinical attachment loss
      measured via pocket depth measurement, the distance from the gingival margin to the base of
      the pocket. A definitive link between these disease processes will allow preventive measures
      to be taken earlier to prevent this lifelong disease.

      Dental probes will be used to probe depth of gum recession in subjects with and without a
      history of cardiac events. Venous blood samples will also be collected from all subjects for
      measurement of sedimentation rate, myeloperoxidase, and IgG levels. Statistical analysis will
      then be done, in attempt to identify a difference in gum recession depth and/or serum
      inflammatory markers among those with and without prior cardiac events.
