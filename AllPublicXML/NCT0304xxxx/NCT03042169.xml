  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the late onset of symptoms, gastric cancer is frequently diagnosed at an advanced
      stage and therefore in an incurable situation.

      Standard treatment for these patients is palliative chemotherapy, combining 2 or 3 drugs
      (Wagner et al) However chemotherapy efficacy remains insufficient, while exposing patients to
      severe toxicity.

      Taking into account the low complication rates of gastric surgery today, chemotherapy alone
      therefore may not be sufficient for stage IV gastric cancer patients.

      The purpose of palliative gastrectomy is to relieve the symptoms associated with cancer, to
      prevent subsequent tumour complications which are likely to occur, and to improve quality of
      life. In addition reducing the tumour burden, may be associated with a prolonged survival
      time.

      This study is designed as a multicentre trial. Patients with diagnosis of a primary stage IV
      gastric adenocarcinoma who are willing to participate in the trial will be randomized to the
      surgical (gastric resection with peri-operative chemotherapy) or the control (chemotherapy
      only) group.

      Primary objective will be overall survival and secondary objectives will be quality of life,
      progression free survival, surgical related postoperative morbidity and mortality,
      chemotherapy related toxicities, overall duration of hospitalization and number of
      interventional palliative procedures
