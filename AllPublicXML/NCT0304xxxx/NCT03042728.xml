  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1.5 day</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQR questionnaire consists of 21 questions in 3 domains. Each question has 11 boxes similar to a visual analog scale, rating the item from no difficulty to very difficult. To score the FIQR, the researcher must sum the answers for each domain. Then the function domain is divided by 3, the overall impact domain remains unchanged, and the symptom domain score is divided by 2. The resulting scores are added, and final score can range from 0 -100, with 0=no difficulty, and 100=great difficulty.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity Score (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS))</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1.5 day</time_frame>
    <description>The subject is asked to make three pain ratings corresponding to the current, best, and worst pain experienced over the past 24 hours. The average of the 3 ratings is used to represent the patient's level of pain over the previous 24 hours. The NRS scale consists of numbers 0 through 10, with 0=no pain, 1-3=mild pain, 4-6=moderate pain, and 7-10=severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score for Fatigue, Anxiety, and Depression</measure>

    <description>The subject is asked to rate their symptoms on a visual analog scale from 1-10, with 1=not at all, and 10=unbearable.</description>
