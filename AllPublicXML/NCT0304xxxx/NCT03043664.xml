      This study is for patients with non-resectable, recurrent, or metastatic well or moderately
      differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).

      The study will be conducted in two stages: 1) Safety Run-In and 2) Expanded Cohort.

        1. Safety run-in: The first stage will include a safety run-in of 6 patients treated with
           pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks and lanreotide depot 90mg
           subcutaneous (SQ) every 3 weeks. Up to 6 patients at the Duke Cancer Institute will be
           accrued at the starting dose level. If one or less subject meets treatment-related
           discontinuation criteria (as specified in the protocol) during Cycle 1, then the study
           will proceed to the second stage, Expanded Cohort.

        2. Expanded Cohort: Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks and
           lanreotide depot 90mg SQ every 3 weeks as determined by the Safety Run-In Cohort.

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         14. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating physician.

         15. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial.

         16. Pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of study drug.

         17. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         18. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         19. Known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         20. Live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study drug regimen. Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are
             not allowed.
