  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and disability associated with discogenic low back pain are significant, and
      there is a general lack of widely accepted conservative treatments for the condition. A
      majority of previous studies that have assessed the efficacy of self-directed exercise-based
      rehabilitation programs did not include comprehensive metrics to confirm whether participants
      actually participated in the exercises prescribed. In this pilot study, the investigators
      hope to determine whether proxies of compliance with a daily, self-directed rehabilitation
      program for discogenic low back pain are correlated with participant-reported improvements in
      pain and function. The feasibility of a mobile interface designed to help patients with
      chronic low back pain track the daily management of their conditions will also be evaluated.
