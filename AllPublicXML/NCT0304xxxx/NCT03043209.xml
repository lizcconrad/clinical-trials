  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to use comparative exome and/or genome sequencing to discover causative
      molecular lesions for phenotypes hypothesized to be caused by somatic mutations. For this
      study, investigators have targeted hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that sporadic or simplex occurrences of what are typically autosomal
      dominantly inherited diseases can instead be caused my mosaic mutations, specifically,
      mutations in the heart itself.

      This hypothesis mandates that investigators sequence both affected and unaffected tissues,
      which in this case, investigators will construe to be peripheral blood DNA and discarded
      myocardium from cardiac procedures.

      Eligible individuals will first undergo informed consent to be part of the study prior to
      their scheduled myomectomy. The study participants will also have phlebotomy for research
      samples.

      The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) will perform paired exome or genome sequencing
      and we will first screen for germline mutations in known cardiomyopathy genes that meet ACMG
      standards of likely pathogenic or pathogenic.

      Then, if this is negative, investigators will screen for sequence variants that are present
      in cardiac tissue but absent in the blood DNA. Investigators will also screen blood DNA for
      secondary findings in genes recommended for annotation and results return by the ACMG and
      sequence variants deemed clinically relevant in this gene set will be validated in a
      CLIA-certified laboratory and the results returned to that participant.
