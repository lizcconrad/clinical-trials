               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 3x upper normal limit (ULN) (biliary drainage is allowed
                  for biliary obstruction; elevated bilirubin should be caused by obstruction not
                  impaired liver function as assessed by albumin and INR values):

               -  Albumin levels ≥ 3.0 g/dL

               -  Patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation must have an INR &lt; 1.5 ULN and

                  anticoagulants is allowed as long as the INR or PTT is within therapeutic limits
                  (according to the medical standard in the institution) and the patient has been
                  on a stable dose for anticoagulants for at least three weeks at the time of

             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to start of treatment.

          9. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol (including contraceptive
             measures) for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled
             visits and examinations including follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active CNS metastases (indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral oedema, steroid
             requirement, or progressive disease); patient should have been off steroids for at
             least 28 days prior to starting study therapy

             occlusion, or diarrhoea &gt; grade 1

          3. History of any second malignancy in the last 5 years; subjects with prior history of
             in-situ cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible. Subjects with other

          4. Active uncontrolled infection, chronic infectious diseases, immune deficiency
             syndromes or an unexplained fever &gt; 38.5°C during screening visits or on the first
             scheduled day of dosing (at the discretion of the investigator, patients with tumour
             fever may be enrolled), which in the investigator's opinion might compromise the
             patient's participation in the trial or affect the study outcome.

         14. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control
             (failure rate of less than 1% per year). [Acceptable methods of contraception
             are:implants, injectable contraceptives, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine
             pessaries (only hormonal devices), sexual abstinence or vasectomy of the partner].

         15. Known Gilbert-Meulengracht syndrome

         16. Any condition or comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere
             with evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study
             results

         17. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the
             last 30 days before inclusion or 5 half-lifes of previously used trial medication,
             whichever is of longer duration.

             failure).

         19. Previous enrollment in the NIFE trial [AIO-YMO/HEP-0315]

         20. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both Baxalta staff
             and/or staff of sponsor and study site)

         21. Patient who might be dependent on the sponsor, site or the investigator

             by the authorities § 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 4 AMG.

         23. Patients who are unable to consent because they do not understand the nature,
             significance and implications of the clinical trial and therefore cannot form a
             rational intention in the light of the facts [§ 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 3a AMG].
