      This is a Phase 3, single-arm, multicenter OLE study designed to investigate the long-term
      safety and efficacy of 150 mg risankizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic
      plaque psoriasis. Approximately 2000 subjects who meet the entry criteria are planned to be
      enrolled in this study, rolling over from the preceding Phase 2/3 studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, who have
             completed one of the preceding studies.

          -  Subjects must be candidates for prolonged open label risankizumab treatment according
             to investigator judgment.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at
             Baseline.

        If female, subject must be either postmenopausal, OR permanently surgically sterile OR for
        women of childbearing potential practicing at least one protocol specified method of birth
        control, starting at Baseline through at least 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

        - Subjects must have signed and dated a written informed consent in accordance with Good
        Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation prior to admission into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Premature discontinuation for any reason in the preceding study.

          -  Subjects who have developed guttate, erythrodermic, pustular or drug-induced psoriasis
             as diagnosed by the investigator during the preceding study.

          -  Use of any prohibited medication or any drug considered likely to interfere with the
             safe conduct of the study, as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Known tuberculosis (TB) or evidence of TB infection. Subjects with a positive
             QuantiFERON® TB test or a positive purified protein derivate (PPD) skin test result
             may participate in the study if further work up (according to local
             practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the subject has no evidence of
             active TB.

          -  Subjects who have developed active or suspected malignancy during the preceding study,
             except appropriately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in
             situ carcinoma of uterine cervix.

          -  Subjects who have laboratory evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis
             B or hepatitis C viral infection from laboratory testing within the preceding clinical
             trial or any other source.

          -  Evidence of a current or previous disease, medical condition (including chronic
             alcohol or drug abuse) other than psoriasis, surgical procedure (i.e., organ
             transplant), medical examination finding (including vital signs and ECG), or
             laboratory value outside the reference range that in the opinion of the investigator
             is clinically significant and would make the study participant unreliable to adhere to
             the protocol or to complete the study, compromise the safety of the subject, or
             compromise the quality of the data.

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity to a systemically administered biologic agent or
             its excipients.

          -  Previous enrollment in this study.

          -  Female subject who is pregnant, breastfeeding or is considering becoming pregnant
             during the study or within 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Time elapsed is &gt; 8 weeks since the completion visit in the preceding study.

          -  Subject is considered by the investigator for any reason, to be an unsuitable
             candidate for the study and not able to comply with the study protocol.
