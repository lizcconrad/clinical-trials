      To establish the safety of radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced hidradenitis
      suppurativa. Patients will receive radiotherapy treatment over one week and then they will be
      followed for the next three months.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical trial using a Simon-two stage design to establish the safety of
      radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). In the first six
      months, 6 patients will be enrolled, if the patients in the study do not meet the termination
      criteria, then the study will extend to a second stage. A maximum of 20 patients will be
      enrolled. Patients will be treated with skin-directed radiotherapy, using a total
      prescription dose of 7.5 Gy in five fractions of 1.5 Gy over one week. Patients will then be
      seen in the HS specialty clinic at Montefiore Medial Center for at least three months.
      Quality of life changes, immunohistochemical changes, and cutaneous discharge will also be
      evaluated during the study period.
