      Brief summary :

      Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is an optic neuropathy due to acute
      or subacute ischemic event of anterior optic nerve axons retrolaminar part that was
      vascularized by posterior ciliary brevis artery. The incidence of ischemia will be followed
      by axonal edema and causing compartment syndrome and heighten the incidence of ischemic.

      In NAION, the main pathology occurs at the level of the optical nerve, the axons of retinal
      ganglion cells. Initial damage is on the optic disc ischemia resulting hypoxic injury of
      axons and manifest as disc edema. Axonal edema cause disturbances of retrograde axonal
      transport of neurotrophic factors, especially brain derived neurotrophic factor, to the
      retinal ganglion cells. This will trigger a secondary toxicity and apoptosis. In addition,
      the presence of oxidative stress, calcium influx and mitochondrial damage will also triggers
      apoptosis. After the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells, there was a thinning of the retinal
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) through Wallerian degeneration. Thinning of the RNFL will manifest
      as visual field defects and the decline in visual acuity in patients with chronic phase
      NAION.

      Though NAION include disease entity that has long existed, but until now, there has been no
      evidence-based study on medical or surgical procedures that is effective enough to overcome
      NAION. The main treatment is to manage the risk factor such as hypertension, dyslipidemia,
      diabetes mellitus, hypercoagulable state. In general, if the patient is in the acute phase
      (edema of optic nerve head), methylprednisolone administration may be considered, but if the
      patient is already on chronic phase (atrophy disc) which generally occurs 6-11 weeks after
      the onset, then steroids are no longer indicated. Neuroprotective agent was considered as
      treatment in NAION given primary pathology NAION is the retinal ganglion cell axons. Among
      the various neuroprotective substance, Citidine diphosphocoline (CDP-choline
      5'-diphosphocholine or Citicoline) is a therapeutic option NAION.

      Citicoline is an endogenous mononucleotide consisting of ribose, cytosine, pyrophosphate, and
      choline. Citicoline is a component intermediates in the synthesis of phospholipids in cell
      membranes, ie phosphatidylcholine. Exogenous citicoline administered orally or intravenously,
      will be split into citidine and choline. Citicoline via oral administration can be absorbed
      completely and have a similar bioavailability in the blood compared to parenteral
      administration such as intravenous. Once absorbed, citicoline will be distributed throughout
      the body and enter the blood-brain barrier and the blood retinal barrier penetrate into the
      central nervous system. If there is damage to neurons, exogenous citicoline will participate
      in the synthesis of phospholipids in the neuronal cell membrane. Some studies show that
      citicoline may have a neuroprotective effect on retinal ganglion cells and supporting
      regeneration of damaged neurons in vitro. Previous research on the citicoline effect in
      chronic phase NAION give satisfactory results. Dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems known to
      occur in vast numbers in the retina and post-retinal visual pathway. Retinal ganglion cells
      using certain subtypes of dopamine as a means of communication with the visual cortex. Rejdak
      et al in animal models showed that citicoline administration could improve and strengthen the
      dopamine transmission in the retina. Citicoline also a safe medicine, without serious adverse
      effect.

      Electroretinogram (ERG) is a tool to measure the function of the retina. ERG examination can
      measure electrical changes in the retina after light stimulus. ERG examination that can
      detect changes in the activity of retinal ganglion cell is a pattern ERG. Spectral-domain
      optical coherence tomography is a tool that can measure the thickness of retinal ganglion
      cells.

      Thinning of the RNFL will manifest as visual field defects in patients with NAION. The
      typical visual field defects of NAION is altitudinal defects associated with segmental edema
      optic nerve head.

      Based on these descriptions question arises whether the citicoline supplementation can repair
      damage to the neurons of the retina, especially the retinal ganglion cells, in NAION
      resulting in improved retinal function which can be judged from the improvement of the value
      of the amplitude of the wave of P50 and N95 in the examination pattern ERG (PERG) when
      compared with placebo ? In addition whether citicoline supplementation can increase the
      thickness of retinal ganglion cells assessed using SD-OCT? Does citicoline supplementation
      give the effect of improving visual field defects in patients with NAION?

      of medicine Universitas Indonesia-RSCM Kirana and will be given further handling according
      the patient's condition and the researcher will decide whether the patient is still able to
      continue his research. The cost of treatment side effects will be borne by the researcher.
      Researchers also will ask the patient fill out a form and side effects of drugs.

           relative afferent pupillary defect (if unilateral), visual field abnormalities (LP) is
           consistent with NAION. The diagnosis of NAION have been confirmed by the ophtalomologist
           in charge in Neuro-ophthalmology Policlinic Faculty of medicine Universitas
           Indonesia-RSCM Kirana. The acute phase is onset &lt;6 weeks and found to have edema of

      Declaration of Helsinki and will be registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.

      Data analysis Data from the study will be recorded and incorporated into the primary table,
      then be processed with SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science) version 17.0. The
      analysis is intention to treat. If there is a violation of protocols such as the incidence of
      severe side-effects that provide interventions should be stopped or are lost to follow-up at
      least once a second measurement is done (after 30 days), the subject will be considered a
      failure but still included in the analysis. Patients were also said to drop out when during
      the administration of the intervention patients had symptoms of NAION in the contralateral
      eye and require steroid therapy but still included in the analysis had been carried out when
      at least a second measurement is done (after 30 days). Data will be presented in the form of
      tables and graphs. Data will be tested whether the distribution is spread evenly with
      normality test. Data were analyzed to compare the two averages in pairs using unpaired t-test
      or Mann Whitney test. Categorical data are presented in the form of proportions. Statistical
      test for difference in proportions between the two independent groups using chi-square test.
      Statistical tests to determine the correlation using Pearson or Spearman test.

    <description>visual field test results using Humphrey HFA II-i 750, 24-2 threshold. Examination is repeated by taking into account the confidence index that meets the three criteria below:
Fixation losses ≤ 20%
False positive ≤ 15%
False negative ≤ 20-30%
The parameters assessed are:
The mean deviation (MD): the result of the average sensitivity of the retina of patients compared with the normal population. This figure is obtained from the total deviation.
Pattern standard deviation (PSD): the result of the average sensitivity of the retina of patients who have adapted and showed a localized area index. This figure is obtained from the pattern deviation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged 20-65 years.

          2. NAION patients who have been diagnosed clinically by a minimum of 1 consultant
             Division NO with onset ≥6 weeks.

          3. Best corrected visual acuity ≥ 1/60 Snellen

          4. Patients have to get an explanation about the purpose of the research and all the
             procedures that will be undertaken and willing to participate in the study by signing

             moderate to severe (color and turbidity of the lens, the cortex and the posterior
             capsule with degrees LOCs III&gt; 3).

          2. Abnormalities in the macula and the optic disc due to causes other than NAION.
