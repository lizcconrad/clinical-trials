  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. By 2030, COPD is expected to be the fourth main cause of death.
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) represents not only a frequent complication but also a
      deadly cause in COPD patients. Inhaled corticosteroids, which are frequently used among COPD
      patients increase the risk for pneumonia. The effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13
      (PCV13) on the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia among COPD patients in Korean population
      has not been studied yet.

      Several factors such as multi-lobar pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, and high
      pneumonia severity are related to poor outcome of patients with COPD and pneumonia. Prior
      pneumococcal vaccine has a beneficial effect on outcomes of pneumonia with COPD patients.
      However, the effects of pneumococcal vaccine on the clinical outcome of COPD patients were
      evaluated mainly on 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23). The beneficial
      effects of PPV23 rapidly fade out after inoculation, which is more prominent in old age
      group. In this sense, PPV23 vaccine is not sufficient in preventing pneumococcal diseases in
      COPD patients because COPD is the disease of old ages and mortality rate increases
      exponentially with advancing age. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (PCV13) can overcome the
      waning phenomenon by the production of memory B cells. Although PCV13 is expected to be the
      best option for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia in COPD patients, there are few
      available studies supporting it.

      In this study, we will conduct prospective, multi-center trial with the collaboration of
      Korean pulmonologists in five university-affiliated hospitals. In this study, we will
      evaluate influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status, the pathogen distribution, pneumonia
      severity, and clinical outcomes of hospitalized pneumonia patients with COPD.

      If successfully accomplished, this study will enhance the awareness of the preventive use of
      PCV13 in COPD patients among Korean pulmonologists and, most importantly, it will lead to
      protection of more COPD patients from pneumococcal pneumonia, one of the most frequent and
      deadly complication.

      1. Objectives; Prospective evaluation of distribution of pathogens and its clinical
           characteristics in hospitalized pneumonia patients with COPD

        2. SUBJECTS AND CENTERS A. Subjects; COPD patients hospitalized for community-acquired
           pneumonia from Feb, 2017 to Feb, 2018.

           B. Centers; More than five university-affiliated hospitals of Korea

        3. OTHER THERAPY; Treatment for COPD with pneumonia will be done by the disposal of
           attending physicians of each hospital.

        4. STUDY DESIGN

           ; prospective, multi-center, cohort study

        5. STUDY ANALYSIS A. The required number of COPD patients hospitalized for
           community-acquired pneumonia

             -  The sample size calculations were based on detecting 1 point difference in CURB-65
                score between influenza/pneumococcal vaccine recipients and non-recipients
                (expecting the mean CURB-65 score of 3 points for influenza/pneumococcal vaccine
                recipients and 4 points for non-recipients), assuming a common standard deviation
                of 1 point in each group,* a two-tailed test at 5% type I error, and a desired
                power of 80%. In terms of PCV 13, the estimated sample size for an independent
                t-test is 90 when we expect that 10% of them were PCV13 recipients and the other
                90% were non-recipients (in Korea, 10% of candidates are estimated to be vaccinated
                with PCV13). Since the CURB-65 scores may not be symmetrically distributed, adding
                15% to the required number was considered for a non-parametric test and the desired
                number of patients with COPD and pneumococcal pneumonia is 104 for the analysis.
                Total 384 COPD patients admitted for community-acquired pneumonia will be enrolled,
                assuming 30% prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia among them (the prevalence of
                pneumococcal pneumonia is 25~45% in Korea), with allowance of 10% possible data
                loss.

           ; This is an observational study which evaluates the effects of previously inoculated
           influenza/pneumococcal vaccine. Treatment for pneumonia and COPD will be done by
           attending physician with their own disposal. In this setting there would not be ethical
           issues to be debated.

        7. DECISION POINTS/ STATISTICAL METHODS/INTERIM ANALYSIS

           ; The statistics will be purely descriptive. Continuous variables will be presented as
           mean ± SD or median value with minimum and maximum values. Categorical data will be
           presented as frequency and percentile. Intergroup comparison of continuous variables
           will be done with student T test and that of categorical data will be done with
           Chi-square test or with Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance will be determined
           at the 5% level. We will consider non-parametric equivalent tests if the distributional
           assumptions are not suitably made.
