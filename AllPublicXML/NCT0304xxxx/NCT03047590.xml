    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate adherence to four types of walking programs. Participants will be
      randomized to walking programs that included either (1) affect-based exercise intensity, (2)
      self-selected (or &quot;choice-based&quot;) exercise intensity, (3) heart-rate based exercise
      intensity, or (4) heart-rate guided exercise intensity with the emphasis on affective
      benefits.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if an &quot;affect-based&quot; or &quot;choice-based&quot; exercise
      prescription is more effective for behavior change than a traditional, &quot;moderate-intensity&quot;
      exercise prescription. Prior research suggests that &quot;choice-based&quot; or &quot;self-selected&quot;
      exercise intensity is more pleasant and adhered to than &quot;moderate-intensity exercise&quot;
      (Williams et al., 2014). Similarly, affect-based exercise prescriptions (i.e., an exercise
      prescription where intensity is regulated based on the pleasure-displeasure one feels while
      exercising) appear to have merit (Baldwin, Kangas, Denman, Smits, Yamada, &amp; Otto, 2016).

      However, choice-based and affect-based exercise prescriptions have not been compared to each
      other. Further, it is unknown if it is the intensity regulation that matters (e.g., &quot;choose
      an intensity that feels good&quot; or the focus on affect (e.g., &quot;focus on feeling good). Third,
      prior research has not objectively measured physical activity behavior.
