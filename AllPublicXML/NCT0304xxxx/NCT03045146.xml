      FRench Acute cerebral multimodal imaging to select patient for MEchanical thrombectomy is a
      prospective multi-center study to determine if multimodal imaging could identify patients who
      may and those who may not benefit from an endovascular clot removal procedure within 6 hours
      after stroke onset.

    <textblock>
      Emergent cerebral artery recanalization by thrombectomy within 6 hours after symptom onset is
      n the standard of care of an acute hemispheric infarction with a documented proximal internal
      carotid artery and/middle cerebral artery occlusion. The success of vessel revascularization
      is mostly related to the emergent reperfusion of the ischemic penumbra. Multimodal brain
      imaging can identify the amount of salvageable penumbra. The indirect comparison of the
      recently published randomized trials suggests that despite common baseline clinical
      characteristics, (vessel site occlusion, delay and type of treatment), the success of
      thrombectomy was higher in studies enrolling exclusively patients exhibiting a significant
      amount of penumbra defined by a target mismatch (TMM) on CTP or MRI by comparison with those
      enrolling patients based on non contrast CT scan without specific imaging criteria. As the
      prevalence of TMM has not been systematically evaluated in those trials, as TMM definition
      differs according to the studies and as there has been no prospective estimation of the
      impact of the prevalence of TMM on baseline imaging assessed blindly of clinical outcome,
      there is currently no demonstration that mechanical thrombectomy has to be limited to the
      subgroup of patients based on imaging criteria. With this as a background, we aim to
      investigate in a prospective cohort of patients treated by thrombectomy according to the
      current recommendations, the relationship between the prevalence of TMM on pretreatment brain
      imaging with the rate of clinical recovery after thrombectomy. MR DWI, perfusion and CTP maps
      processed by RAPID software will not be as usual pushed back to the PACS but anonymized and
      saved on a remote software leaving the investigator blinded at the time of treatment
      decision. We hope to learn whether MR or CTP can help to define an imaging profile to select
      the subgroup of patients that will benefit from thrombectomy.
