  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize circulating DC subsets from healthy controls and IBD patients and to assess,
      following an ex vivo challenge, the effect of anti-TNF (infliximab, adalimumab and
      golimumab), anti-p40 -IL-12/IL-23- (ustekinumab) and anti-α4β7 (vedolizumab) immunomodulators
      on both the GI production of soluble immune mediators and the mucosal capacity to alter the
      recruitment capacity of circulating DC subsets. It is expected that such approach will
      provide further information on the action mechanisms of such therapies on IBD patients,
      allowing a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease and the identification
      of tissue-specific therapeutic targets, thus avoiding collateral problems associated with
      systemic immunomodulation.

Here, we will address whether the current available biological therapies for IBD patients (infliximab, golimumab, adalimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab) elicit a differential effect on the mucosal capacity to recruit circulating leukocytes on an ex-vivo approach using transwell culture systems.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with active IBD, and endoscopic and histological diagnosis of CD or UC that attend
        a colonoscopy with sedation performed by medical criteria.

        Patients without an IBD diagnosis, or other types of inflammatory, allergic, malignant or
        autoimmune diseases, prior to their inclusion in this project. All patients will attend a
        colonoscopy with sedation at medical judgment with biopsy indication for histopathological
        study as in cases of diarrhea but also due to changes in the bowel transit, rectal bleeding
        or screening for gastrointestinal diseases. Patients will be paired in age and gender with
        the IBD groups. All patients will have no signs of macroscopic or microscopic inflammation
        hence excluding the presence of microscopic colitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 18 years

          2. Chronic disease or any other advanced clinically significant pathology, uncontrolled
             by investigator judgment.

          3. Should be with medication, this will be unchanged in the 3 months prior to
             colonoscopy.

          4. Alcohol or drugs.

          5. Pregnancy or lactation

          6. Do not sign the informed consent form (see &quot;Ethical Issues&quot;) In any case NO
             colonoscopies exclusively targeted for sampling for this project will be made
