  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this this investigation, 15 subjects with a high probability of cardiac sarcoidosis based
      on clinical criteria and abnormal cardiac FDG uptake on initial, clinically indicted FDG PET
      study will be considered for this study. The study will test the following Aims:

      Aim 1. Effect of FDG incubation time on visual and quantitative interpretation of FDG uptake.

      Changes in incubation time can affect imaging target:background ratios and study
      sensitivity/specificity. For the study-directed exam, all patients will undergo sequential
      cardiacfocused FDG-PET imaging at 90 and 120 minutes after injection of FDG. Imaging
      variables will be evaluated as below.

      Aim 2. Reproducibility of FDG and Rb82 PET findings on sequential imaging. It is unknown
      whether FDG-positive imaging findings in cardiac sarcoidosis are reproducible. All patients
      will undergo study-directed FDG-PET/CT with MPI imaging within approximately 2 weeks from
      initial clinical scan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating
      granulomatous inflammation. The pathophysiologic features of cardiac sarcoidosis include
      macrophage-induced, T-cell mediated non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, followed by
      myocardial scarring/fibrosis with clinical sequelae including arrhythmias, conduction
      abnormalities, and contractile dysfunction. These lead to high event rates in patients with
      cardiac sarcoidosis, with several studies reporting a prevalence of ventricular tachycardia
      ranging from 23% to 38% and an ~ 20% rate of clinical congestive heart failure.

      FDG-PET/CT with Rb82 myocardial perfusion imaging (FDG-PET with MPI) is becoming the gold
      standard imaging technique for evaluating the degree of inflammation and the response to
      immunosuppressive treatment in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. FDG PET imaging allows for
      evaluation of inflammatory macrophage infiltration, while Rb82 MPI allows for determination
      of myocardial scar burden. Despite emerging data from our center and others on the clinical
      utility of this technique in predicting prognosis, there is little consensus on the
      reproducibility of this technique or optimal imaging acquisition techniques and
      interpretative strategies.

      In this study, patients with a high clinical likelihood of cardiac sarcoidosis will undergo a
      study-directed FDG PET/CT with Rb82 myocardial perfusion imaging study approximately 2 weeks
      following an initial clinically-directed examination.

      The two FDG PET with MPI examinations will be examined for reproducibility of imaging
      findings, including: SUVmax, SUVmean, distribution of FDG uptake, extra cardiac FDG uptake,
      SUVvolume, SUVvolume:intensity, perfusion defect size/severity/location, LV ejection
      fraction, myocardial blood flow.

      Strict attention will be paid to ensure patients undergo the same metabolic preparation prior
      to the two examinations.

    <description>A 18-20 gauge catheter equipped with a 3-way stopcock will be inserted preferably in the antecubital vein. Cardiac FDG-PET imaging will be performed on the YNHH GE Discovery ST PET/CT scanner following a high fat/low carbohydrate diet and a prolonged fast as is current clinical protocol. Resting ECG-gated dynamic Rb-82 PET imaging will be performed using 20-30 mCi of Rb82 as per YNHH clinical imaging protocol and established clinical guidelines. FDG-PET imaging will be performed following a high fat/low carbohydrate diet (instructions provided to patient) and a fast of greater than 12 hours. The patient will be injected with the same dose of FDG (8-10mCi) as they received for their index clinical examination. Cardiac FDG imaging will be performed using a single 3D acquisition over the heart. Low-dose CT images (120 kV, 50-150 mA based on BMI) for the purposes of attenuation correction will be performed before Rb82 and FDG imaging sequences.</description>
