  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common tumor and the second leading cause of death in the
      Western world. The decrease in incidence and mortality by CRC in the population undergoing
      screening has been observed. Colonoscopy is the recommended method for detecting tumors in
      early stages, as well as identifying and resecting adenomatous polyps, which are the
      precursor lesions of most CRCs. Colonoscopy should be of high quality to decrease incidence
      and mortality by CRC and avoid interval cancer. The literature shows that colonoscopy does
      not prevent right colon lesions in the same way as the left colon lesions, with most of the
      interval cancers located in the right colon. Studies published so far show an increase in the
      adenomas detection rate (ADT) in the right colon in a second visualization of this segment
      and an increase between 2 and 10% if this second examination is performed with the proximal
      retroflexion maneuver .Retroflexion is a safe maneuver in expert endoscopists. The aim of our
      study is to evaluate the ADT in right colon by means of a second visualization by performing
      proximal retroflexion or second frontal visualization at random in the CCR screening
      population.
