  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective registry of atrial fibrillation cryoablation in the Russian Federation.
      This study is observational, prospective, multicenter, open-label
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Registry is to describe characteristics of patients undergoing
      cryoballoon ablation, diversity of cryoablation techniques among different centers; to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of the procedure in the centers with different levels of
      experience.
