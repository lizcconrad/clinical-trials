  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is defined by characteristic motor symptoms including slow
      movements, small movements, difficulty with movement initiation and disruptions in timing.
      Besides gross motor symptoms, fine motor impairments in PD cause difficulties with everyday
      tasks such as writing, self-care, and fine object manipulation. These activity limitations
      can lead to disability, social isolation, and a reduced quality of life. In a series of
      breakthrough studies Michael Thaut and colleagues developed Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT)
      and found it can address many gross motor impairments and improve gait and balance. The
      underlying idea is that rhythm is the essential component relating music specifically to
      motor behavior. The mechanism of action is called &quot;rhythmic entrainment&quot; where one system's
      motion or signal frequency entrains the frequency of another system. The effect of NMT on
      fine motor function has not been investigated yet. Music activities are important in the
      lives of many older adults. Notably, the use of music has been associated with increased
      well-being for older adults, as it fosters social connection and mood regulation.
      Furthermore, many musical activities have limited physical demands, making them attainable
      for individuals who are living with mobility impairments or other physical restrictions.
      Based on the literature and the investigators preliminary studies, the investigators propose
      to test the efficacy of Neurologic Music Therapy in comparison to Occupational Therapy (OT)
      as standards of care on adults in the Parkinson's spectrum. The investigators have defined a
      working plan using different musical instruments and growing tempo to specifically improve
      fine motor movements.
