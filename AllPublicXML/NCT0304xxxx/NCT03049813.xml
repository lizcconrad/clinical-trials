  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the community-based effectiveness of
      virtual reality job interview training (VR-JIT). Northwestern University is partnering with
      Thresholds Inc. to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-JIT at improving interviewing skills and
      access to employment. In addition, we will evaluate the cost effectiveness of VR-JIT and the
      process for implementing VR-JIT at Thresholds.
