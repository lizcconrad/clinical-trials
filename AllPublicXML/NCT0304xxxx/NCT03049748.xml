      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of VAD Care App in an out-patient mechanical
      circulatory support program. The specific aim for this pilot study is to obtain preliminary
      efficacy data of the VAD Care App as a self-management tool for patients with long-term
      LVADs. A randomized control trial will be employed to establish preliminary estimates of the
      effects of the App on the following outcomes: (1) patients' and caregivers' self-efficacy and
      (2) adherence to the LVAD care regimen; (3) LVAD-related complications and health care
      utilization [e.g., hospital re-admission]; and (4) the patients' overall health status and
      (5) quality of life. The duration of the study is 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 250,000 of 5.8 million Americans are suffering from an advanced or end-stage heart
      failure. Generally, these individuals require a heart transplant or a mechanical circulatory
      support such as a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD). LVAD is implanted to liberate
      patients from crippling symptoms of heart failure, or in some cases avert imminent death.
      However, maintaining health and improving quality of life (QOL) depend on a &quot;trouble-free&quot;
      LVAD. Despite the refinement in circulatory support technology, many patients and their
      family caregivers still face challenges in managing the LVAD in home settings. The LVAD
      home-care regimen comprise of complex technical and non-technical tasks and procedures that
      must be implemented frequently and consistently. During the first 6 months following hospital
      discharge, patients/caregivers generally exhibit low levels of confidence (i.e.,
      self-efficacy) in managing the tasks/procedures. This problem appears to contribute to low
      adherence to the regimen and poor outcomes. The current self-management processes include
      provision of instructional manuals and logs for vital signs, LVAD parameters, etc. To address
      this problem, the research team developed a mobile phone VAD Care App as a self-management
      tool. The app will aid and may ease patients/caregivers' problems in managing the complexity
      of the home-care regimen. The app offers patients/caregivers with (a) daily reminders about
      the tasks/procedures to be performed, (b) videoconferencing feature to communicate with
      healthcare providers about LVAD and health issues, and (c) on-line LVAD training/education.
      The prototype of the app was tested by 16 patients and caregivers. Results included ease of
      use and high acceptability and competency rates among users.The specific aim for the present
      study is to obtain preliminary efficacy data of the care app as self-management tool in
      patients with a long-term LVAD. This study will employ a randomized control trial to
      establish preliminary estimates of the effects of the care app on the following: (1) the
      patients and caregivers' self-efficacy and (2) adherence to the LVAD home-care regimen; (3)
      LVAD-related complications and healthcare utilizations; and (4) patients' overall health
      status and (5) QOL. A total of 40 patient-caregiver dyads will be recruited. There will be 20
      patients/caregivers allocated in the control (usual care) and experimental (usual care + VAD
      Care App) groups. Data collection will be performed during pre-hospital discharge (baseline)
      and at 1, 3 and 6 months post discharge using self-administered questionnaires, chart
      reviews, interviews, and retrieval of historical data of the care app. Descriptive and
      inferential statistical procedures will be employed for data analysis. The outcome of this
      pilot will inform the next stages of investigations that are crucial for transforming LVAD
      self-management processes and improving outcomes.

All data will be de-identified. Persons interested in using the data will need to submit a request in writing, stating their intended use. Data will be made available at cost. Requirements for sharing will include acknowledgement in all publications of the funding source and of the study authors. Data sets will be accompanied by a data dictionary for all study variables, both derived and raw data. We will consider the most cost-effective means for sharing data after a data-sharing agreement has been reached. For example, data may be copied to a CD or DVD, be posted on a password protected and secure web site, or made available through a third party data archive service. We will also share research findings through publications and presentations at scholarly research meetings.</ipd_description>
