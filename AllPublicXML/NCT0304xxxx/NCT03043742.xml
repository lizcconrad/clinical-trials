      Assess the safety and effectiveness of stem cell application with regard to improvement in
      regional myocardial function in patients receiving Trans-Myocardial Laser Revascularization
      (TMR) and stem cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple case experiences and studies have been published reviewing clinical experiences with
      Carbon Dioxide Trans-Myocardial Laser Revascularization (TMR) and autologous bone marrow
      derived cell application. These experiences have demonstrated perfusion improvements,
      ejection fraction improvements and improvements in angina or heart failure symptoms. The
      investigators elected to examine the use of CD133 positive (CD133+) BM-derived stem cells
      because of their pluripotent nature and the fact that during the CD133 selection process
      inflammatory cells present in the bone marrow are being discarded. CD133+ is a recently
      discovered marker for more primitive bone marrow derived multipotent stem and endothelial
      progenitor cells and is of particular interest in studies directed to therapeutic
      angiogenesis, as these cells have been shown to differentiate into endothelial and myogenic
      cell lines. Multiple studies have utilized BM derived cells for myocardial regeneration.
      Patients who received CD133+ cells showed improved perfusion at injection sites of stem cells
      leading to a significant increase in volume of left ventricular ejection fraction, regional
      wall motion in the infarct zone, and a reduction in end systolic left ventricular volume.
