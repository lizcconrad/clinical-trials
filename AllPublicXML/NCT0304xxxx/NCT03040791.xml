  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate Cancer (PC) is the most frequent cancer in men, accounting for 21% of new cases of
      cancer in men in the United States. Among the four most incident tumors (breast, lung and
      colorectal cancer); prostate cancer is the only that does not have any predictive biomarker
      to guide the treatment. Even though the molecular heterogeneity of PC is well-documented,
      treatment has not been molecularly stratified and the need for genetic prognostic and
      predictive markers is critical.

      DNA repair defects (DRD), mainly in the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway (such as BRCA1,
      BRCA2, ATM and CHEK2) are emerging as potential biomarkers in prostate cancer. It is well
      known BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers have better Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall
      Survival (OS) than non-carriers in ovarian cancer. Differently than ovarian tumors that BRCA
      mutations provides a good prognosis, PC patients who harbor HR defects have a higher Gleason
      score 6, an increased risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. The predictive role of DRD in PC
      was demonstrated in a recent trial using Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, in DRD carriers. This
      trial showed 88% of response rate with Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor that acts in HR pathway by
      synthetic lethality.

      Recent data demonstrated important association between HR deficient high-grade serous ovarian
      cancer (HGSOC), high neoantigen load and high expression of PD-1/PD-L1 compared with HR
      proficient HGSOCs 10. This study showed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations increase the number of
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and confer a better prognosis. The unprecedented
      success of immunotherapy in malignant disorders has provided evidence that the patient's
      immune system can be improved to attack established tumors, mainly melanoma, non-small cell
      lung cancer and kidney cancer. A high mutational burden increases the likelihood of the
      development of specific neoepitopes that would confer clinical benefit from CTLA-4 and PD-1
      blockade.

      These data showed that specific DNA repair defects increase the mutational burden, the
      expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and TILs; and could improve the response to immunotherapy in cancer.
      This rationale was already tested in a trial that evaluated the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor
      Pembrolizumab in mismatch-repair deficient patients, a kind of DNA repair defect by
      definition. This important trial showed that this DRD predicted clinical benefit of immune
      checkpoint blockade in many types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer.

      This is a Phase II, two-stage, multi-center, single-arm, and open-label trial of Nivolumab
      (BMS-936558) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who
      have progressed to a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen previously. Eligible patients must
      have ECOG 0-2 and material for biomarker analysis. Prior enzalutamide, abiraterone and
      cabazitaxel are permitted but not necessary to enrollment. The germline and somatic DRD
      (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PTEN, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD51D, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2.) will be
      assessed by T-NGS of metastatic sites or by liquid biopsy. The primary endpoint is PSA 50
      response rate (PSA50, following the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria). The trial will
      meet its endpoint if ≥ 3/29 men achieve a PSA50 response. The secondary endpoints will
      include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, radiologic PFS, PSA response rate
      at 6 and 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with tumor tissue available
             for molecular analyses. If archival tissue for biomarker analysis is not available
             then the patient must be willing to have a further biopsy to obtain tumor tissue for
             histological diagnosis.

          2. Metastatic Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), defined by:

               -  Disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and may present as
                  either a continuous rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, the
                  progression of pre-existing disease, and/or the appearance of new metastases.

               -  Surgically or medically castrated, with testosterone levels of &lt; 50 ng/dL (&lt; 2.0
                  nM). If the patient is being treated with GnRH or LHRH agonists or antagonists
                  (patient who have not undergone orchiectomy), this therapy should be maintained.

          3. Documented prostate cancer progression, during treatment with Docetaxel, as assessed
             by the investigator with one of the following:

               -  PSA progression is defined according the PCWG3 criteria: PSA increase, that is ≥
                  50% and ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value ≥ 3
                  weeks later (confirmed the rising trend).

               -  Radiographic progression of visceral lesions or soft tissue disease by modified
                  RECIST 1.1 criteria.

                  results by other imaging modalities (eg, CT or MRI) is obligatory. If Docetaxel
                  chemotherapy is used more than once, this will be considered as one regimen.

             to start study treatment.

          8. For hormonal treatment must be followed the guideline below:

               -  No antiandrogens are allowed during the study period. The use of antiandrogens
                  before study entry is permitted, but at least 28 days since the completion of
                  prior antiandrogen are required (washout period).

                  completion of prior corticotherapy are required (washout period).

          9. Agreeable to have all the biomarker studies including the fresh tumor biopsies if
             needed.
