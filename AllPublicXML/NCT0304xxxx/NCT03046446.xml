      This is an Open-label Study to Assess the Safety of Repeat Dose of FX006 Administered to
      Patients with Osteoarthritis of the Knee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, repeat administration design of 32 mg FX006. The study will be
      conducted in male and female patients ≥ 40 years of age with symptomatic OA of the knee.

      Eligible patients will be offered participation to receive an initial IA injection of FX006
      administered to the index knee at Day 1.

      Patients who receive an initial injection of FX006 will return at Weeks 4 and 8 before being
      evaluated at 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks for repeat administration. At the first evaluation where
      the patient has been determined to meet repeat administration eligibility criteria, the
      patient will be eligible to receive a second IA injection of FX006.

      Patients who are eligible to receive a second injection will be evaluated for a total of 52
      weeks post initial injection at: Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52,
      regardless of the time at which they receive their second injection. In addition, X-rays will
      be completed at Screening and Week 52 for assessment of safety.

      Patients that do not benefit from the initial treatment as determined by evaluation at Week
      12 will complete the study at the Week 12 follow-up visit.

      Patients who are not eligible for a second injection of FX006 after evaluation at Weeks 12,
      16, 20, and 24 will complete the study at the Week 24 follow-up visit.
