  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, monocenter, single arm, phase II trial in 33 patients with
      unresectable MPM, who experience disease progression or recurrence after at least one
      previous line of platinum-based systemic treatment.

      Nivolumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 240 mg every 2 week. Nivolumab will be
      given in combination with ipilimumab on week 1, 7, 13 and 19 and will be administered prior
      to the infusion of ipilimumab. Ipilimumab will be administered at the dose of 1 mg/Kg.The
      patients will receive nivolumab monotherapy on week 3, 5, 9, 11, 15 and 17. From week 21
      thereafter, Nivolumab will be then administered every 2 weeks for a maximum period of 2 years
      or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
