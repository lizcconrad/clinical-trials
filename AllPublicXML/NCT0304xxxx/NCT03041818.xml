  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop healing riding algorithm applicable in rural riding
      centers and to apply this to children with cerebral palsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Horseback riding activities in Korea's riding centers have mostly centered on physical
      rehabilitation for children with special needs, including those with cerebral palsy, mental
      disabilities, and autism, with the program conducted by certified equine-assisted therapy
      instructors. However, there is no definite way to assess the ability of children for
      horseback riding and no standard riding program. Therefore, developing a assessment and
      program algorithm for healing horseback riding is expected to contribute to providing more
      activities for children with special needs and also for general people.

      Children older than 4 years old or adolescent with cerebral palsy who voluntarily want to
      enroll this study would be enrolled.

      Participants have 2 times of 30-minute horse riding program for 8 weeks, total 16 times of
      riding program in a local horse riding center.

      Sample size assessment: Calculating for 20% of drop out, 16 patients were calculated to apply
      the assessment and applicable program.

      Drop out: missing more than 2 lessons of horse-riding

      Plan for missing data: not included

      Statistical analysis plan: paired t-test for the outcome measures
