  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter controlled intervention study that aims to assess the efficacy of a
      telephone follow-up program for the prevention of suicidal behavior in adults discharged from
      general hospitals after a suicide attempt.

      The hypothesis is that the implementation of this program is associated with reduced rates of
      suicide reattempts in these patients and also with delayed reattempts in them.

      Justification: Suicide is a global public health concern and is the leading cause of
      avoidable death in the Basque Country (Spain). The use of telemedicine techniques applied to
      high risk patients has shown to be useful in the prevention of suicide and suicidal behavior.

      Objectives: To assess the efficacy of a telephone follow-up program for the prevention of
      suicidal behavior in patients who recently attempted suicide.

      Design: This is a multicenter, prospective intervention study, non-randomized and with
      control group.

      Method: A sample of adults discharged from 2 general hospitals after a suicide attempt are
      enrolled in a telephone follow-up program which is added to their usual treatment (TAU). The
      program consists of 5 short calls made by nurses during 6 months. The calls are intended to:
      1) Assess the risk of suicide in that moment, 2) Improve patient's adherence to treatments,
      and 3) Provide general psychoeducation guidelines. The control group is composed of patients
      discharged from a third general hospital after a suicide attempt. These receive TAU but are
      not enrolled in the telephone follow-up.

      Evaluation: All patients are followed during 12 months. Main outcome measures include the
      percentage of patients that make a second attempt and the average time to reattempt.

      Patients sign and informed consent.
