  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a randomized, 2-way, blinded parallel trial in which 56 healthy adults of both
      genders with frequent occurrence of stomach trouble.This intervention trial with 6 weeks of
      daily intake β-glucans will be carried out with a beverage containing β-glucans and a control
      beverage without β-glucans. The primary aim is to investigate whether β-glucans from barley
      has an effect on stomach and intestinal health, including stool volume and frequency.
      Microbiota, concentrations of short chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate),
      calprotectin, and energy and fat content in feces. Furthermore, blood pressure and exhaled
      hydrogen and methane, before and after the intervention, subjective perception of
      gastrointestinal problems and digestion as well as the participants' attitudes towards
      functional foods are measured using Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

      Further, specific metabolites of β-glucans in urine (exploratory endpoint) and certain toxic
      metabolites from the microbiota using metabolite profiling (metabolomics) are also analyzed

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      β-glucans from barley slows gastric emptying rate and prolongs the transit time of food in
      the small intestine.&quot; The relatively undigested β-glucans have the ability to increase
      satiety and stimulate digestion, ensuring regular bowel movements and relieve sluggish bowel
      movements, including constipation and constipation. β-glucans are fermented down in the large
      intestine, resulting in production of short-chain fatty acids which inhibit the biosynthesis
      of cholesterol, hence blood cholesterol levels are lowered (not the goal here). Subsequently,
      β-glucans may also affect blood pressure. As a direct result of the effects in the intestine,
      there will be an improvement in the quality of life for people with stomach upsets and maybe
      a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease.
