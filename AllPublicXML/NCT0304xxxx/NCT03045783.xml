      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of
      antibiotics in endoscopic injection of tissue adhesive in gastric varices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding is the most common and life-threatening condition in
      patients with portal hypertension, which are susceptibility to bacterial infection. However,
      the prophylaxis use of antibiotics remained uncertain and lack of high level evidences.This
      study is a randomized controlled trial. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of prophylactic use of antibiotics in endoscopic injection of tissue adhesive in
      gastric varices.
