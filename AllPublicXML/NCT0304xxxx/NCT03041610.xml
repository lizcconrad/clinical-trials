  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter randomized controlled trial, with follow-up at 6 and 12 months. Physically
      inactive participants with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction will be
      randomly assigned to intervention or control arms.

      The six-month intervention will consist of an individualized pedometer-based walking program
      with weekly step goals, monthly face-to-face sessions with the physician, and monthly
      telephone calls with the research nurse. The intervention will be based on effective
      behavioral principles (goal setting, self-monitoring, personalized feedback).

      The primary outcome is the change in 6-minute walk distance at 6 months. Secondary outcomes
      include changes in serum biomarkers levels, pulmonary congestion assessed by ultrasound,
      average daily step count measured by accelerometry, anthropometric measures, symptoms of
      depression, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, and MAGGIC Risk Score.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt;40%) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III symptoms.

          2. Physically inactive, as determined by a question &quot;As a rule, do you do at least half
             an hour of moderate or vigorous exercise (such as walking or a sport) on five or more
             days of the week?&quot;.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Signs and symptoms of decompensated heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmia or effort
             angina, severe or symptomatic aortic stenosis, persistent hypotension, recent shocks
             delivered by the automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

          2. Co-morbid conditions that would affect adherence to trial procedures (e.g.
             inflammatory arthritis, active malignancy, renal disease requiring dialysis,
             uncontrolled diabetes, major depression or other significant psychiatric disorders,
             cognitive impairment, significant hearing or visual impairment).

          3. Major surgery planned within the next 12 months.

          4. Life expectancy shorter than 12 months.

          5. Inability to walk from any reason.

          6. Baseline six-minute walking distance &gt;450 meters. Patients covering more than 450
             meters in the baseline six-minute walk test (6MWT) are excluded due to a possible
             ceiling effect.

          7. Pregnancy.

          8. Failure to perform the 6MWT.
