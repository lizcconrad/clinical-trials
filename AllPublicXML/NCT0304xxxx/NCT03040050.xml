  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial. Subjects are randomly assigned 1:1 to receive
      either rapid multiplex qPCR (intervention) prior to standard of care prostate biopsy or
      standard of care (control) prostate biopsy. The subjects will have a rectal culture swab
      performed prior to the prostate biopsy. One rectal culture swab will be used for rapid
      multiplex qPCR and the other swab will be sent to microbiology for a standard culture. The
      subjects randomized to the intervention group will have the qPCR results shared with the
      physician to determine if additional standard of care antibiotics are needed at time of
      standard of care prostate biopsy. The subjects randomized to the control group will not have
      the qPCR results shared with the physician to determine if additional standard of care
      antibiotics are needed at time of standard of care prostate biopsy. Approximately, 10 days
      after the prostate biopsy, the research staff will conduct a chart review and/or telephone
      call to ask about any prostate biopsy infections and complications.
