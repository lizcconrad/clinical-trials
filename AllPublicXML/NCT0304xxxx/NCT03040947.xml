    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop imaging protocols when using cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance (CMR) to assess cardiac functions, morphology and tissue characterization. The
      National Heart Research Institute Singapore (NHRIS) houses two dedicated CMR scanners to
      support the numerous investigator initiated projects in patients with various cardiac
      pathologists. By optimizing novel CMR sequences used in these studies, scanning time can be
      shortened for patients with underlying cardiac diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In medical research, there is a continuous need to develop new imaging techniques such as
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. This will allow us to visualize and study
      the function and structure of the heart in greater detail so as to improve the diagnosis and
      treatment of patients with various cardiac conditions. The aim of the study is to optimise
      new CMR sequences, allowing the development of imaging protocols in future research studies.

      This study will hence recruit 100 subjects for each of the following sub-studies:

        1. Sub-study 1: Normal CMR protocols for assessment of cardiac function and morphology

        2. Sub-study 2: Exercise stress protocols with a CMR-compatible supine bike.

      For the first sub-study, 50 healthy volunteers will be recruited. The testing and optimising
      of CMR sequence settings are crucial to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the scan before
      using these tests on patients with cardiac diseases.

      For the second sub-study, 50 healthy volunteers of different fitness levels will be
      recruited. An exercise stress protocol will then be developed for future studies in patients
      with suspected coronary artery diseases. For this protocol, participants will be asked to
      cycle on a supine exercise bike to assess the effects of exercise and free breathing on the
      stability of the CMR imaging sequences.

        Potential participants will be identified from an existing database of healthy volunteers
        who had previously participated in the biobank program and indicated interest in future
        studies.

        Potential patients are identified from the imaging or admissions databases. The primary
        physicians of these patients identified will be notified prior to recruitment and the
        patient will only be recruited if the primary physician is agreeable.

        Alternatively, other methods of participant identification include co-workers of the
        department who volunteer themselves and indicate on the Informed Consent Document that
        their participation was entirely voluntary and not under coercion.

        Team members of this study are not eligible for participation.
