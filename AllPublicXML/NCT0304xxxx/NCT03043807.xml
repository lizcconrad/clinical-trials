  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety of treating men with oligometastatic prostate cancer with the following
      therapy: (1st) Systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of adjuvant
      androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control
      with adjuvant radiation therapy, and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic radiation to
      oligometastatic lesions. The men will receive a total of 2 years of androgen deprivation.
      Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the course of treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant treatment (month 1 through ~6): All patients will be treated with up to 6 months of
      androgen deprivation, plus up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. Following docetaxel
      therapy, patients with a PSA response of at least a 50% decrease from baseline, will proceed
      to maximum consolidative therapy.

      Local consolidation (month 7 though ~11): After completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the men
      will be treated with definitive local therapy with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). After
      definitive local therapy, patients will be treated with consolidative stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) to the metastatic sites (if present).

      Systemic consolidation: Patients will continue on androgen deprivation for a total of 2
      years. They will be followed clinically and monitored with serum testosterone and PSA until
      2-years after completion of systemic consolidation. Androgen blockade will be the same
      throughout the course of treatment.

          4. Documented histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          5. Willing to undergo the following therapy: (1st) Systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with
             up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of
             chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control with adjuvant radiation therapy,
             and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic radiation to oligometastatic lesions.
             Additionally, must be willing to be treated with a full two years of androgen
             deprivation.

          6. Oligometastatic prostate cancer: Stage T1-4, N0-1 and/or M1a-b (up to 5 metastatic
             lesions- including bone lesions and non-regional lymph nodes seen on bone scan,
             contrast enhanced CT scan, or PET scan)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior local non-surgical therapy to treat prostate cancer (e.g. radiation therapy,
             brachytherapy)

          2. Prior therapy to a metastatic site.

          3. Prior or ongoing systemic therapy for prostate cancer including, but not limited to:

               1. Hormonal therapy (e.g. leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, degarelix)

               2. CYP-17 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole)

               3. Antiandrogens (e.g. bicalutamide, nilutamide)

                  therapy was recently initiated (&lt;90 days duration)). In the event that hormone
                  therapy was initiated prior to study enrollment, the clock for 2 years of
                  androgen deprivation would begin at the time of therapy initiation, rather than
                  at study enrollment.

          4. Evidence of serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other
             condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that could interfere with patient
             safety or provision of informed consent to participate in this study.

          5. Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that could
             potentially interfere with compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.

          6. Abnormal bone marrow function [absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&lt;1500/mm3, platelet
             count &lt;100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL]

          7. Abnormal liver function (bilirubin &gt;ULN; AST, ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal)

          8. Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min. CrCl should be calculated suing the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula.

          9. Active cardiac disease defined as active angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             or myocardial infarction within previous six months.

         10. Prior history of malignancy in the past 3 years with the exception of basal cell and
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Other malignancies that are considered to have a
             low potential to progress may be enrolled at discretion of PI.
