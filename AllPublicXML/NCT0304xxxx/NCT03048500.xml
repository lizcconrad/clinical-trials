      The purpose of this study is to find the benefits of combining nivolumab with metformin in
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer with and without prior treatment with immunotherapy. We
      will also be looking at the safety of the combination. Nivolumab is currently approved in
      certain cancers such as melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer. Metformin is approved by the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat diabetes. In this study, Metformin is being
      used to treat cancer. This use is not approved by the FDA; therefore, in this study, it is
      considered experimental. Experimental means the U.S. FDA has not approved the drug for use in
      your type of cancer. Nivolumab is an antibody (a human protein that sticks to a part of the
      tumor and/or immune cells) designed to allow the body's immune system to work against tumor
      cells. It is believed that metformin has immune modifying properties, meaning it can boost
      your immune system. As a result, it may help certain cancer treatments, known as
      immunotherapy, to work better.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess anti-tumor activity of the combination treatment of metformin hydrochloride
      (metformin) with nivolumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with and without prior
      exposure to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of the combination treatment of metformin with nivolumab according
      to depth, duration, and persistence of response, disease control rate (DCR; complete response
      [CR], partial response [PR], and stable disease [SD] at 24 weeks), progression-free survival
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with and without
      prior exposure to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria version (v)1.1.

      II. To assess the efficacy of the combination treatment of metformin with nivolumab according
      to depth, duration, and persistence of response, objective response rate (ORR), DCR, PFS, and
      OS in the above population using immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) criteria.

      III. To assess the safety and tolerability profile of the combination treatment of metformin
      with nivolumab in the above population using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) version 4.03.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the immune-related tumor and blood biomarkers including T cell markers and their
      association with treatment response in the above population.

      II. To assess the dynamic change in both immune and genomic biomarkers in blood that may
      correlate with response to metformin.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -7 to -1 and
      1-28. Patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      courses 1-4, then over 60 minutes on day 1 beginning course 5. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, then every 6 months for 3 years.
