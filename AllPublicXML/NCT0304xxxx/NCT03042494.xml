  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the importance of the gut microbiota to human health has been demonstrated.
      In adulthood, the microbial profile is relatively stable, yet can be transiently altered by
      factors such as diet or antibiotic treatment. Such changes may be beneficial, as gut
      microbiota has been shown to differ in normal versus disease states including inflammatory
      bowel disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Given this relationship,
      there is intense interest in designing interventions that positively influence the gut
      microbial profile. Prebiotics are non-digestible, fermentable oligo- and polysaccharides that
      alter the colonic environment in favour of health-promoting bacterial species, such as
      bifidobacteria which selectively ferment prebiotics. Given the ability of prebiotics to
      beneficially alter the microbial profile, there is a need to identify the dosing requirements
      to positively modulate the gut microbiota. This study will test the effect of two doses of
      prebiotic on gut microbiota taxonomy and diversity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the effect of 4 week intake of a moderate dose (7 g/d)
      or low dose (2.5-3 g/d) of prebiotic on gut microbiota profiles in healthy adults compared to
      a non-prebiotic containing control.

      The primary outcome is change in microbial composition (measured via 16S rRNA sequencing).

      The secondary outcomes are change in gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance (measured via
      questionnaire); change in fecal short chain fatty acids; and change in quality of life.

      This study will consist of two separate trials of 12 week duration. Each trial will be
      performed in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover manner with a 4 week
      intervention period followed by a 4 week wash-out period and final 4 week cross over.
