  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease that causes joint pain, stiffness, and movement
      limitation. Nearly 50% in those 75 years and above are affected. In Taiwan, the reported
      prevalence was more than 6000 per year. The cause of pain is joint instability and structure
      changed, including hyaline articular cartilage lost, bony remodeling, capsular stretching and
      periartcular muscle weakness. Current guidelines for treatment of symptomatic knee
      osteoarthritis include exercise, anti-inflammatory drugs, transcutaneous electrical
      stimulation(TENS) and magnetic fields(MF) which reduce pain and improve the patient's quality
      of life.

      However, conservative therapies and oral supplements have been evaluated but are without
      clear efficacy. Prolotherapy is an injection therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain. One of
      the hypotheses is stimulating local healing and current study demonstrated clinical benefit
      for pain and improvement of function. The effects of multi-point injections were more
      pronounced in several studies than single-point injection.

      Extracorporeal shock wave is common treatment for kidney stones, has been widely used in soft
      tissue diseases, such as calcified tendon lesions and plantar fasciitis. The theory of
      extracorporeal shock wave is energy of high-frequency vibration caused destruction of stones
      and other hard material and by increasing the rate of vascular regeneration in the injured
      area and increasing the rate of autologous tissue repair, possible biological processes
      include increased mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and differentiation, slowing the
      inflammatory response and antimicrobial efficacy. Current studies have shown equivalent
      clinical outcomes on calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy among extracorporeal shock wave
      therapy, sono-guided acupuncture and arthroscopic surgery and the extracorporeal shock wave
      has the advantage of non-invasive treatment.

      Taking the advantages of non-invasive treatment of extracorporeal shockwave. We want to
      design a randomized control trial by multi-point shockwave therapy and physical therapy
      compared with placebo shockwave therapy and physical therapy. Two randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) reported improvement in outcomes in response to shockwave therapy but were not
      methodologically rigorous. The investigators therefore conducted a two-arm RCT to assess the
      hypothesis that adults with symptomatic knee pain receiving shockwave therapy will report
      greater improvement in knee-related quality-of-life than sham shockwave therapy.
