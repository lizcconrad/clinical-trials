    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to conduct a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study among pediatric
      patients requiring minor procedures in the Emergency Department setting. Patients will be
      randomized to one of two arms of intranasal treatments: ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (K) or midazolam
      0.3 mg/kg (M). The primary outcome will be change in anxiety using the Modified Yale
      Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intranasal route of drug delivery is commonly used in Emergency Departments (ED) in
      pediatric patients. Multiple trials have shown the safety of administration of intranasal
      ketamine, including studies performed in the ED to treat pain in pediatric patients. The use
      of ketamine for anxiolysis has not been directly studied; however, ketamine has been shown to
      have anxiolytic effect at low doses as secondary outcomes when studied. Midazolam has been
      established as an effective medication to provide analgesia and anxiolysis. Investigators
      plan to conduct a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study in the Emergency Department.
      Pediatric patients presenting to the ED with the need for minor procedures who meet the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented, and if amenable, will be enrolled.
      Patients will be randomized to one of two arms of intranasal treatments: ketamine 1.0 mg/kg
      (K) or midazolam 0.3 mg/kg (M). Patients will be tracked for symptom improvement within the
      Emergency Department. The primary outcome will be change in anxiety from initial measurement
      to measurement 5 minutes pre-procedure using the Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale
      (mYPAS). Secondary outcomes will include sedation level, adverse events, need for additional
      medications, change in pain rating, patient and/or parent/guardian satisfaction.
