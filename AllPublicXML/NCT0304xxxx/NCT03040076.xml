    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to test a computerized treatment designed to help people with high
      levels of emotional eating, which is when people eat to cope with negative emotions and/or
      stressful situations. The investigators are interested in comparing two different ways of
      coping with negative emotions, relaxation training or training in how to think differently
      about such situations. Additionally, the researchers' study seeks to understand more about
      the psychological factors that may contribute to someone having difficulty with emotional
      eating.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional eating, or eating as a mechanism for coping with negative affect, is present across
      a spectrum of eating disorders and is associated with poor health outcomes, namely obesity.
      Research suggests that individuals with emotional eating experience urges to eat in response
      to multiple negative emotions, including anxiety, depression, and anger. While emotional
      eating is related to binge eating, it can be examined in a more dimensional fashion because
      it is not associated with a specific size criterion or a requirement of loss of control over
      eating. As such, emotional eating is a useful analog through which to understand mechanisms
      of binge eating and test the preliminary efficacy of treatment interventions. Interventions
      that target mechanisms of regulating negative affect may reduce both negative affect and
      emotional eating, increasing their transdiagnostic value. Research suggests that a large gap
      exists between the prevalence of psychopathology and access to psychological treatment, and
      this gap extends to individuals with eating disorders. A potential solution to these
      challenges is the use of computerized methodologies that may be easier to disseminate, allow
      for a gradient of treatment intensity, and do not rely upon training treatment providers.
      Computer-administered CBM interventions address the need for more easily disseminated
      treatments. CBM interventions are based in research suggesting that negative interpretation
      biases cause negative emotionality and subsequent symptom expression. Negative interpretation
      biases are the tendency to draw threatening conclusions about ambiguous information. Thus,
      CBM paradigms train people to make neutral or positive attributions about situations they
      would typically view through the lens of their negative biases. CBM interventions have been
      tested across a range of psychopathology, including anxiety disorders, depression, and anger,
      and using a variety of different bias modification techniques. Two recent CBM studies have
      been tested within the field of eating disorders. Although results were promising, both
      studies were marked by methodological limitations and neither addressed emotional eating
      specifically. The purpose of the present study is to test a CBM intervention designed to help
      individuals with elevated emotional eating improve their ability to regulate negative affect.
      In doing so, the investigators will determine if modifying the interpretation of ambiguous
      situations that would typically result in negative affect can reduce negative affect in
      individuals with high emotional eating. The researchers will in turn determine if those
      individuals have decreased food consumption under conditions that would otherwise elicit
      negative emotions. This project extends initial research on CBMs in eating disorders, as well
      as research suggesting that basic emotion regulation training can decrease emotional eating.

    <measure>Change in Emotional Overeating Questionnaire Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline (time zero), mid-treatment (8 days after baseline), and post-treatment (2 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional eating will be measured using the 6-item Emotional Overeating Questionnaire (EOQ; Masheb &amp; Grilo, 2006), in which participants report on the frequency of eating in response to five negative emotions and one positive emotion. The instructions and item scaling will be modified to decrease the timeframe assessed from 28 days to 5 days, in order to be sensitive to changes during the present intervention. Each item will be assessed on a 5-point scale (0= no days to 5 = every day). Further, the instructions will be modified to not specifically reference eating an objectively large amount of food. This change is made in order to ensure consistency with how emotional eating is conceptualized in the literature (i.e., no specific size criterion). Change in scores at each of the time points will be used to determine symptom improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline (time zero), mid-treatment (8 days after baseline), and post-treatment (2 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Negative affect will be assessed using the negative affect scale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988), which is a 10-item measure of negative emotions on a scale of 1 (&quot;very slightly or not at all) to 5 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The instructions can be modified as needed to reflect the desired timeframe of assessment (Watson et al., 1988) and therefore, we will instruct participants to consider the past five days.Change in scores at each of the time points will be used to determine symptom improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Word Sentence Association Paradigm Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline (time zero), mid-treatment (8 days after baseline), and post-treatment (2 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>A modified version of the treatment condition Word Sentence Association Paradigm (WSAP; Amir &amp; Taylor, 2012b; Beard &amp; Amir, 2008; Hindash &amp; Amir, 2012) will be used to assess interpretation bias. The ambiguous sentences will be distinct from those used in the bias modification program in order to allow for a more generalized assessment of change in biases. However, to permit an accurate assessment of changes in bias, the WSAP task will be the same at pre-, mid and post treatment. Scores on the WSAP task are calculated as the ratio of percent threatening to percent benign interpretations across the trials. Change in scores at each of the time points will be used to determine symptom improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline (time zero) and post-treatment (2 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Eating disorder symptoms will be measured using the 8-item binge eating subscale of the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI; Forbush et al., 2013), which measures features of binge eating (e.g., consumption of large quantities of food, mindless eating) on a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often.&quot; The EPSI scale is designed to assess behavior over the past 28 days (Forbush et al., 2013); however, to be sensitive to the timeframe of the present study, the instructions will be modified to ask participants to consider the past week.</description>

    <description>Depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms will be measured using the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995a). The DASS is a 42-item measure that assesses such symptoms over the preceding week on a 0 to 3 scale from &quot;did not apply to me at all&quot; to &quot;applied to me very much, or most of the time.&quot;</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, Second Edition</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline (time zero) and post-treatment (2 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Anger symptoms will be measured using the trait anger scale of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, Second Edition (STAXI-2; Spielberger, 1999). Only the trait scale will be used in the present study given our interest in assessing overall anger symptoms, not momentary anger levels, as a moderating variable. The trait scale consists of 10 items that assess frequency of anger a 4-point scale from &quot;almost never&quot; to &quot;almost always,&quot; but is not measured across a specific timeframe (Spielberger &amp; Reheiser, 2009).</description>

    <description>Emotion dysregulation will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004). The DERS is a 36-item measure of six aspects of emotion dysregulation; all items are measured on a 1 (&quot;almost never&quot;) to 5 (&quot;almost always&quot;) scale and are not anchored to a specific timeframe.</description>

    <description>Two computerized tasks will be administered during four intervention sessions. During the first task, the Word Sentence Association Paradigm, participants see a threat or benign word and then an ambiguous sentence. Participants press one if they believe the word and sentence are related and two if they believe the word and sentence are not related. Participants are given feedback that they responded correctly if they state that a benign word is related to the sentence or they state that a threat word is not related to the sentence. The second task is the Ambiguous Scenarios Task. In each trial, an ambiguous scenario, ending in a benign word, appears on the screen. After the scenario is presented, participants respond to a comprehension question and are given feedback on their performance.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the active control group will complete four sessions of progressive muscle relaxation training. Two alternating relaxation scripts will be used. The scripts will be presented as Youtube videos with a blank black screen and will instruct participants to keep their eyes closed for the duration of the training. Participants will access the videos through Qualtrics to ensure that data can be gathered about their compliance. The relaxation scripts used in the present study will be modified versions of those currently being tested by other researchers utilizing cognitive bias modification paradigms. The relaxation training sessions will be matched to the length of the treatment condition and therefore will last approximately 30 minutes.</description>
