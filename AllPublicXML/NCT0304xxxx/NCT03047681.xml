      An association between mast cells and outcomes of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic
      valve replacement (TAVR) has not been studied to our knowledge. We aim to characterize
      tryptase levels dynamics during TAVR; Demonstrate whether tryptase level post-TAVR can be
      used as a prognostic marker.

      Inflammation is known to have a detrimental effect on outcome of patients with myocardial
      infarction (MI) [1, 2] as well as reperfusion injury (RI) [3]. Previous trials have shown
      correlation between the extent of an inflammatory response and postoperative complications
      and worse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [4, 5, 6, 7] including valve
      replacement [8]. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be associated with
      inflammation [5, 9] as well. A few possible mechanisms may be responsible, such as tissue
      injury due to mechanical trauma, vascular complications, and possible suboptimal organ
      perfusion due to bleeding, ventricular pacing, balloon valvuloplasty, deployment,
      post-dilatation, or repositioning of the valve prosthesis [10]. Accumulating data show that
      peri-procedural inflammation is associated with worse outcomes and complications of TAVR [11,
      12, 13, 14, 15], and may predict increased mortality in patients after TAVR [16, 17, 18, 19,
      20].

      Inflammation is a complex process and includes many types of cells including mast cells. The
      association between mast cells, as part of the inflammatory process, and RI has been
      thoroughly studied. Mast cells have been linked to RI in many organs [21], contributing to
      insult to the myocardium. This association has been suggested from animal models [22, 23, 24]
      as well as recent human trials which showed that tryptase, an abundant protease found in mast
      cell granules, is elevated in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients
      treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [25].

      Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that mast cells may have a role in the inflammation
      process involved in patients undergoing TAVR. Moreover, such association with mast cells may
      be used to predict adverse outcomes.

      To our knowledge, an association between mast cells and outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR
      has not been studied.

      METHODS Peripheral venous blood from 30 patients undergoing TAVR will be withdrawn to examine
      tryptase levels, as a marker of mast cell activity. Blood samples will be taken at 0 hours
      (before the procedure) and a second sample will be taken up to 2 hours post-procedure.

      CRP will be examined in each patient pre and post TAVR. Tryptase levels will be examined in
      10 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE We aim to: 1. Characterize tryptase levels dynamics during TAVR 2.
      Demonstrate whether tryptase level post-TAVR can be used as a prognostic marker.

      Primary outcome - mortality at 1 year Secondary outcomes - Major complications at 7 days and
      30 days, including death, major stroke, acute kidney injury, paravalvular regurgitation,
      permanent pacemaker implantation, coronary artery obstruction, heart block, vascular injury,
      pericardial hemorrhage.
