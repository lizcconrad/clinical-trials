      The aims of the study are:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility of echocardiography monitoring in postoperative unit;

        2. To assess diagnostic value of different focussed echocardiography parameters to define
           fluid responsiveness for non-cardiac hypotensive spontaneously breathing patients after
           major abdominal surgery.

      As there are different strategies of perioperative fluid management discussion which is the
      choice liberal or restrictive one occurs? Individualized infusion therapy should be the goal.
      The investigators hypothesize extended hemodynamic monitoring based on focused transthoracic
      echocardiography enable to differentiate the cause of hypotension more carefully and fluid
      overload will be avoided after major abdominal surgery.

      The goals of the study are:

        -  To conduct one group of hypotensive patients after major abdominal surgery. To divide
           this group into responders and nonresponders after fluid challenge.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of echocardiography monitoring in postoperative unit (having
           in mind such restrains as supine position, postoperative pain, bandages etc.)

        -  To compare the evaluation of fluid responsiveness by clinical signs and focused assessed
           echocardiography data.

        -  To identify the best focused echocardiography parameters for prognosis of fluid
           responsiveness.

        -  To determine if extended hemodynamic monitoring changes postoperative fluid management.
