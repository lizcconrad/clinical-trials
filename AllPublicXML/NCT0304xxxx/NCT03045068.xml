      Hypothesis:

      Dilutional thrombocytopenia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is universal and
      administration of donor apheresis platelets just prior to termination of bypass will assist
      in early correction of coagulopathy, early hemostasis and lesser donor exposure of blood
      products after cardiac surgery.

      Background:

      What is the Problem? - Bleeding, Transfusion and Outcomes

        1. Excessive bleeding after neonatal cardiac surgery has been independently associated with
           increased adverse events, morbidity and mortality.1,2 Bleeding after neonatal open-heart
           surgery has multiple etiologies such as immaturity of the building blocks of
           coagulation, effects of deep hypothermia, longer CPB times, altered flow states and
           dilutional state induced by being on CPB leading to low platelet count, low platelet
           function, low fibrinogen levels, altered fibrinogen polymerization, complement
           activation, etc.2,3 The strongest predictor of transfusion after cardiopulmonary bypass
           in children was deemed to be the CPB circuit volume and the effect of hemodilution.4

        2. The dilutional coagulopathy after neonatal CPB requires intense damage control
           resuscitation with massive transfusion of platelets, packed red blood cells (PRBC),
           cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and supplemental factor concentrates. In a
           previous study at this institution (IRB# HSC-MS-13-0647), we have shown that in neonates
           undergoing open-heart surgery there was a significant drop in platelet counts after
           bypass (71% change, baseline= 268 ± 90, Post CPB= 76 ± 27, 109/L). Associated with this
           drop , the average intraoperative transfusion load in neonates undergoing cardiac
           surgery with CPB at our institution constitutes of PRBC= 63± 43 ml/kg, FFP=51± 21 ml/kg,
           cryoprecipitate =12+6 ml/kg, platelets = 28 +16 ml/kg and cell-saver =27± 10 ml/kg. In
           addition 72% of these patients were exposed to a 3-factor prothrombin complex
           concentrate (Bebulin®). Although this &quot;throw the kitchen sink&quot; approach is effective in
           achieving hemostasis, it comes with significant effects on post CPB hemodynamics,
           constantly changing hematocrit, variable blood volume with inability to achieve steady
           state inotropic state affecting cardiac output, oxygen delivery and adding to pulmonary
           hypertension.

      Overall, having higher platelet counts at the time of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass has
      distinct advantages of reducing transfusions and improving outcomes.

    <textblock>
      What do we do at our institution? The vast majority of centers including ours continue to
      utilize a regimen for neonatal CPB prime that constitutes of PRBCs ( 20-30 ml/kg) added to
      achieve a hematocrit &gt; 25 on CPB and FFP (20-30 ml/kg) to assist the lower antithrombin
      levels, improve heparin efficiency and improved suppression of the thrombin generation on
      CPB. Platelets are not added in the CPB prime at our institution. This regimen of avoiding
      donor apheresis platelets transfusion during early CPB is because of the known effects of CPB
      on native platelets resulting in decreases in count from hemodilution and mechanical damage.
      Donor apheresis platelets administered as an initial constituent of CPB prime also carry the
      risk of platelet activation during hypothermia and CPB with potential activation of the
      coagulation cascade. Fresh whole blood is also not used secondary to the difficulty and
      logistics pertaining to availability fresh whole blood makes this approach unattractive.

      What is the advantage of adding platelet apheresis just prior to separation from CPB? We know
      that native platelets are significantly reduced in count and function with increasing
      duration of CPB and function diminishes independently of platelet count with hypothermia.11
      The advantages of adding donor apheresis platelets just prior to separating from CPB are that
      the donor platelets don't get spalliated and deformed by the roller pumps for long durations,
      they are not subjected to the intense cooling and rewarming process and spared of the early
      reperfusion injury/inflammation. Furthermore, addition of 10 ml/kg of platelets would raise
      the platelet counts by at least 50% based on a previous study at this institution (IRB#
      HSC-MS-13-0647; post-CPB platelet transfusion of 28 ± 16 ml/kg resulted in elevation of
      platelet counts from 76 ± 27 to 223 ± 60 (109/L).

      Effect of modified ultrafiltration (MUF): MUF is routinely performed immediately on
      termination of CPB and prior to protamine administration. During this stage, after successful
      weaning from CPB, 10-15% of the cardiac output from the arterial cannula along with residual
      volume from the venous reservoir of the CPB pump is pumped through a hemofilter placed under
      vacuum to allow rapid hemofiltration with the effluent returned via a single atrial venous
      cannula to the patient. This 15-minute rapid hemofiltration allows for removal of excess
      water, improvement in hematocrit with improved oxygen delivery, faster achievement of steady
      state inotrope levels with improved hemodynamics and removal of inflammatory mediators.12-14
      While MUF improves hematocrit, it does not increase platelet count significantly, MUF has no
      effect on native platelet function.3 The biggest advantage of transfusion of apheresis
      platelets prior to termination of bypass versus standard practice of their transfusion after
      protamine is that the transfused fluid load of 10-15 ml/kg of platelets volume that would
      have diluted the red cell fraction (hematocrit) and impacted oxygen delivery and pulmonary
      dysfunction would now take the full benefit of modified ultrafiltration with excess fluid
      removal even prior to protamine administration with overall improved hemodynamics.

      Institutional Blood transfusion Management for Neonatal CPB For the CPB prime: PRBCs
      (50ml/kg) are added to allow for a hematocrit &gt;30 for the estimated blood volumes. FFP is
      added to the pump prime for all patients weighing less than 5 kilograms and in those who
      demonstrate heparin resistance on initial heparin dose response assays. Heparin is added in
      the CPB prime. Other constituents of the CPB prime are epsilon aminocaproic acid (50 mg/kg),
      cefazolin (30 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone.

      Post CPB: Current practice in neonates is to administer a combination of cryoprecipitate,
      platelet and PRBC in a 1:1:1 ratio till hemostasis is achieved. 3PCC factor administration is
      based on diffuse clinical bleeding suggestive of coagulopathy that persists despite one round
      of cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusion.

      Study Method:

      Prospective Randomized trial in neonates comparing platelet apheresis transfusion prior to
      termination of CPB versus standard transfusion of platelet apheresis after modified
      ultrafiltration and protamine administration. Primary outcomes and secondary outcomes are
      detailed below.
