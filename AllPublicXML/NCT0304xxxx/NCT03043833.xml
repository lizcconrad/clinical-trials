  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study represents Phase II of a research program involving an international collaboration
      with Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia) to implement an Internet-based cognitive
      behavior therapy for the treatment of anxiety and depression in French-speaking Canadians
      from the Atlantic Provinces.

      The primary objective is to establish the clinical efficacy of a French-Canadian self-guided
      format version of the Wellbeing Course by conducting a randomized-control trial where an
      experimental group will be compared to a waitlist control group. A secondary objective is to
      demonstrate the course's acceptability through participants' satisfaction with the course.

    <intervention_name>The Wellbeing Course</intervention_name>
    <description>The Wellbeing Course (Titov et al., 2011) includes five online lessons:
Lesson 1 presents information on the prevalence of anxiety disorders and depression as well as on how they may interfere with life goals. This lesson also discusses how cognitive, behavioral and physical symptoms can contribute to poor emotional health.
Lesson 2 presents different strategies to generate realistic cognitions.
Lesson 3 describes strategies for physical de-arousal and for re-engaging in reinforcing activities.
Lesson 4 describes avoidance and safety behaviors in relation with anxiety and depression along with graded exposure.
Lesson 5 is about problem solving, relapse prevention and staying well.
For each lesson, a &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; guide is included as well vignettes and additional material.</description>
