  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy includes a class of medication called checkpoint inhibitors, which are a
      relatively new medication therapy for many types of cancer which are metastatic, meaning it
      has spread to other parts of the body.Immune therapy medication may be given safely with
      radiation treatment, and in rare cases it may even make radiotherapy more effective. When
      radiation therapy is given in the &quot;palliative&quot; setting it is given to treat pain/discomfort
      and not necessarily shrink or get rid of the tumour. Palliative radiotherapy may be given for
      many reasons, but common examples include painful bone or liver tumours, brain metastases, or
      symptoms from a chest tumour such as feeling breathless, cough, or bleeding. Palliative
      radiotherapy is usually given in smaller amounts and less frequently than other types of
      radiation therapy. Because checkpoint inhibitors are relatively new there is not a huge
      amount of evidence looking at how patients respond when the treatments are combined, or in
      which patients immune therapy may make radiation therapy even more effective. This study is
      looking at the way patients who are on or about to start immune therapy and who have been
      recommended for palliative radiotherapy, respond to the combination of these two treatments.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the treatment outcomes in patients with cancer that
      has spread who are managed with a combination of immune therapy medication and radiotherapy.
      This research is being done because there is limited information about the outcomes of
      combined immune therapy and radiotherapy treatment from a patient's perspective, but also in
      terms of which patients may have a better response to combined treatment. In particular, the
      study aims to describe how combined treatment affects cancer not only in the area where
      radiotherapy is given, but also outside the part of the body that receives radiotherapy
      (which is called &quot;abscopal&quot; effect).
