      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare clinical efficacy by Modified MASI score between Fractional Picosecond 1,064
           nm laser and daily application of 4% hydroquinone with 4% hydroquinone alone Secondary
           objectives

        -  To compare the clinical endpoints of Mexameter Melanin Index, brownish spot and
           Ultraviolet spots by VISIATM complexion analysis, The Antera 3DÂ® imaging technology for
           pigmentation, quality of life by Dermatology Life Quality Index and patient's
           satisfaction between Fractional Picosecond 1,064 nm laser and 4% hydroquinone with 4%
           hydroquinone alone
