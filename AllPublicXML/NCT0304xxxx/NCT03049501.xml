  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of family caregivers is projected to increase in concert with the projected
      increase in number of AD patients. The focus of the study is to gather systematic data on the
      acceptability and efficacy of a unique technology-based, culturally- tailored psycho-social
      intervention program that targets ethnically/culturally diverse family caregivers of patients
      with Alzheimer's Disease. The overall goal of the project is to improve the lives of family
      caregivers as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one and to reduce
      disparities in access to needed services and support among caregiver populations.
