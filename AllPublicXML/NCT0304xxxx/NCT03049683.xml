  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To lower the threshold for clinical application by reducing the testing time for recording
      vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), we evaluated whether a simultaneous recording
      of ocular and cervical VEMPs after unilateral or bilateral stimulation can be achieved
      without a loss in diagnostic sensitivity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combined evaluation of ocular and cervical VEMPs permits the assessment of both endorgans
      and whole vestibular nerve function, as well as the ascending and descending vestibular
      pathways in the brainstem at once.

      In about 30 healthy participants and 20 patients with acute unilateral vestibular neuritis,
      unilateral simultaneous cVEMP and oVEMP recordings in each side during monaural stimulation
      (air-conducted sound, 500Hz tone bursts, 100 nHL), and bilateral simultaneous recordings of
      each VEMP while binaural stimulation were compared to the conventional method of sequential
      recording each VEMPs on each side at a time.

    <description>Thirty healthy volunteers without a previous history of vertigo or neuro-otologic diseases will be enrolled in this study. The subjects will be also screened with a full history on vestibular disorders, with pure tone audiogram, and head-impulse tests to exclude the possibility of previous vestibular disorders or migraine which may cause abnormal VEMPs.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Acute unilateral vestibular neuritis</arm_group_label>
    <description>The criteria for inclusion as a patient with vestibular neuritis involving the superior division (superior VN) included the following: (1) acute onset of vertigo, (2) the appearance of mixed horizontal and torsional nystagmus, (3) impaired horizontal semicircular canal (SCC) function on head-impulse test and a unilaterally absent or reduced caloric response (i.e., a caloric paresis score &gt; 25%), (4) intact inferior division of vestibular nerve as evidenced by normal cVEMP and normal head-impulse test for vertical SCCs, and (5) the absence of auditory and neurologic signs. Thirty patients (aged 32-82 years; mean age, 51.7 years; 16 males) fulfilled the criteria of superior VN.</description>

    <description>The c- and oVEMPs will be assessed in three different sessions including conventional sequential recordings and two different simultaneous recording methods, i.e., unilateral simultaneous recording of cVEMPs and oVEMPs during monaural stimulation (Figure 1A) and bilateral simultaneous recording of each VEMP during binaural stimulation (Figure 1B).</description>

        About thirty healthy volunteers without a previous history of vertigo or neuro-otologic
        diseases will be enrolled in this study. The subjects were also screened with a full
        history on vestibular disorders, with pure tone audiogram, and head-impulse tests to
        exclude the possibility of previous vestibular disorders or migraine which may cause
        abnormal VEMPs.

        The criteria for inclusion as a patient with vestibular neuritis involving the superior
        division (superior VN) will be included the following: (1) acute onset of vertigo, (2) the
        appearance of mixed horizontal and torsional nystagmus, (3) impaired horizontal
        semicircular canal (SCC) function on head-impulse test and a unilaterally absent or reduced
        caloric response (i.e., a caloric paresis score &gt; 25%), (4) intact inferior division of
        vestibular nerve as evidenced by normal cVEMP and normal head-impulse test for vertical
        SCCs, and (5) the absence of auditory and neurologic signs.
