      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, parallel-group, single dose study. This

      groups and one group of control participants with normal hepatic function.

      This study will enroll up to 24 participants and will include 2 hepatic impaired participant
      groups and one group of control participants with normal hepatic function. Approximately four
      participants with mild hepatic impairment will be enrolled first (Group 1). To ensure
      participant safety, following dosing of these first four participants, a safety meeting will
      take place to review the safety data prior to dosing additional participants. After safety
      and pharmacokinetic (PK) results from the first four participants have been reviewed, an
      additional four participants with mild hepatic impairment (remainder of Group 1) will be
      enrolled concurrently with the moderated hepatic impairment group (Group 2). Thereafter,
      matched participants with normal hepatic function (Group 3) will be enrolled. All
      participants will participate in one treatment period and will receive a single dose of
      lasmiditan in the fasting state.
