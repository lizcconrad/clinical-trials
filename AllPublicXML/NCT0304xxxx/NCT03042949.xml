      An assesment of an optical system that measures blood pressure on the finger -Elfor 1 device.
      The system is based on a small optical sensor that emits coherent light into the skin and
      collects the reflected light from the red blood cells in the blood vessels in the skin under
      the sensor. The sensor is able to detect the pulse wave and blood pressure can be measured.

      The investigators plan to measure blood pressure with the new sensor in patients who are
      attending the Hypertension Clinic at Meir Hospital or are undergoing hemodialysis to validate
      the sensor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the blood flow is temporarily interrupted by inflating a small pneumatic cuff at the root
      of the finger, blood flow is occluded and the pulse wave disappears. As the pressure in the
      cuff is released, blood flow returns, the pulse wave is again detected and blood pressure can
      be measured. This apparatus is easy to use and will allow simplified monitoring of blood
      pressure contains the laser source and optical sensors that measure the reflected light.

      The investigators proposed to validate the sensor by measuring the blood pressure in patients
      with this optical sensor and also by standard plethysmography. The investigators plan to
      measure participants with low, normal and high blood pressure in order to assess the accuracy
      and reliability of the new device.
