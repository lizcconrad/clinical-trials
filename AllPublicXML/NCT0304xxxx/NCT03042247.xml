  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the most recent guidelines, total-body imaging techniques are an indispensable
      element in the staging and post-treatment re-evaluation in patients with lymphoma.
      Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is the
      gold-standard for the assessment of the disease in these patients. The use of alternative
      methods, without radiation, such as whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), could be a
      valid alternative; this would result an advantage, considering the young age of the majority
      of patients at diagnosis and the need to undergo to serial assessments. The recent
      introduction of combined PET total body MRI (PET/MRI) offers the possibility to integrate
      morphological information with the high resolution of MRI with the metabolic activity of PET,
      through the uptake of FDG, for a more accurate definition of the extent of disease in
      patients with lymphoma.

      All patients diagnosed with classical Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma that meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. They will undergo an
      FDG-PET/CT for defining the staging and the therapeutic strategy. PET/MRI scans will be
      performed immediately upon completion of the PET/contrast-enhanced CT study and FDG tracer
      will be injected before the PET/CT exam and PET/MRI acquisitions will be practiced using the
      residual activity of the tracer. All patients will have to provide their informed consent in
      order to participate in the study.

      The combined assessment FDG-PET/CT and FDG-PET/MRI will be performed at diagnosis for
      staging, at the interim evaluation for early assessment of treatment response after 2 cycles
      of chemotherapy and finally the post-chemotherapy re-staging. The enrollment period is 24
      months for a total of 50 patients.

      Patients enrolled in the study will be followed for the diagnostic/therapeutic program at the
      Hematology Department of Federico II University of Naples, while the FDG-PET/CT and
      FDG-PET/MRI examinations will be carried out at the IRCSS SDN of Naples. The acquired images
      will be evaluated by a panel of experienced radiologists and nuclear physicians at the IRCSS
      SDN Naples and simultaneously at the Hôpital Henri Mondor (Hôpitaux Universitaires Henri
      Mondor) Créteil.

      The results obtained from the examination MRI will not modify in any way the clinical
      therapeutic choices in the planned chemotherapy for the patient, who will not receive
      additional radiations. This prospective pilot study will be conducted after approval by the
      Ethics Committee; each patient will sign an appropriate informed consent.
