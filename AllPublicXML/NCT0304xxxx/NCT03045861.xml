  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2838232 is a novel HIV-1 maturation inhibitor (MI) that is being developed for the
      treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretroviral therapy (ART). This
      study will be a 10-day monotherapy, open-label, adaptive, dose ranging, repeat-dose study.
      This study will be conducted in two Parts (Part A and Part B) consisting single daily doses
      of GSK2838232 and Cobicistat from Day 1 to Day 10. This proof of concept open-label study
      will be aimed to characterize the acute antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), the
      relationship between PK and antiviral activity, and safety of GSK2838232/cobi administered
      across a range of doses over 10 days in HIV-1 infected patients. A cohort of 10 subjects will
      be studied in Part I followed by interim (go/no-go) analysis of Part A data. On completion of
      an interim analysis of part A data, further cohorts of 8 subjects will then be studied in
      Part B in a parallel design in two or more cohorts (depending upon the data obtained in Part
      A). Approximately 34 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects will be enrolled during the
      study. Subjects in both parts will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to first dose
      and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose. Maximum duration of study participation
      will be approximately 6 Weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy (other than HIV infection) male or female as determined by the investigator or
             medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history,
             physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring, defined as no other
             chronic medical conditions and taking no chronic medications.

          -  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in
             consultation with the medical monitor agree and document that the finding is unlikely
             to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A creatinine clearance &gt;80 mL/minute as determined by Cockcroft-Gault equation
             creatinine clearance CLcr (mL/minute) = (140 - age) x weight (Wt) divided by (72 x
             serum creatinine [Scr]) (times 0.85 if female) where age is in years, Wt is in
             kilogram (kg), and Scr is in units of mg/decilitre (dL).

          -  Confirmed HIV positive; CD4+ cell count &gt;=350 cells/millimetre (mm)^3 and plasma HIV-1
             RNA &gt;=5000 copies/mL at screening.

          -  No current and no prior ART.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kg (110 pound [lbs.]) for men and &gt;=45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body
             mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/meter^2 (inclusive)

          -  A female subject of reproductive or non-reproductive potential is eligible to
             participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum or urine human
             chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening and prior to first dose), not
             lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: females of
             reproductive potential may only be enrolled if they are using two forms of
             complementary contraception, which must include one barrier method. They will be
             counselled on safer sex practices; there is no definitive drug-drug interaction (DDI)
             information with GSK2838232 and an interaction with oral contraceptives is possible,
             so other (barrier, inter-uterine device etc.) methods of contraception will be
             required; fertile females, who have an established, long-term lifestyle of sexual
             abstinence, or only same sex partners, require no other means of birth control.

             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels
             consistent with menopause. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrolment.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the
             following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication
             until one week after the last dose of study medication; vasectomy with documentation
             of azoospermia; male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options as:
             Contraceptive sub dermal implant including a &lt;1 percent rate of failure per year;
             intrauterine device or intrauterine system including a &lt;1 percent rate of failure per
             year; oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone or injectable
             progestogen; contraceptive vaginal ring; percutaneous contraceptive patches. These
             allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly
             and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring
             that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.
