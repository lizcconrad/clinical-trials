  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 will be conducted as an open-label, non-randomized, non-placebo-controlled dose
      escalation study using pre-specified doses. Subjects with the following advanced
      hematological disorders and no available therapies, and who satisfy all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled. The purpose is to identify the recommended dose of oral ORH-2014
      in subjects with advanced hematological disorders.

      Part 2 will be an expansion phase conducted as a single-arm, open-label study to further
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ORH-2014 at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or
      recommended dose determined from Part 1 in the fasted state. Subjects with the same disease
      types as in Part 1 will be enrolled. All subjects will receive oral ORH-2014, in the fasted
      state, at the recommended dose for an initial period of up to 12 weeks. The purpose is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral ORH-2014 in a population of subjects with
      advanced hematological disorders when administered at the recommended dose.
