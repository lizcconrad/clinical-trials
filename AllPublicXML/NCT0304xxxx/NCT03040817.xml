  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic gastroparesis, postsurgical gastroparesis, idiopathic gastroparesis and primary
      pyloric stenosis are debilitating gastrointestinal motility disorder. However, there is
      limited medical therapeutic options for these diseases. Gastric peroral endoscopic
      pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) is an emerging novel endoscopic technique which is reported as a
      minimally invasive therapy. But so far, the efficacy and safety of G-POEM on these diseases
      are rarely explored. So, there is a cooperative group composed of five clinical centers for
      clinical research in G-POEM.

      Participants are randomly devided into 'G-POEM group' and 'Esomeprazole+Mosapride group'. In
      G-POEM group, each participant receives G-POEM treatment. In Esomeprazole+Mosapride group,
      each participant receives Nexium 40mg bid + Mosapride Citrate Tablets 5mg tid. The whole
      outcome measure time fram is up to two years. Outcome evaluations include: gastric emptying
      imaging, gastric antrum volume, gastric emptying time, gastroparesis cardinal symptoms index
      and gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire. All the outcomes are assessed at different
      time points (from baseline to 6 months, 12months and 24months).

    <description>G-POEM procedure:
A. Premixed methylene blue/normal saline were injected into gastric antrum submucosa at greater curvature, 5 cm proximal to the pylorus.
B. Submucosal tunnel was created via endoscopic submucosal dissection. C. A white thick pyloric band, was in contrast to a thin-walled submucosal space of the duodenum observed distally.
D. Pyloromyotomy starts with dissection of the pyloric ring exposing muscular layer underneath.
E. Circular and longitudinal myotomy for 2-3 cm. F. Serosa indicates appropriate depth of myotomy. G. Reevaluation of the mucosotomy site. H. Mucosal entry was closed with clips from distal mucosal incision point.</description>
