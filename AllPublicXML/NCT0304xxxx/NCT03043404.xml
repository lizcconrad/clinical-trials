      To confirm the acute performance and safety of the Lotus™ Valve Flex System for transcatheter
      aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in symptomatic patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis
      who are considered high risk for surgical valve replacement.

    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a prospective, single-arm study designed to confirm that the acute
      performance and safety of the Lotus Valve Flex System for TAVR are consistent with the
      results of the Lotus Valve System in the REPRISE II study, when delivered and deployed in
      symptomatic subjects who have severe calcific aortic valve stenosis and who are at high risk
      for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).

             luminal diameter &gt;5 cm or with documented presence of thrombus, marked tortuosity,
             narrowing of the abdominal aorta, severe unfolding of the thoracic aorta or thick [&gt;5
             mm], protruding or ulcerated atheroma in the aortic arch) or symptomatic carotid or
             vertebral disease.

             subjects requiring 27 mm valve size, or severe iliofemoral tortuosity or calcification
             that would prevent safe placement of the introducer sheath.

         22. Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, etc.).

         23. Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not

         24. Subject has untreated conduction system disorder (e.g., Type II second degree
             atrioventricular block) that in the opinion of the treating physician is clinically
             significant and requires a pacemaker implantation.
