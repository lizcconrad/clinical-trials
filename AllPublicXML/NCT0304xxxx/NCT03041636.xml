  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Jakafi (ruxolitinib) can delay, lower
      the amount of therapy you may need in the future, or possibly eliminate the need for future
      therapy in recently diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma
      (SLL) patients.

      This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF). It is considered investigational to use ruxolitinib to
      treat CLL/SLL. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will take ruxolitinib pills by mouth 2 times
      each day. The study doctor will tell you which dose you are taking.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may receive ruxolitinib for up to 3 years. If the study doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest, you may be able to continue receiving ruxolitinib after 3 years. This will be
      discussed with you. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).

      Study Visits:

      All study visits during screening and the first 8 months of participation (except the Month 2
      visit) will take place at MD Anderson. For the Month 2 visit and every other visit after
      Month 8, if it is more convenient for you, you may have your physical exams and routine blood
      draws completed at a local lab or doctor's office. The results of the tests/procedures will
      be sent to the study doctor for review. This option will be discussed with you. If you choose
      all visits will take place at MD Anderson, you will be seen at least every 4 months.

      Before you start taking ruxolitinib:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for cytokine testing and for a special kind of
           testing that tells researchers if there are changes in the pathways that helps CLL/SLL
           cells grow. This is called B-cell receptor testing. Cytokines are proteins that may
           affect the immune system.

        -  Blood (2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a Whole Body CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a Bone Marrow biopsy and aspiration to check the status of the disease. To
           collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with a
           anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be collected for
           a pregnancy test.

      On Days 1 and Day 15 (+/- 7 days), Month 3, Month 6, every 2 months (Months 8 10, and so on).
      as well as every time you come to MD Anderson as part of your routine care:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If needed, this blood draw may be
           repeated every 2-4 weeks.

        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires about your symptoms. This should take about 10
           minutes to complete.

      At about Month 2, Month 10, and every 4 months after that (Month 14,18, and so on), if
      performed by your local doctor as part of your routine care:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If needed, this blood draw may be
           repeated every 2-4 weeks.

      About 3 months after you start treatment, in addition to the testing listed above, blood (2
      teaspoons) will be drawn for cytokine testing and for B-cell receptor testing.

      About 6 months after you start treatment in addition to the tests above:

        -  Blood (2 teaspoons) will be drawn for cytokine testing and for B-cell receptor testing.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. To collect a
           bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a
           small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.

        -  You will have a whole body CT scan.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your last dose of ruxolitinib, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn
      for routine tests.
