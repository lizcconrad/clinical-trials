      regimen) in newly diagnosed Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) patients.

      This is a single center, open-labeled , single arm, phase-II pilot study which aims to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and prednisone (TCP
      regimen) in newly diagnosed Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) patients.There would be
      two phases of the study. The treatment and the response evaluation phase will last from the
      time of enrollment up to 24 months (evaluation will be carried out every 3 months). The
      follow-up phase to assess for progression of disease will last from 24 months (2 years) to 4
      years after enrollment (evaluation will be carried out every 12 months).The total study
      duration will be 4 years after the last patient starts study medication.

    <description>Durable tumor and symptomatic response is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). CR: complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease (eg, pleural effusion) and resolution of baseline symptoms attributed to multicentric Castleman's disease, sustained for at least 18 weeks. PR: &gt;=50 percent decrease in sum of the product of the diameters of indicator lesion(s), with at least stable disease in all other evaluable disease in the absence of treatment failure sustained for at least 6 months.</description>
