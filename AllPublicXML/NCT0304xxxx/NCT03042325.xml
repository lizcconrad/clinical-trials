  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alogliptin tablets when
      given as monotherapy or add on therapy in participants who are on standard care for
      management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

      The drug being tested in this study is called alogliptin. Alogliptin is being tested to treat
      people who have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This study will look at side effects and
      glycemic control in people who take alogliptin in addition to standard care.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 patients. All participants will receive alogliptin
      tablets at a dose determined based on the creatinine clearance.

      The recommended dose of alogliptin is 25 mg once daily with normal or mildly impaired renal
      function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥60 mL/min), dose of 12.5 mg for participants with
      moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min), and 6.25 mg for participants severe renal
      impairment (CrCl ≥15 to &lt;30 mL/min). Participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl
      &lt;15 mL/min or requiring hemodialysis) will be excluded, in addition to standard care for the
      management of T2DM.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet every morning each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in India. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 33 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 30 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An ADR is any response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of diseases or for the restoration, correction or modification of physiological function. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility.</description>
