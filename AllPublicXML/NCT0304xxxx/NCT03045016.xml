  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a traumatic event such as an accident or an assault, victims may experience intense
      stress symptoms that may evolve into &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot; (PTSD). It is a
      frequent and serious pathology, which can be complicated by depression, addiction or suicide.
      Few means are available to prevent PTSD in people who have just undergone trauma. Prazosin is
      an antihypertensive drug that blocks α1 adrenaline receptors which could help to stop the
      vicious circle of stress and prevent the development of the disease. The objective of this
      study is to demonstrate the efficacy of prazosin to prevent PTSD in patients who visit an
      emergency department after trauma.
