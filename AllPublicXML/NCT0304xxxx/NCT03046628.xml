  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of using polarised green laser and CMOS
      camera in order to assess the tissue perfusion of lower extremity ulcers in patients
      suffering from diabetic foot by comparing this method with the percutaneous tissue oxygen
      tension examination which is currently the &quot;gold standard&quot; examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An objective assessment of blood supply and oxygen delivery to the damaged tissue in patients
      with diabetic ulcer is very problematic with various currently accepted auxiliary
      examinations. These tests include measuring blood pressure ratio between the ankle or toes
      arm (ABI \ TBI), Sonar Doppler examination of the lower limb arteries, and percutaneous
      tissue oxygen tension examination (TcPO2). Each of these tests, along with the obvious
      advantages esprit ability to assess a non-invasive blood as number of disadvantages.

      As the blood supply to the tissue is the most important healing of the tissue regardless of
      the type of intervention chosen (conservative treatment includes systemic antibiotics or
      surgical debridement), there is clear necessity for a non-invasive test with high reliably
      assessing tissue perfusion in patients with diabetic ulcers.

      Recently, a new a method for assessing multiple features in vital tissues using polarised
      laser light was introduced. The technique is based on tracking temporal changes of reflected
      secondary speckles produced in the skin when being illuminated by a laser beam. Change in
      skin's temporal vibration profile is generated by time varied oxygen concentration caused
      these temporal changes. This technology of nanometer motion sensing allows, according to
      studies already carried out, monitoring parameters such as blood pressure, pulse rate and
      heart rhythm, glucose concentration in the blood substances and alcohol, oxygen saturation
      and intraocular pressure.

      In this study the investigators will examine, non-invasively, the tissue around the lower
      limb ulcers of 30 diabetic patients, beginning with the TcPO2 examination followed by the
      polarised laser light and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera examination,
      and analysing the data in order to determine the ability of the latter method for assessing
      the tissue oxygen pressure.
