  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to know whether starting progesterone luteal support in intra cytoplasmic
      sperm injection (ICSI) cycles on the day of ovum pickup affects the degree of difficulty of
      embryo transfer compared with starting luteal support on day of embryo transfer

      Double blind Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) : the clinicians and the patents were blinded
      of the allocation group.

      A total of 137 embryo transfers were randomly allocated into either arm I (67 ) starting
      luteal support as daily IM injections of 100 mg prontogest on day of egg retrieval , or arm
      II (66) starting the same P4 dose on day of embryo transfer

    <intervention_model_description>Double blind Randomized Controlled Trial : the clinicians and the patents were blinded of the allocation group.
A total of 137 embryo transfers (ETs) were randomly allocated into either group A (67 ) starting luteal support as daily intra muscular (IM) injections of 100 mg prontogest on day of egg retrieval, or group B (66) starting the same P4 dose on day of embryo transfer.Transfer technique was blind tactile using Labotect catheter and was considered difficult if the inner ET catheter was blood stained and /or sounding or dilating the cervix was needed. Cervical traction or blood staining of outer sheath did not indicate difficulty</intervention_model_description>
