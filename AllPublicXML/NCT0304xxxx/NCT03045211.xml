  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When postural imbalance and gait difficulties emerge in subjects with Parkinson disease,
      patients are typically referred for a number of physical therapy sessions. However, there is
      a critical gap in clinical practice on what to do once patients have completed their therapy
      sessions. To fill this gap, the study team has developed a standing table with a tabletop
      system that encourages weight shifting during upright standing (&quot;dynamic standing table&quot;),
      and therefore may be a unique means to increase daily physical activity by integrating the
      system with routine desktop activities of daily living. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether a post-physical therapy in-home physical activity program using the dynamic
      standing table (as an adjunct to post-physical therapy standard of care—weekly physical
      activity group sessions) is effective in sustaining the mobility benefits of physical therapy
      in individuals with Parkinson disease.

      Axial motor dysfunctions in Parkinson disease (PD) are least responsive to dopaminergic
      therapy and incline many patients towards a sedentary lifestyle. This places PD patients at
      increased risk for the negative consequences of physical inactivity. When PD patients develop
      postural imbalance and gait difficulties, including falls, they are generally referred to
      physical therapy for optimal management. Although these patients do benefit from physical
      therapy, there is a critical gap in clinical practice on what to do next once the physical
      therapy sessions are over. Clinical experience shows that most patients return to a sedentary
      lifestyle indicating an urgent need for post-physical therapy in-home physical activity
      programs in PD with postural imbalance and gait difficulties to preserve mobility functions.
      Recent advances in physical activity research tout non-exercise physical activity approaches
      to promote healthy lifestyle modifications. Non-exercise physical activities are activities
      of daily living, like cleaning, shopping, and standing, other than intentional exercise. For
      PD patients with postural imbalance and gait difficulties, normal upright standing and
      weight-shifting (stepping) for longer periods of time may be an ideal form of non-exercise
      physical activity. It activates lower extremity muscles and encourages postural activity. To
      promote this type of non-exercise physical activity, the study team has developed a sit-stand
      desk system that enhances upright standing activity with weight-shifting movements. The
      &quot;dynamic standing table&quot; has a tabletop that oscillates in the horizontal plane, which cues
      users to make periodic side-to-side body weight shifting adjustments. Dynamic standing would
      represent a minimal level of physical activity compared to sitting, which is pervasive in PD
      subjects with postural imbalance and gait difficulties. Use of the dynamic standing table can
      easily be incorporated with routine desktop activities, such as computer use, reading, or
      watching TV and may promote physical activity. Preliminary data shows that patients with
      moderate PD can complete sessions of at least 3 hours without significant difficulty and may
      have motor and cognitive benefits from using this table. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether a post-physical therapy in-home physical activity program using the dynamic
      standing table (as an adjunct to post-physical therapy standard of care—weekly physical
      activity group sessions) is effective in sustaining the mobility benefits of physical therapy
      compared with post-physical activity standard of care alone in individuals with Parkinson
      disease and postural imbalance and gait difficulties. The study team is testing the
      exploratory hypothesis that post-physical therapy gains in mobility functions in PD patients
      with postural imbalance and gait difficulties will be preserved better with in-home dynamic
      standing table use compared to a control group. The incremental addition of the dynamic table
      use is expected to more effectively reduce post-physical therapy sedentary behavior compared
      to the standard of care alone.

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive a dynamic standing table to be used in their home for at least two hours per day for at least five days per week for a 16-week period. Specific activities will be tracked with a logbook. PD subjects will be coached by a physical therapist on proper body positioning at the table, use of anti-fatigue mat, and optimal monitor height. The physical therapist will adhere to the &quot;neutral body positioning&quot; guidelines as provided by the OSHA. The physical therapist will also perform an in-home safety assessment of the office or room in which the table will be placed to ensure safety not only for the users but also for family members or children. The physical therapist will monitor each participant throughout the study by making biweekly compliance phone calls.
In addition, this group will received standard of care, which is weekly group exercise sessions during the 16-week period of table use.</description>

    <description>The dynamic standing table is a height-adjustable standing table with an oscillating tabletop system. The tabletop system moves automatically and slowly (velocity of approximately 3 mm/s) from side-to-side in the horizontal plane (in a linear movement pattern) and facilitates stepping by the user to stay centered in front of the working table surface.</description>
