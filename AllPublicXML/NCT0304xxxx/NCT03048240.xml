      The study pilot evaluate the feasibility of a &quot;5-ALA- PpIX (protoporhyrin IX) mediated
      per-PDT protocol&quot; in patients with glioblastoma accessible for complete surgical removal of
      contrast. This treatment will be carried out in addition to the current reference treatment
      of glioblastoma: maximum resection surgery followed by radiochemotherapy according to the
      protocol Stupp
