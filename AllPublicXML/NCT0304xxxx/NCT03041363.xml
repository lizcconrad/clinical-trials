  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as a percentage of calories consumed, of
      triheptanoin (C7 oil; C7) in a pediatric and adult patient population genetically diagnosed
      with glucose transporter type 1 deficiency disorder (G1D).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will use an open-label, standard 3+3 phase i design for determining the MTD of
      orally-administered C7 in G1D.

      Triheptanoin: a triglyceride oil containing three odd-carbon chain-length fatty acids (i.e.,
      a triglyceride of 7-carbon heptanoic acid). Triheptanoin will be taken 4 times per day
      (approximately every 6 hours) by mouth. it is dosed 4 times per day, divided evenly, and the
      total C7 daily dose will re-place 40% or 45% (depending on group) of the daily caloric intake
      from fat in the usual diet, based on current protocol guidelines. The oil should be taken
      approximately one hour before meals, and will be mixed with fat-free, sugar-free yogurt or
      pudding for administration.

      Up to thirty-six subjects will be enrolled in a 10-day maximum tolerable dose trial of C7.
      initiation of C7 dosing will be conducted in the Children's Medical Center Dallas ambulatory
      Care Pavilion neurology Clinic. Sub-jects will be provided with C7 oil to take over the 7
      days of administration.

      Subjects will not be required to stop other medications. Subjects will be di-rected to
      maintain their usual medications, including rescue seizure medications, as necessary for the
      course of the study. Subjects may have any clinical medical records transferred back to their
      referring physician at completion of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of glucose transporter type I deficiency (G1D) confirmed by genotyping or
             PET scan of the brain.

          -  Stable on no dietary therapy (i.e., on no dietary therapy for 1 month, including, but
             not limited to, medium chain triglyceride therapy).

          -  Males and females 2 years 6 months to 17 years 11 months old, inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of life-threatening seizure episodes, including but not
             limited to status epilepticus and cardiac arrest.

          -  Subjects with evidence of independent, unrelated metabolic and/or genetic disease.

          -  Subjects with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30.

          -  Subjects with a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome,
             Crohn's disease, or colitis, which could increase the subject's risk of developing
             diarrhea or stomach pain.

          -  Subjects currently on dietary therapy (i.e., ketogenic diet, medium chain
             triglyceride-supplemented diets, Atkins diet and versions of it, low glycemic index
             diet, and related diets).

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding may not participate.

          -  Women who plan to become pregnant during the course of the study, or who are unwilling
             to use birth control to prevent pregnancy (including abstinence) may not participate.

          -  Females age 10 and over will be asked to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test
             via dipstick.

          -  Subjects will be asked to agree to abstinence or another form of birth control for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Allergy/sensitivity to C7.

          -  Previous treatment with C7 one month prior to enrollment.

          -  Treatment with medium chain triglycerides in the last 30 days.

          -  Subjects exhibiting signs of dementia, or diagnosed with any degenerative brain
             disorder (such as Alzheimer's disease) that would confound assessment of cognitive
             changes, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of 2 parents or legal guardians/representatives to give
             written informed consent.
