  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients undergoing surgery use naturopathic drugs, including fish oil. Fish oil has
      been reported to increase bleeding in patients through inhibiting platelet aggregation and
      prolonging of clot formation time. The Swedish Medical Products Agency recommends that
      patients stop taking the naturopathic medicines including fish oil two weeks prior planed
      surgery. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of fish oil given to healthy
      volunteers using point of care coagulation assessment and flow dependent Cellix instrument
      before and after intake of fish oil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will be given maximum dose of fish oil for 7 days. Blood samples will be
      collected before and immediately after the 7 days of intake and analysed using point of care
      coagulation assessment instruments and flow dependent platelet aggregation using a microfluid
      flow controlled system (Cellix). For point of care coagulation assessment the multiple
      electrode platelet aggregometer Multiplate, the viscoelastic rotational thromboelastometers
      ROTEM and Sonoclot will be used. Flow cytometry may also be utilized.
