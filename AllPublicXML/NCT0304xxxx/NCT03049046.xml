    <textblock>
      Approximately 21 subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) will be randomized (6 to
      1) to receive by mouth seven morning doses of CC100 or placebo for 7 days. Subjects are
      required to stay in the Clinic for approximately 9 hours following the first and last dose.
      Subjects will also have a mid-week clinic visit and will be contacted by phone within 3 to 5
      days after the last dose.

      Primary objective: to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of orally
      administered CC100 in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Secondary
      objectives: to determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CC100 in plasma after
      single and after multiple doses; and to determine short-term effects of CC100 on potential
      blood-cell ALS biomarkers.

      Study Design: Phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multiple-dose of three
      CC100-dose cohorts. Approximately 18 subjects will receive CC100. Approximately 3 subjects
      will be randomized to placebo (across 3 cohorts). Periodic Assessment Committee safety
      reviews. Note: Participation will not exclude subjects from future CC100 studies Criteria for
      Evaluation: Safety Endpoints: Adverse events, blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, vital
      signs, 12-lead ECGs. Pharmacokinetic (PK)/Pharmacodynamic (PD): Plasma for CC100
      concentrations (PK). Blood collected at baseline and after each subject's last dose will be
      assayed for potential biomarker(s). Stored specimens will be de-identified or combined for
      validating diagnostic tools/assays related to ALS. Statistical Methods: A minimum of 6
      subjects per CC100 dose group and 3 placebo-dosed subjects (total across cohorts) are
      considered sufficient to evaluate initial safety and tolerability for the cohorts.
      Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates will be calculated by standard noncompartmental methods
      of analysis. Absolute bioavailability of administration will be estimated based on the total
      area under the time- concentration curve (AUC0-âˆž).
