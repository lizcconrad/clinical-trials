  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, split-face, controlled clinical trial that aims to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of picosecond, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet
      laser laser therapy on patients with melasma, compared with 2% hydroquinone cream. The trial
      will be performed by two Korean institutions on 45 subjects.
