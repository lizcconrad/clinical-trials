    <textblock>
      This study will address the effectiveness of Family-centered Function Focused Care (Fam-FFC).
      Fam-FFC is a theoretically-based approach to care in which family caregivers partner with
      nurses to prevent functional decline and other complications related to hospitalization in
      older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. A systematic care pathway
      promotes information-sharing and decision-making that promotes physical activity, function,
      and cognitive stimulation during the hospitalization and immediate post-acute period. Our
      goal in this work is to establish a practical and effective way to optimize function and
      physical activity; decrease neuropsychiatric symptoms, delirium, and depression; prevent
      avoidable post-acute care dependency; and prevent unnecessary rehospitalizations and
      long-stay nursing home admissions, while mitigating family caregiver strain and burden.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are about two times as
      likely to be hospitalized as their peers who are cognitively healthy. The care of
      hospitalized persons with ADRD has traditionally focused on the acute medical problem that
      led to admission with little attention paid to functional recovery. Older persons with ADRD
      are at greater risk for functional decline and increased care dependency after discharge due
      to a combination of intrinsic factors, environmental, policy, and care practices that
      restrict physical and cognitive activity, and limited staff knowledge of dementia care.
      Family caregivers (CGs) can play an important role in promoting the functional recovery of
      hospitalized older adults. They can provide vital information, offer motivation and support
      of function-focused care, and assume responsibility in varying degrees for post-acute care
      delivery and coordination. Family-centered FFC (Fam-FFC) incorporates an educational
      empowerment model for family CGs provided within a social-ecological in-patient framework
      promoting specialized care to patients with ADRD. The intervention creates an &quot;enabling&quot;
      milieu for the person with ADRD through environmental and policy assessment/modification,
      staff education, unit-based champions, and individualized goal setting that focuses on
      functional recovery. In this patient/family-centered care approach, nurses purposefully
      engage family CGs in the assessment, decision-making, care delivery and evaluation of
      function-focused care during hospitalization and the 60-day post-acute period. In the
      proposed project, we will implement Fam-FFC in a cluster randomized trial of 438 patient/CG
      dyads in six hospital units randomized within three hospitals (73 dyads per unit) to
      accomplish the following aims: Aim 1: Validate the efficacy of Fam-FFC on physical function
      (ADLs/ performance and physical activity), delirium occurrence and severity, neuropsychiatric
      symptoms, and mood; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of Fam-FFC on family CG-centered outcomes
      (preparedness for caregiving, strain, burden, and desire to institutionalize); and Aim 3:
      Evaluate the relative costs for Fam-FFC v. control condition, and calculate health care cost
      (post-acute health care utilization) and total cost savings for Fam-FFC. We will also
      evaluate the cultural appropriateness of Fam-FCC for diverse families in our sample. Dyads
      will be composed of community-residing, hospitalized medical patients with very mild to
      moderate dementia (0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale) and their CG (defined as
      the primary person providing oversight and support on an ongoing basis). Outcomes will be
      evaluated at hospital admission, within 72 hours of discharge, and two and six months
      post-discharge. This study will be a critical next step in delineating how to partner with
      family CGs to change acute care approaches provided to patients with ADRD so as to optimize
      function after discharge, and promote delirium abatement and well-being in these individuals.
      The societal implications of helping older individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related
      dementias avoid functional decline are enormous in terms of aging in place, quality of life,
      cost, and caregiver burden. The study findings will be relevant for other areas of behavior
      change research in acute care, specifically those related to engaging patients and families
      in health care planning, delivery, and evaluation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patient Inclusion Criteria: medical patients who: are age ≥65, speak English or Spanish,
        live in the community prior to admission to the hospital, screen positive for dementia on
        well-validated scales (Montreal Cognitive Assessment {MoCA} ≤ 25 123-127 and AD8 &gt;2
        128,129), and score 0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale; and have a family CG
        as the designated study partner for the duration of the study.

        Patient Exclusion Criteria: mild cognitive impairment (CDR 0.5 without functional or ADL
        impairments), severe dementia (CDR 3), any significant neurological condition associated
        with cognitive impairment other than dementia (e.g. brain tumor), a major acute psychiatric
        disorder, have no family caregiver to participate, are enrolled in hospice and/or have a
        life expectancy of six months or less, are admitted from a nursing home, or experience
        transfers to another unit for stays longer than 48 hours.

        Family Inclusion Criteria: age 18 and above whose relatives meet inclusion criteria will be
        eligible if they can speak and read English or Spanish; and are related to the patient by
        blood, marriage, adoption, or affinity as a significant other (defined as or by the
        patient/legally authorized person as the primary person providing oversight and support on
        an ongoing basis); participate, at a minimum, in the initial assessment and development of
        FamPath; and able to recall at least two words on the MiniCog

        Staff nurses (at the conclusion of the intervention at each site) who identify the
        intervention unit as the primary unit worked, and speak English or Spanish, will be
        included in focus groups

        For the exploratory aim of assessing the cultural appropriateness of the intervention, we
        will recruit family caregivers who self-identify as black, Latino, Asian and white,
        randomly selected from the Fam-FFC sample. Approximately 10 percent of families from each
        ethnic group represented in the study will be approached for consent for participation in
        interviews. (If theoretical saturation is not reached, interviews will continue until
        saturation is reached). Additionally, the six nurse champions will be consented and
        interviewed after the study ends in his/her particular unit/setting to provide their
        perspective on the cultural appropriateness of Fam-FFC.
