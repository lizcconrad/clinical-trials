      Research suggests that when one spouse loses weight, the other spouse does too. This study
      will examine whether a ripple effect is observed in untreated spouses and children of
      individuals participating in a nationally available weight loss program. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either receive Weight Watchers immediately or at the end of a 6-month
      waiting period. Participants and untreated spouses (and any children in the home) will be
      assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months.
