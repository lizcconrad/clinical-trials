  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immediate potent inhibition of platelet function is critical for the prevention of
      periprocedural ischemic event occurrences in high risk N-ST segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (NSTEMI) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
      Currently, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and an oral P2Y12 receptor blocker (with
      loading doses) is widely used for PCI. However, immediate, potent and reversible inhibition
      of platelet aggregation is not possible even with the newer oral agents, prasugrel and
      ticagrelor. Therefore, an intravenously administered GPIIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor
      (tirofiban) or P2Y12 receptor blocker (cangrelor) with fast onset and offset of actions will
      provide more desired antiplatelet effects in the setting of PCI. This study will measure and
      compare the anti-platelet effects of Tirofiban and Cangrelor in patients presenting with
      N-STEMI and undergoing PCI.
