  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will examine how ethnic/racial background, body composition (%body fat),
      and the location of body fat affect the ability of the hormone insulin to promote uptake of
      blood sugar in persons who are 19 to 45 years of age. When insulin is ineffective in
      promoting blood sugar uptake, this condition is termed &quot;insulin resistance.&quot; Insulin
      resistance plays a major role in the development of chronic metabolic diseases (such as type
      2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer), many of which differ with race. Previous
      studies suggest that insulin resistance is higher in African-Americans (AA) vs.
      European-Americans (EA). However, results from these studies remain unclear due to different
      testing measures used for insulin resistance as well as differences in body fat between
      individuals. Results from this research study may help explain why insulin resistance differs
      with genetic background and may guide development of personalized treatment strategies with
      implications for several chronic metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
      disease, and cancer).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance plays a major role in the etiology of chronic metabolic diseases, many of
      which differ with race/ethnicity. Previous studies using mainly indirect methods suggest that
      insulin sensitivity is lower in AA vs. EA. Our preliminary data using the reference standard
      glucose clamp indicate that in lean individuals, insulin sensitivity is lower among AA, while
      in obese individuals, insulin sensitivity is higher among AA. We hypothesize that this
      race/body mass index (BMI) interaction may be explained in part by significantly lower
      visceral and hepatic fat accumulation in AA. Conversely, based on our preliminary data, we
      hypothesize that inherently greater oxidative stress impairs insulin sensitivity even in AA,
      explaining lower insulin sensitivity in lean AA vs. EA. We propose to test these hypotheses
      by prospectively comparing skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity in healthy lean,
      overweight, and obese AA and EA using the hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp.
      Analysis of ancestral genes will permit simultaneous assessment of the contribution of
      ancestry to main outcomes.
