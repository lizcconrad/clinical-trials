  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing interest in the effects of various food derived polyphenols on
      vascular function. Arguably the most well-established vascular benefits are attributed to
      flavanols from cocoa beans and this has been supported by a successful health claim through
      the European Food Safely Authority in 2012. Berry fruits are another rich source of
      polyphenols that have vasoactive properties, and there is a growing body of research
      exploring these effects in various berries (blueberries, cranberries, strawberries) and other
      fruit products with similar polyphenol composition. A key (poly)phenol in berries and other
      fruits believed to provide much of the benefit is anthocyanins. When given as an isolated
      extract, 320 mg anthocyanins have been found to improve blood vessel function both acutely
      and in response to chronic consumption over 12 weeks.

      Aronia berries are a native North American berry with high naturally occurring anthocyanins
      among other polyphenols. Based on their polyphenol composition, there is growing interest in
      the potential for Aronia berries to elicit health promoting cardio-metabolic effects.
      Specifically, Aronia berry extracts, which provide a concentrated source of polyphenols, may
      improve blood vessel function.

      Thus, the primary focus of this project is to evaluate the effects of Aronia berry extracts
      of differing polyphenol dose on vascular endothelial function.
