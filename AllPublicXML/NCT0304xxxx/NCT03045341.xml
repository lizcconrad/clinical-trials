  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness and relative efficacy of behavioral and pharmacologic
      treatments, alone and in combination, for the treatment of binge eating disorder (BED) in
      patients with obesity. This is an acute treatment comparing behavioral weight loss alone or
      in combination with naltrexone/bupropion medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder, is associated
      strongly with obesity and bio-psychosocial impairment. Improved treatments for obese patients
      with BED are needed that can produce sustained clinical outcomes and promote weight loss.
      This study (acute treatment stage) aims to test the effectiveness of behavioral weight loss
      (BWL) and pharmacological treatment with Naltrexone/Bupropion (NB; a recently FDA-approved
      anti-obesity combination medication), alone and in combination, for the treatment of BED in
      patients with obesity. The acute treatment stage stage RCT will provide new findings
      regarding the effectiveness of NB medication and whether this specific combination of BWL and
      NB medication is effective for patients with obesity and BED. N=160 patients with BED and
      obesity will be randomly assigned (double-blind) in a balanced factorial (2 X 2) design
      trial, to one of four 16-week interventions: BWL+NB, BWL+Placebo, NB, or Placebo. This study
      will produce important new information about the relative efficacy of BWL and this recently
      FDA-approved anti-obesity (NB medicine), alone and in combination, for BED in patients with
      obesity.
