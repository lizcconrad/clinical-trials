  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to develop and validate a visio-behavioral scale of
      visual abilities for subjects with profound multiple intellectual disabilities.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  to validate the structure of the scale.

        -  to evaluate the reproducibility of scale with the intra- and inter-examiners, and the
           influence of the different professions of examiners.

        -  to evaluate the feasibility of visio-behavioral scale.

        -  to evaluate the sensitivity to change.

        -  to study the uniformity of use of the scale depending on the type of patients (age,
           disability level, pathology).

        -  to study the prevalence of the visual disorder in profound multiple intellectual
           disabilities subjects.

      This study includes 3 phases:

        -  Elaboration of a list of behavioral items by a group of multi-disciplinary expertise
           (physicians, nurses, caregivers, ophthalmologies, orthoptists) based on their clinical
           experiences.

        -  Development of the scale based on the sample obtained by a prospective multicenter
           research trial.

        -  Validation of the sample obtained by a prospective transversal multicenter study.

      This study will be performed in 5 centers in France. The enrollment of patients planned for
      24 months targeting 310 patients. The duration of follow-up of the study for each patient
      will be varied according to the group of patients, il will be 1 day for group 1, 2 weeks for
      group 2, or 6 months for group 3.
