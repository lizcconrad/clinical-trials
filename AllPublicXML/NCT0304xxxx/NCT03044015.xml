      BACKGROUND Recent evidence has been published about the effectiveness for the secondary
      prevention of osteoporotic fractures (OF) of the hospital-based fracture liaison services.

      AIM To assess the effectiveness of a primary care based intervention in the secondary
      prevention of OF.

      METHODOLOGY Prospective study of random clusters, defined at the primary-care trust (PCT)
      level. Total study follow-up 3 years. Sample size 1800 patients.

      DESCRIPTION To launch a defined strategy for the identification of OF. To carry out a primary
      care based intervention about lifestyle, diet and drug prescription, if needed, with an
      intensive follow-up in the intervention PCT vs treatment as usual in the control branch.

      ANALYSIS As the outcome are the new OF, a survival analysis will be done. Risk factors will
      be analyzed through Cox proportional hazard regression model stratified by age groups.

      Outcomes :

        -  new OF ratio in intervention vs control areas.

        -  maintenance of the adherence to the pharmacological and non pharmacological
           interventions proposed

        -  assessment of cost-effectivity of the intervention
