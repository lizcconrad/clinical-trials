  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant neoplasm originating from the epithelial cells lining
      the intra- or extrahepatic biliary ducts. It is the second-most common liver cancer, after
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). About 6,000 people in the United States develop bile duct
      cancer each year. One-year survival is less than 25% and no effective and safe systemic
      treatments are currently available. Last year the completion of open-label phase 2 trial
      (NCT02256514) of hepcortespenlisimut-L (V5) has been reported, which has shown that two-third
      of Mongolian patients with advanced HCC had a favorable clinical response, including complete
      remissions and with overall survival over 90% after 1 year. So far a few patients with CCA
      were treated with V5, but it appeared that their response rate was somewhat inferior to
      patients with HCC since two (both with hemochromatosis) out six patients died within 6
      months. In one patient who had improved clinically, the improvement was correlated with
      decrease in CA19-9 tumor marker, but no marker profile information is available in regard to
      other CCA patients. As V5 tablets are made from pooled blood of patients with HCC, in theory,
      they will be not very useful to patients with CCA. The goal of this project is to manufacture
      an immunotherapeutic formulation made from pooled heat- and chemically-inactivated blood from
      donors with CCA and initiate pilot open-label trial in 20 cholangiocarcinoma patients. This
      clinical trial will be conducted in collaboration with the National Cancer Center.

      Upon obtaining regulatory and ethical approvals the Phase II single-arm study will be
      initiated at the NCC involving 20 patients with confirmed CCA diagnosis. The trial will be
      short, it will last only 2 months, but this will be sufficient to gauge the safety and
      efficacy. Only those patients who have higher than normal levels of CA19-9 tumor marker will
      be enrolled, which will serve as a surrogate marker in a manner alpha fetoprotein (AFP) has
      been used as a predictor of clinical response in HCC patients. Additional primary endpoints
      will be overall survival and changes in tumor burden, with secondary endpoints being liver
      function tests and changes in quality of life.
