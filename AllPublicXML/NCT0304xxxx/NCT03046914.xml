  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) is a rare but fatal condition.
      Previous reports have reported that HLA-B*5801 is an important genetic risk factor
      significantly associated with the development of allopurinol-induced SCAR. However, there has
      been no prospective study to prove the clinical efficacy of a HLA-B*5801 screening before
      administration of allopurinol in predicting allopurinol-induced SCAR. The purpose of this
      prospective study is to test our hypothesis that a pre-screening of HLA-B*5801 will
      significantly reduce the risk of allopurinol-induced SCAR development compared to the
      historical control.
