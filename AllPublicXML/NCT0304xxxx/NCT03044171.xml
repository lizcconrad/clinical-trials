      The objective of this double blind, randomized and controlled clinical study, was to evaluate
      the efficacy of 1.1% sodium fluoride associated with LLLT (Low Level Laser Therapy) on teeth
      that were exposed to 35% hydrogen peroxide during 4 weeks of bleaching treatment. Methods: 25
      volunteers were evaluated through the split-mouth model, where the hemiarcates were
      ranzomized and later allocated in one of the experimental groups: G-FLUOR+LASER - constitutes
      the group treated with LLLT + 1.1% sodium fluoride; and G-FLUOR - constitutes the group
      treated with placebo + 1.1% sodium fluoride .
