  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive lung disease is an increasing global health problem of pandemic proportions, with
      COPD alone affecting &gt;10% of the population. Smoking is the main and most well studies risk
      factor for developing COPD. However, chronic airway obstruction also in never-smoking
      populations has recently been recognized as an increasing health problem.

      In the clinical segment (PI: Prof. C. Magnus Skold), 1000 subjects from the Swedish national
      SCAPIS study will be clinically well characterized in one of the six Swedish University
      Hospital Respiratory clinics (clinical site PIs: Anders Andersson, Leif Bjermer, Anders
      Blomberg, Christer Janson, Lennart Persson, Magnus Skold). This first screening includes all
      never-smokers with COPD identified in the SCAPIS study. A subset of 300 subjects from the
      groups of Healthy never-smokers, current-smokers with normal lung function, current-smokers
      with COPD, ex-smokers with COPD, and never-smokers with COPD will be selected for the
      Bronchoscopy segment, were sampling will be performed from a number of anatomical locations,
      including bronchial biopsies, airway epithelial brushings, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Serum,
      plasma, and urine samples will also be collected.

      In the systems medicine segment (PI: Assoc. prof Asa M. Wheelock), alterations at the
      epigenetic, mRNA, microRNA, proteome, metabolome and microbiome level will be performed from
      multiple lung compartments (airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages, exosomes, and
      bronchoalveolar exudates). By means of biostatistics and bioinformatics approaches, specific
      mediators and molecular pathways critical in the pathological mechanisms of obstructive lung
      disease related to never-smoker disease phenotypes will be identified.

      In the immunohistochemistry segment (PI: Prof. Jonas Erjefalt), a number of molecules of
      relevance for disease pathology will be investigated in bronchial biopsies collected from the
      300 subjects in the Bronchoscopy segment.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an umbrella diagnosis defined by obstructive
      lung function impairments, and is likely to be caused by a multitude of etiologies including
      environmental exposures, genetic predispositions and developmental factors. Due to the
      heterogeneity of the disease, molecular and mechanistic sub-phenotyping of COPD represents an
      essential step to facilitate the development of relevant diagnostic and treatment options for
      this constantly growing patient group. In the BRONCHO-SCAPIS study, molecular sub-phenotypes
      of smoking-induced COPD are investigated. A particular focus relates to recent
      epidemiological indications of an increasing proportion of never-smokers developing the
      disease. The study encompasses profiling of mRNA, miRNA, proteomes, metabolomes and lipid
      mediators of from multiple lung compartments (airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages,
      exosomes, and bronchoalveolar exudates) using a range of 'omics platforms, in combination
      with extensive clinical phenotyping of early stage COPD patients, never-smokers, and smokers
      with normal lung function from both genders. The primary objective of the study is to
      identify molecular sub-phenotypes of never-smokers with COPD, specifically by correlating
      clinical phenotypes multi-molecular 'omics profiling from multiple lung compartments of early
      stage COPD patients compared to healthy and at-risk control populations. Secondary goals
      involve identification of subsets of prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers for classification of
      the defined subgroups, as well as relevant pharmaceutical targets.
