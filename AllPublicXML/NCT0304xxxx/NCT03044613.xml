  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) or Anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) administration in the pre-operative
      setting and nivolumab combined with chemoradiation will be safe and feasible in patients with
      resectable distal esophageal/gastroesophageal junction cancer and will change cellular and
      molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment that will improve survival.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IB study assessing the safety of 2 cycles of induction (Arm A) nivolumab or
      (Arm B) 1 cycle of induction nivolumab plus ipilimumab prior to concurrent chemoradiation
      plus nivolumab before surgical resection in operable stage II/III esophageal/gastroesophageal
      junction cancer.

      Approximately 32 patients will be enrolled on study with 16 enrolled on Arm A and if no
      unexpected toxicities then an additional 16 patients will be enrolled on Arm B.
