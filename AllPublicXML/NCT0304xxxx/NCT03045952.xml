    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA of liver cancer is a relatively new technique with
      favorable long-term outcomes.Butthe results are mainly from single center reports.A larger
      scale data need to be analyzed to evaluate the technique. This study is designed to
      investigated the efficacy of cooled-tip microwave ablation (MWA) for primary liver cancer
      (PLC) and analyzed the prognostic factors on a multicenter database.Between January 2013 and
      December 2018, all the PLC patients underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous cooled-tip MWA
      as a primary treatment will be enrolled from at least ten Chinese institutions with different
      levels of MWA experience. All the patients will be closely followed up until June 2019.
      Clinicopathologic data, recurrence and survival estimates, complications and
      prognosis-relative factors will be measured.

    <description>Antenna in the microwave ablation device was percutaneously inserted into the tumor and placed at designated place under US guidance. For tumors less than 1.5 cm, one antenna was inserted and for tumors measuring 1.5 cm or greater, two antennae were inserted in parallel with an inter-antenna distance of 1.0-2.5 cm, which were used simultaneously during MWA to obtain larger ablation zone. A 20G thermocouple was inserted about 0.5-1 cm away from the tumor for real-time temperature monitoring during MWA. MW emission didn't stop until the heat-generated hyperechoic water vapor completely encompassed the entire tumor and the measured temperature reached 60°C or remained above 54°C for at least three minutes.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  absence of ascites or the depth of ascites on US detection less than 4 cm;

          -  a normal serum total bilirubin level or less than 60 µmol/L;

          -  a normal albumin level or not less than 30 g/L;

          -  for radical treatment, single lesion of 8 cm or smaller, three or fewer multiple
             lesions with a maximum diameter of 4 cm or less, absence of portal vein cancerous
             thrombus or extrahepatic metastases;

          -  for palliative treatment, those with large or multiple lesions, suffering multiple
             metastases and unsuitable for other modalities can be considered to undergo the MWA on
             the condition of good hepatic function and blood coagulation function to tolerate the
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Contraindications include patients who have

          1. clinical evident liver failure, such as massive ascites or hepatic encephalopathy or
             with a trance-like state;

          2. severe blood coagulation dysfunction (prothrombin time of more than 30 seconds,
             prothrombin activity less than 40%, and platelet count less than 30 cells×109/L);

          3. high intrahepatic tumor burden (tumor volume &gt;70% of the target liver volume or
             multiple tumor nodules) or high extrahepatic tumor burden;

          4. acute or active inflammatory and infectious lesions at any organ;

          5. acute or severe chronic renal failure, pulmonary insufficiency or heart dysfunction;

          6. relative contraindication concerns medical risk for the tumor proximity to diaphragm,
             gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas, hepatic hilum and major bile duct or
             vessels, which may require adjunctive techniques to prevent off-target heating of
             adjacent structures during the ablation procedure.
