      Study design: A double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial

      Intervention: Randomized placebo controlled treatment of 20 HS patients of which fifteen
      patients will be randomized to apremilast and five patients to placebo. The total duration of
      the treatment period per subject is 16 weeks.

      Primary objectives: To evaluate the expression profile of inflammatory cytokines in HS
      lesional skin at week four (t=4) and week sixteen (t=16):

        -  of patients receiving apremilast compared to placebo;

        -  within both groups relative to baseline (t=0).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To prospectively evaluate the clinical efficacy of apremilast.

        -  To assess the effect of apremilast on patient reported outcomes measures.

        -  To assess the short-term safety and tolerability of apremilast in patients with
           hidradenitis suppurativa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent, debilitating skin
      disease. It is characterized by painful, deep-seated, inflamed boils in the inverse areas of
      the body, most commonly the axillae, inguinal and anogenital regions.

      Systemic therapy with immunosuppressive agents (systemic corticosteroids, dapsone,
      cyclosporin) has been investigated in the past decades and has shown limited efficacy. The
      use of the selective immunosuppressant apremilast has not yet been evaluated in HS. The
      investigators hypothesize a beneficial effect of apremilast in HS patients, similar to the
      efficacy of apremilast in psoriasis patients. Namely, it has been shown that the immune
      dysregulation in the pathogenesis of HS shows many similarities with that of psoriasis.
      Moreover, the TNF-α blocker adalimumab was registered for HS after approval for the treatment
      in patients with psoriasis.
