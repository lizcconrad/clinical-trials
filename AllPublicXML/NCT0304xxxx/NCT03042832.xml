      This study will test the effects of the Leadership and Organizational Change for
      Implementation (LOCI) intervention in facilitating evidence-based practice (EBP)
      implementation in substance use disorder (SUD) and HIV services settings. LOCI improves
      implementation leadership and organizational support to develop strategic climate for EBP
      implementation. Greater efficiency and effectiveness of EBP implementation will improve the
      public health impact of evidence-based health and allied healthcare innovations and lead to
      greater effectiveness of SUD and HIV services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address complex and widespread
      public health issues, such as substance use disorders (SUDs) and HIV, remains a substantial
      challenge. Leadership and organizational context are associated with implementation climate
      and attitudes toward EBP, as well as clinical outcomes such as client satisfaction and
      quality of life. While there are many leadership development approaches, they are often not
      based on empirically supported approaches and curricula, nor are they specifically designed
      to develop strategic climates for EBP implementation. This project addresses these concerns
      and advances implementation science by testing the effects of the Leadership and
      Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) intervention. The goals of the LOCI
      intervention are to improve general leadership and implementation leadership and utilize
      organizational strategies to create a positive strategic organizational climate for EBP
      implementation. These should lead to more positive SUD treatment provider attitudes and
      behaviors that support EBP implementation outcomes of intervention fidelity and
      implementation process. Consistent with the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation,
      Sustainment (EPIS) conceptual framework, LOCI creates change at multiple levels within a
      provider organization (e.g., executives/mid- managers, workgroup leader, service provider) to
      foster a context supportive of EBP implementation and sustainment. Initial support for the
      feasibility, acceptability, and utility of the LOCI intervention have been successfully
      demonstrated in an NIH supported pilot study (R21MH082731, PI: Aarons). The proposed study
      will test whether LOCI can achieve change in outcomes of general and implementation
      leadership, implementation climate, implementation process, and EBP fidelity in SUD treatment
      agencies. Seventy-two workgroup leaders and their providers (i.e., subordinates) will be
      randomized to either the LOCI condition or a webinar control condition. All direct SUD
      treatment providers in both conditions will receive training in Motivational Interviewing
      (MI), a leading EBP for SUD and HIV prevention and treatment. The test of LOCI will occur
      within four agencies that provide SUD treatment at multiple sites across California. The test
      of the LOCI intervention will include SUD service providers (n=320), workgroup leaders
      (n=60), and agency executives/mid-managers (n=16). Hypotheses will be tested comparing LOCI
      and control group outcomes of leadership, implementation climate, psychological safety
      climate, provider attitudes and behaviors, MI fidelity, and implementation process. The
      proposed study will provide a practical implementation strategy that can be utilized to
      improve workgroup leadership and strategic climate for EBP implementation.

    <description>The Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS: Aarons et al., 2014) is a brief 12-item measure with four subscales: Proactive Leadership, Knowledgeable Leadership, Supportive Leadership, and Perseverant Leadership. This measure will be included in the survey for providers, workgroup supervisors, and managers/executives. Data will be aggregated at the workgroup level.</description>

    <description>The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ: Bass &amp; Avolio, 1990) is one of the most widely used measures of leadership in organizations. The MLQ assesses transformational and transactional leadership. This measure will be included in the survey for providers, workgroup supervisors, and managers/executives.</description>

    <description>1. The Implementation Climate Scale (ICS; Ehrhart, Aarons, &amp; Farahnak, 2015) will be used to assess organizational climate for implementation. ICS dimensions include 1) focus on EBP, 2) educational support for EBP, 3) recognition for EBP, 4) rewards for EBP, 5) selection for EBP, and 6) selection for openness. Data will be aggregated at the workgroup level.</description>

    <description>The Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS; Aarons 2004 will assess individuals attitudes toward EBP. The EBPAS is a 15-item measure with four subscales that assess attitudes toward adoption of EBP as a function of perceived appeal EBP, Requirements to use EBP, provider Openness, and perceived Divergence between EBP and usual care. The EBPAS is an individual level construct and will not be aggregated to the workgroup level.</description>

    <description>The Implementation Citizenship Behavior Scale (ICBS; Ehrhart, Aarons, Farahnak, 2015) [69] will be used to assess individuals EBP implementation citizenship behavior. The ICBS was adapted from an existing reliable and valid measure of safety citizenship behavior in the workplace [76] and assesses the extent to which individual workgroup members go above and beyond minimum requirements to support successful EBP implementation in regard to helping others and keeping informed. The ICBS is an individual level construct and will not be aggregated to the workgroup level.</description>
