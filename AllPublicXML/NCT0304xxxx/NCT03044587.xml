  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether a combination of 5-FU and nal-IRI prolongs
      progression-free survival in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of
      the biliary tract

             &lt; 1.5 ULN within 7 days prior to randomization. The use of full dose anticoagulants is
             allowed as long as the INR or PTT is within therapeutic limits (according to the
             medical standard in the institution) and the patient has been on a stable dose for
             anticoagulants for at least three weeks at the time of randomization

             results

         17. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the

         18. Previous enrollment or randomization in the present study (does not include screening
             failure).

         19. Any other chemotherapy at study start

         20. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study

             by the authorities.

         23. Patients who are unable to consent because they do not understand the nature,
             significance and implications of the clinical trial and therefore cannot form a
