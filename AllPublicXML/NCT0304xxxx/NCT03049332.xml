  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is to develop a culturally sensitive and feasible self- and family-management
      intervention that will assist HIV+ Chinese women and their families to manage the illness and
      improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 3 phases.

      Phase 1: The PI conducted a secondary qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews to further
      illuminate the sociocultural and family context of HIV+ Chinese women. The data were obtained
      from three previous projects conducted in China from 2005 to 2011.

      Phase 2: The PI developed and adapted a theory-driven, culturally sensitive and feasible
      intervention to improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes of HIV+ Chinese women and
      their families.

      Phase 3: The PI conducted a feasibility, compliance, and acceptability study for a self- and
      family-management intervention with HIV+ women and of their family members.
