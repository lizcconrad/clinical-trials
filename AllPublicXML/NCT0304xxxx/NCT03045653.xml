    <textblock>
      Background: Endocrine therapy is an effective and safe treatment for hormone receptor
      positive breast cancer. Unfortunately , endocrine treatment resistance occurs and there is an
      urgent need for treatment alternative. Laboratory researches and clinical case reports
      indicate that hormone receptor-high expressed breast cancer patients may potentially benefit
      from high-dose Tamoxifen or high-dose Tamoxifen plus chemotherapy , providing a new option
      for treatment strategy.

      Aim: To explore the efficacy and safety of high-dose Tamoxifen to advanced hormone
      receptor-high expressed endocrine therapy resisted breast cancer.

      Methods: Eligible patients will be treated with tamoxifen 100 mg/d or high-dose Tamoxifen(100
      mg/d ) plus chemotherapy. Blood and tumor samples will be obtained from the patients.

      Primary endpoint: clinical benefit rate at 16 weeks(CBR)
