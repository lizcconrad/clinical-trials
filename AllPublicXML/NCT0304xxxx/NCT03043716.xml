  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telemonitoring for Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy might help to establish and
      maintain long-term therapy adherence and thus support the beneficial effects of PAP therapy
      on long-term outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Airway obstructions, airflow resistance by partial occlusion of the airways or central
      sleep-breathing disorders, where the respiratory effort is reduced or stops, cause a
      reduction in airflow and lead to arousals from sleep and disturbances in gas exchange during
      sleep. The negative consequences manifest in increases of blood pressure, higher workload for
      the heart and daytime sleepiness. PAP (positive airway pressure) treats sleep-related
      breathing disorders. It applies pressure to nose and mouth to keep the airway from collapsing
      and provides pressure support to assist the respiratory muscles. The efficacy of the therapy
      is measured with apnoea- and hypopnoea-indices that count the total number of apnoeic events
      at night. To ensure an efficacious and efficient therapy, pressures have to be adjusted
      correctly and the patient needs to use PAP regularly.

      Telemonitoring is information and communication technology to exchange sleep data and to
      provide clinical guidance over distances. There is no defined spectrum of technology. It can
      comprise phone calls, video support or interaction programs via the internet. Some studies
      point to advantages of telemonitoring in keeping compliance upright, increase usage hours and
      some also point to economic advantages. However, we do not have conclusive data from large
      trials with telemonitoring on the long-term that would show conclusive effects, be it from
      the side of a patient or from a cost and labour perspective of providers or the healthcare
      sector. Still, there are uncertainties regarding data safety, reimbursement or connectivity
      of different systems.

      No long-term data of PAP therapy under telemonitoring and its effect on compliance and
      therapy outcomes is available by now.

    <description>Usage Patterns are hours/night and nights/month that therapy has been used. Telemonitoring enables the physician to remotely supervise device usage. Usage will be assessed through data recordings of the device: Days of usage &gt;3hours; Days of usage &lt;3 hours; total recorded days; mean daily usage (minutes); total usage hours (h)</description>

    <description>Efficacy is measured through changes in Apnea-Hypopnea-Index AHI (numbers of apneas - reduction of airflow by &gt;90% for at least 10 seconds - and hypopneas - reduction of airflow by &gt;30% for at least 10 seconds with a 4% decrease of Oxygen Saturation - divided by hours of sleep), AI - apnea index (apneas per hour), HI hypopnea index (hypopneas per hour).</description>
