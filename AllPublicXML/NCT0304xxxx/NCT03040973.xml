        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is currently receiving treatment with INC280 monotherapy within a
             Novartis-sponsored study which has fulfilled the requirements for the primary
             objective and, in the opinion of the Investigator, would benefit from continued
             treatment.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other
             study procedures.

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in the roll-over study and
             receiving study medication. If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be
             formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has been previously permanently discontinued from INC280 study treatment in
             the parent study due to any reason.

          -  Patient currently has unresolved toxicities for which INC280 dosing has been
             interrupted in the parent study (Patients meeting all other eligibility criteria may
             be enrolled once toxicities have resolved to allow INC280 dosing to resume).

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 7 days after stopping treatment.

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 7 days after stopping treatment.
