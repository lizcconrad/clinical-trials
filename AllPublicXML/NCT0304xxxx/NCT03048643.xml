  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalizations for severe infections associated with opioid use disorder (OUD), such as
      infective endocarditis (IE), have doubled in the US over the past decade and are frequently
      prolonged and resource-intensive. Once medically stabilized, persons with IE but without drug
      use typically enroll in outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT), while persons with
      IE and OUD are kept in the hospital for the duration of therapy (often 6 weeks or more)
      largely due to concerns of ongoing drug use. Unfortunately, hospitalization for IE with OUD
      infrequently includes evidence-based medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine
      or methadone to address the OUD, despite the strong evidence that MAT decreases illicit drug
      use and mortality. Enrolling hospitalized persons with IE due to OUD into comprehensive MAT
      (i.e., buprenorphine + counseling) while inpatient, and providing an intensive transitional
      outpatient care program supporting MAT, may support provision of outpatient IV antibiotic
      therapy and be cost effective. The primary aim of this pilot randomized clinical trial is to
      evaluate the equivalence of current practice plus buprenorphine (keeping patients with IE due
      to opioid use disorder in the hospital for the full duration of antibiotic treatment)
      compared to OPAT plus buprenorphine (discharge with outpatient treatment once medically
      stable).
