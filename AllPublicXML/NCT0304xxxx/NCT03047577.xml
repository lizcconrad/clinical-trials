  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients non-electively admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) will be screened for
      eligibility. The investigators will include adult patients with risk level alcohol use,
      defined by AUDIT-C score (&gt;5 for females, &gt;6 for males). Informed consent will be obtained
      from the patient in the end or shortly after the ICU treatment, when they have regained
      sufficient cognitive function. 600 patients will be randomized to receive either routine
      treatment or a brief intervention (BI). The BI includes a 20 minute discussion with
      pre-educated study personnel, option to discussion with a social worker and written material.
      Primary outcome measure is the amount of alcohol used during the preceding week (g/week), at
      6 and 12 months after study entry. The information will be obtained 1)in an interview by a
      study team member blinded for the intervention arm at 6 months 2) A letter of a telephone
      interview at 12 months. AUDIT score, EQ-5D and mortality will also be recorded.
