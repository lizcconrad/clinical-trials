  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of a variety of effective treatments for smoking cessation, uptake
      of treatments is low. The increasing use of smartphone technology presents an exceptional
      opportunity to expand access to low-cost smoking cessation services. In this pilot study, the
      investigators will use a text-messaging platform to test peer mentoring for smoking
      cessation, delivered by former smokers. While peer mentoring is a common approach to health
      behavior change, it has rarely been used to maximum effect by smoking cessation programs. The
      text-messaging platform serves as the basis for a randomized controlled trial to test the
      effectiveness of peer mentoring for smoking cessation.

      This pilot will include approximately 200 U.S. adult smokers who will be randomly assigned to
      a peer mentor or not. Participants in the control group will receive automated text messages
      used in SmokefreeTXT, a nationwide text-messaging service sponsored by the National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) in which users receive one to five automated messages per day for up to eight
      weeks. Smokers in the intervention group will receive a modified version of the same
      automated messages from SmokefreeTXT, but with additional personalized messages from an
      assigned peer mentor. Mentors will provide responses to specific questions or comments a
      smoker may have after receiving the automated messages.

      The intervention will last 8 weeks. The study includes primary outcomes to measure the
      acceptability, engagement, user experience, and early efficacy of the intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Saliva test for cotinine</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after quit day</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure of early efficacy is the 7-day point prevalence of abstinence measured 3 months after the quit day, using a saliva cotinine test. The saliva test results will be recorded through a series of photographs and shared with the study team via email or online upload. Participants who self-report having smoked in the last 7 days, as part of the follow-up survey, will be considered to be continuing smokers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported smoking status</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after quit day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will self-report 7-day point prevalence of abstinence in the follow-up survey, measured 3 months after the quit day.</description>

    <measure>Duration of engagement</measure>

    <description>The primary measure of participant engagement is the number of days from enrollment since the participant last replied to a message asking about the person's status (e.g., mood and cravings).

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the program</measure>

    <description>The primary measure of acceptability of the intervention is the self-reported rating of participants to the statement, &quot;I liked participating in the iQuit Project.&quot; Responses will be on a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;completely disagree&quot; to &quot;completely agree.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants who correctly self-report their message type</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after quit day</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure of user experience in the intervention is whether participants correctly identify the type of messages they received: automated or personal from a mentor. The measure has four categories:
assigned to automated messages and self-reports receiving automated messages only,
assigned to automated messages and self-reports receiving at least some messages from a mentor,
assigned to mentor messages and self-reports receiving at least some mentor messages, and
assigned to mentor messages and self-reports receiving automated messages only.</description>
