  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to confirm the safety of the selected dose and potential toxicity
      of oncolytic poliovirus (PV) immunotherapy with PVSRIPO for pediatric patients with recurrent
      WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma, but evidence for efficacy will also be sought. The
      primary objective is to confirm the safety of the selected dose of PVSRIPO when delivered
      intracerebrally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in children with recurrent WHO Grade
      III malignant glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma, anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) or WHO Grade IV malignant glioma
      (glioblastoma, gliosarcoma). A secondary objective is to estimate overall survival (OS) in
      this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PVSRIPO will be delivered intratumorally by CED using an intracerebral catheter placed within
      the enhancing portion of the tumor. The population group are patients with recurrent WHO
      grade III or IV malignant glioma who are aged 12 through 18 years old. After a single dose of
      PVSRIPO, subjects will return for periodic visits to monitor tumor status, adverse events,
      and changes in blood immune profiles. A maximum of 12 pediatric patients will be treated with
      PVSRIPO, and then carefully monitored for safety for at least a year after treatment.

    <description>PVSRIPO will be delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor. A stereotactic biopsy will be performed prior to virus administration. Immediately following the stereotactically-guided tumor biopsy, a catheter will be implanted in the operating room at a site the same or different from that used for the biopsy using sterile techniques under general anesthesia. The entire volume of PVSRIPO to be delivered will be pre-loaded into a syringe by the investigational pharmacist and connected to the catheter under sterile conditions in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) just prior to beginning of infusion.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO Grade III malignant glioma
             (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma,
             anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, ependymoma) or WHO Grade IV malignant glioma
             (glioblastoma, gliosarcoma) based on imaging studies with measurable disease (≥ 1 cm
             and ≤ 5.5 cm of contrast-enhancing tumor). The prior histopathology must be consistent
             with a World Health Organization (WHO) Grade III or IV malignant glioma confirmed by
             the study pathologist, Roger McLendon, or his designee. There is no standard of care
             treatment for children with Grade III/IV gliomas. Patients must have completed
             first-line treatments including surgical procedure and a minimum of 54 Gray of
             radiation prior to participating in this trial.

          -  Due to the potential implications of the treatment on the developing CNS, all patients
             must be ≥ 12 years of age and ≤ 18 years of age at the time of entry into the study.

          -  The patient must have a Lansky or Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) of ≥ 70% at the
             time of entry.

          -  Laboratory Studies:

          -  Platelet count ≥ 125,000 per microliter prior to biopsy. Platelets ≥ 100,000 per
             microliter prior to infusion;

          -  Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) prior
             to biopsy;

          -  Positive serum anti-poliovirus titer ≥ 1:8 prior to biopsy;

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x ULN prior to biopsy;

          -  Total bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN prior to biopsy;

          -  Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 per microliter prior to biopsy;

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dl prior to biopsy (can be transfused).

          -  The patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL™
             (Sanofi-Pasteur) ≥ 1 week prior to administration of the study agent.

          -  At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis.

          -  A signed informed consent form approved by the Duke University Institutional Review
             Board (IRB) will be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients (if 18
             years old) or their parent(s) or guardian(s) must be able to read and understand the
             informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating that they are
             aware of the investigational nature of this study. All children will have to provide
             assent to the study.

          -  Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast without requiring general
             anesthesia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding. Female patients of child-bearing potential or female
             sexual partners (who are of child-bearing potential) of male patients must use at
             least one of the following methods of medically acceptable contraceptives: approved
             hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, implants or infusions),
             an intrauterine device (IUD), or a barrier method of contraception (such as a condom
             or diaphragm) used ith spermicide. Because all patients are required to have a boost
             immunization of trivalent inactivated IPOL™, there should be no risk of transmission
             of a mother to her fetus after receiving intracranial PVSRIPO. As such, patients who
             become pregnant after receiving PVSRIPO will continue to be monitored in the same
             manner, i.e. per protocol, unless the assessment is contra-indicated during pregnancy.
             Partners who become pregnant will sign a Pregnant Partner Information Form and
             information regarding the pregnancy and its outcome may be collected.

          -  Patients with an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on
             the assessment of the study neurosurgeon.

          -  Patients with an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an
             unexplained febrile illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5°F).

          -  Patients with known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency virus
             infection.

          -  Patients with unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe heart
             (New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4) or lung (FEV1 &lt; 50%) disease, uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus.

          -  Patients with albumin allergy.

          -  Gadolinium allergy.

          -  A history of neurological complications due to past PV infection would imply previous
             virus replication in the CNS. Based on animal studies, previous exposure to poliovirus
             administered intracerebrally can reduce subsequent virus replication in the CNS.

          -  Patients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemo- and/or
             radiation therapy. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific
             therapeutic agent being used:

          -  Patients who are less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive disease
             outside of the radiation field or 2 consecutive scans with disease progression or
             histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor.

          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for
             nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or
             cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have
             recovered from side effects of such therapy.

          -  Patients who have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study drug
             unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy.

          -  Patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord, tumors
             extending into or crossing the corpus callosum, intraventricular tumors, pineal
             tumors, pituitary tumors, radiological evidence of active (growing) multifocal
             disease, leptomeningeal disease, or other locations at the discretion of the treating
             neurosurgeon.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia, that is:

          -  Undetectable anti-tetanus toxoid IgG

          -  Known history of agammaglobulinemia

          -  Patients who are on dexamethasone receiving &gt; 4 mg/day in the two weeks prior to
             admission for intra-cerebral delivery of PVSRIPO.

          -  Patients with worsening steroid myopathy (history of gradual progression of bilateral
             proximal muscle weakness, and atrophy of proximal muscle groups).

          -  Patients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the
             exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin.
