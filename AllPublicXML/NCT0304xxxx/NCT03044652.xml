    <description>&quot;Vulvovaginal dryness&quot; will be measured by the Total Severity Score. It is defined as the sum score of the single subjective symptom parameters dryness, itching, burning and pain unrelated to sexual intercourse, each scored from 0=none to 4=very severe. In total a range of 0=no complaints to 16=very severe complaints is possible. Differences to Baseline (Visit 1) of the Total Severity Score assessed after six weeks of treatment (Visit 3) serve as the primary endpoint for the test of non-inferiority.</description>
