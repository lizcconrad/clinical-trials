  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the interrelationship between cachexia, neural
      invasion and diabetes in patients with pancreatic cancer. Thus the investigators propose to
      identify the protein expression levels of Activin and Midkine in plasma of patients with
      different stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with healthy patients and to evaluate
      the possible correlation with diabetes, tumor size and tumor stage.

    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      patients with or without cachexia, perineural invasion and diabetes.

      Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, based on the results of an endoscopic
      ultrasonography (EUS) biopsy or surgery were enrolled at the diagnosis and blood samples are
      drawn.

      Thus the investigators propose to identify the protein expression levels of Activin and
      Midkine in plasma of patients with different stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared
      with benign pancreatic disorders and healthy patients and to evaluate the possible
      correlation with diabetes, tumor size and tumor stage.

      Furthermore, the investigators propose to identify the prognostic role of these biomarkers in
      the development of metastasis and survival in patients with adenocarcinoma, with and without
      diabetes and cachexia; to identify a new biomarker predictive of cachexia and eventually to
      select patients likely to benefit from treatment with antagonists of activin (or hypoglycemic
      treatment) and investigating the role of invasion neural in the appearance of cachexia in
      patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Follow-up: with phone-calls on an every 6 month, for up to 2 years, retaining the following
      data: survival, date of decease and its direct cause, the presence of tumor recurrence.

      Venous blood samples and pancreatic cancer tissue (from EUS FNA and surgery) will be
      collected from patients with pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma at the time of diagnosis. The
      blood sample will be immediately prepared by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. The plasma
      samples were stored at −80 °C until use. Tissue will be embedded in paraffin.

      Point-of-care bio-markers will be assessed by using western blot analyses and
      immunohistochemistry.

      The participant will be explicitly asked for consent for storing the plasma sample.
