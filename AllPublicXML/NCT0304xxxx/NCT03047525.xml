      Background: Combinations of Dendritic and Cytokine-induced Killer Cells (DC-CIK) and
      Cytokine-induced Killer Cells (CIK) treatment may enhance the immune response and stop cancer
      cells from growing. The investigators suppose that DC-CIK combined with CIK treatment will
      improve the prognosis of advanced solid tumors.

      Objective: Phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy
      with DC-CIK and CIK treatment in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumors.

      Study treatment:

      Patients in group A will receive 4 cycles of CIK treatments and 4 cycles of DC-CIK treatments
      within 8 months. Patients in group B will have no immunotherapy . chemotherapy are available
      in both groups.
