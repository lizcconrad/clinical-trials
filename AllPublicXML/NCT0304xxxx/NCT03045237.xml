    <textblock>
      &quot;Healthy Bellies&quot; is an intervention program with pregnant women, based on the promotion of
      healthy lifestyles. It aims to evaluate the impact of the program in the health of both
      pregnant and newborn. This trial is being conducted with pregnant women, divided into control
      and intervention group. Are performed 3 assessment periods: 1 - beginning of the program; 2 -
      postpartum; 3 - 1 month after delivery. The intervention group has a program of 3 weekly
      physical exercise classes and the control group has the basic information that is usually
      provided by health professionals. With this program, it is expected to contribute with
      evidence to the best practice in the field of interventions in pregnancy and improve health
      outcomes of both pregnant and newborn.
