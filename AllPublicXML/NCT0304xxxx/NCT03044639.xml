      The randomized, double-blind, multi-centric study performed in four parallel groups to
      compare all lipid emulsions, which can be used as a part of PN. Patients with home parenteral
      nutrition due to stable intestinal failure, were randomly assigned to receive parenteral
      nutrition with one the following lipid emulsions:

        -  Long-chained triglycerides (LCT group)

        -  Medium/ long-chained triglycerides MCT/LCT (50:50, MCT/LCT group))

        -  Olive oil/ LCT (80:20, OO group))

        -  SMOFlipid (Omega-3/ olive oil/ MCT/ LCT, SMOF group)

      Intravenous lipid emulsion (IVLE) is the essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN),
      because it is a very efficient source of energy and essential fatty acids (FA).The prevalence
      of abnormal liver function tests during PN varies from 15 to 85%, according to most
      authors.[19-21] The severity of IFALD depends also on underlying disease, especially ongoing
      sepsis and pre-existing liver disease. A study comparing all lipid emulsions, which can be
      used as a part of PN, has never been done. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical
      value of the four most popular intravenous lipid emulsions in regards to the liver function
      in long term intestinal failure patients.Patients with home parenteral nutrition due to
      stable intestinal failure, were randomly assigned to receive parenteral nutrition with one
      the following lipid emulsions:

        -  Long-chained triglycerides (LCT group)

        -  Medium/ long-chained triglycerides MCT/LCT (50:50, MCT/LCT group))

        -  Olive oil/ LCT (80:20, OO group))

        -  SMOFlipid (Omega-3/ olive oil/ MCT/ LCT, SMOF group) Randomization was performed after
           assessment and check for in-/exclusion criteria if the patient has met all study
           eligibility requirements.

      The test emulsion became a part of regular PN admixture, which was used to feed patient at
      home. The study was performed for 12 months.
