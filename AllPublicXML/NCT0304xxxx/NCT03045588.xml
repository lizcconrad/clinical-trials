  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine the long-term effects of a combined training and diet
      intervention that, acutely, increases fat oxidation during exercise. This is done with a 4
      week intervention study with moderately trained cyclists. Performance is tested pre and post
      intervention and muscle biopsies are obtained.

    <description>This subjects in this group conducts all their morning exercise sessions with high fat oxidation (in a fasted condition).

    <description>Both groups exercise 6 times per week in 4 weeks conducted as 3 evening and 3 morning sessions per week. Both groups receive dietary products to be consumed immediately before and after each evening and morning session, respectively. One group conduct morning sessions in a fasted state, the other conduct the morning sessions in a fed state. Performance pre and post is measured, and muscle biopsies are obtained.</description>
