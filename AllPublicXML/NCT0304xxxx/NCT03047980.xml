  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to gain a preliminary understanding of the safety of
      sirolimus in Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) and determine best outcomes to be used to assess the
      utility of sirolimus for the treatment of cognitive impairments related to Sturge-Weber
      syndrome.

  <detailed_description>

      Sirolimus will be administered as an adjunct to all current medications. The impact of
      sirolimus upon cognitive functioning in Sturge-Weber syndrome is the primary outcome measure.
      This outcome will be assessed using a panel of testing selected based upon extensive
      experience in testing cognitive function in adults and children with SWS at the Kennedy
      Krieger Sturge-Weber Center. Changes in a quantitative EEG before and after the trial,
      Sturge-Weber syndrome clinical neuroscore, port-wine birthmark score, and the impact of
      sirolimus upon seizures will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients ages 3 to 31 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Cognitive impairment as defined by the following:

             SWS cognitive neuroscore of ≥ 1

          3. Ability to participate in direct neuropsychological and developmental testing.

          4. English as primary language.

          5. Stable anti-epileptic drugs (no changes in medications except dose for &gt;3 months).

          6. Adequate renal function. GFR must be greater than 50 ml/min/m2 as determined by the
             Schwartz Formula for children and MDRD for adults:
             http://www.nkdep.nih.gov/professionals/gfr_calculators/index.htm

          7. If female and of child bearing potential, documentation of a negative pregnancy test
             prior to enrollment determined by a urine test is required. Sexually active
             pre-menopausal female patients (and female partners of male patients) must use
             adequate contraceptive measures, excluding estrogen containing contraceptives, while
