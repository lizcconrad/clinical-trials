      The purpose of this study is to conduct community-engaged research (CEnR) with families and
      pediatric providers caring for the children in those families to address the following
      specific aims:

        1. Examine parents' knowledge and perceptions about their 6-36 month old children's sleep
           and objective characteristics of sleep, including (1a) self-reported and
           actigraph-recorded characteristics of sleep, sleep habits, and difficulty; (1b) the
           contributions of sleep habits and individual, family, community, cultural/social, and
           health-related factors to sleep characteristics and sleep difficulty; (1c) consequences
           of sleep difficulty; (1d) successful and unsuccessful strategies used to promote
           children's sleep and sleep habits; (1e) preferences regarding sleep promotion
           interventions for their children; and perceptions of the optimal timing to begin sleep
           promotion intervention

        2. Examine pediatric primary care providers' perceptions about (2a) the importance of sleep
           and sleep habits for 6-36 month old children; (2b) factors that contribute to sleep
           habits and sleep difficulty; (2c) successful and unsuccessful approaches to promote
           healthy sleep habits, adequate duration and good quality sleep and assessment and
           management of sleep difficulty in young children within the context of their families;
           and (2c) barriers, facilitators, and preferences regarding sleep-promoting interventions
           for families with young children;

        3. Collaborate with families and providers to use the information obtained in Aims 1 and 2
           to develop and refine a feasible, relevant, and acceptable sleep promotion program,
           including procedures, protocols, patient materials, intervention fidelity plans, and
           delivery methods.

      The investigators will conduct this study in 3 phases, employ Community Engaged Research
      (CEnR), and use guidelines for community participation developed through Yale Center for
      Clinical Investigation (YCCI/Yale's CTSA). The Social Ecological Model, depicting
      interactions among the environment, individual, family, community, and society as they
      influence health, will guide the study. The key informants and community and clinical
      stakeholders represent layers of the model49-51 acknowledging the critical intersection
      between the model components and health promotion behavior (i.e., healthy sleep habits).

      Community Engagement. The investigators will extend the CEnR process begun in our preliminary
      work to engage two groups of community stakeholders: parents of children between the ages of
      6-36 months and pediatric primary care clinicians who provide health care to those children.
      The investigators will invite 8-10 volunteers (pediatricians, nurse practitioners, parents of
      6-18 month old children, parents of 19-36 month olds) to join our team as members of a
      Community Advisory Committee that will meet quarterly throughout this project to assist with
      oversight and share decision-making about methods, interpretation of findings, and
      intervention development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination. The investigators
      will meet at convenient times and locations and use conference calls if preferred. The
      investigators will compensate parents and providers for time spent in study activities and
      reimburse parents for taxi cab fare. The investigators will provide onsite childcare in a
      separate room from the interviews. The investigators will offer committee members
      co-authorship on reports and collaboration on disseminating information on sleep habits into
      the community. The investigators will also invite them to continue to guide future studies
      and intervention projects. Consistent with a CEnR approach, The investigators will include
      them as full partners in future collaborations as preferred.

      In Phase I/Aims 1 &amp; 2 the investigators will employ a convergent mixed methods approach in
      which the investigators will collect quantitative (questionnaires) and qualitative interview
      data (semi-structured interview) about parents' perceptions of children's sleep, sleep
      habits, sleep difficulty, and sleep-promoting interventions (Aim 1). The investigators will
      also use semi-structured interviews to elicit perceptions about the importance of sleep,
      promotion of healthy sleep habits, sleep assessment, sleep difficulties, and barrier and
      facilitators to sleep promotion, assessment, and intervention from primary care clinicians
      (Aim 2).

      In Phase II/Aim 3 the investigators will collaborate with the Community Advisory Board to
      draft a sleep promotion program, based on phase I results and the literature. Deliverables
      will include objectives, content, procedures, protocols, patient materials, intervention
      fidelity procedures, and delivery methods, including a possible prototype of an mHealth
      approach. The investigators will use an iterative method, including focus groups with our two
      communities, for member checking and cognitive interviewing to assess feasibility, cultural
      relevance and acceptability of the intervention.

    <description>A member of the research team experienced in qualitative interviewing will conduct the parent interviews in a private space at the PCC, Yale School of Nursing (YSN), or other convenient location at a time separate from a health care visit. Investigators will use a semi-structured guide organized by the constructs of interest (e.g. sleep characteristics, importance of sleep, sleep habits, contributing factors). Open-ended prompts will be used to explore ideas.
Interview data will be digitally transcribed and uploaded into Atlas.ti software. Investigators will use a qualitative descriptive approach and a constant comparative method in which data collection and analysis occur simultaneously to allow for a flexible and emergent design, with modification of the interview schedule and probes as new patterns or directions emerge from the data.</description>

    <description>Objective sleep characteristics will be measured with the Respironics Minimitter Actiwatch AW2. Reliability for actigraphy in 12-24 month old children ranges from .67-.85 (sleep duration) and .77-.89 (efficiency). As in earlier studies, the actigraph will be worn on the ankle. The parent will depress the event marker at &quot;lights out&quot;/bedtime, &quot;lights on,&quot; and naptime and record the times in the diary. A user-friendly guide will be used to explain this process to parents. The investigators will phone parents every two days to address questions and remind them to continue. The investigators will request 9 days and nights of data to obtain at least seven nights, a period that will enable us to determine daily variability.</description>
