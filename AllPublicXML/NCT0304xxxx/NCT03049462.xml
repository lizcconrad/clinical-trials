      Background:

      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a type of fat in the body. It may prevent weight gain, improve
      insulin sensitivity, and reduce fatty liver. Researchers want to see if BAT helps the body
      burn energy.

      Objective:

      To learn more about how BAT works to burn energy.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18-40 with a body mass index between 18 and 40

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Dietitian interview

      Participants will have an overnight baseline visit. This includes:

      Repeats of screening tests

      Exercise test

      Scans. For one scan, a radioactive substance is injected into the arm.

      FSIVGIT: An IV is inserted into veins in the right and left arms. Glucose and insulin are
      injected in one arm. Blood glucose and insulin levels are measured from the other.

      Metabolic suite: Participants stay 18 19 hours in a room that measures their metabolic rate.
      Monitors on the body measure heart rate, movement, and temperature.

      Optional fat biopsy: A small piece of tissue is removed with a needle.

      Participants will take 2-4 pills daily for 4 weeks. All women will take the drug mirabegron.
      Men will be randomly get either the drug or a placebo.

      All participants will have a visit after 2 weeks of the pills. They will repeat the screening
      tests.

      Participants will have an overnight visit 2 weeks later. They will repeat the baseline tests.

      Participants will keep food and medication diaries.

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 2 weeks after stopping the pills. This includes
      heart tests.

      Background issues and controversies

      More than ever before, there is a rise in the rates of obesity and diabetes. As opposed to
      white fat which stores excess calories, brown fat also known as brown adipose tissue or BAT
      consumes this energy to generate heat. In settings of increased food consumption and
      cold-exposure, studies show that human BAT becomes more active, potentially combatting weight
      gain. Other emerging evidence indicates that human BAT may be an endocrine organ, releasing
      hormones into the blood and regulating other organs like skeletal muscle, liver, and the
      insulinreleasing pancreatic beta-cell. However, alongside these promising studies are those
      people who believe that there is not enough BAT in humans to be functionally relevant, and it
      contributes little to heat generation or overall health.

      Purpose/Rationale of the proposed study

      One of the principal reasons for skepticism about the ability to utilize human BAT is that
      there is not very much compared to smaller animals in which BAT activation has shown such
      promise. Therefore, a critical step is to develop medicines that can grow BAT in people and
      evaluate what kind of health benefits can be achieved.

      Specific objectives

      This study will administer the clinically-available beta 3-AR agonist, mirabegron (Myrbetriq
      , Astellas Pharma). We will determine whether we can increase BAT volume and activity in
      people after they have taken this medication daily for four weeks. Our current goal is to see
      if chronic administration of mirabegron leads to an increase in BAT volume and metabolic
      activity and if it produces health benefits.

      Key elements of what is involved

      At the beginning of the study, the participants will undergo a series of tests to determine
      their baseline amounts of BAT, blood sugar status, and levels of specified hormones. The
      testing will take place over the course of two days while an inpatient on the Metabolic
      Patient Care Unit at the NIH Clinical Center. Participants will then take the medication or
      placebo for four weeks during which time they will continue their standard daily routines. At
      two weeks, participants will return for one day for the assessment of any interim changes and
      to validate safety. At the end of the four weeks there will be a second set of inpatient
      testing over two days. Participants will be brought back two weeks after finishing the study
      for a follow-up safety visit, at which time they will receive an ECG and heart rate
      monitoring.

      Primary outcomes

      The primary outcome is the change in BAT metabolic activity as measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT.
      Secondary endpoints will examine multiple other factors, including body weight, fat mass,
      glucose tolerance, changes in levels of hormones, and improved liver function.
