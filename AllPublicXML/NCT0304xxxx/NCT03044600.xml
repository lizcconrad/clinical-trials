      Objectives:

        1. To better define the differences in molecular genetics of parathyroid tumors in patients
           with MEN1, single gland parathyroid disease in patients less than 50 years old and
           single gland disease in patients greater than 50 years old.

        2. To better define the incidence of HRPT2 mutation in young patients with primary
           hyperparathyroidism and determine whether routine testing in these patients is
           indicated.

      Patient charts will be reviewed to collect demographic data, pre-operative and post-operative
      clinical and laboratory data, operative reports, and pathology reports. Archived
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from surgical specimens of patients
      will be stained for parafibromin to evaluate for HRPT2 mutations.
