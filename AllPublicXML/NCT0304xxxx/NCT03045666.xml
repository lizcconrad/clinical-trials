  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      48 patients, over the age of 18, with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) classified as WHO
      III-IV, that are all stable under Macitentan therapy ( medication for treating PAH patients),
      will be recruited to the study through the pulmonary hypertension (PH) clinic at Soroka
      Medical Center. The patients will be randomly divided into an intervention group, which will
      exercise twice a week for 12 weeks, supervised by physiotherapists, and a control group,
      which will only receive the medication. Tests will be performed before the beginning of the
      intervention program, 6 weeks after it has begun, at the end of the 12 week program, and 3
      months after finishing the program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      48 patients, over the age of 18, with PAH classified as WHO III-IV, that are all stable under
      Macitentan therapy, will be recruited to the study through the PH clinic at Soroka Medical
      Center. The patients will be randomly divided into intervention and control groups.

      The intervention group will exercise in a pulmonary rehabilitation program twice a week, for
      12 weeks. The exercise protocol will include circuit training, with 2-3 minutes exercise
      intervals, including aerobic and strength training, and will be supervised by
      physiotherapists. The control group will continue to receive their usual Macitentan
      treatment.

      All study participants will undergo tests before the beginning of the intervention program, 6
      weeks after it has begun, at the end of the 12 week program, and 3 months after finishing the
      program. The tests will include a cardio-pulmonary exercise test, 6 minute walk distance
      measurement, WHO functional class evaluation, levels of Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP),
      EMPHASIS10 questionnaire (emPHasis-10 questionnaire is a short questionnaire for assessing
      Health Related Quality of Life in pulmonary arterial hypertension), Short Form-36 (SF-36)
      quality of life questionnaire and echocardiography.

      Once data collection is completed, two way ANOVA repeated measures will be used to assess the
      changes in outcome measures.
