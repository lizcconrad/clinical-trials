      This study aims to Analyze and compere the hemodynamic and respiratory variables before,
      during and after the applying of technic as well as evaluate respiratory pressures generated
      during applying of this same technic and correlate them with the effort noticed by device
      user.

      The breath stacking technic (BS) is an inspiratory maneuver used for recruitment of collapsed
      alveoli and, consequently, improves oxygenation and, therefore, used by respiratory
      physiotherapy aiming promoting lung re-expansion being. The BS was described by Marini as an
      attempt of optimizing vital capacity in little co-operative individuals and hemodynamics has
      been considered a way of incentive spirometry that provides high lung volume, in situations,
      in which, inspiratory maneuver duration can be as important as the volume reached, composing
      an alternative incentive of inspiration technic4. The system used is composed by an interface
      (facial mask) connected to the patient, an inspiratory unidirectional valve and the
      respiratory branch which is kept occluded during the carrying out of maneuvers.

    <description>During initial rest period, the volunteer remained seated for 10' in spontaneous breathing. During carrying out of the breath stacking technic, the volunteer remained seated, being requested to hold the mask on his/her face not allowing air scape, The volunteer was oriented to inhale normally and exhale all the air during expiration for 20 seconds. During the 20 seconds of applying of technic, in the three series the maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures reached during the carrying out of technic. In the final rest period, right after technic end, the volunteers remained seated for 10 minutes in spontaneous breathing and again the same variables of control at the 10th minute were assessed.</description>
