  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether horticultural therapy would improve the
      psychological well-being older adults who are at risk of memory (cognitive) decline. 100
      elderly subjects who are at risk of cognitive decline will be randomized into the active
      horticultural therapy or to the waitlist control group. Sessions will be conducted weekly for
      9 months, and participants will be assessed at 3 time-points: at the start of the study, at 3
      months and at 9 months.

      It is hypothesized that participants who undergo horticultural therapy will perform better on
      neuropsychological tests when compared to control, and that they will have improved
      psychological well-being and functional outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants comprise of community-dwelling elderly who are at risk of developing
      dementia, and will be selected from consenting participants from an existing community
      cognitive screening program.

      This is an intervention study where 100 subjects will be randomized into an active
      horticultural therapy group, or a waitlist control group. Baseline demographic data will be
      collected at the start of the study. Assessments will be done at the start, at 3 months and
      at 6 months, which will include neuropsychological tests of cognitive functioning,
      psychological tests for depression and anxiety, assessment of psychosocial well-being, and
      tests of functional status.

      The Horticultural Therapy intervention will be delivered by trained facilitators at the
      Therapeutic Garden at Hort Park, and consists of 1 hour sessions weekly for 9 months. The
      Horticultural Therapy program is designed to stimulate the senses through interaction with
      the tasks and the environment, promote social interaction and also to promote a sense of
      self-worth through completion of projects. It encompasses a range of activities including
      general gardening and also project-based craft activities.

      The control group will be placed on a waiting list and only be contacted for assessments.
      They will receive intervention after the active treatment group at a later date.

    <measure>Changes in Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores at baseline, 3 months and 9 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS (Zung, 1965) is a 20-item quantitative measurement of symptoms of depression. Participants rate each item regarding how they felt during the week preceding using a 4-point scale that ranges from 1 (a little of the time) to 4 (most of the time). A total raw score computed by summing the scores on the individual items will be converted into a percentage (the SDS index); the higher the SDS index, the greater the severity of depressive symptoms. Several studies have established the SDS as a reliable and valid instrument for measuring depressive symptoms (Biggs et al., 1978; Gabrys and Peters, 1985; Agrell and Dehlin, 1989).</description>

    <description>The SAS (Zung, 1971) will be used to measure anxiety of the participants in the preceding week. It is a 20-item self-report assessment designed to measure anxiety levels, based on cognitive, autonomic, motor and central nervous system symptoms. Each question is scored on a Likert-type scale of 1-4 (a little of the time) to (most of the time). Some questions are negatively worded to avoid the problem of set response. Overall assessment is done by total score. The total raw scores range from 20-80. The raw score then needs to be converted to an &quot;Anxiety Index&quot; score; the higher the SAS index, the greater the severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Friendship Scale (FS) scores at baseline, 3 months and 9 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social connectedness scale will be measured using the Friendship Scale (Hawthorne, 2006). It is a 6-item questionnaire that measures both social isolation and social connectedness. Participants were asked to rate the frequency in which each statement describes them during the past four weeks on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (almost always) to 5 (not at all). Total scores were computed by summing the scores on the individual items and ranged from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating higher level of social connectedness. The Friendship Scale was developed as a short, user-friendly, stand alone scale measuring perceived social isolation. It was validated with older adults with excellent internal structures, reliability and validity (Hawthorne, 2006; Hawthorne, 2008).</description>
