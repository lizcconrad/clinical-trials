  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study the investigators wish to evaluate the effect the doctors and midwives
      in the delivery room have on the timing and modality of analgesia chosen by the participants.
      The participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Both groups will be advised of the
      different modalities of analgesia available during labor. One group will be managed in the
      delivery room the same as if not part of the study, meaning the doctors and midwives will
      treat the participants the way they usually do regarding analgesia. The second group of
      participants will not be asked by the doctors and midwives about analgesia at all but will be
      able to receive analgesia by a modality of choice at the timing of choice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After explaining to the participants the study and having signed a confirmed consent,
      participants will receive an extensive explanation regarding the different modalities of
      analgesia available during labor. After the explanations the participants will be randomly
      divided into 2 groups:

        1. Routine management-doctors and midwives will treat the participants the way they usually
           do regarding analgesia including frequent inquiries about wishes for analgesia.

        2. Interventional management-participants will not be asked by the doctors and midwives
           about analgesia at all during labor but will be able to receive analgesia by a modality
           of choice at the timing of choice after being advised by the medical team.

      After delivery, participants will fill a questionnaire regarding the experience of labor in
      general and the relevance of analgesia during labor including the effect the medical team may
      have had on decision making during labor.

      Medical information regarding visual analogue scale (VAS), analgesia modality, cervical
      conditions, parity etc. will be extracted from patients` electronic files.
