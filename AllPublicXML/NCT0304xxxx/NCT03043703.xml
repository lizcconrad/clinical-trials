      Detecting mild forms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) easily and efficiently might help to
      identify and improve care for patients suffering from wake reactions at night. The AirSense
      10 for Her is able to detect respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) through changes in
      the flow of air. The algorithm of the AirSense 10 will be compared with scoring via
      polysomnography (PSG). 129 patients shall be observed in a sleep facility under suboptimal
      Treatment (i.e. low pressure) with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy.

    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing is commonly assessed by calculating an Apnea-Hypopnea-Index AHI
      and a Hypopnea-Index HI to define how frequent breathing or breathing efforts stop during the
      night. The severity of sleep apnea (SA) is determined by the number of occurring apneas and
      hypopneas. Research on sleep apnea in women - that has been expanded to both genders - has
      shown that many patients suffering from SA often do not have detectable apneas or hypopneas
      because their airways collapse partially, which leads to a reduction in airflow that does not
      match the criteria for a hypopnea, but results in a wake reaction because of the higher
      effort to breathe (respiratory effort related arousal (RERA)). Such milder forms of SA have
      the same negative consequences as severe SA on daytime alertness, mood and life`s quality and
      might affect blood pressure and the cardiovascular system. Polysomnography (PSG) - in
      connection of measuring esophageal pressure - is being used in the sleep laboratory as the
      Gold standard method to document a patient`s sleep behavior by tracking air flow, respiratory
      effort, blood oxygen and electrocardiac as well as electromyographic signals. This way a
      comprehensive sleep pattern analysis can be created and different forms of SA can be
      detected. However, the method is laborious and cost-intensive, so it could save time and
      costs to have events accurately scored by the device itself, and ensure a quick and reliable
      diagnosis also of hard-to-detect mild SA. RERA events can be detected accurately via a
      reduction in air flow and changes in flow patterns. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI)
      captures these events and is calculated comprising an AHI but also RERAs via the flow signal.
