  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of murine double minute chromosome
      2 (MDM2) inhibitor AMG-232 when given together with decitabine in treating patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia that has come back, does not respond to treatment, or is newly
      diagnosed. MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232
      together and decitabine together may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 (AMG-232) in combination with
      decitabine (20 mg/m^2 for 10 days), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMG-232 in combination with a standard dose of
      decitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of AMG-232 and decitabine when used in
      combination.

      II. To evaluate tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) signaling induced by AMG-232 and decitabine
      as measured by macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) induction.

      III. To correlate AMG-232 and decitabine exposure with pharmacodynamics endpoints (efficacy,
      toxicity, changes in p53 signaling).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) of AMG-232 and
      decitabine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers of response to AMG-232 and decitabine in AML.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of AMG-232 and decitabine in AML blasts.

      IV. To determine the variability of decitabine incorporation into genomic deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) and correlate with systemic pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232.

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10 and MDM2 inhibitor
      AMG-232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 4-10 and 18-24. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. Based on the toxicity observed, a derived variable, the occurrence of dose limiting toxicity, will be created. Will be correlated with MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 and decitabine exposure. Toxicities will be tabulated and reported according to dose level, grade, type, cycle, and attribution- and, if numbers permit, by whether the patient had newly diagnosed or previously treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cumulative incidence curves will be used to estimate the proportion of patients who will discontinue therapy for reasons of toxicity or general inability to tolerate the regimen. The data from all patients treated at the RP2D, will be combined for a final summary and listing of toxicities observed.</description>

    <description>Standard descriptive methods (point estimates and confidence intervals, scatterplots) will be used to summarize the baseline levels and the changes from baseline (i.e. after treatment).
