      To compare the effect of Protonics knee brace and Hamstring Resisted Exercise (HRE) on
      anterior pelvic tilt, hip internal rotation and adduction, and knee pain in subjects with
      Patellofemoral pain symptoms (PFPS) and examine the reliability and validity of self-report
      patellofemoral disability index (PDI) as a measure of functional performance in subjects with
      PFPS.

      The purpose of this graduate student research study is to compare the effect of Protonics
      knee brace and Hamstring Resisted Exercise (HRE) on anterior pelvic tilt, hip internal
      rotation and adduction, and knee pain in subjects with Patellofemoral pain symptoms (PFPS)
      and examine the reliability and validity of self-report patellofemoral disability index (PDI)
      as a measure of functional performance in subjects with PFPS.

      There will be three visits over 4 weeks for 1 hour per visit, but the first visit will take
      about 2 hours. In visit one, participants will be asked to sign an informed consent, complete
      five questionnaires. Then, your hip range of motion (ROM), pelvic tilt angle, and lateral
      step-up test will be measured. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      group one receiving the Protonics knee brace exercise, and a home program or group two
      getting the hamstring-resisted exercise using sport cord and home program. Participant in
      both groups will walk a specific distance in each phase. Phase I (walk 5 min in straight
      surface), Phase II (walk 8 min in inclined surface), and Phase III (walk 10 min in different
      direction).

    <description>Protonics Therapy Program is separated into three phases for a period of 4 weeks. In each phase the patients will learn how to perform the Protonics neuromuscular repositioning technique, Protonics gait and open-chain exercise. All subjects will be asked to perform the exercise 3 times a week, 3 sets a day; every set is 10-15 repetitions for 4 weeks.
In phase one, the subjects will perform Protonics Neuromuscular repositioning Techniques, Protonics gait through walking for up to 5 minutes or as tolerated, and preform warming up exercise.
In phase two, the subjects will perform Protonics Neuromuscular repositioning Techniques, Protonics gait through walking for up to 8 minutes or as tolerated, and preform three specific exercises in prone, supine and sitting position.
In phase three, the subjects will perform Protonics Neuromuscular repositioning Techniques, Protonics gait through walking for up to 10 minutes or as tolerated, and preform one specific exercise in standing position.</description>
