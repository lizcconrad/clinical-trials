      Assessing the use of corneal confocal microscopy to evaluate for early neuropathy changes in
      subjects with Type 1 Diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is associated with microvascular
      complications, which includes peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy associated with
      diabetes is a painful condition. Its diagnosis is hampered by painful and long nerve
      conduction studies which fail to diagnose small nerve neuropathy. It is important to study
      methods of noninvasive methods of early detection, which are sensitive and specific in
      diagnosing early neuropathy and we propose a novel study that this can be detected in the
      cornea of the eye.

      Aims:

        -  Estimate corneal small nerve fiber damage in young T1DM subjects (corneal fiber density,
           nerve branch density, and fiber length) and compare the results to healthy controls
           using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM).

        -  Estimate corneal nerve fiber damage in subjects with diabetes, with peripheral
           neuropathy and subjects with diabetes without peripheral neuropathy, diagnosed by skin
           biopsies and nerve conduction studies

        -  Obtain much needed normative values for CCM in adolescents and intraepidermal nerve
           fiber density from skin biopsies in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

        -  As a secondary outcome measure, to compare serum biomarkers including leptin, TNF alpha,
           and fibrinogen in patients with diabetes in those with neuropathy Vs. without
           neuropathy.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Subjects with T1DM will have reduced corneal nerve fiber density, corneal nerve branch
           density, and fiber length on Corneal Confocal Microscopy compared to controls and these
           findings will be more pronounced in those with neuropathy.

        2. There will be a correlation between abnormal corneal parameters and biomarkers.
           Adolescents with neuropathy diagnosed via nerve conduction studies will have the lowest
           nerve fiber density from the distal leg and this will correlate with nerve conduction
           studies.

      Study Design: Cross sectional study design, interventional

      Inclusion:

      Subjects with diabetes:

      18-30 years (cohort 1), adolescents ages 13-17 years (cohort 2). Type 1 Diabetes diagnosed
      via standard ADA criteria

      Matched Controls:

      Match for age and gender Hemoglobin A1c &lt;6.5%

      Exclusion:

      For all subjects:

      Contact lens wearers Diseases that could damage the cornea, other than diabetes. Neurologic
      disease Psychiatric disease Amputation Foot ulcers Pain not of neuropathic origin. Presence
      of Lupus, Sjogren's syndrome and Celiac disease Hyperlipidemia requiring lipid-lowering
      medications

      Peripheral vascular disease Neuropathy due to anything besides diabetes Presence of any
      medical condition that may affect nerve conduction (e.g., radiculopathy).

      For healthy controls Family history of Type 1 Diabetes

      The study will be under the monitoring of the Institutional Review Board of the Albert
      Einstein College of Medicine

      Screening:

      The investigators will recruit 15 subjects 18-30, and then proceed with 35 13-17 year old
      subjects with T1DM, and in addition recruit matched controls.

      Subjects will be found via flyers placed around the hospital and via recruitment from clinics
      in the ophthalmology, neurology, and pediatric and adult diabetes clinics at the Children's
      Hospital at Montefiore in Bronx, NY. In addition, the investigators will advertise for
      subjects through our local JDRF chapter. Healthy controls will be recruited from Craigslist
      and also from the Montefiore pediatric clinics.

      At the time of screening, subjects will be consented by Dr. Lisa Underland. The consent will
      be obtained in the clinical research center in an exam room with the door closed, and the
      study will be explained and subject will be given the opportunity to ask questions.
      Information will be obtained via discussion with the patient and also review of medical
      records (if followed at Montefiore) regarding current diabetes control (HgBA1c), lipid
      status, duration of disease, comorbidities, incidence of retinopathy (if available), and
      previous history of diabetes control.

      Study Visit:

      The investigators will initially recruit adult subjects first, and then assess for safety
      prior to inclusion of pediatric subjects.

      Subjects will present to the Ophthalmology clinic at Montefiore for the eye exam. They will
      undergo an examination via Corneal Confocal microscopy by Dr. Lisa Underland, who will be
      trained by Dr. Kang. The procedure itself will take less than 15 minutes, and will include
      use of a numbing drop prior to the procedure. The CCM device has disposable caps which will
      be used and changed between patients. Images will be reviewed and assessed by an
      ophthalmologist, and the same person will review all of the images for all subjects. This
      procedure is not standard of care at this time for this indication.

      In addition, subjects will receive evaluation by a neurologist to assess for neuropathy via
      physical examination and questioning using the Utah Early Neuropathy Scale and Michigan
      Neuropathy screening instrument[21].

      Nerve conduction studies will be obtained, and the skin biopsy portion performed on subjects
      with T1DM only. The 3mm skin punch biopsies will be taken from the distal leg and IENFD will
      be determined according to EFNS guidelines[9]. These procedures are standard for the
      evaluation of a patient with suspected neuropathy, but not standard evaluation for all
      patients with Type 1 Diabetes. Blood will be obtained for biomarkers for Leptin, TNF alpha,
      and Fibrinogen.

      Data and Specimen Collection and Storage Data will be collected about diabetes control and
      management via chart review and at the time of screening. Paper charts will be stored in
      locked drawers in the division of pediatric endocrinology and diabetes, and any electronic
      files held on a password protected computer. Subjects will be identified by a unique study ID
      rather than by name in both data, and also on any biological specimens. Biological specimens
      will be stored in a freezer at -70 degrees.

      Data Safety and Monitoring An independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMB) will
      oversee this project and will conduct interim monitoring of accumulated data from research
      activities to assure the continuing safety of participants, relevance of the study question,
      appropriateness of the study, and accumulating data. The DSMB has been meeting and reviewing
      pediatric endocrinology research protocols that require it for several years. The monitoring
      entity consists of doctors with expertise in the relevant field of study, statistics and
      research design and will include Dr. Steven Choi, pediatric cardiologist at Montefiore, Dr.
      Rita Louard, adult endocrinologist at Montefiore, and Dr. Chhavi Agarwal, a private practice
      pediatric endocrinologist. The committee will meet prior to initiation of the protocol to
      review the plan for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance through evaluating the
      protocol and expertise of personnel performing the research procedures. Adverse events and
      protocol deviations will be reported annually at the DSMB meeting and serious adverse events
      and serious protocol deviations will be reported within 48 hours of occurrence. DSMB minutes
      and signed continuation forms will be submitted to the IRB with yearly progress reports and
      as needed for serious adverse events and deviations.

      The committee will meet annually to assess protocol compliance as well as prior to initiation
      of protocol and review safety information or in the case of a serious adverse event. Research
      would be suspended in the case a serious adverse event due to study activities that severely
      harms a subject as determined by the DSMB. Adverse events will be graded using severity
      scales consistent with common terminology criteria for adverse events.

      Safety information will be collected at the start and finish of all study visits and
      procedures by study personnel and if needed evaluation by a physician will be performed as is
      deemed appropriate. Information collected will include severity of adverse event, study
      intervention relationship, action taken, outcome, and if it was expected or serious. This
      will all be documented in the source documents and an adverse event log.
