  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of the intraperitoneal administration
      of the combination of fosfomycin, metronidazole, and granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients undergoing surgery for uncomplicated
      appendicitis. Further, in a sub-trial the aim is to investigate the plasma concentrations of
      fosfomycin and metronidazole after intraperitoneal administration.
