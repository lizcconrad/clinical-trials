  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to evaluate the performance characteristics of rapid tests to differentiate
      bacterial from non-bacterial infection in febrile adults and children presenting at OPDs
      (outpatient departments) i.e.(&quot;fever triage assays&quot;) in three LMICs. The evaluation will
      include a different commercial biomarker combinations as well as individual biomarkers to
      assess their individual or combined value in the target population. Markers will be evaluated
      onsite in ELISA or RDT format, as appropriate. Further, this study aims to contribute to a
      centralized biobank of well-characterized specimens for use by IVD companies and academic
      institutions for the development and evaluation of emerging assays.

    <description>Microbiological testing (blood culture positive/negative, malaria pos/neg, S. Tyhpi RDT pos/neg) and clinical assessments of symptoms (respiratory, gastro, no foci) will be recorded and reviewed by a clinical panel upon completion of the study to assign a final category (bacterial or non-bacterial). These categories are used in the evaluation of the biomarker assays to evaluate their performance in differentiating bacterial from non-bacterial infections. Where applicable, the same categories will be used to determine the area under the curve by employing receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis of quantitative markers.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Any non-severely ill subject presenting with acute fever defined as: temperature of more
        than 38Â°C at initial evaluation of less than 7 days of symptoms at presentation.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Children 2-17 years of age

          -  Adults 18-65 years of age

          -  Signed written informed consent for study participation. For recruitment purposes,
             subjects will be classified into two groups, children and adults. For children, age &gt;2
             years is the minimum cut-off, based on the amount of blood volume to be obtained in
             the study. WHO guidelines for allowable blood volume in 24 hours recommend that no
             more than 1-5% of total blood volume (75-80 ml/kg for older children) be obtained.
             Applying the average weight of a 2 year old toddler =12 kg, the allowable blood volume
             to be drawn in 24 hours at 1-5% of the total blood volume is 9.6 - 48 mL .

        For minors, caregivers will provide informed consent. Documented assent for children of 12
        to 16 years of age will be required for their participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are felt to be in critical condition (based on clinician assessment or
             the presence of any general signs of critical illness as defined by WHO guidelines
             (for children: extensive vomiting, active seizure or recent history of seizures,
             altered mentation, inability to feed, or any of the severe IMNCI classifications; for
             adults: impending airway obstruction, central cyanosis, severe respiratory distress,
             feeble pulse, active seizure or recent history of seizures, or unconsciousness)
             because the target population for the study is non-severe febrile subjects.

          -  Subjects can only be enrolled once into the study.
