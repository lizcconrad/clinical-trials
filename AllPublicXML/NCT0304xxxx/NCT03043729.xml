  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal or rectosigmoid cancer staged cT3 CRM-negative with MRI
      will receive 6 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with mFOLFOX6 (Arm A) vs. mFOLFOX6 +
      aflibercept (Arm B) followed by surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are generally recommended to receive
      preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. The advantage of combined-modality therapy in
      rectal cancer is that it has reduced local pelvic recurrence - a dreaded and morbid event -
      to rates of about 10%. There is good quality evidence that preoperative radiotherapy reduces
      local recurrence but there is little if any impact on overall survival. One strategy to
      reduce the distant recurrence rate, and thereby increase the cure rate, would be to introduce
      systemic treatment earlier to prevent dissemination of micrometastases. The present trial is
      designed to compare two neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens in patients with non-metastatic T3
      CRM-negative rectal cancers using quality-controlled MRI of the pelvis as a main inclusion
      criterion. This strategy is believed to reduce acute and long-term toxicity caused by
      preoperative radiotherapy and to administer effective systemic chemotherapy early in the
      course of disease as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
