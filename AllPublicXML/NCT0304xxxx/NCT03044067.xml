  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is one of the main causes of chronic musculoskeletal widespread pain. This
      condition presents a global prevalence of 2.7%, and it is more prevalent in women (with a
      female to male ratio of 3:1) over 50 years of age with low education level and low
      socioeconomic status, living in rural areas. High direct medical costs and significant
      indirect costs of this condition can't be ignored.

      Study design and setting: The design of the present study will be a randomized controlled
      trial with 2 follow-ups (one week and one month after intervention) that will be performed
      between May 2017 and June 2017 in one private clinic in Malaga, Spain. The outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline (t1), one week after intervention (t2), and one moth after intervention
      (t3). Written informed consent will be acquired for all participants prior to their
      participation. The study will be implemented and reported in line with the CONSORT statement.

    <description>Pain neuroscience education can be defined as an educational session or sessions describing the neurobiology and neurophysiology of pain, and pain processing by the nervous system. It will be applied three times (at baseline, one week and one month after intervention). Exercise will be based on a set of 4 exercise implicating flexion, extension, lateral rotation and abduction of lower and upper extremities.</description>

    <description>Exercise will be based on a set of 4 exercise implicating flexion, extension, lateral rotation and abduction of lower and upper extremities. Participants will attend three appointments per week over three weeks. They will complete three sets of 10 repetitions, with the exercises progressed in difficulty at each appointment.</description>
