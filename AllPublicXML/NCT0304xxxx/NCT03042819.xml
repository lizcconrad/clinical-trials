  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b study of investigational drug selinexor in combination with doxorubicin in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. The purpose of this study
      is to determine how safe and tolerable the combination is, as well as the best dose of the
      study drugs in this patient population.

      Selinexor (also called KPT-330), works by trapping &quot;tumor suppressor proteins&quot; within the
      cell and thus causing the cancer cells to die or stop growing.

      This is a phase 1b study of investigational drug selinexor in combination with doxorubicin in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility within 28 days of the start of the study drugs. In
      addition to standard tests and procedures, research tumor tissue (archival or fresh biopsy)
      will be collected for collection for pharmacodynamics. Participants will also be asked if
      they agree to optional biopsies at 6 cycles if their cancer is responding and at disease
      progression.

      Eligible participants will then receive the study drugs in 21 day cycles. Selinexor will be
      given by mouth and doxorubicin will be given by vein, once a week, for 6 cycles.

      Participants will be restaged every 2 cycles. If participants respond to treatment after 6
      cycles, they may be able to continue the selinexor alone as a maintenance treatment until
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      While receiving the study drug, many of the screening tests will be repeated. Additional
      tests and procedures include blood sample collection for pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics.

      When participants stop the study drug permanently for any reason, an end of treatment visit,
      28-day follow-up, and long term follow up every 90 days will occur.

    <description>Selinexor is a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compound that binds and inactivates Exportin 1 (XPO1), thereby forcing the nuclear retention of key tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs).</description>

    <description>Doxorubicin is currently approved for various cancers. Doxorubicin inhibits DNA synthesis and repair by inhibiting topoisomerase II and also by intercalation between base pairs on the DNA helix. These actions result in the blockade of DNA and RNA synthesis and fragmentation of DNA.</description>
