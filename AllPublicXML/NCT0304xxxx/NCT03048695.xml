  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 85% of patients with schizophrenia have cognitive impairments, executive functions
      being particularly affected. Executive dysfunction, and cognitive deficits in general, are
      important predictors of functional outcomes, including social problem solving, activities of
      daily living, life satisfaction, and the ability to return to work or school.The main
      objective of the current study is to examine the efficacy of group-based Goal Management
      Training (GMT) for patients with broad schizophrenia spectrum disorders or high risk
      individuals with executive deficits. The short term goals are to investigate whether GMT can
      improve participants' ability to organize and achieve goals in everyday life in addition to
      improving aspects of emotional health. A long-term goal would be to establish an evidence
      base for nonpharmacological interventions for patients with broad schizophrenia spectrum
      disorders or high risk for schizophrenia. Main research questions: (1) Does a RCT with GMT
      delivered to patients with broad schizophrenia spectrum disorders or high risk for
      schizophrenia result in improved executive functioning, measured by self-reported and/or
      objective measures of executive functions? (2) Does GMT result in improved goal attainment in
      everyday life, social- and real world functioning? (3) Does GMT have a positive impact on the
      patients' emotional health? (4) Are there specific characteristics in patients with broad
      schizophrenia spectrum disorders or high risk for schizophrenia that are associated with
      better treatment benefit from GMT?
