  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop and test a web-based patient empowerment platform, PainTracker Self-Manager
      (PTSM), that can support integrated multimodal care in a variety of specialty and primary
      care settings. The investigators will adapt PainTracker, a web-based outcome and treatment
      tracking tool already deployed in multiple University of Washington clinics to create the
      PTSM self-management tool that helps assess, engage, activate, and support patients' efforts
      to self-manage their chronic pain in collaboration with their clinicians. PTSM design will be
      based on 4-phase patient engagement strategy derived from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.
      Phase 1 focuses on achieving consensus on the clinical problem definition, treatment goals
      and timeline. Phase 2 focuses on promoting values-based action and acceptance of pain. Phase
      3 focuses on providing skills in chronic pain self-management with close monitoring of
      patient reported outcomes and actigraphy. Phase 4 focuses on providing autonomy support to
      promote maintenance of self-management behaviors. Phase 5 involves generating a patient
      registry with the above data for use in quality improvement research. The investigators will
      engage patients, providers and investigators in designing PTSM, reviewing prototypes, and
      conducting usability testing. In a 6-month clinical trial, the investigators will compare 50
      intervention patients from the UW Center for Pain Relief who receive PTSM to 50 historical
      control patients who have received the basic PainTracker. The primary outcome will be chronic
      pain self-efficacy, with secondary outcomes of: chronic pain acceptance, perceived efficacy
      in physician-patient interactions, and patient and provider satisfaction. Development of the
      PTSM platform will support the dissemination of the multimodal interdisciplinary care for
      chronic pain that is recommended in the National Pain Strategy, and may help chronic pain
      care meet the goals of the Triple Aim: better patient experience, better patient outcomes,
      with lower costs.
