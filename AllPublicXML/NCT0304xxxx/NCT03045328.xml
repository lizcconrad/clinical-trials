  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open‑label non‑randomized two‑center phase 2 study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of concurrent therapy with ibrutinib and venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory CLL/SLL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of concurrent therapy with
      ibrutinib and venetoclax in patients with relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to define the safety, tolerability, and
      dose‑limiting toxicity (DLT) within 28 days of completion of dose‑escalation.
