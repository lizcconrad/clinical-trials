  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to compare the clinical outcomes of a home-based rehabilitation
      program using a novel digital biofeedback system against conventional home-based
      rehabilitation after total hip replacement This system allows the patients to perform
      independent rehabilitation sessions at home, under remote monitoring from the clinical team.
      The investigators hypothesise that the clinical outcomes of a home-based rehabilitation
      program will be at least similar to the outcomes of a traditional home-based rehabilitation
      with face-to-face sessions. This is a randomised controlled trial with active comparator.
      Patients will be enrolled pre-operatively and then divided into 2 groups: experimental group
      and conventional rehabilitation group. Both groups will perform an 8-week rehabilitation
      program starting between day 7 and 10 aftersurgery.

      The experimental group will perform daily exercise sessions at home using the system, under
      remote monitoring from a physical therapist. The conventional rehabilitation group will
      perform 3 home-based rehabilitation sessions per week, each with 1h duration, given by a
      physical therapist.

      Outcomes will be measured at weeks 4 and 8 and then at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome is
      the change in patient performance measured by the Timed-up-and-Go (TUG) test between in
      comparison with the pre-operative score. Secondary outcomes will be measured in terms of: a)
      Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS); b) range of motion of the hip joint (lying
      flexion/abduction; standing flexion/adbuction/hyperextension)

    <description>The system will be used independently by the patients to perform rehabilitation sessions at home, under remote monitoring from the clinical team. A tailored rehabilitation program will be prescribed, based on the following principles:
STAGE 1 (Weeks 0-6) Open kinetic chain exercises without added resistance: lying, sitting and standing (with support) Strengthening of hip flexors and abductors (mainly) Ice pack application STAGE 2 (weeks 7-8) Open kinetic chain exercises with added resistance: lying, sitting (high chair) and standing (with progression to standing without support) Strengthening of hip flexors and abductors (mainly) Ice pack application after each session</description>

    <description>Patients will perform 3 weekly rehabilitation sessions, with a duration of 1 hour, for 8 weeks, provided by a physical therapist. The rehabilitation program will respect the following principles:
STAGE 1 (Weeks 0-6) Soft tissue massage Active assisted mobilization of the hip joint to increase range of motion (avoiding internal rotation and adduction) Gait training with bilateral assistive devices Isometric exercises progressing to open chain, low-impact, concentric exercises with strengthening of hip abductors and flexors Ice pack application STAGE 2 (weeks 7-8) Soft tissue massage Gait training with progressive withdrawal of assistive devices Balance exercises with progression to one-leg support Open-chain strengthening exercises against resistance with progression to closed-chain exercises Ice pack application</description>
