  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contextualization: Exercise is a common triggers of bronchospasm in patients with asthma and
      healthy subjects. To prevent these symptoms frequently they have to use Short-Acting
      Beta2-Agonists. However, the cardiovascular effects of salbutamol during and after exercise
      remain poorly known.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of salbutamol on heart rate and blood pressure during
      exercise in patients with moderate or severe asthma and healthy individuals.

      Methods: A randomized, double-blind, crossover study will be conducted which 13 individuals
      with moderate or severe persistent asthma and 13 healthy individuals aged between 20 to 59
      years.

      Patients will perform a maximal effort test on 2 nonconsecutive days, with either 400mcg
      Salbutamol or 4 placebo puffs. The order of use of placebo or salbutamol will be drawn.
      During the protocol, heart rate, blood pressure, perception of exertion and peak expiratory
      flow will be monitored.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 1 hour and after 1 week.</time_frame>
    <description>It is being considered that the asthmatic heart rate will increase after the use of salbutamol and that the increase will remain during and after the exercise, in relation to the placebo intervention. To evaluate this variable, the Polar RS800cx heart rate monitor will be used, where the participant will have his heart beats monitored beat to beat until the end of the protocol.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and for 1 hour and after 1 week again.</time_frame>
    <description>It is being considered that the systemic arterial pressure (SBP) of the asthmatic will not have significant alteration after the use of salbutamol during and after the exercise. To evaluate this variable, a Solidor manual sphygmomanometer and a supermed stethoscope will be used. The SBP will be measured after 10 minutes of initial rest, 15 minutes after administration of the drug, every 3 minutes during the physical test and every 5 minutes for 20 minutes at rest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 15 minutes final and after 1 week.</time_frame>
    <description>Due to improved airflow brought by the drug, the peak expiratory flow is expected to increase with the use of salbutamol.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective perception of Borg</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour and after 1 week .</time_frame>
    <description>The modified borg subjective perception scale will be used, where the perception of effort will be reported by a scale ranging from 0 to 10. The scale will be applied during the stress test every 3 minutes and during the final rest phase.</description>
