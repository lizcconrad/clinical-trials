  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to establish the clinical evidence for effect of Robot-Assisted upper
      arm training and Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on upper limb function of
      subacute stroke patients.

        -  Purpose : to elucidate the effect of Robot-Assisted upper arm training and Repetitive
           Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on upper limb function of stroke patients compared to
           conventional occupational therapy

        -  Subjects : total 99 patients with stroke whose upper limb functions are impaired

        -  Intervention : 4 weeks of therapy (5 days per week)

        -  Studies : upper limb functional assessment (FMA, MFT, WMFT), computerized motion
           analysis

        -  Evaluation plan : 1) pre-intervention, 2) post-2 weeks of intervention, 3) post-4 weeks
           of intervention, 4) 4 weeks after end of intervention

    <description>The Armeo, a robot with a spring mechanism allowing adjustable arm weight support, can generate assistive forces of up to 66N in flexion/extension and up to 30N for the arm and forearm respectively. This robot integrates seven angle sensors and one pressure sensor that allow direct interaction between the motion of the patient's arm and the associated therapy software. rTMS is a magnetic method used to stimulate small regions of the brain.
The Robot and rTMS group will receive the robot-assisted upper arm training and rTMS for 5 times per week, for 4 weeks. And all patients of three groups will receive the additional conventional occupational therapy for 30 minutes daily 5 times per week, for 4 weeks.</description>
