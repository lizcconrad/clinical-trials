  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled subjects will receive histamine dihydrochloride (HDC; Ceplene®) and/or IL-2
      (Proleukin®) subcutaneously (s.c.) twice daily (BID) in 3-week periods followed by 3- or 6
      week rest periods.

      All subjects will be assigned to one of three consecutive cohorts, each comprising five
      patients.

      Cohort 1 will receive HDC without IL-2 for the first treatment cycle, to enable the
      assessment of short-term impact of HDC alone on clonal and immunological markers. For all
      remaining cycles the combination of HDC and IL-2 will be given.

      Cohort 2 will receive the combination of Ceplene and Proleukin in all cycles. After all
      patients in cohorts 1 and 2 have completed 4 treatment cycles, immunological and clinical
      response and toxicity will be evaluated. On the basis of the results for the first 4 cycles
      of cohorts 1 and 2, a third cohort of 5 patients will be enrolled receiving either the
      combination of HDC/IL-2 or HDC alone.

      In case of a beneficial response* after 4 cycles, treatment may be continued to a total of 10
      cycles. Treatment cycles 5-10 will comprise 3 weeks of treatment and 6-week rest periods.

      IL-2 will be administered s.c., 1 µg/kg (=16400 IU/kg) body weight twice daily (BID) during
      treatment periods. Ceplene® will be administered s.c. 0.5 mg BID after IL-2. The patient or a
      family member/significant other will be instructed to administer injections of both study
      drugs to allow safe treatment at home.
