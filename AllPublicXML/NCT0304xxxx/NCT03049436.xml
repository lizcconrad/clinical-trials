  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has demonstrated efficacy in cancer prevention and improves quality of life
      and outcome in cancer survivors. Patients undergoing chemotherapy, especially those with
      advanced disease, may have symptoms leading to inactivity. Adapted physical activity (APA)
      among those patients could improve their tolerance to the treatment, and thereby their
      quality of life. APA could be beneficial to patients with curable disease as well as patients
      undergoing palliative chemotherapy. Some studies suggest that fighting against loss of muscle
      mass could lead to a survival benefit. However, APA is not established in daily practice and
      has not yet been evaluated in a chemotherapy ambulatory care unit.

      Primary aim of the study is to assess feasibility of an APA program in a chemotherapy
      ambulatory care unit of digestive, lung, hematological and dermatological cancers Secondary
      aim is to measure the impact of an APA program on fatigue, anxiety, depression and handgrip
      strength in patients beginning chemotherapy or targeted therapy for a digestive, lung,
      hematological or dermatological cancer, of any stage.

    <description>Fatigue evaluating using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item self-report instrument assessing the following items: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity. It has been validated to assess fatigue in cancer patients.</description>
