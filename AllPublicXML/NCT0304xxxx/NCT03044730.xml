    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a combination of two different drugs -
      pembrolizumab and capecitabine - is safe, and if it might be effective in treating triple
      negative and hormone-refractory breast cancer. Pembrolizumab is a type of drug that contains
      an antibody. Antibodies are the part of your immune system that finds things that don't
      belong in your body, such as bacteria or viruses. The antibody in pembrolizumab finds and
      blocks a protein, which allows your immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.
      Pembrolizumab is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for other types of cancer. It is
      not approved for breast cancer, meaning that it is an &quot;experimental&quot; or &quot;investigational&quot;
      treatment. Capecitabine is a type of chemotherapy pill that is a standard treatment and
      FDA-approved for breast cancer. It stops the cancer cells from being able to multiply.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the median progression-free survival (median PFS) for participants receiving
      pembrolizumab with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone-refractory metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the objective response rate (ORR) for participants receiving pembrolizumab
      with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and
      hormone-refractory MBC.

      II. To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and
      capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and hormone-refractory
      MBC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Analysis of expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) through
      immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.

      II. To assess circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). III. To evaluate ORR and median-PFS using
      immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
