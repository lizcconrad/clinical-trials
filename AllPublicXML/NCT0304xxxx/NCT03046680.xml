  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a multifactorial clinical condition, it may not cause symptoms and its
      diagnosis is often delayed. And even when it is diagnosed early, some patients cannot manage
      an adequate blood pressure.

      There are several hypotheses for the non-control of blood pressure, among them the difficulty
      of lifestyle change, irregular treatment with antihypertensive drugs, non-individualized
      treatment. Studies haven shown that tools such as multiprofessional team and hypertension
      leagues are important strategies to obtain a better outcome in the hypertension treatment,
      but new approaches are still necessary. Health Coaching is an individualized form of
      follow-up, promoting better adherence, better nutrition, smoking cessation, regular physical
      exercise and regular use of drugs, thus reducing cardiovascular mortality.

      Drug adherence and lifestyle changes are tools for chronic disease control. The relationship
      between nutrients, alcohol intake, and weight change in blood pressure was demonstraded in
      one study, demonstrating the importance of lifestyle change. Studies have shown that
      multiprofessional team and hypertension leagues are important strategies to obtain a better
      outcome, but new approaches to the patient are still necessary. Health coaching is an
      individualized follow-up, promoting better adherence to the hypertension treatment. Health
      coaching is a new model based on the support of the individual, for a better autonomy in
      personal care. The process engages de patient with the conditions of the disease itself by
      increasing knowledge, skill and confidence so that the patient become informed, active in the
      participation of its own care. Among health care, training is characterized by the
      expression. Of concerns, answering questions, providing information on home-based follow-up,
      and collaborative development of health care plans.

      Motivated patients are more likely to treatment adherence and more committed to making
      lifestyle changes and thus effectively managing their illness.

      The research is a randomized clinical trial comparing treatment based on health coaching and
      the usual treatment based in the treatment of hypertension and comorbidities in uncontrolled
      hypertensive patients.
