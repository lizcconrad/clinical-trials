  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies in animal model showed clearly that lipid homeostasis influence oocyte
      meiosis resumption. However Liver X Receptors pathway has never been investigated in human
      ovocyte

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In mice deficient of Liver X Receptor (LXR) genes, the oocytes are unable to resume meiosis.
      Oxysterols are molecules derived from the cholesterol synthesis pathway. They are ligands of
      the liver X receptors (LXRs). In human, the LXR signalling pathway has never been
      investigated in this process. The Investigator propose to analyse in granulosa cells
      surrounding ovocyte the expression of LXR, their target genes and the enzymes involved in
      oxysterols synthesis. These granulosa cells are normally retrieved and destroyed 18 hours
      after sperm insemination of oocytes in a In Vitro Fertilization program. The oocyte meiosis
      resumption will be considered as positive (Granulosa cell positive, GC+) if a zygote is
      observed 18 hours after sperm insemination and negative (Granulosa cell negative, GC-) if
      none zygote appears. Moreover the investigator will analyse the quality of embryo development
      during 5 days after zygote is formed (normal process of In Vitro Fertilization) . The both
      populations of granulosa cells (GC+ and GC-) will be compared. The measurements of Liver X
      Receptor genes and the enzymes involved in oxysterols pathways xill be performed by Reverse
      Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction. The accumulation of lipid in granulosa cells will be
      measures by oil red staining. By this sudy the investigator will probably find new biological
      markers of resumption meiosis for women enrolled in In Vitro Fertilization programm.
      Moreover, data will help to better understand the physiopathology of oocyte meiosis failures.
