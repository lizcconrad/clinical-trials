      The objective of this pilot double-blind study was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of
      Broncho-Vaxom 1 capsule (3.5 mg) per day for 9 months compared to placebo on the evolution of
      the disease in children suffering from Atopic Dermatitis (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children outpatients of both sexes, aged 6 months to 7 years, with AD confirmed by
      Haniffin-Rajka or Williams et al, and an AD score (SCORAD) between 25 and 70 were included
      and followed for 9 months. Patients were randomized to receive either Broncho-Vaxom 1 capsule
      (3.5 mg) per day or the corresponding placebo over 9 months.

      Children under general corticotherapy within one month of study start, patients with
      immunodeficiency, patient's affected body surface area less than 15% or greater than 70% or
      with known allergy to desonide were excluded.

      Outcome measures were a comparisons between the two groups in the number of AD flares during
      the study after the first month of treatment. Secondary outcome measures were comparisons
      between the two groups based on SCORAD evolution, area of eczema, amount of corticoids used
      and parents/investigator assessments.
