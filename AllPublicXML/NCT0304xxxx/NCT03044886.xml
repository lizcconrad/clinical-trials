      The object of the study was to evaluate the direct effect of high dose vitamin D
      supplementation on chronic periodontitis, and suggest the recommended dose for clinic use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by periodontal tissues
      inflammation and alveolar bone loss. Vitamin D is involved in stimulating osteoblasts to
      enable normal bone growth and preservation, also the regulation of cellular proliferation,
      differentiation, innate immune response and anti-inflammatory effect.Previous studies have
      reported the association of vitamin D levels and gingivitis and periodontitis. This study was
      designed as a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation
      on chronic periodontitis.

      The study was divided into two phases. Recruitment including baseline clinical measurements
      was obtained and standard periodontal treatments were performed in Phase One. The
      randomization and intervention of vitamin D were performed in Phase Two. The 323 subjects
      were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=105,110,108) to receive a supplement kit containing 90
      capsules of 2000 IU vitamin D, 1000 IU vitamin D, or placebo capsule for 3 months. After
      intervention, all the subjects were followed up after 3 months and received standard
      periodontal examination, including attachment loss (AL), probing depth (PD), bleeding index
      (BI), and panoramic radiographs were taken to evaluate alveolar crest height (ACH).
