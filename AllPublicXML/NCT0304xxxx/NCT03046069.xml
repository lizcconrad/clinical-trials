  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three main classes of inhaled treatment exist for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD): Beta2-adrenergic agonists (which may be short (SABA) or long (LABA) acting),
      long-acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids
      (ICS). For subjects at higher risk of exacerbation, treatment with all these three classes of
      medication is recommended. This study aims to explore the potential utility of a device
      called single inhaler triple combination or fluticasone furoate/ umeclidinium/ vilanterol
      (FF/UMEC/VI) inhaler containing all three groups of compound. This is a mixed methods study
      with a qualitative phase and a quantitative Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) phase and will
      be conducted in four stages: qualitative concept elicitation, DCE development, DCE piloting
      and testing, and conduct of the DCE. The study will conducted in the United Kingdom (UK),
      United States (US) and Germany and approximately 573 subjects with COPD will be included.
