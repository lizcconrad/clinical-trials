    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well the HER2 inhibitor tucatinib (ONT-380, ARRY-380) works
      in combination with trastuzumab in treating patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) metastatic
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking HER2, a
      receptor needed for cell growth in patients with HER2+ tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      trastuzumab, may interfere with the ability of HER2+ tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      tucatinib and trastuzumab in combination may work better in treating patients with HER2+
      metastatic CRC.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab
      in patients with HER2 positive (+) metastatic CRC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (stable disease [SD] for &gt;= 6 months, or best
      response of complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) of tucatinib in combination with
      trastuzumab.

      II. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of tucatinib in combination with
      trastuzumab.

      III. To assess the duration of response of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab.

      IV. To assess the overall survival (OS) of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab.

      V. To assess the safety and tolerability of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the combination of tucatinib and trastuzumab eliminates HER2
      amplified circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) from peripheral blood.

      II. To explore any correlation between tissue and blood based biomarkers and clinical
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tucatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and trastuzumab
      intravenously (IV) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of unconfirmed tumor responses (successes) will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients.

Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated using the normal approximation.</description>
