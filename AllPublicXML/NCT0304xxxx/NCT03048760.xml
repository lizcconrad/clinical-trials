  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Christie NHS Foundation Trust is one of seven sites worldwide within the Atlantic
      consortium that is developing the Elekta MR-Linac (MRL) prior to commercial release at the
      end of 2017. The MRL allows MR images of patients to be acquired before, during and following
      radiotherapy (RT). One area where The Christie is taking the lead within the consortium is
      the application of the MRL for lung imaging and treatment, an area where MRI has hardly been
      used.

      MRI scans provide greater soft tissue contrast than CT scans which can aid in the accurate
      delineation of organs at risk (OAR) and tumour target volumes for MRL and routine treatment.
      In addition, MRI can provide real time imaging which can aid in the accurate motion
      characterisation of these volumes. The addition of functional diffusion weighted imaging
      (DWI) has also proven to be useful in the discrimination of malignant from benign lesions;
      for lymph node detection and for the differentiation of tumour from atelectasis.

      Auto-contouring has the potential to speed workflows at various points in the clinical
      pathway. This may be inter-patient contour propagation used pre-treatment for plan creation,
      or may be during online or offline adaptive workflows propagating contours through imaging
      acquired as treatment progresses. In collaboration with industry the investigators will be
      testing such algorithms on these images retrospectively.

      In addition, the investigators would also like to evaluate patients' experiences of CT and
      MRI scans and determine which scanning method is preferred. Other studies have explored
      patient experiences of MRI compared to CT but not in the lung cancer patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants on this study will have two MRI scans in addition to the CT treatment planning
      scan, which is standard of care and cone beam CT scans during treatment, which are also
      standard of care. One of the MR scans will be close to the start of treatment and the other
      will be approximately 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy treatment. If the patient has
      had a PET scan within 4 weeks of the 1st MR scan then the PET images will also be used for
      target volume delineation. If the PET scan &gt; 4 weeks old, it can be repeated as per standard
      practice.

      The MRI protocol includes up to 60 minutes of scanning which will include anatomical,
      respiratory dynamic and functional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). The patient will be set
      up according to the treatment position on the MR scanner, using flat couch. The MR scans will
      not be used for clinical decision making.

      Clinicians will then contour organs at risk (OARs) and target volumes on both the CT (guided
      by PET if available) and MRI scans and contours will be compared to determine the usefulness
      of MRI for radiotherapy treatment planning.

      The contoured data sets will be fully anonymised, and used in house and shared with Elekta to
      assist with the development of automatic contouring / tumour tracking software, comparing CT
      to cone beam CT (CBCT) tracking (standard of care) with MR to MR tracking (experimental).

      To assess experiences of MRI and CT, participants will be asked to complete baseline
      self-report questionnaires and additional questionnaires after MRI and CT scans. A small
      sample of participants will also be invited to participate in a semi-structured interview to
      explore their experiences in greater depth.
