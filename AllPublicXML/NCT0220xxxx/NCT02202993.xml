  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study that will assess the safety and determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of mibefradil dihydrochloride, a partially selective T-type calcium
      channel blocker, combined with hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) in subjects with
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive mibefradil dihydrochloride, which will be dose escalated from 150mg/day
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, or until a dose of 350 mg/day is
      reached using a standard 3 + 3 design. Mibefradil dihydrochloride will be dosed orally in 4
      divided doses per day for 17 consecutive days to the MTD. The MTD will be determined
      according to dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events version 4.0. Radiation therapy (RT) consists of 5 fractions of 600 centigray
      (cGy) each, delivered over 2 consecutive weeks for a total dose of 3,000 cGy, using
      stereotactic, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).

      The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the MTD of mibefradil dihydrochloride when
      given with concurrent hypofractionated RT. Secondary and tertiary endpoints include
      evaluating the efficacy of mibefradil dihydrochloride and RT in terms of progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and to perform translational research on resected
      tumor tissue.

             following standard radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (i.e., at least
             &quot;biopsy-proven&quot; recurrent disease). Previous salvage therapies after first recurrence
             are permitted.

          -  Measurable contrast-enhancing progressive or recurrent GBM (single or multiple
             lesions) by MRI imaging with an interval of greater than or equal to 6 months between
             recurrence and completion of prior radiotherapy.

          -  Patients who have not passed an interval of at least 6 months may still be eligible if
             they meet the following criteria: convincing histologic evidence of disease recurrence
