  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent disorder and a major health concern.
      Cardiovascular disease is the most prevailing and life-threatening complication observed in
      patients with CKD. The diagnosis of CKD places a patient at the highest cardiovascular risk
      level irrespective of the stage of renal decline. Therefore, fatal cardiovascular events are
      more likely to occur than the evolution to final stages of kidney disease with the need for
      dialysis. Counter intuitively, treatment of classical cardiovascular risk factors does not
      affect cardiovascular prognosis in CKD, which suggests that the missing link between these
      two entities has not been elucidated yet.

      In the present project, the investigators focus on endothelial dysfunction in patients with
      CKD. Endothelial dysfunction precedes overt atherosclerotic changes by many years. In the
      absence of structural changes, endothelial dysfunction is still reversible, which offers
      therapeutic perspectives to tackle the progression towards atherosclerosis in an early stage.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an exercise training program is effective
      in ameliorating endothelial dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease.
