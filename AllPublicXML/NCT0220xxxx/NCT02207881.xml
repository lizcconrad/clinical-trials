  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent herpes labialis are usually a minor malady of limited duration, although they are
      often painful and are uniformly discomforting for patients. Oral antivirals represent an
      advance in the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis, but the clinical implications are
      modest. Randomized, controlled clinical trials have shown that oral antivirals decrease the
      duration of lesion episodes and pain by approximately one day. In recurrent HSV infections
      including herpes labialis, many instances of viral re-activation occur without symptoms, and
      can only be identified by detection of virus on the lips of infected individuals. In these
      cases, the virus is cleared from the local site without the development of a classical
      ulcerative herpes lesion. In the other cases, the triggered specific immune response rapidly
      stops viral replication in the skin and also causes the development of the herpes lesion
      prodrome and a considerable part of the symptoms associated with a classical ulcerative
      herpes lesion. One could therefore predict that treatment with an antiviral drug alone would
      help the immune system in shortening the virus replication, but may not substantially reduce
      the disfiguring symptoms caused by the immune reaction. In dermatology, the principle of
      using an anti-inflammatory drug improve clinical outcomes by reducing inflammation-related
      symptoms associated with the infection has been well established. We have found that a
      topical formulation of VDO is useful for alleviating pain and inflammation associated with
      infection caused by herpes virus.

      In the treatment of oral herpes labialis, it is desirable to have local absorption of the
      drug to provide pain relief directly at the lesion sites while minimizing overall exposure.

      The present study is designed to elucidate the effects of VDO ( on recurrent herpes simplex
      labialis.

    <description>Pain intensity will be measured at baseline and in the Subject's DRC on a daily basis while receiving study drug until end of study. Pain and itching assessments will be using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging 0 (no pain/itching) to 10 (the worst pain/itching imaginable).
The subject will be asked the following question exactly as follows：「On a scale 1 to 10 where 0 means on pain/itching, and 10 means the worst possible pain/itching, rate the worst pain/itching that you have since last assessment」</description>
