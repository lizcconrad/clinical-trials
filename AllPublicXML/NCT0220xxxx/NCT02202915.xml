    <textblock>
      This study examines a training program for clinicians who work in mental health clinics that
      serve children with OCD. We will provide clinician training in conducting exposure-based
      treatments for children with OCD. The purpose of the project is to test the use of a new tool
      to enhance training in exposure-based treatments for clinicians. Therapists will receive
      training and oversight from the researchers regarding the treatment procedures and use of the
      new tool. All children enrolled in the study will receive treatment by clinicians who are
      participating in this study. Therapists and youth will be recruited separately for the study
      and will be assigned to work together.
