    <textblock>
      This research study aims to test the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Mayo Clinic
      Anxiety Coach smartphone app as an addition to traditional therapy for the treatment of
      anxiety disorders in youth, particularly those youth who may have limited access to mental
      health treatment in the traditional clinical setting.

      60 therapists in underserved areas will treat children with anxiety disorders in one of three
      conditions (treatment as usual, Anxiety Coach with face-to-face therapy, or Anxiety Coach
      with minimal direct contact) to determine the feasibility of using of Anxiety Coach to
      increase the frequency of exposure and improve outcomes with varying degrees of face-to-face
      contact (N = 60 patients).

    <description>In this condition therapists will provide 6 to 12 50-minute, face-to-face therapy sessions using Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach. The sessions are expected to initially occur weekly and be within the office although the therapist can leave the office to conduct exposure. The therapist is expected to utilize Anxiety Coach within the session, encourage the patient to use the application to complete homework, and review progress in-session via the web-based portal.</description>

    <description>In the TAU condition therapists provide treatment consistent with their orientation and clinical judgment. Previous research suggests that TAU will include supportive therapy, relaxation, and cognitive restructuring. The format of treatment will be 6 to 12, 50-minute, face-to-face therapy sessions in the therapist's office, with flexibility to leave the office (e.g., for exposure). Therapists can communicate with patients between sessions (e.g., phone calls), as long as this medium is not the primary mode of treatment.</description>

    <description>Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach is a smartphone application based on cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety disorders (i.e., exposure-based therapy) that can be used as 1) a stand-alone treatment requiring minimal provider contact, and 2) an augmentation of face-to-face treatment that increases clinician fidelity and patient adherence to evidence-based treatment. The design of Anxiety Coach is based on evidence and theory suggesting that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are well-suited for encouraging behavior change through 1) scheduled reminders to engage in therapeutic exercises, 2) point of performance support, 3) individually tailored information, 4) real-time symptom assessment, and 5) readily accessible asynchronous communication.</description>
