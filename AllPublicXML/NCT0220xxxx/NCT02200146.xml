  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is determining the non-inferiority in the overall success rate and the
      safety for a combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus low dose glucocorticoids
      compared to that for high dose glucocorticoids at 3 and 9 months in patients with pulmonary
      sarcoidosis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary EFFICACY measure is the per-subject overall success rate at the 3 month visit. Overall response is defined as a combined radiographic and clinical responses.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline- After 3 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects is considered clinically cured at the 3 month visit if they will have radiographic success (determined if Chest X-Ray is resolved or improved compared to the baseline; improvement was assessed if there were reduction in hilar adenopathies, less pulmonary involvement, changing in radiographic stage) PLUS a change in at least one of the followings: symptoms (determined by dyspnea or cough index score decrease compared to the baseline), and/or functional improvement (determined by an increase in % of predicted Forced Vital Capacity and/or increase in % of predicted Single-Breath Diffusion capacity of Lung for Carbon monoxide DLCO-SB compared to the baseline), and/or increase in resting Partial pressure of Oxygen in the artery blood (PaO2), and/or worst oxygen saturation increase during 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and/or increase in distance walked at 6MWT, compared to the baseline</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary SAFETY endpoint is the percent change in lumbar spine (L1-L4) bone mineral density from baseline to month 9 as measured by Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - After 9 months of treatment</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary EFFICACY endpoint was the change from baseline in radiographic success rate after 9 month of therapy (measured by High Resolution Chest Tomography HRCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline- After 9 months of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The radiographic success is determined if HRCT is resolved or improved compared to the baseline after 9 months</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline - After 3, 6 and 9 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Secondary SAFETY endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3, 6 and 9 months of therapy</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary SAFETY endpoint was the change from baseline in clinical laboratory tests (including inflammatory markers)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3, 6 and 9 months of therapy</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary SAFETY endpoint was the change from baseline in bone turnover markers and mineral metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>At months 3 and 9 from the start of therapy</time_frame>

    <measure>Secondary safety endpoint was the number of participants with Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events</measure>
