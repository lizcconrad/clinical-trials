      In this clinical trial the investigators aim to evaluate the diagnostic feasibility and
      safety of ceVUS with the intravesical use of OPTISON for vesicoureteral reflux detection and
      urethral imaging in children.

    <textblock>
      Contrast enhanced Voiding Urosonography (ceVUS) is a radiation free, highly sensitive imaging
      modality for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urethral imaging in children. It employs
      ultrasound technology in combination with ultrasound contrast agent, which is administered
      intravesically via a bladder catheter. Currently, second generation ultrasound contrast
      agents are commercially available, comprising of gas-filled microbubbles. CeVUS in children
      is being widely practiced, primarily in Europe, despite the fact that none of the
      commercially available ultrasound contrast agents are yet approved for clinical applications
      in pediatric population. In the United States, there is limited clinical experience with
      ceVUS in children. Among the currently commercially available ultrasound contrast agents,
      OPTISON has already been used in research and off-label in clinical settings involving adults
      and children. One in-vitro study has been conducted aiming to optimize the ultrasound
      technical parameters and the dose of OPTISON for intravesical administration in children. In
      this clinical trial the investigators aim to evaluate the diagnostic feasibility and safety
      of ceVUS with the intravesical use of OPTISON for vesicoureteral reflux detection and
      urethral imaging in children.

    <time_frame>10-15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnostic feasibility of ceVUS will be assessed with respect to the following outcome measurements:
Detection of reflux (presence of reflux or not).
Grading of reflux (grades I-V).
Urethra imaging and urethra pathology detection.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of ceVUS safety with intravesical administration of OPTISON.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 hour and up to 2 days after ceVUS and VCUG (Voiding CystoUrethroGraphy) examinations completion.</time_frame>
    <description>The overall safety and tolerability of ceVUS with OPTISON will be assessed regarding the incidence, frequency, type, severity, onset and duration of potential adverse events as well as the body organ/system involved, based on the following evaluations:
Physical examination: assessment of subject's overall physical condition and general appearance of skin and mucosal tissues in the perineal area.
Vital signs: pulse rate and arterial oxygen saturation measurements.
Adverse events evaluation: clinical signs of generalized hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactoid reactions.
Follow-up phase: Telephone contact and questionnaire-based interview 48 hours after ceVUS examination for follow-up of any possible adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Compare the diagnostic accuracy of ceVUS with Voiding CystoUrethroGraphy (VCUG) for vesicoureteral reflux detection and urethral imaging in children.</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnostic accuracy of ceVUS will be assessed by evaluation of the true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative cases of reflux and urethral imaging findings detected by ceVUS and VCUG examinations.</description>

    <description>OPTISON will be resuspended just before the performance of ceVUS examination, and 0.5% OPTISON solution will be used for intravesical administration. The exact OPTISON dose (ml) will be adjusted according to the age-related bladder filling capacity with a dose (ml) range from 0.3 mL in newborns to 3 mL in 18 year-old children. VCUG exam will be performed using the same bladder catheter with intravesical administration of the x-ray contrast agent.</description>
