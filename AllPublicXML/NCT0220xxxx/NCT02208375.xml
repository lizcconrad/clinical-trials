    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about and compare the highest tolerable
      doses and combinations of the drugs Lynparza™ (olaparib), AZD2014, and AZD5363 that can be
      given to patients with recurrent endometrial, triple negative breast, ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The safety of these drugs and drug combinations will
      also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and agree, you will be enrolled in
      a study group based on when you join the study. Up to 3 groups of 30 participants will be
      enrolled in the Dose Escalation part of the study, and up to 60 participants will be enrolled
      in the Dose Expansion part.

      If you are in a Dose Escalation group, you will be assigned to a combination dose level of
      one of the following:

        -  Olaparib and AZD2014 both taken every day,

        -  Olaparib taken every day and AZD2014 taken for 2 days on and 5 days off

      If you are in the first group above, you will begin taking olaparib alone on Week -1 (the
      week before Week 1) on Days -3, -2, -1. Then you will take AZD2014 alone on Days 1-4 of Week
      1. You will start taking olaparib again on Day 5 of Week 1 with AZD2014 every day for the
      rest of Cycle 1. For Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, you will continue to take both
      olaparib and AZD2014 together every day.

      If you are in the second group above, you will begin taking olaparib alone on Week -1 on Days
      -5, -4, and -3. Then you will take AZD2014 alone on Days 1 and 2 of Week 1. You will start
      taking olaparib again on Day 3 of Week 1 and continue every day for the rest of Cycle 1. For
      Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, you will take olaparib every day. You will add AZD2014 to
      your dosing schedule starting Week 2 Day 8, on a 2 days on/5 days off schedule.

      Up to 5 combination dose levels will be tested in the Dose Escalation groups. Up to 3
      participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will
      receive the lowest dose level. Each new group may receive a higher dose of the study drugs
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combinations is found.

      If you are in the Dose Expansion group, you will receive either the combination of
      olaparib/AZD2014 or olaparib/AZD5363 at the highest dose combination and schedule that was
      tolerated in the escalation groups.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You should not take olaparib 2 hours before or within 2 hours after eating. The olaparib
      tablets should be swallowed whole with 8 ounces (1 cup) of water. You should not chew, crush,
      dissolve, or divide the tablets.

      If you take AZD5363 or AZD2014, you should fast (have nothing to eat or drink except for
      water) at least 2 hours before your dose and then again 2 hours after your dose. You should
      take these doses at about the same time each morning and evening.

      You should avoid sugary or fatty food before taking a dose of study drugs. The study drugs
      can be taken in any order.

      If you vomit shortly after the olaparib tablets are swallowed, the dose should only be
      replaced if all of the intact tablets can be seen and counted. If you miss a scheduled dose,
      you should take the dose up to 2 hours after that scheduled time. If more than 2 hours have
      passed after the scheduled time, the missed dose should not to be taken and you should wait
      until the next scheduled time.

      Study Visits:

      Each study cycle is 4 weeks. The following tests and procedures will be performed:

      Each Week during Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will also
           have a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you have ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, blood (about 1-2
           teaspoons) will be drawn to check the CA-125 level.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  One (1) time during Weeks 1 and 2 only, blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn about 2-4
           hours after your study drug dose to test your blood sugar level.

      If you are in the Dose Expansion group, after Cycle 1 (4 weeks after starting the study
      drugs), you will have an image-guided biopsy of the tumor for biomarker testing.

      Every 4 weeks:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the level of fat
           in your blood.

        -  After Cycle 1, if you have ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, blood
           (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the CA-125 level.

      Every 8 weeks:

        -  Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn to test your blood sugar.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      After Cycle 2, you will have an ECHO every 8 weeks and then again whenever the study doctor
      thinks it is needed.

      After 6 months, you will have a CT scan every 3 cycles to check the status of the disease.

      Pharmacokinetic Testing:

      Blood (about ½ teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing
      measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. The time points for
      these draws will depend upon which study group you are in:

        -  If you will take both olaparib and AZD2014 every day, you will have PK draws on Days -1,
           4, and 8.

        -  If you will take olaparib every day and AZD2014 for 2 days on and 5 days off, you will
           have PK draws on Days -3, 1, 8, and 9.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive the study drugs for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 4 weeks after your last dose of study drugs, the following tests and procedures will
      be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the level of fat
           in your blood and your blood sugar level.

        -  You will have an EKG and an ECHO.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

        -  If you have ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, blood (about 1-2
           teaspoons) will be drawn to check the CA-125 level.

      This is an investigational study. Olaparib is commercially available and FDA approved for the
      treatment of certain types of ovarian cancer. Its use in this study is investigational.
      AZD2014 and AZD5363 are not FDA approved or commercially available. They are currently being
      used for research purposes only. The use of the study drugs in combination is
      investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
