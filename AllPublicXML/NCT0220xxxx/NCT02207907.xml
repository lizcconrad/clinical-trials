    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study will be to compare the Gingival Bleeding and Gingival
      Inflammation following twice daily use of a sodium bicarbonate experimental dentifrice
      compared to a 0% sodium bicarbonate toothpaste after 24 weeks of use. The study will be
      conducted at Silverstone Research Group. Participants will be recruited from their database
      and by use of an external recruitment agency.

    <measure>Number of Gingival Bleeding Sites at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of gingival bleeding sites were measured as bleeding index via a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system used to measure bleeding sites is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed. A bleeding site was considered as a BI score of 1 or 2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Gingival Index (MGI) at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Gingival Index (MGI) was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces at two sites on each tooth (papillae and margin). The scoring of the MGI was performed under dental office conditions using a standard dental light for illuminating the oral cavity. Compressed air, water and mouth mirrors were available to each examiner. This procedure was performed by a single examiner. The MGI scoring system is as follows: 0 = absence of inflammation; 1 = mild inflammation; slight change in color, little change in color; little change in texture of any portion of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 2 = mild inflammation; criteria as above but involving the entire marginal or papillar gingival units; 3= moderate inflammation; glazing, redness, edema, and/ or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 4 = severe inflammation; marked redness, edema and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, spontaneous bleeding, congestion, or ulceration</description>

    <measure>Plaque Control (Overall and Interproximal Dental Plaque Scores) Using Turesky Modification of Quigley &amp;Amp; Hein Plaque Index at 6, 12 and 24 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6,12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The dental examiner used the Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index to assess plaque on all gradable teeth. The plaque was first disclosed using a dye solution. Participants then rinsed with disclosing solution according to instructions. They had expectorated and rinsed with 10 mL of water for 10 seconds and expectorated again. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including the mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces. Disclosed plaque was scored as follows: 0= No plaque; 1= Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth; 2= A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth; 3= A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth; 4= Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less tan 2/3 of the crown of the tooth; 5= Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth</description>

          -  Excessive calculus present that interferes with the probing examination for Gingival
             Bleeding Index

          -  Participation in another clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug or oral

        <title>Number of Gingival Bleeding Sites at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>Number of gingival bleeding sites were measured as bleeding index via a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system used to measure bleeding sites is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed. A bleeding site was considered as a BI score of 1 or 2.</description>

          <title>Number of Gingival Bleeding Sites at 24 Weeks</title>
          <description>Number of gingival bleeding sites were measured as bleeding index via a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system used to measure bleeding sites is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed. A bleeding site was considered as a BI score of 1 or 2.</description>

        <title>Modified Gingival Index (MGI) at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Modified Gingival Index (MGI) was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces at two sites on each tooth (papillae and margin). The scoring of the MGI was performed under dental office conditions using a standard dental light for illuminating the oral cavity. Compressed air, water and mouth mirrors were available to each examiner. This procedure was performed by a single examiner. The MGI scoring system is as follows: 0 = absence of inflammation; 1 = mild inflammation; slight change in color, little change in color; little change in texture of any portion of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 2 = mild inflammation; criteria as above but involving the entire marginal or papillar gingival units; 3= moderate inflammation; glazing, redness, edema, and/ or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 4 = severe inflammation; marked redness, edema and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, spontaneous bleeding, congestion, or ulceration</description>

          <title>Bleeding Index at 6, 12 and 24 Weeks</title>
          <description>The Bleeding Index was performed by a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system to be used is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed</description>

        <title>Plaque Control (Overall and Interproximal Dental Plaque Scores) Using Turesky Modification of Quigley &amp;Amp; Hein Plaque Index at 6, 12 and 24 Weeks.</title>
        <description>The dental examiner used the Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index to assess plaque on all gradable teeth. The plaque was first disclosed using a dye solution. Participants then rinsed with disclosing solution according to instructions. They had expectorated and rinsed with 10 mL of water for 10 seconds and expectorated again. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including the mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces. Disclosed plaque was scored as follows: 0= No plaque; 1= Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth; 2= A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth; 3= A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth; 4= Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less tan 2/3 of the crown of the tooth; 5= Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth</description>
