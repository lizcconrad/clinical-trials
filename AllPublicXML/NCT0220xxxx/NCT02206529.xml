      The purpose of this study is to develop a Social Network Engagement (SNE) Intervention that
      will be integrated into a standard treatment program for childhood overweight. The
      investigators will conduct a pilot trial of SNE to assess feasibility and to estimate its
      effectiveness compared with historical controls who received standard treatment. The
      historical controls will be participants in the FOCUS trial (Family Overweight: Comparing Use
      of Strategies; NCT00746629).
