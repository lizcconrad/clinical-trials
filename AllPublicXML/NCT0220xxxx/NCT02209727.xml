    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of advanced, non-resectable, and/or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and
             at least one previous conventional treatment for advanced disease

          -  Eastern cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease, determined by World Health Organization (WHO)
             criteria using standard imaging modalities, including ultrasound, X-ray, CT and/or
             Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Bone scans and/or antibody scans are not to be used
             to determine the extent of the disease

          -  Expected survival of ≥ 16 weeks

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10**9/L

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 2.0 x 10**9/L

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal or &lt; 5 x upper limit of
             normal if liver metastases are present

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2mg/dL

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2mg/dL

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known brain metastases

          -  Exposure to an investigational agent within 30 days prior to receiving the scout dose

          -  Incomplete recovery from surgery or incomplete healing of an incision site or evidence
             of infection

          -  Treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation or immunosuppressive therapy within
             the 30 days (42 days for nitrosoureas and/or mitomycin C) of the scout infusion.
             Patients using inhaled corticosteroids are considered eligible for enrollment

          -  Serious illnesses, i.e., active infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders
             or other serious illnesses precluding the use of either 131I or sibrotuzumab

          -  Women who are breast-feeding or pregnant

          -  Men and women who were sexually active and are unwilling to utilize a medically
             acceptable method of contraception

          -  Hypertrophic skin disease or autoimmune disease that possibly involves over-expression
             of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which can be targeted by the antibody. These
             diseases include active inflammatory arthritis, cirrhosis, and keloids

          -  Unstable angina pectoris. Patients prescribed medication to control their angina
             pectoris must have been on a fixed dose for at least 1 month prior to screening to be
             eligible for trial enrollment

          -  Myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to screening

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Heart failure stage III or IV, or a left ventricular
             ejection fraction of ≤ 40 %

          -  Impaired lung function, measured by a decrease in forced expiratory volume at one
             second (FEV1) to less than 50 % of the predicted normal value
