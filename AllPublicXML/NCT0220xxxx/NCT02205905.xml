      This is an open-label, single-dose, non-randomized study in healthy male subjects to
      characterize the mass balance, metabolic disposition, and identification of the metabolites
      and general metabolic pathways following administration of a single dose of IV solution
      containing 200 mg of PER977 plus a tracer amount of 14C PER977 in health male subjects.
