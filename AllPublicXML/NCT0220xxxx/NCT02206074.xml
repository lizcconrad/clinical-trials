  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a research study to see if increasing the amount of nitrate
      (a substance found in large quantities in certain vegetables) in the diet can increase the
      ability of individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) to perform exercise. Some people with T2D
      find exercise more uncomfortable than individuals who do not have T2D. This may be explained
      by the experimental studies showing that T2D can result in reductions in the supply of oxygen
      to the muscles. Studies have also shown that for a given level of activity, individuals with
      T2D will be much closer to their maximum exercise capacity than healthy individuals. Dietary
      nitrate may have two important beneficial effects in individuals with T2D: 1) The effects of
      dietary nitrate on the responses to exercise may have a significant impact on the ability of
      individuals with Type 2 diabetes to perform daily tasks and exercise more comfortably and 2)
      experimental studies suggest that increased nitrate consumption has been shown to reduce the
      amount of oxygen required for a given level of exercise.

      The investigators will recruit 60 individuals with T2D. These people will take part in a
      randomised crossover design study where they will be asked to drink normal beetroot juice
      (rich in nitrate) and nitrate depleted beetroot juice, prior to performing two different
      walking exercise tasks (a six minute walk and repeated, low intensity treadmill walking).
      This study aims to determine if dietary nitrate supplementation reduces the amount of oxygen
      required for a given level of exercise in individuals with T2D. To test brain function
      individuals will be asked to perform a standard computerised decision making task following
      consumption of the nitrate rich and nitrate depleted juices.

    <description>Pulmonary gas exchange was measured during treadmill walking exercise (MedGraphics CardiO2 Cardiopulmonary Diagnostic Systems, St. Paul, MN, USA). Prior to each testing session the analysers were calibrated using known concentrations. The volume transducer was calibrated using a 3-litre syringe (Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, MO, USA). When we refer to the oxygen cost of exercise we are referring to end exercise oxygen uptake.</description>
