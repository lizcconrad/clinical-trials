      Aim oft he study is to compare two different devices for cerebral oximetry (FORE-SIGHTTM
      Monitor (CAS Medical Systems, Branford, Connecticut, USA and INVOSTM Somanetics, Troy,
      Michigan, USA) in patients undergoing surgical carotid thrombendarterectomy (cTEA) with
      crossclamped internal carotid artery (ACI). All procedures will be performed in regional
      anesthesia, therefore the patients will be awake and direct neurological examination during
      the procedure will be possible, giving information how the drop in cerebral saturation
      (measured with INVOS and FORESIGHT both on the same patient) correlates with any clinical
      symptoms.

      We expect to see a difference in the total drop and in the delay of the drop of cerebral
      oxygen saturation, making it possible to detect varieties in specificity and sensitivity of
      both devices compared to neurologic examination in the awake patient.
