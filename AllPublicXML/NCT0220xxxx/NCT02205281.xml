  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of an innovative, couples based
      approach to weight management during pregnancy. The primary hypothesis is that a
      couples-based behavioral weight management program will reduce the rate of gestational weight
      gain compared to standard care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gestational weight gain</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks gestation, 35 weeks gestation</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of gestational weight gain will be computed as difference between weights measured at study entry and gestational week 35; this difference will be divided by the number of weeks of observation during pregnancy (i.e., weeks between study entry and final pregnancy assessment). If gestational week 35 is unavailable, most proximal clinic visit weight will be used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Partner's weight loss</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry, when pregnant partner reaches 35 weeks gestation</time_frame>
    <description>Weight lost by the non-pregnant partner during the study will be assessed by subtracting their weight at the 35 week gestation visit from their study entry weight.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a multi-component program designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain in overweight and obese women and to promote weight loss in their non-pregnant overweight and obese partners through modifications of diet, exercise, and behavioral strategies during pregnancy.</description>
