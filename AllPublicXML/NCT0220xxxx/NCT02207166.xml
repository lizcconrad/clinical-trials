  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical devices are designed and manufactured by subjective design process that was only
      based on engineers' direct concepts to essential principles sets for the device. A home user
      may not easily use or operate the piece of medical device through the interfacing components
      as the designer's expected such as the meaning when pushing a button or switching a knob,
      even the required procedure needed when a certain display shown to fulfill some knowledge
      dependent judgment. In addition, the incompatible interfacing designed communication between
      a user and the device may cause possible errors that may trigger further negative
      consequences during the use of the device to a innocent home user.

      The aim of this research is to closely understand the consequent results of human factor
      engineering or usability engineering practices of various types or models of marketed
      home-use blood pressure monitors (BPM) in real use.

      The aim of this research is to closely understand the consequent results of human factor
      engineering or usability engineering practices of various types or models of marketed
      home-use blood pressure monitors (BPM) in real use. Participants of the intended user
      population interact with marketed BPMs in research to assess ease of learning, ease of use,
      effectiveness and efficiency of use, memorability, safety, and/or user appeal among the many
      possible attributes of interest. With these understanding and analysis of human factors
      engineering / usability engineering (HFE/UE) practiced status, it can help manufacturers to
      capture the required and diversified HFE/UE essences with the minimum or limited professional
      technical resources in hand some more efficiently.
