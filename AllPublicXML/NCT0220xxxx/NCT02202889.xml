  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      School based educational intervention to educate on bone health among Hispanic, Asian or
      non-Hispanic white girls between 10-13 years with end points of knowledge gained, calcium
      intake and bone density in . The hypothesis was that the educational program would increase
      knowledge, improve dairy food and calcium consumption and enhance bone health in this
      population. A secondary hypothesis was that lactose maldigestion would be an impediment to
      improved dairy food consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A targeted behavioral intervention to improve calcium intake and bone mass was conducted at
      middle schools in 6 states. The primary outcomes of bone mass and dietary calcium were
      assessed among Asian, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white girls between 10 -13 y. Lactose
      maldigestion (LM) was determined by a breath hydrogen test (BHT). Perceived milk intolerance
      (PMI) and calcium intake were assessed by questionnaires and bone mineral content (BMC) was
      determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Data from 473 girls were used in a
      multiple linear regression to examine the impact of the intervention while accounting for PMI
      and LM and adjusting for covariates.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Middle schools within one-hour driving time of one of the designated DXA measurement sites
        were eligible to participate in ACT if their student population had a higher proportion of
        Asian or Hispanic students than the respective state's average. - Girls recruited for
        evaluation measures were limited to those being at least 75% Asian, Hispanic or
        non-Hispanic White based on the race/ethnicity of their biological parents.
