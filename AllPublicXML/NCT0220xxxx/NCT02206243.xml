      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the prostatic arterial embolization
      (PAE) with Embozene® Microspheres (Boston Scientific) in sphere sizes of 250 µm for the
      treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

      EmboProstate is an observational study that collects data of patients with benign prostatic
      hyperplasia that are treated with 250 µm Embozene ® Microspheres (Boston Scientific). The
      study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the microspheres for prostatic arterial
      embolization for benign prostata hyperplasia treatment. 10 adult male subjects will be
      enrolled in this study. If eligible patients are recruited, they will undergo the prostate
      artery embolization procedure in our radiology department. Once the catheter is placed in the
      prostate artery, a fluid containing thousands of tiny particles (microspheres) is injected
      through the catheter into these small arteries which nourish the prostate. The injected
      embospheres will slow the blood flow to the prostate reducing urinary tract symptoms caused
      by BPH. Within one week after PAE as well as after one, three and six months post-procedure
      an MRI examination ill occur. A follow-up visit using a questionnaire is due after 6 months.
