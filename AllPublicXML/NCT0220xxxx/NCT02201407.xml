  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open--label, multicenter, national observational study will investigate the
      effectiveness of standard of care treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a in participants with
      chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Participants who have never received any hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      treatment and participants previously treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) are qualified
      for enrollment. The observation period is 48 weeks (peginterferon alfa--2a standard of care
      treatment) and for up to 24 weeks thereafter (72 weeks in total).
