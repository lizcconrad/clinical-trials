  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Imatinib in two groups of patients; all
      patients should be diagnosed less than 3 months as chronic myeloid leukemia in a chronic
      phase. The group A, the reference group, will have 10% or less than 10% of the BCR-ABL level
      after three month dosing and be maintained their dose of 400mg/day. On the other hand, the
      group B, will have more than 10% and the dose will be increased from 400mg/day to 600mg/day.
      The superiority of the group B will be proved by evaluating the MMR rate of these two groups
      after 12 months of administeration of Imatinib.
