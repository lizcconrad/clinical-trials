      Participants who were enrolled in study 20110118 (FOURIER; NCT01764633) at select sites in
      select countries (selected based on study start-up timelines) were invited to participate in
      this cognitive function study, 20130385. There was no separate randomization for Study
      20130385; data were analyzed according to Study 20110118 randomized treatment arm.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Spatial Working Memory Strategy Index of Executive Function (6-8 Boxes) Z Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments were conducted at Baseline and at weeks 24, 48, 96, 144 and end of study visit (median time on study was 19.4 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments were performed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), a language-independent battery of computerized tests that is used to assess cognitive function.
The Spatial Working Memory (SWM) test assesses the cognitive domain of executive function (high-level thinking and decision making). Patients search for colored tokens hidden inside boxes on the screen by touching them. The critical instruction is that once a token has been found inside a box, there will never be a token hidden inside that box again, so patients must not return to a box where a token has been found.
The SWM strategy index of executive function represented the number of times a subject began a search with a different box. The Z score represents the standardized measure of how far an individual subject deviates from the study cohort average at baseline. A higher Z score reflects better performance. The mean change from baseline averaged across all the visits is reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Spatial Working Memory (SWM) Between-errors Z Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments were conducted at Baseline and at weeks 24, 48, 96, 144 and end of study visit (median time on study was 19.4 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments were performed with the CANTAB, a language-independent battery of computerized tests that is used to assess cognitive function. The Spatial Working Memory (SWM) between-errors test assesses the cognitive domain of working memory (holding material in mind while that material is being actively processed). Patients search for colored tokens hidden inside boxes on the screen by touching them. The critical instruction is that once a token has been found inside a box, there will never be a token hidden inside that box again, so patients must not return to a box where a token has been found.
The SWM between-errors score is the number of times that a patient revisited a box in which a token had previously been found. The Z score represents the standardized measure of how far an individual participant deviates from the study cohort average at baseline. A higher Z score reflects better performance. The mean change from baseline averaged across all the visits is reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Paired Associated Learning (PAL) Total Errors Adjusted Z Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments were conducted at Baseline and at weeks 24, 48, 96, 144 and end of study visit (median time on study was 19.4 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The CANTAB PAL test assesses visuospatial episodic memory (storing/retrieving information by associating an event with a time and place). Boxes on the screen opened up one at a time to reveal a number of patterns. Participants were asked to remember the location of each pattern. After all the boxes had been opened, each pattern was then shown in the center of the screen in a randomized order, and the patient should touch the box where they think each pattern was hidden. The PAL total errors adjusted comprised the number of errors committed by a patient plus an adjustment for the estimated number of errors the patient would have made on any stages that were not reached.
Z score represents the standardized measure of how far an individual patient deviates from the study cohort average at baseline. A higher Z score indicated better performance. The mean change from baseline averaged across all the visits is reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Reaction Time (RTI) Median 5-choice Reaction Time Z Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments were conducted at Baseline and at weeks 24, 48, 96, 144 and end of study visit (median time on study was 19.4 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments were performed with the CANTAB, a language-independent battery of computerized tests that is used to assess cognitive function. The Reaction Time (RTI) test assessed the cognitive domain of psychomotor speed (detecting and responding to a stimulus). Participants held down a button until a spot appeared in 1 of 5 circles on the screen. As soon as possible after the spot flashed up, the patient lifted their finger from the button and touched the circle in which the spot appeared. The RTI median 5-choice reaction time was the median duration between the onset of the stimulus and the release of the button. Z score represents the standardized measure of how far an individual participant deviates from the study cohort average at baseline. A higher Z score reflects better performance. The mean change from baseline averaged across all the visits is reported.</description>

          <title>Spatial Working Memory (SWM) Strategy Index of Executive Function Raw Score</title>
          <description>CANTAB is a series of computerized tests to assess cognitive function. The SWM test assesses the cognitive domain of executive function (high-level thinking and decision making). Patients search for colored tokens hidden inside boxes on the screen. Tokens were never hidden inside the same box twice, so patients must not return to a box where a token was already found. The SWM strategy index of executive function represents the number of times a patient began a search with a different box. A high score represents an inefficient use of strategy and planning. The raw score ranges from 4 to 28.</description>
          <population>All enrolled and dosed participants who completed a baseline cognitive functional assessment prior to or on the first date of administration of study drug and who have at least one post-baseline cognitive measure.</population>

          <description>The CANTAB SWM test assesses the cognitive domain of executive function (high-level thinking and decision making). Patients search for colored tokens hidden inside boxes on the screen. Tokens were never hidden inside the same box twice, so patients must not return to a box where a token was already found. The SWM strategy index of executive function represents the number of times a patient began a search with a different box. The Z score represents the standardized measure of how far an individual deviates from the study cohort average at baseline. A higher Z score reflects better performance.</description>

          <title>Spatial Working Memory Between Errors Raw Score</title>
          <description>The CANTAB Spatial Working Memory (SWM) between-errors score test assesses the cognitive domain of working memory (holding material in mind while that material is being actively processed). Patients search for colored tokens hidden inside boxes on the screen. Tokens were never hidden inside the same box twice, so patients must not return to a box where a token was already found. The SWM between-errors score is the number of times that a patient revisited a box in which a token had previously been found. A lower score indicates better performance. The raw score ranges from 0 to 279.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Spatial Working Memory Strategy Index of Executive Function (6-8 Boxes) Z Score</title>
        <description>Assessments were performed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), a language-independent battery of computerized tests that is used to assess cognitive function.
The Spatial Working Memory (SWM) test assesses the cognitive domain of executive function (high-level thinking and decision making). Patients search for colored tokens hidden inside boxes on the screen by touching them. The critical instruction is that once a token has been found inside a box, there will never be a token hidden inside that box again, so patients must not return to a box where a token has been found.
The SWM strategy index of executive function represented the number of times a subject began a search with a different box. The Z score represents the standardized measure of how far an individual subject deviates from the study cohort average at baseline. A higher Z score reflects better performance. The mean change from baseline averaged across all the visits is reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Spatial Working Memory (SWM) Between-errors Z Score</title>
        <description>Assessments were performed with the CANTAB, a language-independent battery of computerized tests that is used to assess cognitive function. The Spatial Working Memory (SWM) between-errors test assesses the cognitive domain of working memory (holding material in mind while that material is being actively processed). Patients search for colored tokens hidden inside boxes on the screen by touching them. The critical instruction is that once a token has been found inside a box, there will never be a token hidden inside that box again, so patients must not return to a box where a token has been found.
The SWM between-errors score is the number of times that a patient revisited a box in which a token had previously been found. The Z score represents the standardized measure of how far an individual participant deviates from the study cohort average at baseline. A higher Z score reflects better performance. The mean change from baseline averaged across all the visits is reported.</description>

        <description>The CANTAB PAL test assesses visuospatial episodic memory (storing/retrieving information by associating an event with a time and place). Boxes on the screen opened up one at a time to reveal a number of patterns. Participants were asked to remember the location of each pattern. After all the boxes had been opened, each pattern was then shown in the center of the screen in a randomized order, and the patient should touch the box where they think each pattern was hidden. The PAL total errors adjusted comprised the number of errors committed by a patient plus an adjustment for the estimated number of errors the patient would have made on any stages that were not reached.

        <description>Assessments were performed with the CANTAB, a language-independent battery of computerized tests that is used to assess cognitive function. The Reaction Time (RTI) test assessed the cognitive domain of psychomotor speed (detecting and responding to a stimulus). Participants held down a button until a spot appeared in 1 of 5 circles on the screen. As soon as possible after the spot flashed up, the patient lifted their finger from the button and touched the circle in which the spot appeared. The RTI median 5-choice reaction time was the median duration between the onset of the stimulus and the release of the button. Z score represents the standardized measure of how far an individual participant deviates from the study cohort average at baseline. A higher Z score reflects better performance.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
