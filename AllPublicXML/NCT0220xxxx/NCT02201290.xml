  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase III extension study to evaluate the long-term safety of
      eltrombopag in pediatric patients with chronic ITP who previously participated in study
      TRA115450. This study will allow dosing of eltrombopag at an individualized dose for each
      subject based upon platelet count. The starting dose will be based on the subject's dose at
      the end of the TRA115450 study. The maximum dose will be 75 mg daily.

    <description>Eligible subject will be allocated to 1 of 3 age-defined cohorts. Cohort 1: between 12 and 17 years old, Cohort 2: between 6 and 11 years old, and Cohort 3: between 1 and 5 years old. For Cohorts 1 and 2, eltrombopag tablets will be administered, however, subjects in Cohort 2 may use eltrombopag powder for oral suspension (Eltrombopag PfOS) if they have difficulty swallowing tablets and are receiving a dose of eltrombopag of &lt; 40 mg. For Cohort 3, either eltrombopag tablets or PfOS will be administered.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject's guardian and accompanying
             informed assent from the subject (for children over 6 years old).

          -  Subjects must be between 1 year and &lt;18 years of age at Day 1.

          -  Subjects must have enrolled in TRA115450/PETIT2 study.

          -  Subjects must have completed Part 1 and Part 2 of TRA115450/PETIT2 study.

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential (after menarche) must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 24 hours of first dose of study treatment; agree and be able to
             provide a blood or urine specimen for pregnancy testing during the study; agree to use
             effective contraception during the study and for 28 days following the last dose of
             study treatment, and not be lactating.

          -  Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use
             effective contraception from 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of
             study treatment until 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any clinically relevant abnormality, other than ITP, identified on the
             screening examination or any other medical condition or circumstance, which in the
             opinion of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the
             study or suggests another primary diagnosis (e.g. Thrombocytopenia is secondary to
             another disease).

          -  Any subject considered to be a child in care, defined as one who has been placed under
             the control or protection of an agency, organization, institution or entity by the
