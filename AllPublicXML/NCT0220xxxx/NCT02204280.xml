      Definite diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is currently based on renal biopsy findings. In
      most cases, however, the diagnosis can be reliably made in patients with macroalbuminuria in
      the presence of diabetic retinopathy.Microalbuminuria is often used as a prognostic marker in
      type 1 diabetes, because approximately 50% of type 1 diabetes patients with microalbuminuria
      will eventually develop diabetic nephropathy. Conversely, microalbu- minuria is of much less
      value as a marker in DM because it has a variety of causes, including hypertension. Thus,
      additional markers are needed to identify patient groups with a high risk of developing overt
      diabetic nephropathy. The aims of this study is checking urine UbA52 levels with ELISA to
      identify its significance in the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.

      It is now well recognized that the incidence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. It is the
      leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western countries. Diabetic nephropathy
      has been reported to occur in 25%-40% of people with diabetes. The appearance of
      microalbuminuria usually is regarded as incipient nephropathy, but recently, work has
      suggested that some individuals with diabetes and decreased GFR may not have an increased
      urinary AER.Identification of markers for prediction of the clinical course of diabetic
      nephropathy remains a major challenge. Previous research showed that m/z14766 protein by mass
      spectrometry, was selectively excreted in the urine of diabetic nephropathy patients, the m/z
      14766 mass peaks were identified as UbA52. We suppose that UbA52 can be regard as a simple
      and practical biomarker for diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.
