      This study evaluates the efficacy of the addiction of Cyclophosphamide to Revlimid-low dose
      dexamethasone (Rd) in relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma patients, who experienced a
      biochemical progression, without CRAB, during Rd treatment.

      This protocol is a phase II multicenter, open label study designed to determine whether the
      addiction of Cyclophosphamide to Rd (CRd) treatment significantly increases response rates
      and prolonged the outcome (PFS, OS) in patients who experienced a biochemical relapse,
      without CRAB under Rd treatment. Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3
      study periods: pre-treatment, treatment and long-term follow-up (LTFU).

      The pre-treatment period includes: screening visits, performed at study entry. After
      providing written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated
      for study eligibility. The screening period includes the availability of inclusion criteria
      described above. Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      The treatment period includes: administration of the combination CRd for 9 cycles. In order
      to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment, patients will attend the study center visits
      at least every 2 weeks. The response will be assessed after each cycle.

      During the LTFU period, after development of confirmed progression disease (PD), all patients
      are to be followed for survival every 1-3 months via telephone or office visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma who experienced biochemical
             progression, without CRAB, during treatment with Rd. CRAB means the presence of organ
             damage, multiple myeloma related (renal impairment and/or anemia and/or new bone
             lesions and/or hypercalcemia). It is sufficient one of the previous signs for defining
             the presence of CRAB. Biochemical progression means: positivization of serum/urine
             immunofixation for patients who reached a complete remission with Rd treatment or at
             least 25% increment of monoclonal component in serum/urine for patients who reached at
             least a stable disease (SD).

          -  Patient exposed to previous therapy included Lenalidomide, Thalidomide, Bortezomib
             and/or autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and in treatment with Rd.

          -  Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the
             protocol requirements.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future
             medical care.

          -  Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or, if at
             childbearing potential, must: understand that the study medication could have an
             expected teratogenic risk.

          -  Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without
             interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy
             (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug therapy,
             even if she has amenorrhea. This applies unless the subject commits to absolute and
             continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are effective methods
             of contraception*:

               -  Implant**

               -  Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)**

               -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot

               -  Tubal sterilisation

               -  Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be
                  confirmed by two negative semen analyses

               -  Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)

          -  Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined
             oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of
             venous thromboembolism (VTE) continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral
             contraception.

          -  **prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly
             in patients with neutropenia due to risk of infection.

          -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25
             mills International Units on milliliter (mIU/ml) not more than 3 days before the start
             of study medication once the subject has been on effective contraception for at least
             4 weeks. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice
             complete and continued abstinence.

          -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4 weeks
             after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilization.
             These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the start of next
             treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who
             practice complete and continued abstinence.

          -  â  A female subject or a female partner of a male subject is considered to have
             childbearing potential unless she meets at least one of the following criteria: Age

             â¥50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for â¥ 1 year (amenorrhoea following cancer
             therapy does not rule out childbearing potential), premature ovarian failure confirmed
             by a specialist gynaecologist, previous bilateral salpingooophorectomy or
             hysterectomy, xy genotype, Turner's syndrome or uterine agenesis.

          -  Male subjects must:

               -  Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption
                  and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of
                  childbearing potential and has no contraception.

               -  Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of
                  study drug therapy.

          -  All subjects must:

               -  Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one
                  week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused
                  study drug to the investigator.
