    <description>Access to the femoral artery is performed through a lateral incision from the inguinal ligament. Operations technique on the abdominal aorta.
Aorta-femoral bypass. Proximal anastomosis between the prosthesis and aorta is applied in the sort of &quot;end-to-side&quot; in the reconstruction by shunting.
After jaws prosthesis conduction on hip distal anastomosis is formed with twisting controlling. In a case of preserved antegrade blood flow the femoral artery anastomosis applied in the sort of &quot;end-to-side&quot;. If antegrade flow is absent, anastomosis is formed in the sort of &quot;end to end&quot;.</description>

    <intervention_name>Recanalization and stenting of aorta-iliac segment</intervention_name>
    <description>Standard endovascular access is performed under local anesthesia and affected arterial segment is visualized.
Stenosis or artery occlusion is passed with hydrophilic guide. In case of occlusion transluminal or subintimal (often &quot;mixed&quot;) artery recanalization is performed. To maximize the preservation of the affected artery initial patency, occlusion recanalization is performed by ante-and retrograde accesses. Then stenosis or occlusion predilation is performed with balloon catheter (balloon catheter diameter is smaller than the affected artery diameter for 1-2 mm). After control angiography stent is installed in the aorta-iliac area throughout the lesion (lesion diameter corresponds to the stenotic arteries diameter).</description>
