  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea is a chronic facial disfiguring dermatosis characterized by different stages like
      flushing, erythema, telangiectasia and papulo-pustular lesions. Recommended treatments
      include topical (metronidazole) and systemic (doxycycline) antibiotics with only a suspensive
      effect. The bipolar radiofrequency (RF) with Elos system (infrared light) is a device
      emitting an electromagnetic current inducing an increase in temperature when applied on the
      skin, potentiated by infrared light. The monopolar RF has already been used in rosacea on a
      small number of cases with positive and prolonged results. RF with Elos system has been
      evaluated on erythemato-telangiectasic rosacea with encouraging results. Demodex folliculorum
      (DF) is a long transparent mite which asymptomatically parasitizes pilosebaceous follicle of
      normal human skin sometimes responsible of inflammatory facial dermatoses. The prevalence and
      density of DF are increased in rosacea, and DF is suspected to play a role in the
      pathogenesis of rosacea. DF is sensitive to heat, and the investigators hypothesize that
      radiofrequency treatment may affect the survival of the mite and should be effective to treat
      papulopustular rosacea.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the percent of patients with a score of 0 or 1 severity of rosacea (absent or mild) on a scale of 0-3 (Physician Global Assessment) evaluated on photographs by an independent investigator.
Inflammatory lesions are considered for the evaluation of PGA because it is not expected that the compared treatments improve erythema and telangectasia.</description>

c ) The patient satisfaction will be assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) .
d) The evaluation of the density of demodex will be assessed on the skin surface biopsy ( SSSB ) and by confocal microscopy ( MCIV ) e ) The skin temperature during radiofrequency sessions will be reported by infrared thermometer skin temperature during the treatment session RF</description>
