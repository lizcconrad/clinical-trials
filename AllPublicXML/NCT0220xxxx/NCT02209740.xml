    <textblock>
      Renal outcome could be different after switching tenofovir to different antiretroviral
      strategies, in case of renal toxicity. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the importance
      of renal evolution in these patients, in terms of grade and time to renal improvement,
      according to the different options after interrupting tenofovir. The aim of this study was to
      explore the renal outcome after tenofovir according to new antiretroviral regimen.

      Renal toxicity has become an important issue in a large number of HIV infected patients
      receiving a tenofovir-containing regimen. However, there are no data about the best
      antiretroviral regimen in patients switching tenofovir because of renal toxicity, in time,
      grade or persistence of renal improvement. Thus, patients with renal toxicity on tenofovir,
      defined as:

        -  a progressive decrease of at least 25% of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR, by
           chronic kidney disease-epi equation), or

        -  confirmed value of GFR below 60 ml/min in two successive determinations, or

        -  proximal tubular renal dysfunction, as indicated by the presence of at least 3 of the
           following parameters: proteinuria&gt; 150 mg/g; excretion fractional of phosphorus in urine
           &gt; 20%; glucosuria &gt; 150 mg; or/and tubular proteinuria/albuminuria ratio above 0.4.

      who changed to the combination of abacavir plus a third drug, or to a nucleoside
      analogues-free antiretroviral combination (dual therapy, monotherapy) will be followed for 1
      year to establish the time and grade of improvement (defined as the lack of above criteria).
