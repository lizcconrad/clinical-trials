      Background:

        -  All cells go through cycles which allow them to divide. In normal cells, Chk1 and Chk2
           (Chk1/2) stop cell division at various points to allow any damage to DNA to be repaired.

        -  When Chk1/2 are not present, cells stop dividing and eventually die. LY2606368 blocks
           the Chk1/2 proteins.

        -  Researchers hope that by blocking Chk1/2, it will cause tumor cells to die, thereby
           shrinking tumors.

      Objective:

      - To see if LY2606368 helps shrink tumors in patients with certain breast, ovarian or
      prostate cancers.

      Eligibility:

      - Patients at least 18 years old with breast or ovarian cancer. They must have a mutation in
      BRCA1/2 genes for group 1, high grade serious ovarian cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for
      group 2, or triple negative breast cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 3, or prostate
      cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 4.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have
           blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart test, scans, and X-rays. They will have a
           piece of their tumor removed at entry (CT-assisted biopsy).

        -  Study Day 1: Participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn. They may have a CT
           scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

        -  Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle: Participants will receive the study drug through
           an IV.

        -  Vital signs will be checked before and after. An ECG will be done within 1 hour after.

        -  Day 15 and Day 28: Participants will have a physical exam, blood drawn, and a 12 lead
           ECG.

        -  Cycle 1: Participants will have weekly phone calls and blood draws. Participants may
           have another CT-assisted biopsy at the end of cycle 1.

        -  Cycle 2 and beyond, blood will be drawn every other week for routine blood tests.

        -  Participants will have an after-study visit with a physical exam and blood tests.
           Participants may have another biopsy when they progressed on treatment. They will have
           scans of the chest, pelvis, and abdomen and a 12 lead ECG.

      Background:

        -  Checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 (Chk1/2) are major regulators of the cell cycle and are
           intimately associated with the cellular response to DNA damage and repair. Chk1/2 also
           function as the primary mediators of cell cycle arrest in tumors with p53 dysfunction,
           such as high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), and triple negative breast cancer
           (TNBC).

        -  Patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (gBRCAm) have inherent defects in DNA damage
           repair pathways.

        -  Chk1/2 inhibition alone yielded DNA damage and mitotic catastrophe preclinically, even
           in the absence of DNA damage by external agents in tumors with underlying DNA repair
           dysfunction.

        -  The second-generation Chk1/2 inhibitor, LY2606368, yielded safety and preliminary single
           agent activity in advanced cancer patients.

        -  We hypothesize that LY2606368 will result in clinical benefit in patients with
           gBRCAmassociated breast or ovarian cancers, and HGSOC and TNBC with low genetic risk.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the objective response rate (CR+PR) of single agent LY2606368 in patients with
      gBRCAm-associated breast or ovarian cancer, HGSOC and TNBC with low genetic risk.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with recurrent/refractory gBRCAm-associated breast or ovarian cancer, HGSOC,
           and TNBC, for whom there remains no standard curative measures.

        -  A documented deleterious gBRCA1/2m for breast or ovarian cancer patients enrolling in
           Cohort 1.

        -  Negative gBRCAm testing or negative family history of hereditary breast and ovarian
           cancer syndrome for HGSOC (Cohort 2).

        -  Negative gBRCAm testing or negative family history of hereditary breast and ovarian
           cancer syndrome for TNBC (Cohort 3).

        -  Effective with amendment I (version date 4/24/2017), mCRPC

        -  Negative gBRCAm testing or negative family history of hereditary breast and ovarian
           cancer syndrome for recurrent platinum-resistant HGSOC with measurable and biopsiable
           disease (Cohort 5).

        -  Negative gBRCAm testing or negative family history of hereditary breast and ovarian
           cancer syndrome for recurrent platinum-resistant HGSOC with measurable but without
           biopsiable disease (Cohort 6).

        -  Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or
           biological therapy for at least 4 weeks.

        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function.

      Design:

        -  This is an open label, single arm phase II trial to examine activity of LY2606368 I
           patients in the 5 independent cohorts (Cohorts 1-6).

        -  LY2606368 will be dosed at the RP2D of 105 mg/m2 IV once every 14 days of a 28daycycle.

        -  Research samples including whole blood, CTCs, and tumor biopsies will be obtained for PD
           endpoints at baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15 (6-24hr post-2nd dose), and/or at progression in
           all patients. Tumor biopsies will not be performed in Cohort 6.

        -  Patients (Cohorts 1-3, 5 and 6) will be evaluated every two cycles for response using
           RECIST v1.1 and every cycle for safety using CTCAE v4.0.

        -  or INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. A documented deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutation (gBRCA1/2m) obtained in a
                  CLIA-certified laboratory, including but not limited to Myriad Genetics, either
                  by multi-gene panels or individual testing, for Cohort 1 patients prior to study
                  enrollment. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) of BRCA1/2 are not
                  considered deleterious. Patients with VUS or deleterious mutation in other genes
                  without gBRCA1/2m can be considered for Cohort 2 or 3 or 5.

               2. Patients enrolling in the sporadic high grade serous epithelial or high grade
                  endometrioid ovarian cancer group, Cohort 2, must have a negative family history
                  of hereditary breast ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, or negative gBRCA1/2m test.

               3. Patients enrolling in the triple negative breast cancer (ER-/PR-/Her2-) group,
                  Cohort 3, must have a negative family history of HBOC syndrome, or negative
                  gBRCA1/2m test. A family history of HBOC is defined by NCCN Genetic/Familial
                  High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian guideline.

               4. For Cohorts 1-3, 5 and 6: patients must have breast and/or epithelial or
                  endometrioid ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, and/or fallopian tube
                  cancer histologically or cytologically confirmed at the NCI that is metastatic or
                  unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no
                  longer effective. ER/PR/HER2 status needs to be documented either by an outside
                  source or at NCI. Patients with gBRCA1/2m with history of or active breast and
                  ovarian cancers are considered for Cohort 1.

                  Patients enrolling in Cohort 5, the recurrent platinum-resistant sporadic high
                  grade serous epithelial or high grade endometrioid ovarian cancer group, must
                  have a negative family history of HBOC syndrome, or negative gBRCA1/2m test.
                  Patients should have recurrent platinum-resistant - defined as disease recurrence
                  by imaging within 6 months of the last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy.
                  Rising CA125 only is not considered as platinum-resistant disease. Patients with
                  primary platinum refractory disease defined as progression during or within 3
                  months after receiving first-line platinum based chemotherapy are not eligible.

               5. All patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that
                  can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be
                  recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as greater than
                  or equal to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to 10
                  mm with spiral CT scan.

               6. All patients except Cohort 6 must have at least one lesion deemed safe to biopsy
                  and be willing to undergo a mandatory baseline biopsy. For Cohort 5, the second
                  biopsy at progression is mandatory for the responders (PR/CR/SD) &gt; 4 months.

               7. Patients enrolling in Cohort 6, the recurrent platinum-resistant sporadic high
                  grade serous epithelial or high grade endometrioid ovarian cancer group, must
                  have a negative family history of HBOC syndrome, or negative gBRCA1/2m test.
                  Patients should have recurrent platinum-resistant, defined as disease recurrence
                  by imaging within 6 months of the last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy.
                  This cohort should have measurable (defined by RECIST v1.1) but without
                  biopsiable disease, determined by PI and Interventional Radiology (e.g., cystic
                  abnormal mass, not safely biopsiable disease). Rising CA125 only is not
                  considered as platinum-resistant disease. Patients with primary platinum
                  refractory disease defined as progression during or within 3 months after
                  receiving first-line platinum based chemotherapy are not eligible.

               8. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from previous therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal
                  therapy, and radiation therapy, or investigational agents; 6 weeks for mitomycin
                  C).

               9. The use of raloxifene, denosumab, or bisphosphonates for bone health is allowed.

              10. There is no limit on the number of prior therapies.

              11. Patients must be at least 1 week from the last dose of complementary or
                  alternative medications.

              12. Patients who have had major surgery must be fully recovered and greater than or
                  equal to 4 weeks postoperative prior to enrolling on study.

              13. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

              14. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.

              15. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function (in the absence of
                  transfusion 24 hours prior to dosing) as defined below:

                  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL

                  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

                  test within 7 days prior to the start of the study.

              18. The effects of LY2606368 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason, all subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate
                  contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and
                  for at least four months following the last dose of experimental therapy. All
                  subjects of reproductive potential must also agree to use both a barrier method
                  and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for four
                  months after the last dose of study drug(s). Should a woman become pregnant or
                  suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should
                  inform her treating physician immediately.

              19. Ability of subject to understand, adhere to protocol requirements and the
                  willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          2. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
             Patients with brain metastases diagnosed greater than 1 year prior to study entry may
             be considered if they received sterilizing therapy to the CNS (resection or radiation)
             and have been CNS recurrence-free for the 1-year period.

          3. Patients who have had prior treatment with LY2606368 or other Chk inhibitors

          4. Patients with a serious cardiac condition, such as congestive heart failure; New York
             Heart Association Class III/IV heart disease; unstable angina pectoris; myocardial
             infarction within the last 3 months; valvulopathy that is severe, moderate, or deemed
             clinically significant despite medical intervention; or arrhythmias that are
             symptomatic or refractory to medical intervention.

          5. Patients who have QTc interval of &gt; 470 msec on a screening electrocardiogram.

          6. Patients with a prior history of drug-induced serotonin syndrome, or a family history
             of long-QT syndrome.

          7. Lack of recovery of prior adverse events due to prior cancer therapy to Grade less
             than or equal to 1 (NCI CTCAE; except alopecia). Electrolyte abnormalities that are
             corrected with supplementation will be eligible. Patients with platinum-related grade
             2 or greater hypomagnesemia (on replacement) will be eligible. Stable persistent grade
             2 peripheral neuropathy may be allowed as determined on a case-by-case basis at the
             discretion of the PI.

          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, clinically
             significant GI bleeding or hemoptysis within 28 days prior to the start of the study,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          9. Patients with active infection will not be eligible, but may become eligible once
             infection has resolved and they are at least 7 days from completion of antibiotics.

         10. Another previous or current invasive malignancy within the last 2 years, with the
             exception of curatively treated stage Ia cervical carcinoma, or resected stage Ia
             endometrial cancer, and noninvasive nonmelanoma skin cancers. Patients with gBRCA1/2m
             and primary breast or ovarian cancers will be eligible for Cohort 1.

         11. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with LY2606368. HIV- positive patients
             who are not on HAART and have CD4 counts &gt; 500 will be considered on an individual
             basis.
