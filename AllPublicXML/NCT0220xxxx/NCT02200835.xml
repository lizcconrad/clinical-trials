    <textblock>
      Few data exist on gender-related differences in clinical features, management, and outcomes
      of acute aortic dissection (AAD) in China. Accordingly, we enrolled 2015 patients with AAD
      from 15 hospitals in China to access differences in clinical features, management and
      outcomes between men and women. in this study, our results provided new insights into
      gender-related differences in clinical features, management and outcomes in the Chinese
      patients with AAD. Important implications may be helpful to improve diagnostic and
      therapeutic outcomes.
