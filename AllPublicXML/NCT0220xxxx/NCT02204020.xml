    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in outcomes after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) for Acute
      Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), the risk of relapse remains high
      and is the most common cause of mortality after HCT. Moreover, treatment options for relapse
      after HCT are limited. Strategies to reduce relapse with maintenance therapy in patients who
      are at high risk are needed to improve survival. 5-aza is a hypomethylating agent that has
      shown immune modulating properties that may enhance the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect,
      including upregulation of tumor-associated antigen and costimulatory molecule expression.
      Moreover, 5-aza has properties that suggest protection against graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD) as well. Preliminary data shows that it is well tolerated and effective in clinical
      use for the treatment of AML or MDS relapse after HCT, as well as for maintenance therapy.
      This study will evaluate the use of 5-aza for maintenance after HCT in patients with AML or
      MDS with risk factors that are associated with a high risk for relapse.

      Phase II study of 5-aza maintenance after allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT)
      for high-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Early studies
      indicate 5-aza is a hypomethylating agent that has shown immune modulating properties that
      may enhance the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, including upregulation of
      tumor-associated antigen and costimulatory molecule expression. 5-aza also has properties
      that suggest protection against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary objective is to
      evaluate relapse rate at one year. Secondary objectives will include the incidence of both
      acute and chronic GVHD as well as relapse-free survival, overall survival and toxicity.
      Correlatives will be performed to evaluate the effect of 5-aza maintenance on the immune
      system.

      Subjects must be transplant candidates with MDS or high risk characteristics of AML. Subjects
      are consented, screened, then transplanted. Those showing complete response and no active
      GVHD after transplant can proceed to maintenance with 5-aza. Bone marrow biopsies are
      performed for response assessment after transplant as well as every three cycles (1 cycle=28
      days) while on treatment. Dosing starts at 32mg/m2 and can be increased every 2 cycles
      without a serious adverse event (SAE), or reduced per toxicity for up to 12 cycles.

    <description>The planned initial dose of 5-aza is 32mg/m2 (Level 0) administered either subcutaneously or intravenously for days 1 through 5 of a 28-day cycle, which will be initiated between day+30 and day+100 after HCT. Patients who tolerate this dose based on hematologic parameters and with no SAEs for two consecutive cycles will be eligible for a dose escalation to 50mg/m2 (Level +1). Patients who tolerate this dose based on the same criteria as above for two consecutive cycles will be eligible for a dose escalation to 75mg/m² (Level +2). Patients will continue at dose Level +2 for the remainder of the study provided there are no toxicities that require dose reduction. Patients requiring a dose reduction are not eligible for re-escalation.</description>
