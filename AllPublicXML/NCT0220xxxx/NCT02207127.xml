  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a fundamental gap in the investigators ability to design effective surgical
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for the 30-40% of patients who cannot tolerate
      non-surgical treatment. OSA surgery outcomes vary widely, with the chances of a successful
      outcome ranging from 5% to 65% for individual or combination procedures. To predict - and
      thereby to improve - outcomes, the investigators must determine what predicts surgical
      success. This project will compare findings from two evaluations: drug-induced sleep
      endoscopy (DISE) and upper airway magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DISE has demonstrated
      important benefits, but it has important limitations. Upper airway MRI is the most complete
      evaluation performed during wakefulness, making it conducive to broad application and less
      expensive than DISE, but there are no studies utilizing MRI as a surgical evaluation. The
      investigators propose a cross-sectional analysis of 40 adult subjects with moderate to severe
      OSA. In addition to history, physical examination, and polysomnogram (sleep study), all
      subjects will undergo DISE and MRI to characterize the pattern of obstruction. The
      investigators will examine the association between DISE and MRI, focusing on specific DISE
      findings that have been associated with surgical outcomes. The investigators
      multidisciplinary team has substantial expertise and experience in OSA investigation, DISE,
      and upper airway MRI.
