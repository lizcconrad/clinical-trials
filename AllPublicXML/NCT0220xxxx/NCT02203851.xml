             defined as either of the following:

               1. Completion of the entire follow up period, thus reaching End-of-study (EOS)
                  visit.

               2. Loss of response, defined as decrease in response to &lt;PASI50 at any time from
                  week 24.

          -  Patient must give informed consent and sign an approved consent form prior to any

          -  Negative urine pregnancy dip stick test at the roll-over visit, and if available at

        In addition:

          -  Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized and between menarche and

               1. year postmenopausal), that, if sexually active agree to use one of the

                  weeks after last treatment in this trial. Medically accepted methods of
                  contraceptions are: ethinyl estradiol containing contraceptives, diaphragm with
                  spermicide substance, and intra-uterine-device.

                  OR Female patients which have vasectomized sexual partner(s) (vasectomy at least

          -  Surgically sterilized female patients with documentation of prior hysterectomy, tubal
             ligation or complete bilateral oophorectomy.

        previously occurring menses.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients who experienced any drug related Serious Adverse Event in the preceding trial

          -  Patients who have developed guttate, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis or
             drug-induced psoriasis (as diagnosed by the investigator), during the preceding trial
             1311.2.

          -  Evidence of current or previous clinically significant disease, medical condition
             other than psoriasis, or finding of the medical examination (including vital signs and
             electrocardiography (ECG)), that in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise
             the safety of the patient or the quality of the data.

          -  Known clinically important acute or chronic infections including hepatitis, HIV. In
             regards to Tuberculosis the following applies:

          -  Signs or symptoms suggestive of current active or latent tuberculosis upon medical
             history, physical examination and/or a chest radiograph (both posterior-anterior and
             lateral views, taken within 3 months prior to the first administration of study drug
             and read by a qualified radiologist).

          -  History of latent or active TB prior to screening, except for patients with documented
             completion of an adequate treatment regimen, at least 6 months prior to the first
             administration of study agent.

          -  Positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (IGRA) within 2 months prior to the
             roll-over visit (if available), in which active tuberculosis has not been ruled out.
             This does not apply to patients with history of latent tuberculosis with documented
             completion of an adequate treatment regimen, at least 6 months prior to the first
             administration of study agent.

          -  Patients who have developed malignancy, or suspicion of active malignant disease
             during the preceding trial 1311.2 (except treated cutaneous squamous cell or basal
             cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that have been adequately treated).

          -  Intake of restricted medications or other drugs considered likely to interfere with
             the safe conduct of the study, as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse within 3 months prior to the roll-over visit that would
