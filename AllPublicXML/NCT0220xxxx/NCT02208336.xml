  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research trial studies electronic medical record review in monitoring the effects of
      adherence on myelosuppression and morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors
      receiving temozolomide and radiation therapy. Myelosuppression is a condition in which bone
      marrow activity is decreased, resulting in fewer red blood cells, white blood cells, and
      platelets and is a side effect of some cancer treatments. Morbidity is a term that refers to
      having a symptom of disease or medical problems caused by a treatment. Monitoring patients'
      electronic medical records to compare side effects, such as myelosuppression and morbidity,
      with treatment adherence may be a way to enhance patient care by organizing data for medical
      staff.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Retrospectively measure the frequency of nonadherence with established monitoring
      guidelines in the target patient population.

      II. Retrospectively assess the impact of nonadherence events on myelosuppression severity and
      patient morbidity.

      III. Prospectively measure the effect of an automated notification program on adherence
      rates.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantify any time savings realized by patient care staff through the use of such a
      program.

      II. Quantify the number of patient care interventions that directly result from this
      automated monitoring and notification program.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' electronic medical records are reviewed for adherence, severe myelosuppression, and
      patient morbidity retrospectively and prospectively.

    <description>A two-sided 95.0% confidence interval for a single proportion using the large sample normal approximation will be extended from 8.1% in the observed proportion for an expected proportion of 25% non-adherence.</description>

    <description>Severe myelosuppression will be defined as grade 3 or grade 4 myelosuppression from Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 criteria. The dates of any severe myelosuppressive events will be recorded. A Fisher's exact test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level will be used.</description>

    <measure>Impact of nonadherence events on patient morbidity (retrospective)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient morbidity (including date of event) will be assessed on all participants with severe myelosuppression, and includes: death during treatment with temozolomide or up to 90 days after treatment, the number of transfusions received for myelosuppression during treatment with temozolomide or up to 90 days after treatment, and the length of the hospital stay for myelosuppression during treatment with temozolomide or up to 90 days after treatment. A Fisher's exact test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level will be used.</description>

    <measure>Effect of an automated notification program on adherence rates (prospective)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the rates of adherence between the retrospective and prospective time periods, a Fisher's exact test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level will be used.</description>

             temozolomide and radiation therapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide for newly
             diagnosed malignant gliomas from 01/01/07 through 03/31/2010 will be analyzed

          -  PROSPECTIVE: All patients seen in Dr. Lesser's clinic who receive concurrent
             temozolomide and radiation therapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide for newly
             diagnosed malignant gliomas during and after the construction of the system until the
