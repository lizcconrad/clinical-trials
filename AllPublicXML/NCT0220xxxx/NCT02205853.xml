      The aim of this study is to develop and identify the most effective strategy to implement
      PCRPs into daily care. We want to assess the added value of a multi-faceted strategy compared

      The aim of this study is to develop and identify the most effective strategy to implement
      PCRPs into daily care. We want to assess the added value of a multi-faceted strategy compared
      with a single-faceted patient-directed strategy.

      We will conduct a clustered controlled before and after study (CBA) in the Netherlands that
      compares two strategies to implement PCRPs. The patient-directed (PD) strategy (five
      hospitals) will focus on change at the patient level. The multi-faceted (MF) strategy (five
      hospitals) will focus on change at the patient, professional and organizational levels.
      Eligibility criteria are as follows: (A) patients: adults; preferably (history of) cancer in
      the gastro-intestinal, reproductive and/or urological system; successful primary treatment;
      and without recurrence/metastases. (B) Healthcare professionals: involved in cancer care.

      A stepwise approach will be followed:

      Step 1: Analysis of the current implementation of PCRPs and the examination of barriers and
      facilitators for implementation, via a qualitative study with patients (four focus groups n =
      10-12) and their healthcare workers (four focus groups n = 10-12 and individual interviews n
      = 30-40) and collecting data on adherence to quality indicators (n = 500 patients, 50 per
      hospital).

      Step 2: Selection and development of interventions to create a PD and MF strategy during
      expert's roundtable discussions, using the knowledge gained in step 1 and a literature search
      of the effect of strategies for implementing PCRPs.

      Step 3: Test and compare both strategies with a clustered CBA (effectiveness, process
      evaluation and costs), by data extraction from existing registration systems, questionnaires
      and interviews. For the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, n = 500 patients, 50 per
      hospital. For the process evaluation, n=50 patients, 5 per hospital, and n = 40 healthcare
      professionals, 4 per hospital.
