  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is present in at least 60% of the patients with a muscle disease and can be the most
      disabling symptom. In combination with other impairments, this often results in low levels of
      physical activity and decreased social participation, leading to large societal costs.
      Energetic is a self-management group program aimed at improving participation and physical
      endurance in these patients. Our hypothesis is that Energetic results in improved
      participation and improved physical endurance, less experienced fatigue and better quality of
      life compared to usual care, without increasing health care costs.

             occupational therapist; to this end, motivational interviewing will be used (including
             a advantages/disadvantages matrix; a visual analogue scale (VAS) to rate the
             importance of participation in de program; and a VAS to rate the confidence a patient
             has that participation in the program is feasible)

          -  being able to formulate at least 3 individual participation goals during the interview
             with the occupational therapist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  active depression or other psychiatric disorder as indicated by a consultant
             psychologist or by the medical history,

          -  pregnancy,

          -  severe co-morbid condition,

          -  having participated in the Energetic program before

          -  a travel distance perceived as too burdensome
