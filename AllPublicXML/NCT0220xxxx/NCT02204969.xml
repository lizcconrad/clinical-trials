      The thermal therapy combined with magnetic fields and ozone has a direct effect on patients

      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and cognitive deteriorating in the
      advanced age. This main target of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using novel coil design (H2) for stimulation of deep
      brain structures concomitantly with regular treatment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.
      TMS acts by generating magnetic fields in the brain which simulate neuro-chemical changes and
      stimulate neuronal activity translating into increased secretion of growth factors such as
      brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Hence it is postulated that TMS will have a positive
      effect on the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with AD and may ameliorated the
      progression of the disease. The treatment is non-invasive, with no significant side effects,
      and no need of hospitalization or anesthesia. The trial is phase II double blind study
      including 100 AD patients ages between 50 to 80 with mild or moderate AD (Mini Mental State
      Examination [MMSE] 16 to 26) divided into 3 groups. All participants will receive standard
      medical therapy for AD. In addition, patients recruited for the study will receive 16
      sessions of TMS with the H2 coil over 8 weeks. The first group will receive excitatory
      stimulation of 10 Hz over the prefrontal and parietal cortex, the second group will receive
      inhibitory stimulation of 1 Hz over similar brain areas and control patients will receive the
      same amount of Sham sessions. Patient will receive 3 treatments per week in the first 3 weeks
      and then 1 treatment per week for additional 4 weeks. Patients will be evaluated before the
      treatments, after 8 weeks of treatment and after another 8 weeks without treatment. The
      evaluations will include cognitive function according to ADAS-COG and MMSE, Activity of daily
      living (ADL) functions according to ADSC-ADL, behavioral function according to the
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), depression according to the Cornell Scale for Depression in
      Dementia (CSDD), care giver satisfaction according to the RUD LITE scale and computerized
      cognitive evaluation according to the NEXING battery. We expect that the cognitive,
      behavioral and ADL functions will improve better in the study group as compared to the Sham
      treated group. From previous trial of TMS in neurological patients, although not in AD, we
      anticipate that adverse events rate will be similar between groups proving the safety of deep
      TMS treatment in patients with AD. In case our hypothesis will be proven, deep TMS treatment
      will be added as an important modality to the conventional therapy of AD patients.

      All patients will be received 500 mcg/d of lithium as supplement nutritional in form spring
      mineral water
