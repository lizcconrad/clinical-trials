      The purpose of this study is to conduct long-term surveillance for efficacy, safety and
      immunogenicity of the GSK Biologicals RTS,S/AS01E candidate Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      vaccine in infants and children in Africa following a primary vaccination series
      (NCT00866619). No new subjects will be enrolled in this extension study.
