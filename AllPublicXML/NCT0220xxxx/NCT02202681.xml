  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to assess the tolerability and feasibility of a tethered OFDI capsule
      to image the duodenum.

      A total of 24 subjects will be asked to swallow the tethered capsule, while they are awake
      and unsedated and ask for their feedback. Images will be taken using the OFDI system while
      the capsule travels from the esophagus into the stomach and into the duodenum.

      Subjects including healthy volunteers as well as patients with Celiac disease will be
      recruited and asked to swallow the OFDI capsule while being awake and unsedated. The capsule
      is attached to a tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule
      as it progresses down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the duodenum using natural
      propulsive force called peristalsis.

      As the capsule progresses, multiple 2-dimensional cross sectional images of the duodenum are
      acquired. Images are analyzed at a later stage.
