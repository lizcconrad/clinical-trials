  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two thirds of all strokes happen in developing countries like Pakistan. There is a serious
      lack of health literacy regarding survival after stroke. We hypothesize that our set of 5
      minute videos that teach important skills to stroke survivors and their caregivers , that can
      be replayed in cell phones for extended learning, will increase their adherence to
      Medications after stroke and improve the control of blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and
      glucose in the participants getting cell phone based educational videos.

      In 80% of patients with stroke, further events may be prevented by altering lifestyle
      behavioral risk, and increasing adherence to medications to control hypertension, diabetes,
      lipids. Yet, there exists a huge science to implementation gap to adopt these widely
      recognized beneficial medicines and lifestyle changes. Those most in need remain unable to
      actualize the benefits of science, due to lack of knowledge, perceived complexity, literacy
      challenges, limited time by poorly communicating doctors in crowded clinics and essentially,
      failure by regional scientists to translate Western science in creative resonant ways that
      enable wider uptake.

      In this randomized double blind translational implementation study, we will study the
      effectiveness of the implementation tactic of delivering enabling stroke education and risk
      reduction to literacy and numeracy challenged Pakistani stroke survivors and their
      caregivers, via short films teaching stroke recognition, healthy habits, medication adherence
      and self-care. These 5 minute films , using a 'show me not tell me ' approach, will be
      replayed in tablets, and shown to all stroke patients in the intervention arm. The primary
      objective of this study is to answer the research question - Does video based education given
      to stroke patients (with mild to moderate disability) and their caregivers before discharge,
      and during follow up, improve adherence to therapy and control of three major risk factors
      (Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia) at twelve months post index stroke?

    <description>Stroke patients are given instructions before discharge regarding diet, need for rehabilitation, possible complications, medication use and information booklets are also handed out. This information is imparted by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neuro physician, a stroke nurse, a dietitian and a physiotherapist. These are verbal instructions and handouts are written in English. On the day of discharge, or 24 hours prior to discharge, a discharge coordinator details the skills learnt . A detailed written discharge summary is given out detailing all aspects of care, follow-up, medications and test results.</description>

    <description>Intervention is as follows:
5 minute videos, on various stroke related topics/ themes delivered in one session before discharge from the hospital (list topics on which videos have to made)
Discussion and questions and answers after viewing video to ensure that core message has been understood and there are no lacunae in understanding the message of video.
Phone card - a memory chip installed in the cell phones of intervention team that ensures that the videos can be replayed at home to refresh memory of some details that may not have been captured in the mandatory viewing sessions.</description>

             e.g. moya moya, carotid dissections, gunshot to neck, post Coronary Artery Bypass
             surgery etc.

          4. Serious concurrent medical illnesses, like cancer, renal failure, acute liver disease
             in past 6 months (that precludes use of statins), chronic liver disease, that exclude
             the use of stroke preventive medications, or require non standardized therapy.

          5. Any use of off label, non-guideline medications, due to patient unique comorbid
             conditions that interfere with medication compliance to antihypertensive, statins,
             antiplatelet agents and diabetes control.
