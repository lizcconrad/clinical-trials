  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke and dementia are two of the most common and disabling conditions worldwide,
      responsible for an enormous and growing burden of disease. There is increasing awareness that
      the two conditions are linked, with cognitive impairment and dementia common after stroke,
      vascular dementia accounting for about one-fifth of all dementia cases and recent evidence on
      the contribution of vascular risk factors to Alzheimer's disease. Yet we still know very
      little about whether brain volume loss - a hallmark of dementia - occurs after stroke, and
      whether such atrophy is related to cognitive decline. The aim of this research is to
      establish whether stroke patients have reductions in brain volume in the first three years
      post-stroke compared to control subjects, and whether regional and global brain volume change
      is associated with post-stroke dementia in order to elucidate potential causal mechanisms
      (including genetic markers, amyloid deposition and vascular risk factors). We hypothesise
      that stroke patients will exhibit greater brain volume loss than comparable cohorts of
      stroke-free controls, and further, that stroke patients who develop dementia will exhibit
      greater global and regional brain volume loss than those who do not dement. An understanding
      of whether stroke is neurodegenerative, and in which patients, may be used to help guide the
      early delivery of disease-modifying therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical stroke

          2. Aged greater than 18 years;

          3. Able to have cognitive testing and MRI scan; and

          4. Able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant medical comorbidities precluding participation in cognitive testing, or
             making survival for three years unlikely;

          2. Normal exclusion criteria for MRI; e.g., implanted metal, severe claustrophobia;

          3. Pre-existing dementia

          4. Pregnancy, as a precaution to prevent exposing them to multiple MRI scans in a
             12-month period

          5. People in existing dependent or unequal relationships with any member of the research
             team, to protect against coercion
