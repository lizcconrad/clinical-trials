  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to gain understanding of the basic responses of the
      lungs to inflammation and specifically if there may be a better way to detect graft
      inflammation using non-invasive methods as well as to determine the effectiveness of
      immunosuppressive treatment regimens in preventing acute rejection in lung transplant
      recipients.

    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is a potential way we can
      measure lung inflammation. FDG-PET imaging is a clinically accepted and FDA-approved method
      that is commonly used in the diagnosis and management of cancer. PET is a machine that
      detects radiation and generates pictures using a donut shaped scanner similar in appearance
      to an x-ray &quot;CAT&quot; or computed tomography (CT) scan. FDG stands for [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose,
      a radiolabeled sugar that is used to identify areas of inflammation with the PET scanner. A
      CT scan takes a picture of what the lungs and airways look like.

      T cells are the primary cause of acute rejection of lung transplants. Because T cells must
      divide in order to be activated and cause rejection, imaging them while they are dividing is
      another way that we can determine whether acute rejection is occurring. A new PET tracer
      called [18F]ISO-1 binds to dividing cells. Therefore, [18F]ISO-1 may help us measure acute
      rejection more accurately. [18F]ISO-1 is an investigational drug.

        Any patient within 7 months of double-lung transplantation and who is scheduled for
        bronchoscopy with biopsy will be eligible. Patients will be identified via the bronchoscopy
        schedule through the Lung Transplant Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital / Washington
        University School of Medicine and approached for potential participation prior to their
        scheduled bronchoscopy. PET/CT imaging with [18F]FDG will be performed, if consented, no
        more than 3 days after results from the biopsy are reported. [18F]ISO-1 PET/CT imaging will
        be performed the day after [18F]FDG PET and can be performed after treatment for acute
        rejection has been initiated. We intend to image 30 lung transplant recipients with no
        evidence of rejection (grade A0) and 30 recipients with mild to moderate (grades A2-3)
        rejection.
