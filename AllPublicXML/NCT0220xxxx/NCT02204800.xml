    <textblock>
      Active surveillance in kidney cancer involves closely observing the tumor with periodic
      imaging studies rather than immediately proceeding to an invasive treatment. This does not
      mean that the tumor is ignored or that future treatment is not necessary, rather it means the
      tumor does not require treatment at this time. On active surveillance, a tumor is closely
      monitored without treatment, however if the tumor changes and reaches a predefined threshold
      that your physician no longer considers safe, your physician will strongly encourage
      treatment.

    <textblock>
      While some patients with small kidney tumors may require eventual treatment, most do not.
      Therefore, the American Urologic Association considers active surveillance an acceptable
      treatment strategy. This protocol is a prospective study of active surveillance for small
      clear cell kidney tumors (the most common type of kidney tumor) and is designed to identify
      if there are predictive markers that may help identify which patients are unlikely to require
      surgical treatment. Predictive markers are measurable characteristics that may predict the
      future behavior of a tumor. There are currently no available predictive markers that can help
      identify which tumors are not destined to require treatment. Such a marker may be useful to
      increase the use of active surveillance by informing patients with small renal tumors that
      immediate treatment may be considered overtreatment.
