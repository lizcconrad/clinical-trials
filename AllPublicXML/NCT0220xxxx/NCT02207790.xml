  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is primarily designed to bridge the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data for
      E2609 between Japanese subjects and non-Japanese (ie, white) subjects. To bridge these PK
      characteristics, the proposed study includes a cohort of white subjects treated for
      comparison with the cohort of Japanese subjects treated at the same dose. This comparison
      serves as a key PK bridge in assessing ethnic factors that may contribute to differences in
      plasma concentrations. Pharmacokinetic assessments in the proposed study will include
      confirmation of dose proportionality in Japanese subjects. This study will also evaluate
      safety and tolerability in Japanese subjects.
