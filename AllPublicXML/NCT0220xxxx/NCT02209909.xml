  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet activation after off pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery may affect thrombus
      formation. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of preoperative continuation of
      aspirin on platelet activation after off pump coronary artery bypass surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing OPCAB surgery will be randomized to continue preoperative aspirin or
      discontinue aspirin before surgery.

      Platelet activation can be evaluated by measuring platelet p-selectin using flowcytometry. In
      this study, we will compare platelet-activated markers and conventional coagulation tests.
