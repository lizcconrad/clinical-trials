  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic transfusion reactions are a common complication of transfusion by blood components
      containing plasma. This study aims to investigate passive transfer of Immunoglobin E
      antibodies as a risk factor of allergic reactions to plasma transfusion by use of Solvent
      Detergent plasma.

    <textblock>
      Prospective observation study, aiming to measure transfer of Immunoglobin E antibodies and
      other factors associated with allergic complications in patients receiving plasma
      transfusion. Samples from patients and plasma units will be investigated. Samples frozen
      until investigation. To assess biological relevance of findings, additional analysis of
      basophil reactivity will be performed and information on clinical allergy collected by use of
      a questionaire .

      In-patients will be recruited if receiving plasma transfusion during surgery or if an
      allergic transfusion complication occurs.
