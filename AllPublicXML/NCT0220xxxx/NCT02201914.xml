  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor ovarian response to stimulation in IVF cycles is a challenging and frustrating
      condition, due to its poor prognosis in terms of chances of pregnancy and live births.
      Various ovarian stimulation regimens have been tried to overcome these obstacles. A simple
      approach is increase the dose of the gonadotropin administration, but the results in terms of
      pregnancy rate are very low Another commonly used stimulation regimen is the microdose GnRH
      agonist protocol, which takes advantage of the initial rise in endogenous gonadotropins that
      follows the agonist administration in the early follicular phase and subsequently prevents a
      premature LH surge, with fewer cycle cancellations. However, their application in poor
      responders, even if in small doses and for a limited period, has been questioned as they may
      cause oversuppression of ovarian function, leading to a prolonged cycle and increased
      treatment costs without improving the outcomes.

      Recently, GnRH antagonists were introduced in ART treatment. They are effective in preventing
      a premature LH surge and allow for a more natural recruitment of follicles in the follicular
      phase in a non-suppressed ovary, offering a potential alternative in the treatment of these
      patients. However, randomized studies evaluating the efficacy of this regimen in poor
      responders did not show any improvements in pregnancy rates. Current approach have included
      the addition of oral agents such us clomiphene citrate (CC) to gonadotropins. Some authors
      have investigated the role of CC in addition to low dose of gonadotropins in mild stimulation
      regimen, demonstrating that, despite a small number of retrieved oocytes, good quality
      embryos were produced with a subsequent improvement in the fertilization rate, clinical
      pregnancy rate and live birth rate. The only study that evaluate the efficacy of CC in
      addition to high doses of gonadotropins in poor responders showed improving in number of
      retrieved oocytes, transferred embryos and biochemical pregnancy; however, clinical pregnancy
      rate and live birth rate remained low and showed no measurable increase.

      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of the CC as an adjunctive to a high dose
      of gonadotropins in cycles with antagonist protocols with the microdose GnRH agonist and
      flexible antagonist protocols in women who responded poorly to ovarian stimulation, to
      determine whether this protocol may improve IVF outcomes, offering a valid alternative in
      poor responder patients treatment.
