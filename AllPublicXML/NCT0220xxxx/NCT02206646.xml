    <textblock>
      To monitor the safety of Metalyse® in clinical practice in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction over a period of 6 years as required by Korean authorities, with the following
      observations:

        1. Unexpected adverse drug reactions

        2. Frequency and nature of adverse events (AEs)

        3. Factors on the safety and efficacy profile of the Metalyse® Injection. Efficacy of
           Metalyse® was also assessed.
