    <textblock>
      This single-center, prospective, interventional clinical study is conducted to evaluate the
      repeatability and reproducibility of structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the
      peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT
      (Optical Coherence Tomography) device. Data obtained from healthy volunteers in this study
      are compared to those from a previous, larger healthy volunteer study that was conducted in
      the United States and Europe (S-2012-1), and data from glaucoma patients are compared to
      those from the healthy volunteers.

      The study will include approximately 15 normal subjects and approximately 15 subjects who
      have glaucoma of varying degree. All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging and other
      study procedures in one single visit. All examinations performed on the subjects are
      non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for marketing in
      Europe and in the U.S. Total study duration is anticipated to not exceed 4 weeks.

    <description>This study is designed to determine optic nerve head structural values such as ONH rim thickness, RNFL thickness values, and macula structural values such as total retinal or ganglion cell layer thickness, as measured using the Spectralis device in a population of either subjects that are determined to be clinically &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;glaucomatous&quot;. The expected reproducibility and repeatability are approximately 5% or less of the respective means (coefficients of variation, cov). This study shall result in a 95% confidence interval of the cov estimate not larger than ±1% when all data is pooled (normal and glaucoma cases). Statistical analysis of the measurement values will consist of the computation of mean and standard deviation in repeated examinations with the SPECTRALIS OCT in the normal and glaucomatous population.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is not an employee of the eye clinic.

          -  Age ≥18

          -  Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, give consent, and to follow
             instructions.

          -  For &quot;normal subjects&quot;: Healthy eye without prior intraocular surgery (except cataract
             surgery and Lasik - laser-assisted refractive surgery) and without clinically
             significant vitreal, retinal or choroidal diseases, diabetic retinopathy, or disease
             of the optic nerve.

          -  For &quot;glaucoma subjects&quot;: Early to advanced glaucoma according to existing medical
             charts.

          -  Refraction between +6 and -6 diopters and astigmatism ≤ 2 diopters.

          -  When both eyes are eligible, one randomly selected eye will enter the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • Insufficient quality of Spectralis OCT images (this is not determined until after
        Spectralis OCT examination, and is an unusual circumstance). Minimum requirements are:

          -  Retina completely included in image frame,

          -  Quality Score ≥ 20 in the stored ART mean images
