    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the bladder cancer recurrence free rate,
      according to a phase II pilot study, of intravesical instillation of sequential BCG and
      EMDA/MMC after TUR. The study is designed as a one-sample investigation: the outcome measure
      is disease recurrence rate. Follow up will continue up to 5 years.

      For sample size determination, disease recurrence rate will be compared with literature data
      of recurrence rate obtained in standard BCG alone administration (Lamm's protocol).

      TURBT (TransUrethral Resection of Bladder Tumor)

      Prior to enrolment, all patients must sign a consent form and will have a Complete Blood
      Count (CBC), Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) and a Urinalysis (UA) performed. The patients White
      Blood Count (WBC) must be greater than 4.0 10^9/L and platelet count greater than 150 10^9/L
      to receive drug.

      Week 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8: BCG instillation: 50 mg wet weight (10•2±9•0x108 colony-forming
      units) BCG Connaught substrain. Lyophilised (ie, freeze-dried) BCG are suspended in 50 ml
      bacteriostatic-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride (NaCl) solution. After bladder draining, the
      suspension is infused intravesically through a 14 Fr Foley catheter and retained in the
      bladder for 60-90 min; bladder emptying is followed by catheter removal.

      Week 3, 6 and 9: A Foley catheter is inserted and the bladder is carefully drained. 40 mg MMC
      dissolved in 100 ml NaCl 0.9% solution are instilled intravesically through the electrode
      catheter by gravity and retained in the bladder for 30 min, while 23 mA for 30 min pulsed
      electric current is given externally. Two dispersive cathode electrodes are placed on lower
      abdominal skin after degreasing with alcohol. The bladder is then emptied and the catheter
      removed. Patients are assigned one course of treatment per week for 6 weeks with sequential
      BCG and EMDA/MMC. Two BCG instillations and one EMDA/MMC instillation constitute one cycle
      for a total of two cycles.

      A CBC and basic metabolic panel (BMP) will be performed weekly and at the beginning of each
      cycle. Prior to dosing with mitomycin C at week 3, a CBC will be performed and also at weeks
      4 and 5 if the CBC has changed. A UA will be performed prior to each intravesicular
      instillation.

      Maintenance treatment of eMMC will be given at month 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 (after last dose of
      BCG of the initial treatment). Maintenance of BCG will be given around month 5, 8, and 11.
      CBC, BMP, UA, and a history/physical (H&amp;P) will be performed before each EMDA/MMC procedure.
      UA and a H&amp;P will be performed before each BCG.

          -  After a restaging TURBT patients with histologically proven primary high grade
             (grade3) and/or pT1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, with or without pTis
             and pTis alone are regarded as being at high risk for tumour recurrence and
             progression.

          -  Patients may enroll in this study if they are thought to have no residual disease
             after TURBT.
