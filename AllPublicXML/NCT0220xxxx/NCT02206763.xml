  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      momelotinib (MMB) and erlotinib, as well as define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      momelotinib (MMB) combined with erlotinib in adults with epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR)-mutated, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Participants will be sequentially enrolled to receive progressively
      increasing doses of MMB in combination with erlotinib. Escalation of MMB doses will proceed
      to the MTD, defined as the highest tested dose associated with dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)
      during the first 28 days of combined erlotinib and MMB treatment. There will be four dose
      levels and each treatment cycle will consist of 28 days.
