  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen is one of the most widely used analgesic in the world, recommended for the
      symptomatic treatment of fever and pain.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of acetaminophen in association with
      N-acetylcysteine.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate if the association in healthy volunteers of
      acetaminophen and N-acétylcystéine

        1. - decrease the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen in comparison to a group control

        2. - and if this antinociceptive effect may depend of the genetic polymorphism of GSH
           enzyme.

      Period 1 : To Day -4 to Day 0

      Day -4 at 8:00 am at Clinical Pharmacology Center

        -  Inclusion Visit, signature of Informed consent form, clinical exam.

        -  Training test

        -  Blood sample (GSH, pharmacogenetic, Biochemistry assay)

        -  Randomization and attribution of treatment for the fisrt study period at home: (day -4,
           -3, -2, -1) 4 days of oral acetaminophen and [N-acetylcysteine or placebo] according to
           the randomization plan.

      At day -3, -2 and -1 a salivary sample will be done to control the treatment compliance.

      Day 0 at Clinical Pharmacology Center Clinical examination Measurement of the basal pain
      thresholds and pain evaluation (Visual Analog Scales) Blood and urinary sample (acetaminophen
      and GSH assay)

      T0 : Administration of product: acetaminophen and [N-acetylcysteine or placebo]

      T0+1H: Thermal stimulation according to the established paradigm (threshold temperature +3°C
      ) and pain evaluation (Visual Analog Scales)

      T0+2H: Thermal stimulation according to the established paradigm (threshold temperature +3°C
      ) and pain evaluation (Visual Analog Scales) and Blood sample (acetaminophen assay)

      T0+3H: Thermal stimulation according to the established paradigm (threshold temperature +3°C
      ) and pain evaluation (Visual Analog Scales)

      T0+4H: Thermal stimulation according to the established paradigm (threshold temperature +3°C
      ) and pain evaluation (Visual Analog Scales) and Blood and urinary sample (acetaminophen,
      GSH, biochemistry assay)

      - Lunch before departure

      2 weeks of wash-out

      Period 2 : To Day 17 to Day 21

      Same of period 1. Subject who receives N-acétylcystéine in period 1 will receive placebo in
      second period and vice versa.
