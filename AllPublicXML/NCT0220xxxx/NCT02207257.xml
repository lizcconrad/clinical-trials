  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the establishment of anticoagulation (&quot;re-anticoagulation&quot;) of
      subjects with edoxaban following reversal by PER977 and will identify a dose regimen of
      PER977 that reverses the effects of edoxaban for up to 21 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, sequential group, ascending PER977 reversal dose study in
      healthy volunteers. Subjects will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive either PER977 or
      placebo. All subjects will receive a single dose of edoxaban 60 mg on Days 1-4. On Days 3 and
      4, study drug will be administered 3 hours following edoxaban. Beginning with Cohort 2, study
      drug will be administered only to those subjects with a minimum increase in whole blood
      clotting time &gt;25% above baseline.

      Pharmacokinetic assessment of PER977 and tis metabolite, and edoxaban and its metabolite will
      be performed. Pharmacodynamic assessment of WBCT and Point of Care prothrombin time will be
      performed. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
