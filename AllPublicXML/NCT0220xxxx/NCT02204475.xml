  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-site, open-label trial of a fixed-dose combination of Grazoprevir
      (MK-5172) and Elbasvir (MK-8742) versus Boceprevir (BOC) / Pegylated Interferon (P) and
      Ribavirin (R) in treatment-naive and prior treatment failure genotype (GT) 1 hepatitis C
      virus (HCV)-infected participants. The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of
      treatment-naive (TN) and prior treatment failure (PTF) participants treated with grazoprevir
      + elbasvir achieving sustained virologic response (undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA])
      12 weeks after the end of study therapy (SVR12) will be greater than the proportion of
      BOC/PR-treated participants achieving SVR12.

    <description>All participants begin treatment with a 4-week lead-in of PR followed by 24 weeks of BOC/PR. At Treatment Week (TW) 28 TN participants who have undetectable HCV RNA at TW 8 will complete BOC/PR therapy. At TW 28 TN participants who have detectable HCV RNA at TW 8, as well as prior relapsers and prior partial responders, will continue on BOC/PR for an additional 8 weeks and then continue on PR for an additional 12 weeks. At TW 28 all cirrhotics and previous null responders will continue on BOC/PR for an additional 20 weeks.</description>

          -  Has cirrhosis and liver imaging within 6 months of Day 1 showing evidence of
