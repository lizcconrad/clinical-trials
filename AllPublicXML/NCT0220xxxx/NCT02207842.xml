  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common side effects of a surgical procedure is infection. In order to lower
      the number of infections that occur after surgery, it is important for physicians to know how
      medications used during surgery affect the way the body fights infection. Often, when
      anesthesiologists are helping people go to sleep before surgery they give people medications
      known as &quot;volatile anesthetics&quot;. Volatile anesthetics are medications that can change from a
      liquid or solid to a gas very easily. Some studies suggest that these types of medications
      may change the way white blood cells work in the body. Changing the way white blood cells
      work could possibly increase the person's risk of infection after their surgery or weaken
      their body's ability to fight infections. The goal of this research study is to learn about
      how volatile anesthesia medications change the way white blood cells work in people having
      anesthesia for cardiac procedures. To do this, investigators will examine the function of
      while blood cells in the laboratory based setting.
