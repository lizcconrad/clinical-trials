        with psychotherapy or psychosocial intervention) in the 8 weeks preceding the start of the
        intervention.

        for research purposes, i.e., Meniere's disease, epilepsy, claustrophobia, currently
        pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to conceive or breastfeed during the study, cardiac
        pacemaker, prosthetic heart valve, neurostimulator, implanted pumps, cochlear implants,

        known structural brain lesion).

        xiii. Unable or unwilling to fill in online questionnaires or to be contacted over the
