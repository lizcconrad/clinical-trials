      Gardens and art represent public spaces and support venues of interactions and emotions,
      seeking not only a variety of conversational themes but also various cognitive skills such as
      mnemonic skills. The cognitive and psycho-behavioral effects of art and the garden, jointly
      associated and made available to patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, need to be
      evaluated.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE Delineate the psychological scaffolding virtues of art and garden on cognitive
      and emotional processes by means of interview analyses in Alzheimer patients and control
      subjects based on the &quot; art, memory and life &quot; garden.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Adapt eco-psychosocial approaches of care management to Alzheimer
      patients:

        -  create assessment methods of:

        -  the therapeutic efficacy of the design of the &quot; art, memory and life &quot; garden,

        -  the perception of an artistic dimension in the living environment of those with
           Alzheimer's disease,

        -  establish:

        -  workshop applications using art and the garden for therapeutic purposes,

        -  general recommendations for the layout of the garden. PRIMARY ENDPOINT Quantitative data
           of discursive productions stemming from Interlocutory Logic (Trognon and Batt, 2007,
           2010, 2011) for the analysis of interactive behaviors and the assessment of parameters
           including esthetic appraisals, well-being, mnemonic and emotional processes (frequency
           and nature of these processes) as well as spatio-temporal orientation.

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

        -  Scores obtained in standard neuropsychological tests, in particular to assess
           spatio-temporal orientation (Folstein MMSE),

        -  Scores obtained with the &quot; MemoArtZ &quot; tool (MAZ) to evaluate the memorization of
           artistic elements of the garden,

        -  Scores from the &quot; General Esthetic Preference &quot; (GEP) tool to evaluate the consistency
           of general esthetic appreciations,

        -  Score obtained with the specific mood assessment scale (CSDD) for subjects in group A,

        -  Score obtained with the specific assessment of emotional events scale (AES) for all
           subjects.

      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

      Open, monocentric, controlled (group of healthy control subjects) study.

      Population: 2 groups:

      Group A &quot;Alzheimer group&quot;: patients with mild to severe stages of Alzheimer's disease:
      subgroup A1 &quot;Alzheimer group hospitalized at the Paul Spillmann Centre (Centre Paul
      Spillmann, CPS)&quot; (CHU de Nancy, France); subgroup A2 &quot;Alzheimer group monitored at the
      Resource and Research Memory Centre (Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche, CMRR)&quot;
      (CHU de Nancy, France) Group B &quot;healthy control group&quot;: healthy volunteers

      Therapeutic fallouts of this study will benefit Alzheimer patients in terms of better care
      management, notably: i) by determining the design, conception and layout of the gardens
      destined to these patients, ii) by developing the introduction of an artistic dimension to
      the design of such healing gardens and in their living environment, iii) by establishing
      workshop application perspectives using the contemplation of works of art and the garden for
      therapeutic purposes.

      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY / EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

      Open, monocentric, controlled (group of healthy control subjects) study.

      Population: 2 groups:

      Group A &quot;Alzheimer group&quot;: patients with mild to severe stages of Alzheimer's disease:
      subgroup A1 &quot;Alzheimer group hospitalized at the Paul Spillmann Centre (Centre Paul
      Spillmann, CPS)&quot; (CHU de Nancy, France); subgroup A2 &quot;Alzheimer group monitored at the
      Resource and Research Memory Centre (Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche, CMRR)&quot;
      (CHU de Nancy, France) Group B &quot;healthy control group&quot;: healthy volunteers

      SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES

      TASKS SPECIFIC TO THE STUDY: MATERIALS

      Interview methodology: The interrelationships between garden, art, cognition and behavior
      will be assessed. The endpoints of these dimensions will be achieved by an analysis of
      subject-psychologist interactions via interviews in the garden (in-context) and in
      out-of-context mnemonic interviews. These interviews will be recorded and transcribed
      verbatim. The interest of juxtaposing these two interview situations, in a comparative
      analysis of interactional production, is to be able to access different cognitive skills in
      order to analyze these skills. All of the data will be extracted through the quantitative
      analysis of discursive productions stemming from Interlocutory Logic (Trognon and Batt, 2007,
      2010, 2011). The investigators analyses will consist, on the one hand, of exploring the
      public production of private thoughts of the subject (cognition and emotions) and secondly,
      to modelize interactive behaviors. The interlocutory space will be both referential and
      modal. All in all, the investigators will observe and analyze the eventual discursive
      productions of the subject in reference to the &quot;art, memory and life&quot; garden, whether they
      are related to the subject's experiences in the garden (in-context), to the narrative
      situation in recounting his or her experience in the garden (out-of-context) or to the
      spontaneous use of the garden for subjects in group A1. The implemented approach will have a
      strong ecological perspective.

      Interlocutory logic is an analysis method developed in the INTERPSY laboratory . This
      pragmatic-dialogic method analyzes discourse in situations of interaction. This analytical
      process is aimed at expliciting the basic components of communication, interlocutory
      management and socio-cognitive-discursive events occurring in conversations.

      For subjects in Group A:

      Mood assessment: Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD, Cornell, 1988), translated
      into French.

      For subjects in Group A and in Group B

        -  Assessment of emotional events: Apathy Scale: Marin's Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)

        -  Questionnaire on artistic and cultural activities (ACA) pertaining to all artistic and
           cultural activities that the subject appreciates and/or is engaged in or has engaged in.

        -  Assessment of general esthetic preferences: &quot;General Esthetic Preference&quot; (GEP) tool

        -  Designed along the lines of those used by Kawabata and Zeki and by Halpern et al. for
           their respective studies (Kawabata and Zeki, 2010; Halpern et al., 2008).

        -  Materials: photographs representing works of art - paintings and sculptures - belonging
           to three styles: figurative, stylized or abstract, each representing categories - living
           or non-living.

        -  Task to be performed by the subject: for each photograph presented, the subject's task
           is to express an esthetic judgment using a visual analogue scale. After collecting the
           subject's esthetic judgment, his or her esthetic emotions will be assessed through two
           propositional questions.

        -  Objective: Document the feelings relative to the person's preference for a certain
           artistic style.

      Interview-discovery and interview-knowledge of the garden (in-context) (30 min per
      interview): During the walk-through, the subject, accompanied by the psychologist, will
      observe the entire garden and its artistic elements. The subject will be queried through a
      discussion aimed at promoting the expressing of immediate reactions on the artistic
      dimensions. The analytical approach will enable to assess:

        -  the esthetic preferences of the artistic elements integrated in the garden

        -  the mnemonic and emotional processes (nature and frequency) that are mobilized during
           the contemplation of the elements of the garden, whether vegetation or artistic.

        -  the expressions of well-being and curiosity prompted by the works of art

        -  the mnemonic processes referring to temporality and space

      Out-of-context assessments (90 min per assessment):

        -  Mnemonic interview (about 30 min): in a closed office blinded to the outside, the
           psychologist invites the subject to recall what he or she has experienced in the garden.
           In other words, the subject is asked to narrate an experience outside of its context. In
           this situation, the context must be formalized verbally which leads to the mobilization
           of cognitive skills other than those mobilized in the first in-context situation.

        -  General esthetic preferences (GEP tool): This assessment will reveal the perseverance
           for certain esthetic preferences or, conversely, the detachment relative to certain
           styles or categories addressed prior to the first walk in the garden.

        -  Mnemonic aspects of artistic elements &quot; MémoArtZ &quot; (MAZ) tool:

        -  Task to be performed by the subject: view photographs representing the various works of
           art discovered in the garden, inserted amidst distractive elements.

        -  Instructions: &quot;Show me the photograph that represents an item you saw in the garden&quot;.

        -  Aim: the analysis will enable to objectify potential encoded memory recalls referring to
           the artistic elements of the garden.

        -  The mnemonic processes regarding temporality and space will also be brought to light
           through exchanges initiated by open questions, particularly around the theme of the
           current season of the year. The investigators will observe whether the fact of having
           been in the garden allows the subject to change and readjust his or her eventually
           inadequate response given at the MMSE (context aid).

        -  Mood assessment (CSDD) for subjects in group A only

        -  Assessment of emotional events (AES) for subjects in groups A and B.

    <description>Each interaction between a subject and the psychologist is distributed into a interlocutory analysis table (Trognon and Batt, 2010 ; Batt, Trognon, Rivasseau-Jonveaux, Vernant and Jonveaux, 2014) where each utterance is noticed by its speech turn and its speech act. The second consists of a force (for example, an assertive force, as when I was eight, I loved the garden my parents owned) and a propositional content (for example, a feeling in its episodic context). Propositional content will be described according to its stimulus (for example, a kind of flower growing in the garden, a sculpture put into some place, etc.), to the interaction where it is produced and, more crucially, to the level of memory (procedural/semantics/episodics) it involves. These are the variables that will be then compared in using usual statistics between paired AD and control subjects at visit 1 and 2</description>
