    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well minocycline hydrochloride works in reducing
      chemotherapy induced depression and anxiety in patients with stage I-III breast cancer.
      Minocycline hydrochloride may prevent changes in memory and thinking and improve the quality
      of life of breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate anxiety and depression in women with stages I-III breast cancer during the
      first 8 weeks of doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy randomized to receive either minocycline
      (minocycline hydrochloride) or placebo.

      II. To evaluate markers of neuro-inflammation as assessed by blood based inflammatory
      cytokines and C11-choline positron emission tomography (PET) in women with stages I-III
      breast cancer during the first 8 weeks of doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy randomized to
      receive either minocycline or placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Beginning 1 week prior to chemotherapy, patients receive minocycline hydrochloride
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 9 weeks.

      ARM II: Beginning 1 week prior to chemotherapy, patients receive placebo PO BID for 9 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.

    <description>Scatter plots will be used to explore the pair-wise correlation among the changes of CES-D and STAI scores, blood biomarkers changes, and PET/MRI measures. A statistical model will be used to explore whether the blood based biomarkers and PET/MRI measures can be used to predict the changes in CES-D and STAI scores, which then could be used as potential surrogate markers in future studies.</description>
