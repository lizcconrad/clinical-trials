  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, phase Ib, multicenter clinical trial to determine the MTD/RDE of the
      orally administered c-MET inhibitor INC280 in combination with cetuximab. This combination
      was to be explored in c-MET positive mCRC and HNSCC patients whose disease progressed on
      cetuximab or panitumumab treatment. The dose escalation part was to be guided by a Bayesian
      Logistic Regression Model with overdose control. At MTD/RDE, additional mCRC and HNSCC
      patients who progressed on cetuximab or panitumumab treatment were to be enrolled in two
      expansion groups to further assess the anti-tumor activity and the safety and tolerability of
      the combination of INC280 and cetuximab. Patients were to receive INC280 on a continuous bid
      dosing regimen and cetuximab every week. A treatment cycle was defined as 28 days with no
      scheduled break between cycles.

      The trial was terminated because of difficulties in identifying patients who met the
      eligibility criteria.
