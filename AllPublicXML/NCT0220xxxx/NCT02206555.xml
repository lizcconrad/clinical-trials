  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant increases in HIV diagnoses among gay and other homosexually active men, in
      Australia and internationally, have been observed since the late 1990s. The levels of high
      HIV risk sexual practices among gay men have also increased, particularly unprotected anal
      intercourse (UAI). Nationally, over three quarters of the new HIV infections diagnosed
      annually are among men who have sex with men (MSM). The proportion of heterosexual men and
      women among those diagnosed with HIV annually has also increased in recent years. Despite
      successes in some situations, HIV transmission has not been adequately reduced by the
      prevention methods available to those at risk, such as education, condoms, and treatment of
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

      The effectiveness of daily oral antiretroviral medications (ARVs) as preexposure prophylaxis
      of HIV (PrEP) has now been established by clinical trials in both heterosexual adults and
      homosexual men. Whether PrEP confers high rates of protection in real life situations and is
      a feasible strategy to implement still requires further investigation. Through its &quot;HIV
      prevention strategy 2015: New era,&quot; NSW Health committed to consider how to most
      appropriately and efficiently implement PrEP in line with evidence. This commitment
      translated in the support to this PrEP demonstration project.

      This demonstration project is designed to evaluate the off-label provision of daily
      combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC, known as TRUVADA) as
      PrEP to a sample of sero-negative individuals at high risk for HIV infection in clinical
      settings in New South Wales. The project will inform policy development regarding primary HIV
      prevention with PrEP.

      This is an open-label, single-arm treatment evaluation study. All consenting and eligible HIV
      negative participants will receive TRUVADA prescribed for daily administration orally. At
      each followup visit, the following procedures will be conducted: clinical evaluations/
      procedures, laboratory evaluations/ procedures, testing for HIV, STIs, hepatic and renal
      function, assessment for adherence to the prescribed medication, side effects, eligibility
      for next TRUVADA prescription, and willingness to continue on PrEP.

      As a study requirement, participants will be offered a self-administered assessment of
      behaviour, lifestyle and attitudes which will be conducted ideally within two and no more
      than seven days of the clinic visit in the participant's private space.

      Analyses will include: the feasibility of PrEP delivery, adherence to the study medication,
      safety and tolerability, the effects of PrEP use on behavior, and statistical analyses of the
      risk of HIV seroconversion.

             and weakness)

          -  Concurrently taking a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs / NSAIDs)

          -  Allergic to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine (based on self-report
             or recorded)

          -  Concurrently taking prescribed products containing emtricitabine or tenofovir

          -  Unwilling to adhere to any of the required study procedures

          -  Currently breastfeeding

        Note: Safety for infants exposed to TRUVADA during pregnancy is not fully assessed but no
        harm has been reported. Therefore, planning to become pregnant or currently being pregnant
        is not an exclusion criterion for this study. However, women who are pregnant should learn
        about the risks and benefits of TRUVADA to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV during their
        pregnancy. Site investigators will review the risks and benefits of TRUVADA and of
        potential HIV infection with pregnant women and women who plan to become pregnant.
