  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulation of fat in the neck using tape measures has been linked to increased
      cardiovascular risk. The investigators' hypothesis is that detailed measures of neck fat
      using computed tomography will show that specific fat compartments in the neck contribute
      differently to cardiovascular risk.
