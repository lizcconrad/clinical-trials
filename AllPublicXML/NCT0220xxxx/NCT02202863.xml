  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle modifications, including healthy food intake, exercise, and suppression of tobacco
      smoking, constitute the most powerful tool to fight chronic diseases. Antioxidants and fiber,
      two components of Mediterranean diets, are key functional elements for healthy eating and
      nutrition. We prepared flour from wine grape pomace (WGPF), a rich source of antioxidant and
      fiber, to be used as an ingredient for functional foods and as a dietary supplement to
      increase the intake of dietary fiber and bioactive compounds. WGPF was obtained from red
      grapes (Cabernet Sauvignon variety, Chile). The byproduct of pressing crushed grapes after
      alcoholic fermentation was dried, grounded and stored. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effects of red wine grape pomace flour intake on glycaemia, plasma lipid
      profile, plasma antioxidants (vitamin C and E), oxidative stress and inflammatory markers.

    <textblock>
      A 16-week longitudinal intervention study. Males, 30-65 years of age, with at least one
      component of metabolic syndrome, were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or
      the control group. At lunch, the intervention group was given 20 g of WGPF per day, which
      contained 10 g of dietary fiber and an antioxidant capacity of 7,258 ORAC (oxygen radical
      absorbance capacity) units. Both groups were asked to maintain their regular eating habits
      and lifestyles. Clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements and biochemical blood
      analyses were done at the beginning and the end of the study.

      The intervention was carried out at a heavy mining machinery company in Santiago, Chile. All
      employees were informed about the study and invited to participate. Initially, 47 male
      workers free of exclusion criteria agreed to participate. The number of participants in each
      group was chosen based on the variation coefficients in the evolution of total cholesterol in
      the intervention and in the control group, observed in a previous work (Jiménez, J.P., et
      al., Effects of grape antioxidant dietary fiber in cardiovascular disease risk factors.
      Nutrition, 2008. 24(7-8): 646-53).

      Statistical analysis: Continuous variables will be shown as mean and standard deviation,
      while categorical variables as the number of cases and percentage. The student t-test for
      independent samples and the chi-square test will be used to analyze differences of means and
      proportions between the two groups, respectively. The student t-test for paired samples and
      McNemar's test will be used to analyze differences of means and proportions within each
      group. When appropriate, the Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test will be used to compare paired
      medians. All p values will be two-tailed and a value &lt;0.05 will be considered to be
      statistically significant. Data processing and statistical analyses will be done with the SAS
      statistical software package version 9.1 for Windows.

    <description>The presence of metabolic syndrome components was defined using the criteria proposed by the Adult Treatment Panel III of the US National Cholesterol Education Program: (i) abdominal obesity as waist circumference &gt;102 cm for men; (ii) low levels (&lt;40 mg/dL for men) of serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol; (iii) hypertriglyceridemia as 150 mg/dL or more; (iv) elevated blood pressure as 130/85 mm Hg or higher; and (v) impaired glucose homeostasis as fasting plasma glucose levels of 100 mg/dL or higher</description>

    <description>An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after overnight fasting. Subjects ingested a solution containing 75 g of dextrose, and venous blood samples were obtained at 0 and 120 min to determine plasma glucose and insulin levels.

    <description>Subjects were asked to maintain their regular eating habits and lifestyles for 16 weeks, except for the daily intake of 20 g of WGPF. WGPF was consumed in bread, biscuits or as flour mixed with water during lunch. Bread and biscuits with 20% WGPF were prepared especially in a bakery. WGPF intake was supervised every day at lunch.
