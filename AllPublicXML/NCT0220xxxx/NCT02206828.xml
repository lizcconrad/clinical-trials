      The aim of this Observational Registry Study is to assess the short- and long-term
      clinicaloutcomes following the use of Symbotex™ Composite Mesh in primary and incisional
      abdominal wall hernia surgeries by open or laparoscopic approach, according to the
      Instruction for use (IFU).

    <textblock>
      This is an observational multicenter registry Study. One hundred consecutive, adult patients
      scheduled for primary and incisional abdominalwall hernia surgeries using Symbotex™ Composite
      Mesh will be reported in the ClubHernie online database, with standard data captured of all
      preoperative, perioperative andpost-operative data, for patient's outcomes measurements.

      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate the incidence of peri-operative and post-operative complications, with
      postoperativeevaluations occurring, at discharge , 1 week (D1 and D8 follow up), 1 month(D30
      follow up), 1Year and 2 Year follow up after primary and incisional abdominal wallhernia
      surgeries using Symbotex™ Composite Mesh by open or laparoscopic approach(such as anticipated
      device related complications such as pain, recurrence, complicationsrelated to adhesions,
      wound complications, other postoperative complications, SAE…).

      This online database consists of a systematic and consecutive data entry of all
      patientstreated for Inguinal Hernia and Ventral Hernia by the 30 French surgeon members,
      withstandard data captured of all preoperative, perioperative and post-operative data.

      The database is required to be completed anonymously. Quality data control of all data
      captured into the online database will be performed by coherence analysis by Club Hernie
      authorized representative;A statistical analysis plan will be developed by Covidien.

      Study reported device-related events will be reviewed periodically to assess for any
      potential trends
