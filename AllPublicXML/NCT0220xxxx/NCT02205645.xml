        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject (or guardian, if appropriate) has signed and dated a specific informed

          -  The subject is able to comply with the protocol-defined preoperative procedures, the
             postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluations and the recommended rehabilitation
             regimen as determined by the investigator

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of an MRI or arthroscopically confirmed irreparable medial
             meniscus defect

          -  The meniscal defect should represent 25% or more of the meniscus and be amenable to
             repair

          -  The peripheral meniscal rim must be present

          -  The subject has a functionally intact anterior cruciate ligament

          -  Haemoglobin &gt;9g/dL and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 prior to Day 1

          -  No contraindication to general anaesthetic

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential: a negative urine pregnancy test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a functionally deficient anterior cruciate ligament

          -  The subject has concomitant posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency of the involved
             knee or a concomitant injury that interferes with the subject's ability to comply with
             the recommended rehabilitation program

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of untreatable Grade IV Outerbridge Scale degenerative
             cartilage disease in the involved knee joint

          -  Patients demonstrating an active local or systemic infection

          -  Any condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator would preclude adequate
             evaluation of the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold and clinical outcome.

          -  The subject has a history of confirmed anaphylactoid reaction

          -  The subject has received local administration of any type of corticosteroid or
             systemic administration of antineoplastic, immunostimulating, or immunosuppressive
             agents within 180 days prior to the scheduled surgery

          -  The subject has evidence of osteonecrosis of the involved knee

          -  The subject has a medical history that includes a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid or
             inflammatory arthritis, or relapsing polychondritis

          -  If female and of child-bearing potential: evidence of a positive pregnancy test or a
             stated intention to become pregnant in the next 6-12 months
