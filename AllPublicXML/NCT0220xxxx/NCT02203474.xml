             to commit to using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control, as defined
             below, for the duration of the study:

                  acceptable method of birth control, as defined above, for the duration of the
                  study. At the discretion of the investigator, total abstinence is acceptable in
                  cases where the age, career (eg, priest), lifestyle, and/or sexual orientation of
                  the patient ensures compliance.

             considered clinically significant and will exclude the patient from study
             participation include, but are not limited to, the following:

               -  ventricular rate &lt;45 beats per minute (bpm) or &gt;100 bpm

                  glaucoma)

               -  The patient has symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia.

               -  The patient has a known history or any current evidence of renal impairment or
                  urinary retention (eg, bladder outlet obstruction). This includes abnormal renal
                  function test results at screening.

          9. History of malignancy (excluding treated non-melanoma skin cancers) within the past 5

             • Note: An exacerbation of COPD is defined as any worsening of the patient's baseline
             COPD symptoms requiring any treatment beyond study medication, rescue albuterol or the
             patient's regular maintenance treatment. This includes requiring the use of systemic

             Patients treated on a stable dose of non-selective β-receptor blocking agents for 3
             months prior to SV or longer may be considered for enrollment if expected to maintain
             the same dose throughout the study and (2) Patients on a stable dose of
             cardioselective β1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (eg, atenolol, metaprolol,

             inhaled corticosteroids within the last 30 days prior to the SV, and/or the patient is
             not expected to maintain a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids during the course of
             the study.

         24. For patients using maintenance oral corticosteroids for COPD, the average daily dose
             should not be greater than10 mg of prednisone equivalent per day and the dose should
             have been stable over the 6 weeks prior to the SV. The patient's prior oral
             corticosteroid (OCS) dose should be maintained without change during the study. (Note
             that oral steroid bursts completed 6 weeks or more prior to screening are acceptable.)
