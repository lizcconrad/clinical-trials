    <textblock>
      This study aimed to retrospectively examine patients evaluated by the Code Blue team on a
      Code Blue call in our hospital between 2009 and 2013.

      Primary outcome: an examination of the survival rates and demographic data of the patients
      evaluated as an emergency by a Code Blue call in the period 2009-2013.Secondary outcome: to
      determine the rates of false Code Blue calls, the clinics giving Code Blue calls and the
      relationship between the times of Code Blue calls and mortality.Inclusion criteria: patients
      throughout the whole hospital for whom a Code Blue form was completed and who were evaluated
      by the Code Blue team on a Code Blue call.

      Exclusion criteria: patients who refused treatment

      Retrospective examination was made of the Code Blue notification forms which were completed
      by the anaesthesiologist as Code Blue team leader of the hospital. The age of the patient,
      gender, diagnosis, the department where admitted, time of Blue Code call, reason for Blue
      Code call, whether or not the Blue code call was appropriate, whether or not cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation was administered, if administered, the duration of cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation, whether or not the patient was postoperative, whether or not the patient had
      been discharged from the intensive care unit and if so, how many days had passed, the APACHE
      II score of the patient and expected mortality, were recorded by calculation of the data on
      thhe Code Blue notification form and in the hospital automated system. Patients were excluded
      from the study if they had refused treatment or if there was no record of the parameters
      necessary to calculate the APACHE II score.
