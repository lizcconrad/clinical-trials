    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) ，the fourth leading cause of death in the world,
      represents an important public health challenge. It is also a major cause of chronic
      morbidity, mortality and disability throughout the world, leading to a heavy social and
      economic burden. For a long time, treatment of COPD mainly focus on drug therapy. Recently,
      pulmonary rehabilitation is recognized as a core component of the management of individuals
      with chronic respiratory disease, which has been clearly demonstrated to reduce dyspnea,
      increase exercise capacity, and improve quality of life.

      Exercise training, widely regarded as the cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation , is one of
      the best available means of improving muscle function in COPD.The most commonly form is cycle
      training. Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) as an adjunct to exercise training has an
      additional benefit on inspiratory muscle strength, endurance and exercise capacity in patient
      with COPD.

      There is insufficient evidence demonstrate greater benefits from combined inspiratory muscle
      training and cycle training. This study will evaluate the effects of combined inspiratory
      muscle training and cycle training in patients with COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with COPD will participate in a rehabilitation program for 8 weeks. Participants
      in the proposed study will be randomly programmed into one of three intervention groups:

        1. Cycle training program alone (performing on calibrated stationary cycle ergometer).

        2. Combined cycle training and inspiratory muscle training(performing on calibrated
           stationary cycle ergometer and threshold loading device).

        3. Neither cycle training nor inspiratory muscle training.

    <description>Health-related quality is a component of the broader concept of quality of life and is defined as satisfaction with health.The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ）; and its self-reported version are the most widely used disease-specific questionnaires.</description>

    <description>Currently, a variety of methods can be used to evaluate respiratory muscle function, including maximal inspiratory (PImax)，expiratory pressures(PEmax) and inspiratory muscle endurance.</description>

    <description>Individuals with chronic respiratory disease often have symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, cough, weakness, sleeplessness,and psychological distress.Instruments for assessment of multiple symptoms include COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Modified Medical British Research Council Scale(mMRC).</description>
