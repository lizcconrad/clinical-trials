    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is recommended for preterm infants. Development of breastfeeding is an
      important issue, requiring the involvement of medical and paramedical staff in neonatal
      units. There are few data concerning the fathers of preterm infants. However, the role of the
      father is identified in the literature as a key factor in the initiation and continuation of
      breastfeeding. In our neonatal unit care, reasons for breastfeeding high rates are not
      identified but may be related to the father being in close and constant contact with the
      medical and paramedical staff. In fact, fathers are often first in contact with caregivers.
      They can be invested in the implementation of nursing care, skin to skin, as well as being
      asked to support the development of their child in the service and at home.

      The aims of this study are to:

        -  Analyze the beliefs, social representations and the experience of the fathers of
           premature infants hospitalized in intensive care unit concerning breastfeeding.

        -  Analyze the factors facilitating and inhibiting the initiation and continuation of
           breastfeeding.

        -  Consider strategies of care and support that can be used for the families of premature
           infants and of children born at term.

        -  Explore the expectations of medical staff with regards to the management of children and
           families, their practices, identify the role attributed to the father.

        -  Initiate and facilitate reflexivity of medical and paramedical staff about their
           respective practices

      The study will be conducted in three phases according to the methodology of qualitative
      research:

        -  The first for the preparation of interview guides and observation grids through the
           inclusion of 20 participants: caregivers and members of associations of preterm parents,

        -  The second part: maintenance by the inclusion of 40 fathers of children born preterm
           before 37 weeks and their partner if she wants.

        -  The third part will, as in any qualitative analysis, data validation with the inclusion
           of 20 participants: fathers who experienced this situation in the context of care and
           caregivers close to neonatal intensive unit care (NICU) are participants in the first
           phase.

      interview methods:

        -  1 exploratory interview two hours on average with each part 1 and part 3 participants.

        -  3-5 interviews per part 2 participant. Interviews are conduct with guideline constructed
           during the first part of the study. Interview will be conducted by a nurse and /or a
           psychologist

      Data analysis:

      Full transcript of the interviews. Partial treatment during the study to enrich the interview
      guide until data saturation. All data will be treated differently: Software-aided thematic
      treatment (NVivo) and textual processing with cross medical data and socio-demographic
      variables (Alceste).

      Data Validation :

      Part 3 of the study external validation. Literature validation
