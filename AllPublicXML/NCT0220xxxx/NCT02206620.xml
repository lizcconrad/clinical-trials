  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of placebo and donepezil, a drug that helps conserve
      concentrations of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine on measures of balance and gait in
      subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study is a double-blind, placebo controlled,
      cross-over randomized clinical trial. Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a
      physiological index of cholinergic function will be measured to determine if the deficits in
      balance and gait correlate with abnormalities of the SAI and if SAI is altered by donepezil
      as a measure of drug efficacy. Cognitive tests like the attention network test will be
      administered to determine if changes in gait and balance are mediated by changes in
      attention.

      The results of this study will be the most direct test of the hypothesized role of
      cholinergic neurons and the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine in terms of gait and balance. The
      study is exploratory because it is not known whether donepezil will affect gait, balance or
      attention, nor which measures of gait, balance or attention will be sensitive to drug
      manipulation. The study's immediate goal is to determine the potential utility of cholinergic
      manipulation as a strategy for preventing or treating balance and gait dysfunction in PD. The
      findings of this trial are intended to lead to more sharply focused questions about the role
      of cholinergic neurons in balance and gait and eventually to Phase II B trials to determine
      clinical utility of cholinergic manipulation to prevent falls and improve mobility.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine the effects of a cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, on postural standing sway with and without a dual cognitive task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to four years</time_frame>
    <description>Increased body sway while standing and enhancement of the sway by dual tasking are markers for increased risk of falling in Parkinson's disease. Sway will be measured with an inertial sensor attached to the waist.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Variability of step length while walking and its increase with dual tasking</measure>
    <time_frame>Four years</time_frame>
    <description>Variability in step length and an increase with dual tasking is another marker for increased fall risk in Parkinson' disease. This step length or duration ariability will be measured with inertial sensors attached to both feet.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine the effects of a cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, on physiological markers of mobility associated with falls in PD (postural sway in stance and gait variability).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to four years</time_frame>
    <description>The second marker: increased gait variability and augmentation with dual-tasking.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-latency afferent inhibition is a marker of cortical cholinergic activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Four years</time_frame>
    <description>Short-latency afferent inhibition by a peripheral stimulation is a transcranial magnetic stimulation method to evaluate cortical cholinergic activity. Short-latency afferent Inhibition will be used to determine if our subjects with Parkinson's disease have evidence of reduced cholinergic tone which correlates with their measures of postural and gait instability. Also changes in short-latency afferent inhibition with donepezil will be a measure of pharmacological efficacy of donepezil.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention Network Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Four years</time_frame>
    <description>Attention Network Test (ANT) is 15 minute computerized test or reaction times with various cues and targets designed to assess alerting, orienting and executive control of attention. Deficits of attention are related to fall risk and may be affected by donepezil.</description>
