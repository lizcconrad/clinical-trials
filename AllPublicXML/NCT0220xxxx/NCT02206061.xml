    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the widespread implementation of a developmentally
      appropriate preventive asthma care intervention for urban teens. The School Based Asthma Care
      for Teens (SB-ACT) program includes two core components: 1) a trial of directly observed
      therapy (DOT) to allow the teen to experience the potential benefits from adhering to
      guideline-based asthma treatment, and 2) a developmentally appropriate Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) Counseling Intervention to help the teen transition to independent
      long-term medication adherence. The investigators hypothesize that teens receiving the SB-ACT
      program will 1) experience less asthma-related morbidity than an asthma education (AE)
      attention-control comparison group, and 2) have improved adherence, less urgent healthcare
      use, less absenteeism, improved quality of life, and reduced FeNO compared to AE. The
      investigators also hypothesize that participants receiving DOT-only will have improved
      asthma-related outcomes immediately following their DOT trial vs. teens receiving AE, but
      will not have sustained, clinically significant improvement in outcomes once the DOT phase is
      complete. This represents a unique opportunity to build upon existing community relationships
      with an innovative and developmentally focused program to improve asthma outcomes for urban
      teens.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is asthma morbidity between groups. The investigators will measure asthma morbidity by looking at the average number of days without asthma symptoms (symptom free days) over 2 weeks, during the post-intervention follow-up assessments (up to 12 months post baseline). Symptom free days are defined as 24 hour periods of no asthma symptoms including, coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest or shortness of breath.</description>

    <description>SB-ACT consists of 2 components: Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) For the first 6-8 weeks, the teen will visit the school nurse to receive a daily dose of preventive asthma medication as directly observed therapy (DOT). The purpose of DOT is to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience potential benefits of consistent preventive therapy.
The second component, Motivational Interviewing (MI) counseling , will start 4-6 weeks after the start of DOT. A counselor will conduct 3 in-person MI sessions with the teen at school to enhance the teen's motivation to adhere to their asthma treatment plan. The 3 sessions consist of an initial 40 minute counseling session (4-6 weeks after start of DOT), and two 30 minute follow-up sessions 2 and 6 weeks later. This component consists of an evidence-based self-management program to help the teen begin to transition to independence with preventive medication use.</description>

    <description>Asthma educators will provide an in-school asthma education program that will match the time and attention of the MI counseling portion of the primary intervention. Each teen will receive three 1-on-1 educational sessions at school, and sessions will cover 3 main topics: 1) lung physiology and asthma basics, 2) triggers, symptoms, and warning signs, and 3) medications and self-advocacy.</description>
