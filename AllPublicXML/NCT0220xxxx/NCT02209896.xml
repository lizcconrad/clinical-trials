    <textblock>
      The BlueWind Reprieve system is a neurostimulator consisting of an Implant and external
      components.

      The system is intended for home care use. The chronic pain treatment is achieved by an
      electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers. The stimulation is set so that it
      generates paresthesia in the stimulated area (e.g. foot), reducing the pain sensation and
      improving the quality of life for the patient.
