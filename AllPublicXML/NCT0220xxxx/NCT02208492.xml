    <textblock>
      Unlike the first generation antiepileptic medications, newer drugs for epilepsy such as
      levetiracetam are reported to have less adverse effect in children but not many studies have
      systematically reviewed the subject. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the effect of
      levetiracetam on neurocognition, behavioral issues and quality of life, as well as its
      seizure control efficacy and other adverse events in pediatric epilepsy patients, in
      comparison to carbamazepine, one of the classic antiepileptic medication, widely prescribed
      for both partial and generalized seizures, despite its well known side effects.

      This multicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial is expected to enroll 130 patients from
      age 4 to 16 woh will be randomized into two groups, which will be prescribed with
      levetiracetam or carbamazepine. Series of neuropsychological assessment and behavioral and
      life evaluations of the patients will be performed at baseline period and after the 52 weeks
      of study period.

    <description>Levetiracetam is a second-generation antiepileptic drug that has been approved for the treatment of epilepsy in both children and adults. This anticonvulsant works by binding to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A resulting in a possible effect on neurotransmitter release from presynaptic vesicles, while the exact mechanism of action is still unclear. In both adults and children, levetiracetam treatment in has a proven efficacy in both localization-related and generalized epilepsies. In contrast to first generation, levetiracetam reports less side effects of somnolence or lethargy, but behavioral adverse events, such as changed mood state, aggression, and irritability are noted, but only a few studies have reported such effects in a systemic fashion.</description>

    <description>Carbamazepine, a first-generation antiepileptic medication, stabilizes the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, making fewer of these channels available to subsequently open, which leaves the affected cells less excitable and less seizure prone. It is approved for both focal seizures and generalized tonic-clonic or combined seizures for adults and children.</description>

          2. Patients with level of SGOT/SPGT above the doubled normal level or BUN/Creatinine
             above the 3 times of the normal range

          3. Patients who had used other anti-epileptic medication during any period of the trial,
             including baseline period. (Benzodiazepine used as rescue therapy is acceptable)
