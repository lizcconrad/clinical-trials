  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For previous clinical trials, R-flurbiprofen has been prepared in tablet form. In this study
      R-flurbiprofen, will be available as gelatine capsules.

      This study aims to show the bioavailability of R-flurbiprofen when administered in gelatine
      capsules. The serum availability will be determined by analysis of pharmakokinetic (pK)-blood
      samples at different time points. To assess the safety of the administered capsules adverse
      events will be documented.

      Analysis of lipid signaling molecules in plasma will be done to assess the role of this
      molecules as variable for therapeutic effects.
