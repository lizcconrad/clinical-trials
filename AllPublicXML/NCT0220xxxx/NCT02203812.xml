  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The oral cavity is mostly influenced by general health. The oral microbiota which is as
      complex as the gastro-intestinal or vaginal microbiota are considered to be difficult
      therapeutic targets. The effects of probiotics in different fields of health care have
      resulted recently in the introduction of probiotics for oral healthcare. Probiotics have been
      clinically proved effective in different fields of oral healthcare such as halitosis, oral
      candidiasis and tooth decay. They have also been inducted in the field of periodontal
      healthcare because of the current views on the etiology of plaque- related periodontal
      inflammation.
