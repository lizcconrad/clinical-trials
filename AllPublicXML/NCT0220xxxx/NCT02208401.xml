  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different modalities are employed to remove small colonic polyps which potentially harbour a
      cancer risk. But, they can all vary in their completeness of removal, safety and the
      histological quality and the gold standard technique has yet to be defined. A novel suction
      pseudopolyp technique has been described by Patullo et al and in their prospective study, 126
      polyps measuring less than 10mm flat or sessile were removed by this method with 100%
      complete endoscopic resection and without any immediate or delayed complications. The aim of
      the investigators study is to compare this technique with the standard cold snare technique.
      Patients attending for a routine colonoscopy and found to have polyps measuring 37mm in size
      will be eligible and they will be randomised to the polypectomy technique. Patient
      demographics and polyp characteristics will be recorded. The primary outcome measured will be
      the macroscopic resection rate. The secondary outcome measures are abdominal pain,
      tenderness, bleeding and fever.

    <description>The primary outcome for this study is the polypectomy completion rate. This will be assessed both macroscopically and histologically. The analysis for statistical difference between the 2 techniques and abdominal symptoms will be compared by the Chi2 test for categorical data.</description>
