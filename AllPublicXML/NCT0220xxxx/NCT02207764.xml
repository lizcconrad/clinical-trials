  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test whether a complementary intervention, Reiki therapy, can
      provide added benefits to the standard patient care. Reiki is method for stress reduction
      that uses hand positions over and/or on the body to help people relax.

      We are studying the effect of a 15-minute Reiki application compared to an intervention of
      nursing presence without Reiki. We hope to find if Reiki can assist in relieving stress, and
      improving patient outcomes. In the future we would like to offer complementary interventions
      as an adjunct to our standard care for patients.

      This pilot study is designed to test if a complementary therapy, Reiki, has an effect on
      physiological and subjective measures of stress. This is a 2-arm randomized pilot study of
      the use of Reiki therapy prior to a stressful event with a convenience sample of 40
      participants who are newly diagnosed hematologic malignancy patients on the inpatient service
      who will experience bone marrow aspirate post induction chemotherapy. Reiki therapy is a
      non-invasive complementary therapy that can be used in addition to the standard of care. The
      intervention group will receive a 15-minute Reiki session and the control group will receive
      15 minutes of nursing presence. Each study arm includes a brief item questionnaire to rank
      subjective measures of pain, anxiety, and energy; saliva biological markers related to
      stress-reduction; and measures of blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations. The
      intervention group will receive a 15-minute intervention performed on the inpatient unit
      prior to the bone marrow aspirate procedure. Data will be collected from patients both before
      and after the intervention and before and after the bone marrow aspirate. We will collect
      saliva samples from the control group and baseline data including subjective measures of
      pain, anxiety and energy and measures of blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations. The
      study nurse will maintain presence in the control participant's room for 15-minutes after the
      initial measures.

      Our research hypothesis is that there will be a change in the response to one or more
      parameters of physiological or subjective measures for those patients receiving a Reiki
      intervention when compared to those receiving standard of care plus the nurse presence in
      room.

      The null hypothesis is there will be no difference in response between the groups.
