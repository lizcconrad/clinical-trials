    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to obtain information about the safety and tolerability of BIIF
      1149 BS45 (single dose: 40, 65, 100 mg), to determine the pharmacologically active dose
      (range) by performing a citric acid challenge test and to obtain preliminary pharmacokinetic
      data.

             from normal clinical values

          -  Volunteers with known gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,
             metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders

             during the week prior to the start of the study

          -  Volunteers who have participated in another study with an investigational drug within
             the last 2 months preceding this study

          -  Volunteers who smoke more than 10 cigarettes (or equivalent) per day

          -  Volunteers who are not able to refrain from smoking on study days
