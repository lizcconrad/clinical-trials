      The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of lymphocyte subsets in chemotherapy
      course of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer who received first chemotherapy in Beijing
      Chaoyang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University were collected, and the percentage
      of lymphocyte subsets at 9 time points before, during, and after chemotherapy was detected by
      flow cytometry method.We will investigate the changes of patients' lymphocyte subsets in
      chemotherapy courses. The correlation of the percentage of lymphocyte subsets and age,
      gender, pathological type, clinical stage, surgery or not, clinical efficacy assessment will
      be further analyzed.
