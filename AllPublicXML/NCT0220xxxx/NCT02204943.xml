  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine biomarkers involved in osteomimicry in bone metastases and
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of men with mCRPC before and during therapy with the
      bone-targeting radiopharmaceutical radium-223. This study will also examine the
      bio-distribution of radium-223 in bone and bone metastases of men with mCRPC.

      The investigators hypothesize that bone metastases and CTCs in men with mCRPC will commonly
      express markers of EMT/plasticity and osteomimicry, not just in the normal surrounding
      osteoblastic stroma but in the epithelial tumor cells themselves and that radium-223 will
      target both of these compartments including the more mesenchymal/osteoblastic tumor cells and
      the surrounding osteoblasts in the active bone microenvironment, with a relative sparing of
      normal bone and bone marrow.

             consent form. A signed informed consent form must be appropriately obtained prior to
             the conduct of any trial-specific procedure.

          4. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Histologic
             variants of prostate cancer, including neuroendocrine features are permitted; however,
             pure small cell carcinoma of the prostate is excluded.

          5. Presence of &gt;2 sites of metastatic disease in bone as determined by bone scan or CT,
             and for men who opt-in for bone biopsy, they must have at least one site amenable to
             radiographically-guided metastatic biopsy as determined by the study radiologist.

          6. Symptomatic castration-resistant bone metastatic disease as determined by the
             provider.

          7. Prior or concurrent therapy with either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.

          8. Ongoing ADT using an LHRH agonist (e.g. leuprolide, goserelin) or antagonist (e.g.
             degarelix) must continue on therapy unless prior bilateral orchiectomy has been
             performed.

               1. 2 consecutive rising PSA levels separated at least 1 week apart above nadir PSA
                  on last systemic therapy. If no nadir, then 2 rising PSA values greater than
                  baseline pretreatment value is required from the most immediate prior therapy, OR

               2. CT or bone scan based evidence of disease progression with bone metastasis (new
                  lesions or growth of existing lesions), OR

               3. Evidence of symptomatic progression (increased pain in an area with known lesions
                  confirmed on imaging).
