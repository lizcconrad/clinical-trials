    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at the use of a series of questionnaires
      evaluating risk for falls in order to collect information that might be used to develop a
      larger study aiming to recognize who is more at risk for falls and how to best intervene to
      prevent falls in older adults with cancer.

    <measure>Percent completion of the Fall Risk Questionnaire (FRQ) and the Cancer and Aging Research Group Geriatric Assessment (CARG GA) of enrolled patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The percent of patients who complete the assessment will be calculated. Successful completion will be defined as the completion of all items on the questionnaires. If more than 85% of subjects are able to complete the FRQ and CARG GA, the assessment will be deemed feasible.</description>

    <description>We will calculate the frequency of participant feedback that 1) certain questions that were difficult to understand 2) the questionnaire was too short or too long 3) questions were upsetting or 4) the questionnaire left out important questions to ask. Open-ended follow-up questions in which the participants will be given the opportunity to write out their responses will be examined qualitatively for recurring themes of particular questions that were unsatisfactory</description>

    <description>Participants will complete an assessment consisting of the Falls Risk Questionnaire, a primarily self-administered geriatric assessment (GA) developed by the Cancer and Aging Research Group, a quality of life scale (FACT GOG/NTX) and the Falls Efficacy Scale-International.
Each questionnaire contains approximately 150 questions and will take between 30 minutes and one hour to complete.</description>
