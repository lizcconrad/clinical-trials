      Using collagenase to isolate limbal stem cells and improve the technique of ex vivo expansion
      of limbal stem cells for the treatment of patients suffering from unilateral limbal stem cell
      insufficiency based on the concept of &quot;limbal stem cells need special cell-cell contact and
      cell-extracellular matrix interaction to support their survival&quot;.

      Patients suffering from unilateral limbal stem cell insufficiency and understand the benefits
      and risk factors of the operation will be enrolled in this clinical trial. Two weeks before
      transplantation, the investigators first take 1-2 mm2 of limbal tissues from the healthy eye,
      digest the tissue with collagenase, and get an epithelial cell cluster. The cell cluster will
      be cultured on amniotic membrane with SHEM medium which contains Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
      medium/F12 (1:1), 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 5μg/ml
      insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 nM cholera toxin, 50μg/ml gentamicin, 1.25μg/ml
      amphotericin B. Seven to ten days later after successful culture, transplantation will be
      performed after the cells reaches 1.5-2 cm2 compact confluent epithelial sheets without
      evidence of contamination. During the operation, lamellar keratectomy will be performed to
      remove the abnormal corneal neovascularization and scar tissue. The cultivated epithelial
      sheets will be transplanted to denuded corneal surface with fibrin glue and suture technique.
      The patients are planed to be admitted for 2 weeks. After discharge, follow up of the
      patients will be performed on one week, two week, one month, two months, three months, six
      months and one year later. Pictures of external eyes will be taken and the extent of corneal
      epithelium regeneration, visual acuity, and complications will be recorded during follow-up
      visits. The investigators plan to collect 10 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: between 18-70 years old.

          2. Lesion eye should have limbal insufficiency more than 180 degrees.

          3. Lesion eye should have recurrent corneal erosions, corneal neovascularisation and poor
             vision caused by limbal insufficiency.

          4. The symptoms should be more than 1/2 year, and have no possibility of improvement by
             medical treatment.

          5. The patients will to received the operation and the long term post- operative
             follow-up.

          6. The patients are not infected by AIDS, hepatitis B/C , and willing to received the
             associated examinations.

          7. The patients does not plan to be pregnant from the day of cell culture and
             transplantation for 1 year. They also agree to receive the pregnant test.

          8. The condition of cell culture from the 1st to the clinical trial is successful.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Bilateral limbal insufficiency.

          2. No recurrent corneal erosion, corneal neovascularisation or poor vision was found due
             to limbal insufficiency. If corneal neovascularisation was found deeper than the
             anterior 1/2 of corneal stroma, or corneal thickness was less than 200 um evaluated by
             anterior segment OCT and ultrasound pachymetry, the patients should be excluded from

          3. About corneal sedation, if the value checked by Cocet-Bonnet esthesiometer is less

          5. Post-operative follow up is less than 1/2 year

          6. The patient can't receive long term postoperative follow up

          8. If the intraocular pressure was more than 21 mmHg under necessary glaucoma surgery and
             anti-glaucoma medication, or optic disc cupping was more than 90%, or visual field was
             found to have severe defects, the patients were excluded from the clinical trial.
