      This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo- (inactive
      substance identical in appearance to study drug) and active-comparator-controlled (use of an
      approved drug to compare with study drug) study of guselkumab in participants with moderate
      to severe plaque-type psoriasis (scaly skin rash). The active comparator study drug is
      adalimumab, an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
      Participants who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in a
      2:1:2 ratio to one of three treatment groups (arms): Group I (guselkumab 100 mg dose
      regimen), Group II (placebo then crossover to guselkumab at Week 16), or Group III
      (adalimumab at standard psoriasis dosing). All participants will receive guselkumab every 8
      weeks (q8w) from Week 52 through Week 252 (open label treatment period).The end of the study
      is defined as the time the last participant completes the Week 264 visit. Participants will
      primarily be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 or 1 and
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 16. The total duration of the
      study will be approximately 268 weeks (includes a 4-week screening period). Participants will
      be monitored for safety throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants. This secondary outcome measure was planned to include only the placebo and guselkumab arms.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The ss-IGA instrument is used to evaluate the disease severity of scalp psoriasis. The lesions were assessed in terms of the clinical signs of redness, thickness, and scaliness, which are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 = absence of disease, 1 = very mild disease, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, and 4 = severe disease.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSD (24-hour version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items (&gt;=50 percentage of 5 items) on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score = average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100= most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease. This secondary outcome measure was planned to include only the placebo and guselkumab arms.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Adalimumab Group at Week 24 and 48</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants. This secondary outcome measure was planned to include only the placebo and guselkumab arms.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Adalimumab Group at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD) Symptom Score at Week 16 in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group</title>
        <description>The PSSD (24-hour version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items (&gt;=50 percentage of 5 items) on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score = average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100= most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease. This secondary outcome measure was planned to include only the placebo and guselkumab arms.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD) Symptom Score at Week 16 in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group</title>
          <description>The PSSD (24-hour version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items (&gt;=50 percentage of 5 items) on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score = average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100= most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease. This secondary outcome measure was planned to include only the placebo and guselkumab arms.</description>
          <population>PSSD analysis set included all those participants who had baseline PSSD scores as the average score of at least 4 days out of the 7 days prior to the Week 0 visit.</population>
