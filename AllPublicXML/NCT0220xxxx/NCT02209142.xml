  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting nearly 16% of the general
      population. Its physiopathology remains unclear. Based on gene-environment studies and
      epigenetic studies, a main hypothesis proposed that the major depressive episode (MDE)
      results from the convergence of multiple factors including biological factors such as
      multi-genic vulnerability, hormonal and immunological variations as well as environmental
      factors. As a consequence, mRNA could define a biological signature of the MDE.
