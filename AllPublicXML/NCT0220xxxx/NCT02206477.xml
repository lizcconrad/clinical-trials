  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsular contraction is the one of the most common complications of both esthetic and
      reconstructive breast surgery, with high incidence after radiotherapy. The mechanism of the
      contraction is unclear, but is believed to be similar to the formation of hypertrophic
      scarring.

      Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has demonstrated its use as an anti-inflammatory,
      anti-proliferative, and antibacterial agent.

      The aim of this study is to test the effect of DMSO on the incidence and severity if capsular
      contracture after breast alloplastic reconstruction in irradiated patients.

      We conduct a prospective randomized-control single-surgeon study in the tertiary academic
      Rabin Medical Center.

      110 female candidates for mastectomy, radiotherapy and immediate two-stage reconstruction
      will be included. They will be divided into two groups: the DMSO treatment group, which will
      be treated according to our protocol, and the control group, that will be treated with the
      same protocol but with 0.9% saline instead.

      Several measures will be taken, including: capsular contracture grading by two plastic
      surgeons, a VAS-score of breast pain, maximal capsular thickness (MCT) in sonography
      evaluation, and pathology examination of the capsule (biopsy will be taken during the second
      stage operation).

      Rates and grades of capsular contracture evident clinically, radiologically and
      pathologically, will be evaluated and compared.

    <description>The treatment group will be exposed to DMSO according to our built protocol. On the seventh post-operative day, the patient will be guided to set 10 cc of DMSO soaked gauze compresses on the breast, twice a day for 20 minutes, for the term of 6 weeks. This treatment will be holed for 24 hours on tissue expander inflation dates. A repeated course of compresses will be taken after adjuvant radiotherapy, starting 24 hours after the last therapy.</description>
