    <textblock>
      The investigators clinical trials will be for a medical device that is non-invasive in
      nature. The investigators will be studying whether their non-invasive medical device gets
      data that is as good as, or better than, an FDA previously approved, blood analysis device.
      There is no study hypothesis for this study.
