  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess whether early integration of palliative and
      supportive care services in care of patients hospitalized for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) can improve patients' and family caregivers' quality of life and mood.

      This research study is evaluating the impact of early involvement of supportive care team
      working with the transplant oncology team will have on the quality of life, symptoms, and
      mood of patients undergoing stem cell transplantation.

      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether introducing patients and families
      undergoing stem cell transplantation to the palliative care team that specializes in symptom
      management can improve the physical and psychological symptoms that patients and families
      experience during hospitalization for stem cell transplantation.

      The study will use a series of questionnaires to measure participant's and their caregivers'
      quality of life, physical symptoms, and mood. Study questionnaires will be completed in the
      hospital or clinic with assistance provided as needed
