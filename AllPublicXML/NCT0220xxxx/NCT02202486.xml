      Substudy 1 Blood-brain barrier breakdown has been proposed in migraine patients. Our
      hypothesis that we will test in this study is that the blood-brain barrier breaks down during
      migraine attacks but not out side attacks using MRI.

      Substudy 2 Altered cerebral resting-state functional connectivity networks have been reported
      in migraine patients outside migraine attacks. What happens during migraine attacks has never
      been investigated. The hypothesis we will test is that pain related networks are affected
      during spontaneous attacks using functional MRI.

      Substudy 3 Old studies report that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is altered in patients with
      migraine with aura, but not in those without aura. We hypothesize that CBF is altered
      regionally during attacks, which we will investigate in this study using arterial spin
      labeling (ASL).

      Substudy 4 Structural changes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of the brain have been
      suggested but never investigated during migraine attacks. Our hypothesis is that pain related
      structures show altered VBM during spontaneous migraine attacks.

      Brain MRI during and outside migraine attacks.

      Up to 600 patients will be recruited, who will be given a phone number that they can call
      when they get migraine attacks.

      The study will continue until 20 patients with migraine with aura, 20 patients without aura,
      20 patients with chronic migraine have completed the study.
