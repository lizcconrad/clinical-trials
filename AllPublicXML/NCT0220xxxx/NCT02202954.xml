  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the situation of motor limitations that people often experience after stroke, current
      health systems cannot provide for the daily amount and duration of high intensity muscle
      stretch and motor training that would be required over protracted periods to involve muscle
      and brain plasticity. For patients with sufficient cognitive abilities, Guided
      Self-rehabilitation Contracts allow implementing stretch and training at high intensity and
      may result in meaningful functional improvement in chronic stages, as long as discipline
      persists over at least a year span.

      This single blind control protocol will evaluate Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts as
      against conventional therapy in the community, for a one year duration in persons with
      chronic hemiparesis after stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single blind controlled multicentre protocol will compare the evolution after a one-year
      treatment, either using a Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract or conventional therapy in the
      community. Patients with chronic stroke-induced hemiparesis (over a year post stroke) will be
      selected to be randomized between the two groups, Conventional or in Guided
      Self-rehabilitation Contracts.

      In Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts, the therapist acts as a coach, in the sports' sense,
      providing double guidance:

        -  Technical, selecting and teaching the required exercises to the patient using infrequent
           thorough visits, for example every month.

        -  Psychological, binding with the patient on the contract.

      The patient agrees to:

        -  Perform the prescribed daily stretch postures and rapid alternating movements over the
           long term.

        -  Document this work in a written diary.

      To facilitate such contracts, a manual for guided self-rehabilitation in spastic paresis has
      been developed and will be provided to patients randomized to that group.

      124 patients will be enrolled from 6 centers in France: Creteil, Paris Fernand-Widal,
      Toulouse, Reims, Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux. The duration of patient participation will be 2
      years: 6 months follow-up, 1 year intervention and another 6-month follow-up after the study
      intervention. Only functional assessments will be used, using in particular ambulation speed
      for the lower limb and the Modified FRENCHAY Scale for the upper limb.
