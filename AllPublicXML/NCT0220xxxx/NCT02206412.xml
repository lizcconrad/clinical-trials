    <textblock>
      High mobility group 1 (HMGB1) protein is both a nuclear factor and a secreted protein, and
      has recently been identified as a cytokine mediator of systemic inflammation. HMGB1 is
      released by inflammatory cells actively, or increased during cell death passively and
      mediates inflammatory response. It has been reported to have association with the prognosis
      after acute coronary syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury of myocardium, atherosclerosis and
      heart failure. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of serum levels of HMGB1 and
      post operative prognosis of patients who had undergone off-pump coronary artery bypass graft.

    <description>Measure the maximum value of HMGB1 in all patients and calculate median value. And device into upper median value group and under median value group and compare frequency of composite morbidity/mortality rate between two groups. composite morbidity/mortality is as follows:
renal impairment
mediastinal or sternal infection
Stroke
re operation
ventilator care for more than 48hrs
Myocardial infarction
death within 30 days after operation</description>
