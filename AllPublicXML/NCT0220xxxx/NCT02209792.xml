  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this extension study was to obtain long-term safety data for BIRB
      796 BS in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease after 26 weeks of treatment.
      Secondary objectives were the evaluation of efficacy of BIRB 796 BS to induce clinical
      remission and response over 26 weeks of treatment.
