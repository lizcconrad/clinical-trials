  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the trial is to compare the influence of MICARDIS® (telmisartan 40-80 mg)
      and COZAAR® (losartan 50-100 mg) in lowering ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during
      the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval as measured by ABPM after 8-weeks treatment.
      Secondary objectives include evaluations of: 1) change from baseline in mean systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval as measured by ABPM, 2)
      changes from baseline in SBP and DBP during other periods during the 24-hour ABPM profile, 3)
      changes from baseline in mean seated trough SBP and DBP as measured by manual cuff
      sphygmomanometer, and 4) responder rates based on both ABPM and trough cuff blood pressure
