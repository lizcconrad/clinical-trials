  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how behaviors and the effects of the body's
      internal clock (called the circadian pacemaker) affect the control of the heart and blood
      pressure.

      People with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) are hypothesized to have altered circadian
      amplitudes in certain key indices of cardiovascular (CV) and an abnormally advanced circadian
      phase in some of the same key indices of CV risk. The investigators hypothesize that such
      changes, taken together, may explain the different timing of heart attack and sudden cardiac
      death in OSA.

    <measure>Secondary dependent variable: Circadian rhythm phase of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) reactivity to exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Comparisons will be made between participants with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and healthy controls of the circadian amplitude of change in plasma MDA concentration from resting baseline to end of 15 minute of steady-state bicycle exercise. Circadian rhythm amplitude of reactivity will be assessed by cosinor analysis of all changes induced by exercise obtained throughout the protocol assessed under constant conditions but at varied circadian phases.</description>
