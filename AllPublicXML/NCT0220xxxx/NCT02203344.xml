  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that prolonged deep sedation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes
      in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The revised guidelines for management of pain,
      agitation and delirium by the Society of Critical Care Medicine in 2013 also recommended that
      adult ICU patients should be maintained at a light level of sedation. The key point in light
      sedation strategy is the assessment of depth of sedation. At present, sedation is monitored
      mainly by the subjective clinical score systems, such as the Ramsay Scale, the Riker's
      Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). However, the
      subjective and intermittent nature of these scales instruments has limited their application
      in light sedation algorithm. Consequently, objective and continuous measurement of the level
      of sedation would be more desirable in clinical practice. In recent years, objective measures
      of brain function have been of great interests in the evaluation of sedation level, and
      bispectral index (BIS) has been the most investigated instrument.

      Several studies compared BIS with subjective sedation scales in adult ICU patients, and
      yielded conflicting results. The different approaches to select BIS value may be the most
      important reason for these inconsistent agreements between BIS and subjective sedation
      scales. A formal scheme of subjective assessment of the depth of sedation and level of
      consciousness should incorporate exerting verbal and physical stimuli and observation of the
      patient's subsequent responses. Our primary aim is to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of BIS
      in detecting early deep sedation against the reference standard of subjective scale
      instrument. We hypothesize that BIS monitoring will provide accurate, subjective and
      continuous evaluation of deepen sedation.
