      To evaluate the effect of the consumption of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 on mastitis
      incidence.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that L. fermentum CECT5716, a probiotic strain previously
      isolated from breast milk, can be used as an effective treatment of mastitis and painful
      breastfeeding by reducing pathogen counts in breast milk. This is a randomized double blinded
      controlled study to evaluate the effect of L.fermentum CECT5716 on mastitis incidence and
      Staphylococcus load in breast milk. Women will be recruited 1-6 days after child birth and
      distributed into two groups: Probiotic group receiving 1 capsule/day containing L.fermentum
      3x109cfu; Control group receiving 1 placebo capsule/day containing maltodextrin. The
      intervention period is 16 weeks.
