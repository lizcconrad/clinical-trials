  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trans-Radial Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (TR-PCI) is rapidly becoming the gold
      standard. This is especially the case in primary Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI),
      where most benefits of the radial approach, such as reduced major bleeding and mortality, can
      be expected. However there is very limited research available looking at the consequences of
      trans-radial access for upper extremity function.

      The main objective of this study is to provide insight in the morbidity with regards to the
      upper extremity surrounding the radial access route in percutaneous coronary interventions.
      Secondary objectives are to provide insight in the consequences for functional status,
      factors influencing and financial costs of this morbidity, to identify subject who might
      benefit from early referral and treatment of this morbidity and to generate hypotheses for
      further clinical research into this matter.

      The investigators hypothesis is that approximately 20% of the population will experience
      upper extremity dysfunction after TR-PCI.
