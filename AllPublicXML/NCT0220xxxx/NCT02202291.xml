  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vasospasm is a transient contraction causing a decrease in caliber of a vessel and thus a
      decrease in vascularization in a vascular territory leading to suffering of tissue in the
      sector concerned. Vasospasm-related diseases have different clinical presentations such as
      migraine, spastic angina, hypertension related to vasospasm or primary Raynaud's phenomenon
      (RP). These diseases have few therapeutic methods due to poorly understood pathophysiology.
      For migraine and angina, the vascular exploration is problematic unlike for primary Raynaud's
      phenomenon (RP).

      Primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common peripheral vascular disease to cold with an
      estimated prevalence between 5-9 % of the general population. It is the expression of an
      extreme vasospasm microcirculation of the extremities linked to hypersensitivity to cold and
      that is clinically expressed by the occurrence of syncope stages where the fingers are
      anesthetized and white, followed by a stage with hyperemic restaining .

      The objective of our study is to identify new metabolic pathways involved in vasospasm in
      order to consider new specific treatments, currently lacking.

      The identification of these pathways will be made by the detection of genetic abnormalities
      causing vasospasm in Raynaud's phenomenon. This disease is a perfectly appropriate model to
      study vasospasm by its high frequency in the population, its hereditary nature and simple
      diagnosis. The powerful current genetic strategies will be applied to this model (exome
      sequencing combined to family connection analysis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary Raynaud phenomenon will be identified during a consultation of vascular
      medicine and internal medicine in one of the centers participating to the study. Those
      patients with a primary PR will be considered as Index cases.

      In all participating centers, there will be a recruitment of index cases without family
      screening to form a series of cases that will validate the results obtained in family forms.

      The investigators will conduct genealogical trees of index cases to identify families, whose
      number of healthy individuals and those with relevant PR makes sense for a family genetic
      study, i.e. a genetically informative family.

      In all centers, relatives of included Index cases, agreeing to participate in this research,
      will be enrolled and followed.

      Nantes University Hospital is the only center to perform a cold test (for reasons of
      availability of the technique) but this test will be reserved for patients whose diagnosis of
      primary Raynaud's phenomenon would be doubtful. Exposed identified relatives, agreeing to
      participate in this research, will all be included and followed in their enrollment center.

    <description>Such an approach allows to highlight chromosomal regions shared only by individuals within a family and thus highlight the genetic mutations causing the Raynaud phenomenon . The ultimate goal is to identify new pathways involved in vasospasm.
Patients with primary Raynaud phenomenon will be identified during a consultation of vascular medicine and internal medicine in one of the centers participating to the study. Those patients with a primary PR will be considered as Index cases.
The investigators will conduct genealogical trees of index cases to identify families, whose number of healthy individuals and those with relevant PR makes sense for a family genetic study, i.e. a genetically informative family.</description>
