  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of
      intravenous nemonoxacin compared with intravenous moxifloxacin in adult patients with
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of death in both developing and
      developed countries. In the choice of antibacterial agents used to treat CAP,
      fluoroquinolones have received considerable attention because of their wide spectrum of
      bactericidal activity. TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin), a non-fluorinated quinolone (NFQ), is a
      selective bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor.

      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy, microbiological efficacy and safety of
      Intravenous nemonoxacin compared with Intravenous levofloxacin in adult patients with
      community-acquired pneumonia.

      Besides, the populationpharmacokinetics (PPK) of nemonoxacin in adult patients with CAP after
      continuous IV Infusion and the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD)are to be determined.
