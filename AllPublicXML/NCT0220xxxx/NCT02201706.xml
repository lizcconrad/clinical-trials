    <textblock>
      Retinal re-detachment in silicone oil filled eye, especially in the traumatic eye, is a
      complex retinal detachment with poor prognosis.

      In this study, the investigators try to apply a modified surgery as Multi-electrocoagulation
      retinectomy to reattach the retina. Here the investigators aimed to explore the safety and
      efficacy of this new surgical approach

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relaxing retinectomy is a useful surgery for retinal re-detachment in eyes with silicone
      oil filled. However, it has some obvious disadvantages such as the cut of the normal retina
      surrounding, leaving a large area of retinal deficiency and significant exposure of retinal
      pigment epithelium and choroid membranes.

      In this study, we try to apply a modified surgery named Multi-electrocoagulation retinectomy
      to re-attach the retina.

      Instead of cutting through the proliferated retina directly, this new surgical approach
      adopts to cut the retina apart in a honeycomb shape with the help of electrocoagulation.

      In this way, we not only relax the traction of the proliferative membranes, but also reserve
      the rest retina to cover the RPE layers.

      Based on the hypothesis above, we are aiming to explore the safety and efficacy of this new
      surgical approach

    <description>a modified surgery named &quot;multi-electrocoagulation retinectomy&quot; to re-attach the retina.
All the single surgical technique and devices involved in this modified surgery are used commonly in clinic.
Base on this, the investigator changes the traditional sequence of these single surgical techniques, and combine them into a new surgical process.</description>
