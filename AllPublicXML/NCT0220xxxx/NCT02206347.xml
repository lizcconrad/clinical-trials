  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural-suprapostural task is defined as postural control takes place while at least one
      other concurrent task is being performed, and appropriate locus of attentional allocation is
      considered a critical factor for successful postural-suprapostural execution. Recent studies
      have indicated that the behavior performance of postural-suprapostural task would be affected
      by the prioritization of attentional allocation (postural-first vs. suprapostural-first);
      however, the inference of the appropriateness of attention prioritization is primarily
      limited to behavior observations and lacks direct neural evidences. How the effect of
      attentional priority between postural and suprapostural tasks on postural-suprapostural
      performance and its underlying cortical mechanism is rarely understood. By adopting
      postural-first and suprapostural-first strategies for postural-suprapostural task, the
      purpose of this 2-year research project is to 1) investigate the differences in performance
      quality and intrinsic neural mechanisms effect of a postural-suprapostural task for healthy
      adults with the analysis of event-related potential (ERP) and non-linear dynamics of behavior
      measures; 2) investigate brain plastic changes and the appropriateness of strategy use. In
      the first year, the attention prioritization effect on reciprocity of a
      postural-suprapostural task will be characterized by integrating the results of behavior
      performance and ERP causal connectivity with a special focus on validation of prevailing
      theoretical models. In the second year, the difference of task fluent for learning a
      postural-suprapostural task with postural-first/suprapostural-first strategy will be studied
      through the spatial and time variations in alpha rhythm after principle component analysis.
      The present project is expected to have significant contributions not only to gain a better
      insight to neural correlates of concurrent postural and motor suprapostural tasks, but to
      optimize treatment strategy for patients with balance or multi-tasking disturbances.
