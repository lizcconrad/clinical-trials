      Mucopolysaccharidosis IV, also known as MPS IV or Morquio disease, is a rare autosomal
      recessive genetic lysosomal storage disorder. Research thus far regarding Morquio, has
      primarily focused on the physical aspects of the various diseases. Less attention has been
      paid to the psychological toll of these diseases, whether they are direct symptoms or
      reactions to living with a chronic progressive disease.

      Prior to 2013, there was neither a cure nor treatment (other than palliative) for Morquio
      disease. In the latter half of 2013, ERT became available to the broader population of
      patients with Morquio A disease through BioMarin's Expanded Access Program.

      In a previous study, entitled &quot;Psychological Concomitants of Morquio syndrome&quot; the present
      investigator enrolled 20 adult subjects with Morquio into a pilot study to estimate a
      baseline incidence of psychological symptoms and overall quality of life. Subjects were all
      over the age of 18. Data from this study were published in 2015.

      The present study extends this research into psychological health with Morquio via a
      comparison of psychological issues and quality of life before and after treatment (i.e. ERT).
      As ERT does not cross the blood-brain barrier, it would be unlikely to improve organic
      psychological symptoms, but may improve any reactive psychological symptoms caused by living
      over time with this chronic progressive genetic disease.

      The present study thus seeks to follow adult patients with Morquio A disease as they begin
      ERT and track their psychological health every 6 months for a duration of 2 years. Adult
      patients with Morquio disease are invited to participate. Subjects will complete three
      different self-report questionnaires, the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment
      (ASEBA) Adult Self-Report (ASR), the Short Form 36-item Health Questionnaire (SF-36), and the
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Group aggregate data will be reported; individual questionnaire
      content and results will be held confidential, except as in accordance with Georgia law
      relating to reporting of child or elder abuse, suicidal and/or homicidal intent.

      Mucopolysaccharidosis IV, also known as MPS IV or Morquio disease, is a rare autosomal
      recessive genetic lysosomal storage disorder. Research thus far regarding lysosomal storage
      diseases (LSDs) in general, including Morquio, has primarily focused on exploring the causes
      of and finding a treatment for the physical aspects of the various diseases. Less attention
      has been paid to the psychological or emotional toll of these diseases, whether they are
      direct symptoms of the diseases themselves or reactions to living with a chronic progressive
      disease.

      It is well established in the health psychology literature, however, that the interaction
      between our physical health and our psychological health is bidirectional; that is, just as
      our physical health affects us emotionally (e.g. chronic pain can contribute to depression),
      so can our psychological health affect us physically (e.g. anxiety can contribute to feelings
      of chest pain). It is thus critically important to pay attention to the emotional and
      psychological symptoms associated with all lysosomal storage diseases, including Morquio, and
      expand our treatment standard of care to include mental health treatment, if necessary.

      The first step in understanding and treating psychological conditions in Morquio disease is
      determining the natural occurrence of psychological symptoms in this population in comparison
      with non-medical populations. As little has been done in this regard, a pilot study
      documenting the occurrence rate of psychological issues and overall quality of life in
      patients with Morquio is the first item in order and will be the focus of this study.

      Approximately 20 patients with Morquio disease will be invited to participate, recruited
      through Emory's Lysosomal Storage Disease Center, as well as through attendance at Morquio
      support groups and relevant regional, national and/or international meetings. Once consented,
      patients will be asked to complete three different self-report questionnaires, including the
      Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) Adult Self-Report (ASR) or Older
      Adult Self-Report (OASR) questionnaire, the Short Form 36-item Health Questionnaire (SF-36),
      and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Group aggregate data only will be reported; individual
      questionnaire content and results will be held confidential, except as in accordance with
      Georgia law relating to reporting of child or elder abuse, suicidal and/or homicidal intent.
      Completion of these questionnaires will complete subjects' participation in this pilot study.
