    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of MLN0264 in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic guanylyl cyclase C (GCC)-positive adenocarcinoma of the
      stomach or gastroesophageal junction.

      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0264. MLN0264 is being tested to treat
      tumors in people who have metastatic or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      malignancies expressing guanylyl cyclase C (GCC). Participants will be analyzed in cohorts
      based on GCC expression: low=combined H-score 10-109, intermediate=combined H-score 110-249,
      high=combined IHC H-score &gt;250. This study will assess tumor size reduction in patients who
      are administered MLN0264.

      The study enrolled 38 patients. All participants will be administered MLN0264 at 1.8 mg/kg as
      a single, 30-minute, intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle,
      followed by a rest period of 20 days. Participants will continue to receive MLN0264 for up to
      1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 19 months. Participants will make 3 to 6 visits to the clinic per
      treatment cycle, an end-of-treatment visit 30 days after the last dose of study medication,
      and follow-up assessments every 12 weeks until death or 6 months after the last patient
      completes treatment - whichever occurs first.

    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by the Investigator.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with a diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction expressing Guanylyl Cyclase C (GCC) were enrolled in 1 treatment group, MLN0264 1.8 mg/kg, 30-minute IV infusion, Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.</pre_assignment_details>

PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD and no new lesions. SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started and no new lesions.
