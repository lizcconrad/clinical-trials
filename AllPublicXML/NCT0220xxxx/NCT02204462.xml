      Our preclinical studies suggest the capacity of the positron emission tomography imaging
      agent 18F-fluorobenzyl triphenyl phosphonium (FBnTP) to detects early-stage small breast
      tumors (e.g., DCIS), and differentiates benign from malignant masses with better accuracy
      than that obtained by existing breast imaging tools.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most widespread type of cancer among women in the USA, and the second
      leading cause of death. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2013, in the USA,
      226,870 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,510 women will die of breast
      cancer, most of them of progressive metastatic disease. Early detection and treatment of the
      disease, when the tumor is still localized and at a high curability state, is the outmost
      important determinant of disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. Survival rate of
      women first diagnosed with pure early-stage noninvasive tumor (ductal carcinoma in situ-
      DCIS) is nearly 98%, which drops to 48% in patients with advanced disease.Yet, early
      detection of breast cancer is relatively poor. This is best exemplify by the astonishing
      percentage of benign biopsies; 80% of 1.7 million biopsies in the USA, at a cost of $3
      billion; whereas, only small fraction (~20%) of newly diagnosed women are found to have pure
      DCIS.

      Our preclinical studies suggest the capacity of the positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging agent 18F-fluorobenzyl triphenyl phosphonium (FBnTP) to detects early-stage small
      breast tumors (e.g., DCIS), and differentiates benign from malignant masses with better
      accuracy than that obtained by existing breast imaging tools. Accordingly, the present
      protocol is designed to extend the preclinical findings into clinical studies in breast
      cancer women, and to assess the effectiveness of 18F-FBnTP in detecting breast malignant
      lesions, in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients with newly-diagnosed invasive and/or intraductal breast cancer
             detected by core needle or vacuum-assisted biopsy (i.e., index cancer)

          -  Age &gt; 25 Ability and willingness to sign informed consent prior to any study
             procedure.

          -  Positive indication of disease on mammogram or MRI scan.

          -  Candidate for breast cancer surgery on the basis of recommendation of a breast cancer
             surgeon.

          -  Ability to undergo up to 90 minutes of PEM imaging.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any active or chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigators, would make
             the study unsafe or limit compliance with study procedures.
