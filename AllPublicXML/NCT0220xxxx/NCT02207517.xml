  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CITT-ART is a multicenter study (8 locations around the United States) of 324 children ages 9
      to &lt;14 years with symptomatic convergence insufficiency (CI). The purpose of this study is to
      see if office-based therapy for convergence insufficiency (CI) improves reading ability and
      attention. CI is an eye-teaming problem where the eyes would like to drift outward when
      reading or doing close work. When eyes drift out, double vision can happen. To prevent double
      vision one must use extra effort to keep the eyes from going out. This extra effort can cause
      symptoms that can interfere with reading and working comfortably at near. These symptoms
      often include eyestrain, blurred vision, headaches, double vision, and loss of place when
      reading or performing tasks at near. In a prior study we found that therapy improves these
      symptoms. In this study we are looking at whether the therapy improves reading and attention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the success of the NEI-funded Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trials (CITT),
      the next logical and important research issue is to determine if the successful treatment of
      symptomatic convergence insufficiency (CI) (i.e., improvement of symptoms and ophthalmic
      signs) impacts function (reading and attention).

      It is well documented that children with symptomatic CI report significantly more symptoms
      when reading and doing close work (e.g., blurred vision, headaches, double vision, loss of
      concentration, frequent loss of place, trouble remembering what was read), manifest more
      academic-impairing behaviors (e.g., difficulty finishing assignments), and score worse on
      parent ratings of attention compared to children with normal binocular vision. Because
      reduction of symptoms and adverse academic behaviors are established outcomes of successful
      treatment of CI, we propose to test the hypothesis that resolution of these symptoms and
      behaviors leads to improved reading performance and attention. Previous studies have found
      improvements in reading comprehension reading speed and accuracy after successful treatment
      of CI. In a recent pilot study, investigators also found significant improvement in reading
      comprehension and attention after 16 weeks of successful treatment of symptomatic CI with
      office-based vergence/accommodative therapy; however, there was no control group. To
      definitively determine whether the successful treatment of symptomatic CI positively impacts
      reading and attention requires a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.

      Objective: We propose a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of
      324 children ages 9 to &lt;14 years (Grades 3-8) with symptomatic CI. [we will restrict
      recruitment to children who do not have significant single word reading deficits.]
      Participants will be randomized to 16 weeks of treatment with either [a] office-based
      vergence/accommodative therapy with home reinforcement (OBVAT) or [b] office-based placebo
      therapy with home reinforcement (OBPT). Outcomes (reading and attention) will be assessed
      after 16 weeks of treatment. In addition, we will test the long-term effects on outcomes at 1
      year after treatment completion. All analyses will test the null hypothesis of no difference
      in outcomes between the two treatment groups.

      Specific Aim 1 - Reading Performance: To compare reading comprehension outcomes for children
      with symptomatic CI who receive 16 weeks of OBVAT and OBPT treatment. The primary outcome
      measure of reading performance is the Wechsler Individual Achievement test (WIAT-III) reading
      comprehension subtest score. In secondary analyses, we will examine the effects of the
      treatment on word reading, pseudoword decoding, oral reading fluency, and listening
      comprehension. We also will examine the correlation of changes in CI symptoms and ophthalmic
      signs with reading outcomes. Analysis of the 1-year follow-up data will be used to determine
      if any gains in reading performance observed after 16 weeks of treatment are sustained.

      Specific Aim 2 - Attention: To investigate the effect of treatment on teacher- and
      parent-rated measures of attention for children with symptomatic CI who receive 16 weeks of
      OBVAT and OBPT intervention. The primary outcome measure of attention is the score on the
      Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior Scale (SWAN). In secondary
      analyses, we will examine the effects of treatment on a second parent-rated attention scale
      called the SNAP. We also will examine the correlation of changes in CI-symptoms and
      ophthalmic signs with attention outcomes. Analysis of the 1-year follow-up data will be used
      to determine if any gains in attention observed after 16 weeks of treatment are maintained.

      Scientific and Clinical Impact: The relationship between the treatment of symptomatic CI and
      its effect on reading and attention in children is unknown. The results of the proposed study
      will contribute to a better understanding of these relationships and help to resolve
      controversy surrounding this issue. The results will have important implications for
      educators, psychologists, eye professionals, and other health care providers who care for
      children with reading and attention problems and guide hypothesis development for future
      scientific investigations on evidence-based relationships between visual disorders and other
      developmental disorders in children.

    <description>Curriculum Based Measurement is commonly used by educators to assess short-term progress in reading, skills as the child proceeds through the academic year The primary advantage of the CBM measure is the ability to track rate of improvement by initial reading level and by time of year. The addition of the CBM measure will assess reading at each outcome visit and allow us to track changes in a similar manner to attention and CI where we have measures at each outcome visit. In addition, CBM will provide an additional outcome measure for reading using a method that is commonly employed by school districts to monitor reading progress and will help to communicate the clinical significance of our results.</description>

Vision therapists (optometrists, ophthalmologists, orthoptists, or specially-trained technicians) administer the therapy in the office. OBPT procedures are then supplemented with placebo home therapy procedures.
The procedures for OBPT are designed with the intent of not providing a beneficial training effect on vergence, accommodation, saccadic accuracy, or visual attention beyond normal activities. However, the procedures are designed to simulate real vision therapy in such a way that it will be difficult for participants and parents to know that they have been assigned to the control group and thus are not receiving bonafide OBVAT</description>
