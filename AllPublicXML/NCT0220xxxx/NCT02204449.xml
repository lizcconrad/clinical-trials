  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a randomized controlled trial, being conducted at two hospitals in
      Toronto, Ontario, Canada, involving the randomization of cardiac inpatients into an
      intervention group, in which they will receive mentorship from a volunteer cardiac
      rehabilitation peer mentor, and a control group, in which they will receive usual care.
      Patients in both groups will be tracked to determine if they are referred to cardiac
      rehabilitation and if they enroll in cardiac rehabilitation. We hypothesize that compared to
      cardiac inpatients who receive usual care, those cardiac inpatients who receive cardiac
      rehabilitation peer mentorship will be more likely to be referred to and enroll in cardiac
      rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will be a randomized controlled trial in which cardiac inpatients will be
      randomized to either receive the intervention (cardiac rehabilitation peer mentorship) or be
      in the control group (receive usual care). After consent is obtained cardiac patients in the
      intervention group will be visited, at the hospital bedside, by trained volunteer cardiac
      rehabilitation peer mentors (i.e., individuals who have completed cardiac rehabilitation) who
      will provide the patients with information on cardiac rehabilitation as well as encourage the
      patients to obtain a referral from their healthcare provider. During this visit the cardiac
      rehabilitation peer mentor will also obtain agreement from the patient to call the patient at
      home two weeks after their discharge. Those in the control group will not be visited by
      cardiac rehabilitation peer mentors.

      One week after discharge the cardiac rehabilitation peer mentors will mail the patients in
      the intervention a get-well soon card reminding the patient of the visit, giving them more
      information about the cardiac rehabilitation program, and reminding them of their future
      scheduled phone call. Two weeks after patients' discharge cardiac rehabilitation peer mentors
      will call the patients in the intervention group. At this point they will assess how the
      patient is doing, if they were referred to cardiac rehabilitation and if they enrolled. Any
      possible barriers the patients have to attending cardiac rehabilitation will also be
      discussed.

      Eight weeks post-discharge, patient referral and enrolment will be ascertained by a research
      assistant blinded to random assignment. Statistical analyses will be conducted to determine
      any differences between the two groups as well as to determine any differences between men
      and women.

            <title>Cardiac Rehabilitation Peer Mentorship</title>
            <description>Trained cardiac rehabilitation (CR) peer mentors will visit cardiac inpatients in the hospital to provide patients with information on CR. During this visit the CR mentors will discuss the benefits of CR, stress the importance of getting a referral before leaving the hospital, and arrange a time in the near future to call the patient/participant at home to find out about their progress in terms of CR.
One week after the patient has been discharged the peer mentor will mail a card to the patient to wish them well and remind them of the planned call. Two weeks after the patient has been discharged the peer mentor will call the patient at home to determine if they were referred and if they are able and planning to attend CR. If any barriers are stated by the patient the peer mentors will work with the patient to develop possible solutions to those barriers. Patients can request up to two additional phone calls from the peer mentors.
