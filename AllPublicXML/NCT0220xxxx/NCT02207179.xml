  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate LumaScan, an innovative polarization microscope for real time,
      intraoperative imaging and evaluation of the surface of excised tissue excised during Breast
      Conservation Surgery (BCS) for non invasive and invasive breast cancer. The investigators
      hypothesis is that LumaScan will be comparable for cancer detection to conventional
      histopathologic evaluation of the same areas of breast tissue. The real time, intraoperative
      images provided by LumaScan will help improve BCS and lessen the need for BCS re-excision
      surgeries which can lead to higher cost, poor cosmetic outcomes, reduced survival rates, and
      loss of confidence in the tissue conservation surgery procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LumaScan is an innovative polarization microscope that uses Polarization Subtraction Imaging
      (PSI) technology to provide real time, intra operative, digital images of the surface of
      tissue removed during BCS for breast cancer. PSI uses polarized visible light for optical
      sectioning and geometric imaging of the superficial layers of the surgically removed tissue
      while rejecting surface scatter and light from deeper layers. By rejecting light from deeper
      tissues PSI is able to exclusively focus on the superficial tissue layers. This also results
      in higher resolution images than are possible with standard optical imaging. PSI is used in
      both reflectance and fluorescence modes. Reflectance detects morphologic abnormalities that
      occur in tumor progression such as increased nuclear density, angiogenesis, cellular
      infiltration and crowding while fluorescence detects early biochemical changes.

      To enhance the contrast of tumor at the margins the investigators will use Methylene blue
      (MB), a dye that has been commonly used in breast surgery for mapping sentinel lymph nodes.
      MB can be administered peritumorally and is quickly taken up by cells in only a few minutes
      of exposure and its presence does not interfere with or preclude later histopathology on the
      same tissue specimen. A tumor specimen may also be dipped in MB post-excision to achieve
      tumor margin contrast enhancement and not interfere with pathologic assessment.

      Previous research using PSI technology has demonstrated the value of PSI in mapping tumor
      boundaries of breast cancer in excised tissue specimens and in non-melanoma skin cancers and
      these boundaries in side by side comparisons correlate well with those marked by a
      pathologist on representative sections prepared using standard H&amp;E staining procedures.
