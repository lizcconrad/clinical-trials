      Introduction Chronic disease is prevalent and costly in the U.S. (Tu &amp; Cohen, 2009). Poor
      eating habit is one factor that account for risk of chronic disease (Arsand, Varmedal, &amp;
      Hartvigsen, 2007). Smartphone technology has been promising to improve preventive health
      outcomes. However, its great potential has not been widely applied to people's eating
      behaviors and its impact is unknown.

      Professional and peer supports can improve health status (Elkjaer et al., 2010; Lorig et al.,
      1999; Perri, Sears, &amp; Clark, 1993). However, the former is usually delivered didactically or
      passively with limited use of smartphones. There is also little evidence of the effect of
      peer support delivered by smartphones in the domain of healthy eating. This research aims to
      study what smartphone technology can do to upgrade professional and peer supports, and to
      evaluate the impact of these mobile-app enabled supports on people's behavior of healthy
      eating and user engagement.

      Hypotheses

      According to Social Cognitive Theory, we hypothesize the following:

        1. Mobile-enabled self-monitoring approach improves users' healthy eating behaviors through
           improved self-efficacy

        2. Professional support improves users' healthy eating behaviors through improved
           self-efficacy

        3. Peer support improves users' healthy eating behaviors through improved self-efficacy

        4. The amount of support is positively correlated with the change in behaviors and their
           determinants

      Experiment Design The hypotheses will be examined bya 4-month randomized field experiment.
      375 subjects will be recruited and assigned to one of the five arms to receive the
      corresponding tool for diet management at no cost.

      Arm 1: a mobile App with both professional and peer support Arm 2: a mobile App with peer
      support only Arm 3: a mobile App with professional support only Arm 4: a mobile App without
      any support Arm 5: a non-mobile web App In addition to the App usage data, five surveys are
      conducted at baseline and the end of each month. Respondents will be compensated by $8 and a
      chance to win $200 for each completed survey.

      Interventions

        1. All subjects receive the following interventions: an education package includes the
           importance of healthy eating, concept of MyPlate, personalized daily food plans;
           reminders throughout the study; goal setting capabilities;

        2. Self-monitoring provided by an Android App: a heuristic approach inspired by MyPlate to
           record their food consumption which allows users to record their meals by images and
           doesn't require estimations in cups and ounces; daily reports and trend reports

        3. Self-monitoring provided by the web App: a traditional approach to record their food
           consumption which requires estimations in cups and ounces, and no images are allowed; no
           daily reports and trend reports are provided

        4. Professional support provided by a registered dietitian via the Android App: the
           supports include the following:

             1. Reply to users' messages regarding healthy eating

             2. Provide meal-specific comments on subjects' meal consumptions: one meal per week

             3. Provide feedback on the subjects' consumption patterns: once per week

        5. Peer support provided by other subjects via the Android App: the App provides platforms
           for subjects who have the same interest to communicate to each other. The actions the
           subjects can do in the platforms include:

             1. Post images or texts related to healthy eating

             2. Share meals with their ratings

             3. Like/dislike others' posts

             4. Comment on others' posts e Create groups which allow subjects who have the same
                interest to join

      Measurements

        1. Dependent Variables

             1. Eating behavior: a score of healthiness of a meal will be assigned by a dietitian.
                The scores obtained by the same subject along the experiment compose the subject's
                eating behavior

             2. Engaging behavior: this is measured by the number of meals recorded by the subject
                in a week. The numbers for the same subject along the experiment compose the
                subject's engaging behavior

        2. Independent Variables

             1. Level of peer support: this will be measured by a score representing the number of
                posts, likes, and comments received and given by a subject in a week

             2. Level of professional support: this will be measured by a score representing the
                number of messages or comments exchanged with the dietitian in a week

        3. Mediator Variables: self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and impediments will be measured
           by survey instruments

      Data

        1. User Survey: characteristics and perceptions

        2. Mobile App: time, location, and contents of goal setting, meal entries, communications
           with professionals and peers

        3. Web App: contents of goal setting and meal entries

      Analysis Confirmatory factor analysis and statistical modeling such as structural equation
      modeling and mixed models will be conducted to test our hypotheses.

    <description>This will be measured by a score representing the healthiness of each selected meal, evaluated by dietitians. Specifically, the score is composed of three sub-scores: 1) portion of fruits and vegetables (7-point Likert scale); 2) portion of the entire meal (7-point Likert scale); 3) evaluators confidence level (4-point Likert scale). One subject will get one score per week, and hence 16 scores in 4-months.</description>
