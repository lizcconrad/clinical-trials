      Study Aim:

      To determine the feasibility and treatment effect of a multi-component intervention combining
      non-drug treatments for urinary incontinence, physical activity, and environmental
      modifications to prevent toileting disability in frail older women living in senior housing
      facilities.

      Hypothesis 1:

      Treatment group participants will have a 15% improvement in toileting skills as measured by
      the performance on timed toileting instrument compared to no improvement in women assigned to
      the no treatment group

      Hypothesis 2:

      Treatment group participants will have improvements in urinary incontinence severity and
      frequency, quality of life related to urinary incontinence, physical function, and barriers
      to toileting compared to no improvement in the no treatment group participants

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance Oriented Timed Toileting Instrument (POTTI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A performance based measure that takes less than 5 minutes to administer. Participants are timed as they complete tasks that simulate toileting including: rising from a chair, walking 15 feet to another chair, turning around, pulling down an elastic waist skirt worn over their typical clothing, sitting in the chair, grabbing a piece of toileting paper and throwing it into a wastebasket, rising and pulling the skirt back up. Longer times indicate greater difficulty with toileting. It has strong inter-rater and test-retest reliability (90% agreement) and has been validated with activities of daily living dependency (r= -.721, p&lt;.001) in nursing home residents (Ouslander et al., 1987). It has demonstrated responsiveness to change in a recent clinical trial (van Houten et. al., 2007).</description>

    <measure>Toileting Skills Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A five item toileting skills questionnaire that assesses participants level of difficulty with undressing, walking to the toilet, getting on and off the toilet, reaching to grab toilet paper, and reaching around to wipe their bottom. Responses for each item range from 0-no difficulty to 4-cannot do. Total scores range from 0-20. Higher scores indicate more difficulty.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A four item questionnaire reporting the frequency and amount of urine leakage, how much leakage interferes with everyday life, and when leaking occurs. Scores range from 0-21 with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Environmental toileting barriers checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Observation of environmental barriers to toilet access, i.e., inappropriate toilet seat height, grab bar placement, trip hazards on pathway to toilet, adequate lighting in bathroom and pathways to toilet and other barriers to easy toileting.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The IIQ is a questionnaire with 30 items measuring the impact urinary incontinence has on social, physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of life. All items contain the same response options (0=not at all, 1=slightly, 2= moderately, 3=greatly) and scores range from 0-90.</description>

    <measure>Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intevention</time_frame>
    <description>The UDI has 20 items asking about how much urinary incontinence bothers the respondent. All items contain the same response options (0=not at all, 1=slightly, 2= moderately, 3=greatly) and scores range from 0-60.</description>

    <description>12 week program with 3 components
Continence program administered by a registered nurse during 4 home visits. Participants do pelvic floor muscle exercises 5 days/week using a 13-minute instructional audio CD. Based on participant symptoms and preferences the following strategies are taught: bladder training, urge and suppression techniques, caffeine reduction, eliminating bladder irritants, medication adjustment, adequate fluid intake, constipation management, and reducing nocturia.
Physical activity program including moderate intensity walking (30 minutes, 5 days weekly) and twice weekly group strength training sessions using Therabands led by a trained exercise instructor.
Recommendations for improving toilet access (i.e., lighting, toileting and dressing devices, grab bars, raised toilet seats, clearing path to toilet).</description>
