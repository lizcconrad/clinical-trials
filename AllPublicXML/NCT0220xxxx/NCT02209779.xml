             of the skin are not a criterion for exclusion

             practice - having the TNF-blocking agent discontinued due to ineffectiveness

          -  DMARD treatment within 4 weeks before visit 3

               -  Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or total bilirubin greater
                  than upper limit of normal (ULN) at visit 1 or measured within the last six
                  months before visit 3. This exclusion criterion was modified in Amendment 1,
                  effective September 3, 2001, allowing for a retest at Visit 2.

               -  Gamma-Glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase or Lactate Dehydrogenase greater
                  than 1.5 x ULN at visit 1
