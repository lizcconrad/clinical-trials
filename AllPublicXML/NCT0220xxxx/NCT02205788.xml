      The purpose of this study is to determine if you can use an assay on tumor samples to see
      different patterns in response to the same chemotherapy treatment.

      To examine the feasibility of using biodynamic imaging (BDI) as a chemosensitivity assay on
      fresh tumor samples obtained by core needle biopsy from patients planned to receive routine
      care gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
      pancreas.

             research purposes

          8. Women are eligible to participate if they are of non-childbearing potential or have
             documentation of a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine β-hCG) within 1 week of the
             start of protocol treatment.

          9. Women and men of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate, highly effective
             contraceptive measures during protocol treatment

         10. Laboratory values: Platelets ≥ 100 K/mm3 international normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.2,
             Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) in normal range, Cr &lt; 2.0, Total bilirubin &lt; 2 times
             upper limit normal (ULN), transaminases &lt; 5 times ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of abnormal bleeding with minor procedures or documented platelet aggregation
             disorder such as VonWillebrand disease
