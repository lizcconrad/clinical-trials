  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sternal precautions are standard patient education protocol disseminated to post-operative
      open heart surgery patients . While this &quot;best practice&quot; safety measure is widely distributed
      to patients, the origin of said precautions is unknown. Statewide hospitals vary on their
      parameters for sternal precautions using a myriad of restrictions, i.e. weighted activities,
      biomechanical movements to be avoided. In addition, the medium in which sternal precautions
      are taught varies, thus complicating patient adherence to these vital post-operative
      measures.

      The primary objective of this study is to use a randomized pre-post test design to compare
      two different training procedures. One training group examines current standard of care
      (providing verbal instruction using teach back and written sternal precautions). The second
      training group provides subjects with visual depiction of sternal precautions, in addition to
      standard of care. The study will analyze 30 and 60 day readmission rates for aforementioned
      patients. Finally, the study will assess changes in behavior intentions from before training
      to after training in both groups via behavioral analysis survey consisting of 8 questions.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize that subjects provided with visual sternal
      precautions, in addition to standard of care, will have a lower 30 and 60 day readmission
      rate when compared to subjects in the standard of care group

      Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize that changes in behavior intentions toward
      sternal precautions will be greater from before training to after training in the visual SPs
      in addition to standard of care group than the standard of care only group.

      Eligible subjects will be identified by the Senior Cardiothoracic Physical Therapist (Dr.
      Craig D. Feinman, PT, DPT) on staff at North Shore University Hospital. Dr. Feinman will
      provide basic study information to potential subjects and refer those that are interested in
      the study to the research team who will then provide a copy of the consent form and more
      information about the study. Inclusion Criteria represents post-surgical adult patients who
      had a median or midline sternotomy incision during cardiac surgery at North-Shore University
      Hospital. Exclusion Criteria represents patients with dementia or those that are cognitively
      impaired will be excluded from the study.

      A T-test or Mann Whitney U test will be use to compare group differences on continuous
      variables, e.g. age. Beta regression or logistic regression model will be developed for the
      outcomes of adherence and readmission proportions/rates. To assess changes from pre to post
      training on behavioral intentions a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank for matched pairs
      will be used. A result will be considered statistically significant at the p&lt;0.05 level of
      significance. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

    <description>The intervention group will receive &quot;standard of care&quot; sternal precautions delivered via written medium. In addition, printed visual depictions of sternal precautions will be provided. During completion of the initial Physical Therapy evaluation, patients will be asked to provide baseline knowledge of sternal precautions via &quot;teach back,&quot; an important tool in assessing patients' knowledge of important points delivered during clinical practice. Patients will then perform teach back of sternal precautions upon second Physical Therapy encounter to ensure understanding and post-operative anesthesia effects have waned. Prior to discharge (when patient deemed medically appropriate by the medical/surgical team), the patient will receive a survey consisting of 8 behavioral intention questions with &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;not sure&quot; responses. Questions posed on the surveys assess if patients will/will not perform certain behaviors that may/may not predispose a risk to the patient's sternum.</description>

    <description>Re-admission rates of enrolled subjects is integral in determining if patients adhere to sternal precautions after discharge. Resumption of regular activities is cleared by the medical/surgical team. The study team will review the medical records of the subjects 60 days after enrollment to determine if and why they were re-admitted to the hospital. Since there is a possibility for subjects to be re-admitted to facilities outside of the health system, the study team will also call the enrolled subjects 60 days after enrollment to obtain this information.</description>
