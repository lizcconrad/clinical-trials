  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU and cisplatin, higher tumor TS levels were
      associated with a less favorable response (29% vs. 68%; p=0.024). Similarly, in a study in
      which patients were treated with high dose 5-FU, patients with high TS expression had a
      response rate of only 12.5%. Conversely a response rate of 92.9% was observed in patients
      with low tumor TS expression. A longer but not statistically significant survival advantage
      was observed in patients with the TSER*2 allele compared with the TSER*3/*3 patients.
      Additionally, a review by Patel et al. identified approximately 20 gastric cancer studies
      that have found a positive association between TSER genotype and clinical response (in either
      direction). Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to prospectively genotype
      patients, select patients with &quot;good risk&quot; TSER genotypes (TSER*2*/*2 or *2/*3) and treat
      them with a standard 5-FU containing regimen (FOLFOX) in order to improve clinical outcomes,
      while randomize patients with the &quot;poor risk&quot; TSER genotype (*3/*3) to either the standard
      5-FU containing regimen or another non-5-FU-based regimen (docetaxel/cisplatin).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma
             of the stomach.

          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20
             mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 9.2 for
             the evaluation of measurable disease.

          3. No prior therapy for metastatic disease. Prior neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy is
             permitted if the disease free interval has been longer than 12 months.

          4. Age between 18 and 70 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently
             available on the use of these regimens in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are
             excluded from this study.

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          6. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A).

          7. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/microliter

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/microliter

               -  Platelets &gt;100,000/microliter

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 x ULN if not liver metastases &lt; 5 x ULN if known liver
                  metastases

               -  Creatinine clearance &lt;1.5 x ULN

          8. Not pregnant. Not breast feeding. If the patient or partner is of childbearing
             potential, the couple will use adequate birth control in accordance with local IRB
             policies:

             For woman of childbearing potential:

             Patient must have negative blood pregnancy test. If sexually active, woman must either
             be post-menopausal (over age 50 and have not had a menstrual period for one year or
             more, or blood FSH level in the post-menopausal range) OR agree to use appropriate
             contraceptive measures for the duration of the study and for 21 days after stopping
             study treatment. The only birth control methods for women that are acceptable for this
             study are: (1) surgical sterilization (previous removal of the uterus or both ovaries
             or a tubal ligation) OR (2) an intrauterine device (IUD), (3) double barrier methods,
             (4) oral contraceptives.

             For men:

             Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization, or (2) a
             condom used with a spermicide. If the female partner becomes pregnant while patient is
             on treatment or within 21 days after stopping treatment, the study physician must be
             informed.

          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients may not be receiving any other chemotherapy agents.

          2. Patients with known active brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases
             are permitted if stable off steroids for at least 30 days. A screening head CT/MRI is
             not required in asymptomatic patients for this protocol.

          3. History of allergic reactions to 5-FU, oxaliplatin, docetaxel, or cisplatin.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          5. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with the chemotherapies.
