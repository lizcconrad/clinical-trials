  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is known to be associated with cognitive dysfunction which increasing evidence
      suggests has consequences for functional adaptation and which cause difficulties in social
      re-integration after hospitalization. The investigators propose a large scale, multicentric
      study (7 centres from the Hermanas Hospitalarias del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús network) aimed
      at answering outstanding questions concerning the effectiveness of cognitive estimulation
      therapy for schizophrenic cognitive impairment. Specifically, the study will examine a)
      issues related to the size of the effect compared to treatment as usual and compared to a
      control intervention; b) generalizability of improvement to cognitive function and social
      cognition in daily life; and c) the durability of therapeutic gains after the end of
      treatment. 192 patients with chronic schizophrenia will be randomly assigned to one of three
      treatment conditions: a computer- assisted cognitive estimulation program (n=64),
      non-structured time on computer (n=64) and treatment as usual (n=64). A battery of
      neurocognitive tests of memory and executive function, including 'ecologically valid'
      measures, will be administered by blind evaluators at baseline, after 6 months of cognitive
      estimulation, and after 6 months follow-up. Symptoms, social functioning and self-esteem will
      be also be assessed at baseline, after the treatment and at follow-up.

    <description>Patients in this arm of the trial carried out computerized online training drawn from the Feskits program (www.feskits.com), chosen to have attention, memory and executive function components. Specifically the sessions included the following exercises: sustained attention (4 minutes), attention/perception (5 minutes), working memory (8 minutes), auditory and visual memory (8 minutes), executive function (10 minutes), language (6 minutes), and games (4 minutes).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients allocated to this condition completed the same number of sessions as the cognitive training group but followed a computerized typing program (www.rapidtyping.com). This had similar design characteristics to the CRT condition, in that it was hierarchically organized with exercise level of difficulty being adjusted to the individual's level of performance and feedback being given at the end of each exercise. Additionally, patients in this condition played computerized games requiring typing (crosswords, word puzzles, etc) and were taught basic internet navigation by a supervisor. Exposure to the computer was of equivalent duration to the CRT condition.</description>

    <description>Treatment lasted six months. The CRT and CC conditions consisted of biweekly sessions of 45 minutes. Patients in both conditions trained in groups of up to 8, supervised by a single person. The CRT and CC groups were scheduled at different times. The same personnel supervised both treatment conditions. All supervisors were trained by the coordinator of the study in the technical management of the two conditions.</description>
