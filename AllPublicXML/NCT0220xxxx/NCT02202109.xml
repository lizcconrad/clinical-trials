    <textblock>
      The study will test the significance of community health worker (CHW) participation by
      comparing self-sampling provided by a community health worker and self-sampling provided by
      mail. The study will enroll 700 participants in communities that lack access to medical care
      in South Florida.

    <measure>Having a self sampling test done</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is having had a self-sampling done since the initial evaluation. Participants who test negative will be encouraged to rescreen while Participants who test positive for HPV will be navigated to appropriate follow-up care. The CHWs will follow up with participants who do not return the kit within 60 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical Cancer Knowledge and Access to Care</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical Cancer Knowledge: Baseline and follow-up knowledge information will also be examined as a secondary outcome. Access to Care: We will also examine access to care (having health insurance, usual of care of care and visits to a provider) as additional secondary outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participant who used the mailed Self Sampler</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if the method of delivery of the self sampler affected screening and if one of the two planned intervention was more efficacious among women in one location versus another. In addition using data obtained from our study questionnaire, we will also examine if there was a differential impact of the intervention among women who were uninsured, lower education, lower acculturation level or had lower levels of baseline cervical cancer knowledge.</description>

    <description>Behavioral: CHW and Self-sampling for Cervical Cancer The intervention strategies will involve one home visit: 1) provide brief health education on cervical cancer screening, 2) provide and collect self-sampler test. We envision visits lasting no more than 60 minutes.</description>

    <description>Mailed Self Sampler. Women randomized to this intervention arm will receive a self-sampling kit via mail. This kit will include: 1) the self-sampler; 2) the vial for collecting and storing the specimen; 3) a pre-addressed, stamped envelope for returning the vial; 4) a brief introductory letter/postcard which includes a picture of the CHE and the CHW and serves to re-orient the participant to the focus of the study; 5) instructional guide that visually depicts the steps for self-sampling;</description>
