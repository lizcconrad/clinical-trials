  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2140944 belongs to the Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitor (BTI) class of
      antibiotics. GSK2140944 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Gram positive
      including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative pathogens
      associated with respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections including isolates
      resistant to existing classes of antimicrobials. This is a First Time in Human (FTIH) study
      to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of GSK2140944
      in healthy volunteers. This study will be a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      dose-rising study in healthy subjects. The proposed single doses will range from 100 mg to
      3000 mg.

    <textblock>
      GSK2140944 belongs to the Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitor (BTI) class of
      antibiotics which is being developed for treatment of Gram positive [including methicillin
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)] and Gram-negative pathogens associated with
      respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections including isolates resistant to
      existing classes of antimicrobials.

      Study BTZ114595 will be the first administration of GSK2140944 in humans. This study will
      examine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral doses of
      GSK2140944. The predicted clinical target for efficacy, based on preclinical efficacy models,
      is an AUC(0-24) of 16-30 Î¼g.h/mL. This study aims to explore the safety and tolerability at
      and above target exposures in order to establish a therapeutic window for this compound.

      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating
      single oral doses of GSK2140944.

      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind study to determine safety,
      tolerability, and single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of GSK2140944 in healthy subjects.

      The projected single escalating doses of GSK2140944 will range from a starting dose of 100 mg
      to a maximum dose of 3000 mg. The current plan is to administer the study drug after an
      overnight fast, but based on emerging PK and safety data, it may be necessary to administer
      the study drug under fed state to better understand safety, tolerability or PK of GSK2140944.
      Any decision to remove or modify fasting requirements will be made by the GSK Study Team and
      the investigator based on joint review of the emerging safety, tolerability and preliminary
      pharmacokinetic data from prior dose-levels.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin â¤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female ranging from 18 to 60 years of age, at the time of signing the informed
             consent. Female subject must be of non-childbearing potential defined as
             pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and
             estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Body weight â¥ 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 - 31 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  QTcF &lt; 450 msec, or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block., at
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant central nervous system (e.g., seizures), cardiac,
             pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic or gastrointestinal conditions or history of such
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator may place the subject at an
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol (or alcohol breath test) at
             screening.

          -  A screening urinalysis positive for protein or glucose (greater than &quot;trace&quot; findings
             of protein or glucose).

          -  Positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody at screening.

          -  History of drug abuse within 6 months of the study.

          -  History of smoking or use of nicotine containing products within 3 months of

             a 285 mL glass of full strength beer or 425 mL schooner of light beer or 1 (30 mL)
             measure of spirits or 1 glass (100 mL) of wine.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current
             study medication.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins above the
             recommended daily intake (National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia
             guideline), herbal and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, or use of St. John's Wort within
             14 days prior to the first dose of study medication. By exception, the volunteer may
             take paracetamol or acetaminophen (â¤ 2 grams/day) or ibuprofen (1600 mg/day) up to 48
             hours prior to the first dose of study medication. However, the investigator and study
             team can review medication use on a case by case basis to determine if its use would
             compromise subject safety or interfere with study procedures or data interpretation.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, pummelos,
             exotic citrus fruits or grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices containing such products
             for 7 days prior to administration of study medication.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 550 mL within 12 weeks prior to dosing.

          -  An unwillingness of male subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or
             lactating women, or an unwillingness of male subjects to use a condom and spermicide,
             in addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception such as
             an IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone,
             subdermal implants or a tubal ligation, if engaging in sexual intercourse with a
             female partner who could become pregnant. This criterion must be followed from the
             time of study medication administration and until 84 days after study medication
             administration.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible,
             contraindicates their participation.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (if the clinical
             research unit uses heparin to maintain intravenous cannula patency).

          -  An unwillingness to comply with lifestyle and/or dietary restrictions as described in
             Section 8.
