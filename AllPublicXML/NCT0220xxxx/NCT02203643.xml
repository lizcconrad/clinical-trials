    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of carfilzomib combined with
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CCyd) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CRd) followed by
      autologous transplantation ASCT or 12 cycles of carfilzomib combined with dexamethasone and
      lenalidomide for patients eligible for ASCT with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. As a
      secondary endpoint this study will evaluate the best maintenance treatment between
      lenalidomide and lenalidomide combined with carfilzomib.

      Four hundred seventy-seven patients, males and females aged &gt; 18 years, enrolled in several
      sites, will take part in this study.

      The duration of the study is approximately 5 years.
