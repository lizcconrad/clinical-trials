  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that intensification of local therapy will lead to improvements
      in local control and survival in patients with unresectable and borderline resectable
      pancreatic cancer. The investigators propose to do this by combining nab-paclitaxel
      concurrently with dose-escalated radiation therapy. In the first part of this phase I study
      (sub-trial 1), the nab-paclitaxel dose will be escalated while the radiation dose is held
      constant at a standardly accepted level. The use of this novel chemoradiotherapy regimen will
      take advantage of nab-paclitaxels specific anti-tumor and anti-stromal properties, which may
      enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy, and thereby improve local control. After the MTD
      of nab-paclitaxel had been determined, in the second part of this study (sub-trial 2), the
      investigators will administer nab-paclitaxel at the determined MTD concurrently with
      escalated doses of radiation. The investigators will utilize a combination of protons and
      IMRT to safely deliver high doses of radiation while maximally sparing surrounding normal
      tissue. Patients will also preferentially have 2-3 fiducial markers placed in or around the
      tumor for daily localization and will be treated at breath hold in order to prevent tumor
      movement with normal respiration. Such a technique will help minimize target volumes and
      thereby avoid critical normal structures. The investigators will use gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel before and after chemoradiotherapy given its promising results in metastatic
      pancreatic cancer patients. Correlative tissue and serum biomarkers are an important, but
      optional, part of this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  Unresectable disease or borderline resectable disease assessed by a multidisciplinary
             panel of pancreas surgeon, medical and radiation oncologist, and a radiologist.
             Criteria defining unresectable and borderline resectable patients will be based on the
             NCCN Guidelines (v 1.2014):

        Unresectable

          -  Greater than 180 degrees of SMA encasement

          -  Any celiac abutment

          -  Unreconstructible SMV/portal occlusion

          -  Aortic invasion or encasement

          -  Nodal metastases beyond the field of resection Borderline resectable

          -  Venous involvement of the SMV/portal vein demonstrating tumor abutment with
             impingement and narrowing of the lumen

          -  Encasement of the SMV/portal vein but without encasement of the nearby arteries

          -  Short-segment venous occlusion resulting from either tumor thrombus or encasement with
             suitable proximal and distal vessel for reconstruction/grafting.

          -  Gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the hepatic artery with either short segment
             encasement or direct abutment of the hepatic artery, without extension to celiac axis

          -  Tumor abutment to SMA but not to exceed greater than 180 degrees of circumferential
             vessel wall

             platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dl, total bilirubin ≤ 3, (with relief
             of biliary obstruction if present (PTC tube or endobiliary stent) and AST &lt; 5 times
             the upper limit of normal.
