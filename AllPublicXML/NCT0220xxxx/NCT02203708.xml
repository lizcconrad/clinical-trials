  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability
      of interpersonal relationships, self-image and emotions as well as marked impulsivity. When
      patients have children, they are at high risk of severe emotional and relational disturbances
      (withdrawal, low self-esteem, depression, suicidal thoughts). In addition, studies support
      the effectiveness of parental guidance group to reduce emotional and behavioral difficulties
      of children. To our knowledge there are no programs directed to mothers with BPD who received
      a controlled evaluation.

      From experience with parental guidance, data from the observation of children of patients
      with BPD and psychosocial programs directed to patients BPD, we have built for preventive
      intervention. The Supportive Program for Mothers with BPD (SuPMother-B) consists of 10 group
      sessions providing information (education, childcare, care specific to BPD) and promotes
      mother-child interactions (observation, games).

      Purpose: Compare the effect of a program (SuPMother-B) group, of 10 sessions, offered to
      mothers with a BPD in addition to a minimal intervention (diagnostic announcement and
      provision of health care resources) on behavior withdrawal of children at 6 months compared
      to a group of mothers receiving only minimal intervention.

      Primary outcome: Difference at 6 months between the experimental and control groups on scores
      on the assessment scale withdrawal (Alarm Distress Baby (ADBB)).

    <description>The development of the program is based on several principles: group process, groupware, mentalization, parental values, behavioral strategies and information on the child's needs, knowledge of the BPD and the strategies of get better. The program will last 10 sessions of group of about 2h.
Minimal intervention. All study participants receive an individual interview about 45 minutes with a psychiatrist for three objectives: information on the diagnosis of BPD, information on resources for health care and educational aids.</description>
