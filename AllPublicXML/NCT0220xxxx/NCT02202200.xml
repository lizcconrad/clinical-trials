  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label multicentre, phase I-II study with tumour molecular pharmacodynamics (MPD)
      evaluation and pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 added to vemurafenib in patients suffering
      metastatic melanoma with BR.

      The main objective is to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PD-0332991 when added
      to standard vemurafenib therapy (960 mg BID). The estimated MTD is defined as the dose of
      PD-0332991 combined with vemurafenib that will be associated with a prespecified proportion
      of patients experiencing a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), ie, 1/3.

    <description>DLTs, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations will be determined as follows:
Any grade 3 or more non-haematological toxicity excluding:
Grade 3 asymptomatic increase in liver function tests (AST, ALT, ALP) reversible within 7 days for subjects without liver involvement, or grade 4 for subjects with liver involvement.
Grade 3 vomiting if it is encountered despite adequate and optimal therapy (e.g. 5HT3 antagonists and corticosteroids).
Grade 3 diarrhoeas if encountered despite adequate and optimal anti diarrhoea therapy.
Confirmed grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTc &gt;500 msec) that persists after correction of other possible causes such as electrolyte imbalance
Grade 4 hyperlipidemia if it is encountered despite adequate and optimal therapy.
Any grade 4 neutropenia of &gt; 5 days duration, or febrile neutropenia lasting for more than 1 day.
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia &gt; 1 day, or grade 3 with bleeding.</description>
