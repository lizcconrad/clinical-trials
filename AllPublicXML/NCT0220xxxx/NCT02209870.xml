  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been identified as an important
      determinants for patient survival, yet many studies revealed poor CPR guidelines compliance
      in real-life practice for both health care providers and lay persons. Common shortcomings
      identified include an insufficient number of chest compression, too rapid lung inflations,
      and too much hands-off time. The poor quality of CPR is associated with lower survival rate.
      Besides, some other problems could be found during resuscitation, such as prolonged
      intubation time, delayed first shock delivery or unsteady drug delivery interval. These
      problems can't be blamed on the only person but the teamwork. Certain measurements could
      improve the performance of the resuscitation team, such as audio prompt or checklist.

      Methods proposed and improvised to improve the quality of CPR have included CPR assisted
      devices, automatic driven devices or audio prompt system. However, some of these methods are
      hardly incorporate with the original resuscitation process since it could be an extra
      workload. Therefore, the investigators try to provide an digitized checklist combined with
      visual and audio alarming system, which could not only minimize the workload of chart
      recording but also remind the team to perform essential procedures in time.

      Information gained from a video-recording evaluation system had been employed to improve the
      resuscitation skills. The improvement of resuscitation quality also could be found through
      video-recording after certain intervention. It can also avoid the interference of the
      resuscitation and find out other harmful factors to CPR quality.
