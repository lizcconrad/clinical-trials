  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish normative data for the Adult/Adolescent Sensory
      History (ASH) and to determine if the ASH is able to discriminate between individuals aged
      13-95 years, with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with or without co-morbid Sensory processing
      Disorder (SPD), individuals with SPD with no co-morbid ASD, and individuals who are typically
      functioning.

      It is anticipated that individuals with ASD will have the most problems with sensory
      processing, those with SPD will also have problems in comparison to typical individuals. It
      is also hypothesized that the measure will be able to discriminate between the three groups.
