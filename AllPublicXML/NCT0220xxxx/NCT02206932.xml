    <textblock>
      This is a study of the safety and effectiveness of the hepatitis C medications sofosbuvir and
      simeprevir in patients who have both the HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of an investigational combination of two hepatitis C medications
      call sofosbuvir (SOF) and simeprevir (SMV). Both medications are approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of hepatitis C in combination with other
      medications. The combination sofosbuvir and simeprevir has not been approved by the FDA and
      is being tested as an investigational combination in research studies such as this. The
      purpose of this study is to see if SOF + SMV given for 12 weeks is safe and able to clear the
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) from subjects who are co-infected with HIV-1 and who have scarring of
      the liver (fibrosis of 3 or 4 on a scale of 0-4, with 4 as the most scarring, also known as
      cirrhosis).

      This study is an investigator-initiated clinical trial sponsored by University of California,
      San Francisco (UCSF), with support and the study drug simeprevir provided by Janssen
      Scientific Affairs, LLC.

                  carcinoma within 3 months of study enrollment

          -  Female subjects of reproductive potential (defined as women who have not been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, ie, who have had menses within the
             preceding 24 months, or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization,
             specifically hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy)
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL
             performed during screening, within 48 hours prior to study entry.

          -  All subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process (eg, active attempt
             to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization).

        NOTE: Female candidates who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible. A male
        candidate who has a pregnant female partner is not eligible for the study.

             agree to use at least two non-hormonal forms of contraceptive simultaneously while
             receiving protocol-specified medications, and for 4 weeks after stopping the

                  contraceptive choices listed above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may
                  actually increase the risk of HIV acquisition. Study subjects who are sexually
                  active with HIV-1 negative or unknown HIV-1 serostatus partners should be advised
                  that they need to consider effective strategies for reducing the risk of HIV
                  transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective contraception
                  during their participation in the study. Study subjects should discuss
                  contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care
                  provider.

          -  Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (women who have been post-menopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral
             oophorectomy or salpingectomy or men who have documented azoospermia or undergone
             vasectomy) are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives. Acceptable
             documentation of sterilization and menopause is specified below.

        following:

          -  Physician report/letter

          -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a laboratory

          -  Follicle stimulating hormone-release factor (FSH) measurement elevated into the
             menopausal range as established by the reporting laboratory.
