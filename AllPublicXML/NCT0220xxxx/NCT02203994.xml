  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is the most problematic self-reported secondary medical problem in patients with
      spinal cord injury. It has the potential to negatively influence quality of life through
      restricting activities of daily living. Problematic spasticity can cause pain and fatigue,
      disturb sleep, contribute to the developement of contractures and pressure ulcers, and has a
      negative effect on patients morbidity. For this reason there is enormous interest in
      therapeutic interventions addressing to decrease spasticity in persons with spinal cord
      injury. Recently, studies reported positive effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on
      spasticity in patients with stroke, focal limb dystonia and cerebral palsy. To date, no
      studies are published, assessing the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on focal
      spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a one-time ESWT on lower limb
      spasticity in patients with an incomplete spinal cord injury.
