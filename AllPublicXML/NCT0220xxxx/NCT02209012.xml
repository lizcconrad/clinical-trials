  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of Levulan PDT in
      subjects with multiple actinic keratosis of the upper extremities who received treatment as
      part of the DUSA CP0108 study.

    <description>percentage of subjects who had achieved 100% clearance at Visit 6 (Week 12) in CP0108, that have one or more previously treated (as part of CP0108) AK lesion(s) present in the Treatment Area at any visit during CP0108A follow-up</description>
