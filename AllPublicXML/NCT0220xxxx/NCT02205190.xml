    <textblock>
      After subjects have signed informed consent voluntarily, they go through screening period for
      within 21 days.

      As period I, subjects of 1 Group take fimasartan and rosuvastatin at 1st day and subjects of
      2 Group take fimasartan/rosuvastatin combination at 1st day.

      And then, after wash out for 7 days, as period II, subjects of 1 Group take
      fimasartan/rosuvastatin combination at 8th day and subjects of 2 Group take fimasartan and
      rosuvastatin at 8th day.

      At each period, subjects of 1 Group have blood sampling 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5,
      4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hour after medication(17 times in each period, 34 times in
      total).

      At each period, subjects of 2 Group have blood sampling 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5,
      4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hour after medication(17 times in each period, 34 times in
      total).

          1. Healthy male subject, aged 19- 55 years at screening.

          2. Body weight of ≥ 50 kg and within ± 20% of ideal body weight (IBW)(kg) = {height (cm)
             - 100} * 0.9

             chemistry, urinalysis) and ECG, performed within 3 weeks prior to administration of
             study drug

             administration of study drug

         13. Abnormal diet that may affect absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of
             drugs (*e.g., Grapefruit juice ≥ 1L /day within 7 days prior to administration of
