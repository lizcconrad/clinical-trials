  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to discover whether providing feedback to patients from a device
      that records when and how well a patient uses a Seretide Diskus inhaler will lead to:

        -  Improved compliance with prescribed inhaler use

        -  Improved technique of inhaler use

        -  A reduction in respiratory health related outcomes caused by poor inhaler compliance and
           usage.

        -  An improvement in patient quality of life scores
