      -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of
           sorafenib in combination with FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin/leucovorin/5-fluorouracil) as
           first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer

        -  The design of the study incorporated a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation procedure to guide
           elevation of the sorafenib dosage to the next level
