  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      oral dosing of MLN3126 in ascending doses in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MLN3126 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose in healthy people and to
      assess how MLN3126 is processed by the body. In total, approximately 64 participants will be
      enrolled in the study.

      This study is composed of 2 parts: Part A healthy non-Japanese participants and Part B
      healthy Japanese participants. Each part will consist of 4 Cohorts with 8 participants in
      each Cohort. In each Cohort, 6 participants will receive MLN3126 and 2 participants will
      receive matched placebo within 30 minutes after the start of a standard breakfast. The
      starting dose will be 100 mg followed by doses of 300 mg, 800 mg, and a dose to be determined
      during the study. Progression to the next dose level will only occur if the previous dose
      level was considered to be safe and well tolerated.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 20 days. All participants will be contacted by telephone 7
      days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

      Due to toxicology findings from a long-term animal study, Takeda made the decision to
      terminate this study. No clinically significant safety and/or tolerability issues have been
      observed or reported in participants exposed to MLN3126.
