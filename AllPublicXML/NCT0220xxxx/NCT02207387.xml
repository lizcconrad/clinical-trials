  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of a contingency-based musical walking intervention
      program called Ambulosono on neural mechanisms in the brain. The investigators will
      investigate the long-term impact of Ambulosono on brain plasticity with functional MRI
      technique. Participants will undergo 3 months of Ambulosono training and their pre-training
      and post-training fMRI brain scans will be compared to understand the neural networks and
      brain mechanisms following this intervention. The investigators hypothesized that Ambulosono
      may induce functional compensatory reorganization of neural networks in the brain. This
      project will allow us to address the important potential confound of placebo influence and to
      aid in optimizing this intervention program. Additionally, the investigators are hoping to
      investigate the synergistic effects of rasagiline and exercise; the investigators' hypothesis
      is that there will be a positive synergistic effect, and that exercise will augment the
      effectiveness of rasagiline in treating Parkinson's symptoms.
