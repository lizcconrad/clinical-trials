      This is a Phase 3, open label study administering RBP-7000 in the treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia. Study will assess the long-term safety and tolerability of RBP-7000
      subcutaneous (SC) injections in subjects with schizophrenia and to continue collecting
      clinical outcome data with RBP-7000 SC injections in subjects with schizophrenia using the
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity Illness
      (CGI-S) scale.

      Patients to be screened must be diagnosed with schizophrenia with a designated score based on
      the PANSS, as confirmed by a State, Assessability, Face, Ecological and Rule (SAFER)
      interview. &quot;De novo&quot; patients are patients who are already receiving 3- or 4-mg oral
      risperidone/day and will not have to complete the &quot;run-in&quot; or &quot;conversion&quot; phases (see below)
      and will be assigned to receive RBP-7000 after eligibility has been confirmed. Patients who
      completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy study of RBP-7000 (RB-US-09-0010),
      conducted in patients with acute schizophrenia (referred to as &quot;roll-over&quot; patients) will be
      screened.

      All patients will be assigned the 120 mg dose of RBP-7000, which is subject to a one-time
      down-titration to 90-mg RBP-7000 for tolerability, at the investigator's discretion. Patients
      receiving the 90-mg dose of RBP-7000 who exhibit a worsening in psychiatric symptoms,
      confirmed by a total PANSS score &gt;70 or a 20% increase in the PANSS score from the previous
      assessment at the 120-mg dose level (before the dose was decreased to 90 mg), can receive a
      one-time, up-titration back to 120-mg RBP-7000 at the discretion of the investigator.

      De novo&quot; patients entering into the study are those patients who did not participate in stud
      RB-US-09-0010 and are categorized as &quot;run-in&quot; patients. &quot;Run-in&quot; patients are patients who
      are not already receiving oral risperidone (as no other antipsychotic medications are allowed
      during study participation) and will begin the &quot;run-in-phase&quot;; that is over a 14-day period
      by titrating up to a dose of 3- or 4-mg oral risperidone/day before the first injection of
      RBP-7000, only if clinically indicated. &quot;De novo&quot; &quot;conversion&quot; patients are patients who are
      receiving oral risperidone doses other than 3 or 4mg/day and will begin the oral risperidone
      the oral risperidone &quot;conversion&quot; phase over a seven-day period to achieve an oral
      risperidone dose level of 3 or 4-mg before the first injection of RBP-7000, only if
      clinically indicated.

      &quot;Roll-over&quot; patients entering into the study are patients who completed 56 days of
      double-blind treatment in Study RB-US-09-0010. These patients will be eligible to enter the
      current study provided that continuation of treatment is clinically warranted, as judged by
      the investigator, and that there have been no significant protocol deviations or clinically
      relevant adverse events (AEs) that would preclude inclusion in this study. Roll-over patients
      will not undergo the complete screening process and will not require either a run-in or
      conversion phase with oral risperidone. On Visit 6 (Day 1Â±2 days) of the open-label study
      (Day 57 of Study RB-US-09-0010), patients will receive their first dose (120 mg) of open
      label RBP-7000.

    <description>A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an adverse event AE that either commenced following initiation of investigational medicinal product (IMP) dosing (i.e., RBP-7000) or was present prior to the initiation of the IMP dose, but increased in frequency or severity following initiation of IMP, regardless of causality.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to week 58</time_frame>
    <description>Each item on the PANSS is accompanied by a complete definition as well as detailed anchoring criteria for all 7 rating points, which represent increasing levels of psychopathology: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, =moderate severe, 6=severe, and 7= extreme. The PANSS is scored by summation of ratings across items such that the potential ranges are 7 to 49 for the Positive and Negative Scales and 16 to 112 for the General psychopathology Scale. The Composite Scale is calculated by subtracting the negative scale score from the positive scale score, thus yielding a bipolar index that ranges from -42 to +42.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 up to week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The overall clinical severity of illness for each subject will be rated using the CGI-S scale. To perform this assessment, the rater will answer the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not ill at all; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill patients.</description>
