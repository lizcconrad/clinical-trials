  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research with stored biospecimens can provide substantial societal benefits, including
      greater understanding of cancer etiology and discovery of new cancer therapies, but one
      critical social and ethical issue is the use of samples for research unplanned at the time of
      biospecimen collection. Various models for consent (i.e., no consent, notice, opt-out, broad
      consent, study-specific consent) have been proposed for secondary research use of
      biospecimens, but empirical data on individuals' preferences for different consent models are
      limited, particularly from those with limited health literacy and from racial and ethnic
      minority groups. It is critically important to understand the consent preferences of diverse
      individuals, as participation of all population subgroups in biobanks is essential to reach
      translational cancer research goals. Based on a social ecological conceptual framework, the
      investigators will examine preferences for consent models for secondary research uses of
      biospecimens among a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of women 35 years of age
      and older. The investigators aim to compare experimentally the effect of consent model on
      intentions to donate biospecimens for future research use among a diverse sample of women.
      The investigators hypothesize that women will have stronger intentions to donate based on the
      broad model of consent and the study-specific model of consent compared with the notice model
      of consent. These findings from groups underrepresented in research will be critical since
      the participation of these groups in biobanks is essential to generating findings that will
      achieve translational research goals of eliminating cancer disparities.
