  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether two different types of forearm
      exercise, performed before fistula creation surgery, can improve surgery success and fistula
      maturation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blinded controlled trial to study the impact of handgrip
      exercise prior to surgical creation of hemodialysis fistula on vascular remodelling and
      fistula maturation in chronic kidney disease patients.

    <description>A fistula will be deemed mature if either criterion are met: 1) the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 'rule of six' , or 2) the draining vein diameter is &gt; 4 mm with intra-access flows &gt; 500 ml/min AND an experienced hemodialysis nurse, blinded to group allocation, deems maturation to have occurred.</description>
