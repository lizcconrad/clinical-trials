      Ability Pharmaceuticals promotes a clinical trial to determine the adequate dose of a new
      drug, ABTL0812, that will be administered orally daily to patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/Ib, unicenter, open-label and single-agent study. This study consists of
      two different parts, a dose escalation phase and an extension phase in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      ABTL0812 will be administered orally, daily, for 28 days (considered cycle 1). First endpoint
      is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). MTD is defined as the highest dose at which
      no more than one in six patients experiences a ABTL0812 related Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT).
      DLT will be evaluated during the first treatment cycle.

      Dose escalation phase will be performed with an accelerated design of 3 + 3

      Once the 28 days cycle has finished, patients may continue receiving ABTL0812 on a daily
      continuous schedule if the patient is deemed to have clinical benefit from treatment,
      according to the treating physician. Treatment will continue until disease progression, onset
      of unacceptable drug toxicities, or patient/physician's request to discontinue.

             tumour refractory to standard treatment or for whom no effective therapy exists

          -  Evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version
             1.1 guidelines

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2
