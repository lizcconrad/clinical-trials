  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline (50
      mg/d), administered for 12 weeks, on patients with mild Graves' Orbitopathy (GO).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves'orbitopathy is an autoimmune disease that can be treated by corticosteroids and
      surgery. But they often cause severe side-effects and are usually used for treating
      moderate-sever and sight-threatening GO. Wait and see will be the first choice for the
      patient with mild GO.

      Subantimicrobial dose (SD) doxycycline displays a strong anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory function, which is independent of its antibiotic properties. Data from
      clinical trials demonstrated that SD doxycycline was effective in moderating inflammation in
      a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, rosacea
      and periodontitis.

      We propose to test the effect of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline for mild GO.

    <description>As definition of treatment response, we used four criteria: reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis; improvement of ≥8 degrees in any direction of eye movements; reduction of 2 mm or more in eyelid aperture; improvement in grade of soft tissue swelling. A successful response was defined as an improvement in one or more criteria, in absence of deterioration of any criterion in that observed eye. Deterioration was defined as occurrence of DON, and/or worsening of soft tissue swelling. No success was defined if there was no change or the changes did not reach the success criteria.</description>
