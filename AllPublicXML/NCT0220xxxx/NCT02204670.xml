      Background :

      Regular exercise is a cornerstone in the prevention and the management of comorbidities.
      Unfortunately, the metabolic benefit of exercise training is not universal and varies among
      individuals. A main factor likely to explain the exercise training variability is the lack of
      empirical evidence on the determinants of exercise training. A series of muscle-derived
      cytokines have recently been discovered that (1) are released during exercise and (2) exert
      positive effects on peripheral tissues. Irisin is one of these novel &quot;myokines&quot; and might
      contributes to the metabolic adaptations to exercise training.

      Methods:

      The investigators will perform a pilot cohort study in which obese adolescents will perform
      resistance exercise training for 6 weeks. The main exposure variable will be the acute
      release of irisin during resistance exercise. The main outcome measures will be the change in
      hepatic triglyceride content and glucose area under the curve during a 75g, 2-hour oral
      glucose tolerance test.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary overall hypothesis is that the change in plasma Irisin with a single bout of
      exercise will be associated with the metabolic adaptations to 6 weeks of resistance training,
      specifically, the reductions in hepatic triglyceride content and post-prandial glucose
      excursions, in obese adolescents.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatic triglyceride content will be measured by using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After image acquisition, a single voxel volume of interest will be placed in the upper right lobe of the liver in an area devoid of adipose tissue to acquire 1H spectra. A total of 64 spectra will be collected and averaged to determine the intracellular triglyceride content.</description>

    <description>Overweight adolescents that meet pre-specified enrollment criteria will all undergo supervised resistance exercise for a 6-week period. Prior to training, all participants will undergo a single bout of resistance training to determine the acute release of Irisin with resistance training. This will be the primary exposure variable. After the acute session, all participants will perform resistance training three times per week for a period of 4 weeks. During each session participants will perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions (60-85% of 1RM) for major muscle groups (quadriceps, shoulders, and pectoral).</description>

    <description>We will determine the amount of Irisin secreted after a single bout of resistance exercise. Participants will be stratified into 3 groups based on the degree of Irisin release during this acute bout of resistance exercise. The metabolic adaptations to the 4 weeks of resistance training will be compared between youth stratified according to the amount of Irisin released during the acute bout of resistance exercise.</description>
