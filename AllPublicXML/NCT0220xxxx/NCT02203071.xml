    <textblock>
      Subjects will be selected among the investigators' patient population who are already
      scheduled to receive a marrow stimulating procedure (MSP), with or without the addition of
      BioCartilage.

      During the surgical operation for MSP, a portion of the patient's blood is taken out and used
      to form a patch to cover a cartilage defect of the knee. Currently it is considered standard
      of care to either form the patch using only a portion of the patient's blood, or form the
      patch using a portion of the patient's blood combined with an FDA-approved augmentation such
      as BioCartilage.

      This study will collect outcomes data and MRI for patients that are undergoing MSP with and
      without BioCartilage augmentation, then compare the data between those who received
      BioCartilage and those who did not.

      The primary endpoint is to determine whether subjects receiving a marrow stimulating
      procedure (MSP) augmented with BioCartilage have improved outcomes (measured using quality of
      life indicators, functional outcomes, and MRI) compared to subjects who receive MSP without
      the use of BioCartilage.

    <textblock>
      Recent developments in the treatment of articular cartilage defects have resulted in several
      techniques that involve the stimulation of native cellular components for the purpose of
      differentiation and proliferation in the cartilage defect. Techniques of interest for this
      study are the use of microfracture combined with platelet rich plasma (PRP), and a recently
      developed augmentation of the microfracture procedure-BioCartilage.

      The microfracture procedure is performed with PowerPick. During the procedure, a patient with
      focal cartilage defect undergoes arthroscopic debridement of the defect before microfracture
      is used to create holes in the subchondral plate in order to provide access to mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs). To complete this marrow stimulating procedure (MSP), the microfractured
      region is filled with PRP harvested intraoperatively from the patient. A fibrin glue is then
      used to cover the defect and hold the PRP repair in place.

      This basic MSP has been shown to regenerate cartilage tissue and improve joint function.
      Microfracture treatments using PRP are &quot;shown to have good to excellent short-term outcomes
      in appropriately indicated patients&quot; (Abrams, Mall, Fortier, Roller, &amp; Cole, 2013), however
      successful long-term outcomes have not been demonstrated in the literature.

      BioCartilage, a novel therapy developed by Arthrex Inc, is implemented as an augmentation of
      the basic approach of using microfracture and PRP. All aspects of the procedure, as well as
      indications for the procedure, are the same as the basic MSP described above, except the PRP
      is combined with BioCartilage powder, which acts as a scaffolding for cellular growth.
      BioCartilage is an FDA approved augmentation of microfracture treatment with PRP, and the
      powder itself contains no living cells.

      Animal models using BioCartilage have provided data that supports the assertion that the
      BioCartilage augmentation may improve outcomes for patients who receive it; however there is
      currently no published human clinical outcomes data available for using BioCartilage (Abrams
      et al., 2013).

    <description>The primary endpoint is to determine whether subjects receiving a marrow stimulating procedure (MSP) augmented with BioCartilage have improved outcomes (MRI) compared to subjects who receive MSP without the use of BioCartilage. Quantitative and qualitative MRI assessments of repair tissue will be performed by a musculoskeletal (MSK) radiologist who is blinded to treatment group, and compared for differences between treatment groups.</description>
