  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking rates among individuals with psychiatric disorders are disproportionately higher than
      the general population. The majority of psychiatric hospitals ban smoking on hospital
      grounds, thus providing an opportunity for inpatients to experience abstinence. Yet smokers
      in inpatient psychiatric settings are infrequently provided with referrals for cessation
      treatment on discharge (&lt; 1 %) and most resume smoking upon discharge. Therefore, the
      integration of effective cessation interventions within the current mental health treatment
      system is a public health priority.

      The overall objective of this project is to adapt a Sustained Care (SusC) model to smokers
      with severe mental illness (SMI) engaged in a psychiatric hospitalization and to conduct a
      randomized, pragmatic effectiveness trial designed to assess the benefit of this adapted SusC
      intervention in real-world practice. We will test the hypothesis that, among smokers with SMI
      in inpatient psychiatric treatment (n = 422), SusC will result in significantly greater rates
      of cotinine-validated, 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6- and 12-months compared to a
      group that receives Usual Care (UC) about smoking cessation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that
      a higher proportion of SusC vs. UC patients will use evidence-based smoking cessation
      treatment (counseling and pharmacotherapy) in the month after discharge. We will also explore
      the effect of SusC on health and health care utilization in the 12 months post-discharge
      (psychiatric symptoms, psychiatric and medical hospital readmissions and emergency room
      visits) and the effectiveness of SusC on smoking abstinence in patient diagnostic subgroups.

      The expected outcome of this project is a demonstration of the effectiveness of a Sustained
      Care intervention for smoking cessation in individuals with severe mental illness (SMI)
      following psychiatric hospitalization. Future studies could extend these findings to
      individuals with SMI receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment or psychotherapy. Overall,
      this research would have a significant positive public health impact that will move us closer
      to the long-term goal of dissemination and integration of the Sustained Care model to
      increase smoking cessation and decrease smoking related morbidity and mortality in people
      with severe mental illness.
