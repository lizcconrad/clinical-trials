    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate bioequivalence in the rate and extent of
      absorption between 1600 μg selexipag test drug (administered orally as film-coated tablets of
      1600 μg, twice a day (b.i.d.) and 1600 μg selexipag reference drug (administered orally as 8
      film-coated tablets of 200 μg b.i.d.) at steady-state in healthy male subjects following a
      multiple-dose up-titration scheme.
