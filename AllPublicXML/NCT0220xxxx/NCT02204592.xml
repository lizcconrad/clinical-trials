      The term burnout was coined by psychologist Herbert Freudenberger in 1974 in an article
      entitled &quot;Staff Burnout&quot; in which he discussed job dissatisfaction precipitated by
      work-related stress. A broadly applicable description defines burnout as a state of mental
      and physical exhaustion related to work or care giving activities. A long-standing conceptual
      and operational definition characterized burnout as a triad of emotional exhaustion
      (emotional over extension and exhaustion), depersonalization (negative, callous, and detached
      responses to others), and reduced personal accomplishment (feelings of competence and
      achievement in one's work) In the World Health Organization International Classification of
      Diseases, 10th revision, burnout is defined as a &quot;state of vital exhaustion.&quot; Although no
      specific diagnosis of burnout is mentioned in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, burnout is a clear syndrome with significant consequences.

      Burnout in health care professionals has gained significant attention over the last several
      years. Given the intense emotional demands of the work environment, clinicians are
      particularly susceptible to developing burnout above and beyond usual workplace stress.
      Residency training, in particular, can cause a significant degree of burnout, leading to
      interference with individuals' ability to establish rapport, sort through diagnostic
      dilemmas, and work though complex treatment decision making. Overall, burnout is associated
      with a variety of negative consequences including depression, risk of medical errors, and
      negative effects on patient safety. The goal of this review is to provide medical educators
      and leaders with an overview of the existing factors that contribute to burnout, the impact
      of burnout, inter specialty variation, and suggestions for interventions to decrease burnout.
