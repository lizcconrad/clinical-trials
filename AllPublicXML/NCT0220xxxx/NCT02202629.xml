    <textblock>
      Acute, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, 4 arm crossover study to determine the
      effect of different combinations of plant based extracts on cognitive function and cerebral
      blood flow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the effects of oral consumption of three differing
      combinations of plant based extracts, on cognitive function and cerebral blood flow (using
      Near infrared Spectroscopy) in comparison to placebo. The primary outcome will be change in
      cognitive function and mental fatigue during extended performance of the Cognitive Demand
      Battery (CDB) at 1, 3 and 6 hours post- consumption.
