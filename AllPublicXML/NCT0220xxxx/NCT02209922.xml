    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      The incidence of stroke in low-to-middle income countries is increasing .Balance impairment
      and falling negatively impact function of stroke patients. Mobility is based on successful
      postural control and about 30% of individuals with stroke are unable to ambulate without
      assistance.Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a new promising tool for motor
      recovery in neurological disease.This can be addressed through a tDCS intervention.

      Objective:The objectives of this study is to examine the efficacy of anodal tDCS combined
      with Biodex balance training on postural control in chronic stroke patients using laboratory
      and clinical assessments. The following essential treatment components; a) active tDCS
      stimulation paired with Biodex balance training, b)sham tDCS paired with Biodex balance
      training program.

      To identify combinations effects of tDCS stimulation plus balance training . Hypothesis:
      Anodal tDCS targeting leg motor area (CZ) for 5-days plus Biodex balance training, will
      significantly improve stroke clients' balance and functional mobility.

      Double blinded sham -controlled randomized tDCS stimulation Arms Assigned Interventions

      Experimental: Arm 1

      tDCS brain stimulation and simultaneous balance training

      Participants underwent Active tDCS brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance
      training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days.

      No Intervention: Arm 2 Sham tDCS brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance
      training

      Participants underwent tDCS(2mA) brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance
      training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days, All outcome measures will be measured in 4 time
      points: pre-test, post-test after 10 sessions of intervention, and after 1 week and 1 months
      post intervention as follow ups.
