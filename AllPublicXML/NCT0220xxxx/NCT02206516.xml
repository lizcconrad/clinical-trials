      This study aims at combining imaging techniques and clinical evaluations to assess clinical
      change as well as brain changes that occur as a result of brain stimulation in adult
      attention deficit disorder.

      This study will use clinical measures and cognitive tasks covering 3 different functional
      domains during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) and
      Ultrasound tagged near infrared spectroscopy (UT-NIRS), to assess functional brain changes as
      a result of a treatment protocol with Transcaranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in
      adults suffering from attention deficit disorder (ADD).
