  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major cause of disability and falls and
      responds often incompletely to conventional therapy. The pathogenesis remains largely unknown
      and therapeutic alternatives are needed. Rehabilitative interventions that consist of
      learning cognitive strategies with sensory cueing to prevent and to overcome FOG represent
      the most efficacious intervention, but difficulties in learning and execution of these
      cognitive strategies are the main cause of failure. Transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) enhances motor task learning and execution in patients with PD and might enhance the
      efficacy of rehabilitative interventions.

      This study intends to address the following question whether tDCS can enhance the efficacy of
      rehabilitative interventions in the treatment of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease?

    <description>All patients will undergo a rehabilitation therapy intervention (2x a week for 4 weeks = 8 intervention sessions) with simultaneous sham or active tDCS. The trained physiotherapist will follow a standardized program with checklist. Each of the 8 training session will last approximately 45min. The rehabilitative interventions include:
cognitive training: attentional strategies (mental counting, mental obstacle)
transfer training: everyday activities
motor training (walking) with sensory cueing (visual, acoustic, cane, ball) The rehabilitation therapy is divided into two sessions both including a 5 minutes warm-up and the learning of cueing and movement strategies based on different modalities (cognitive, visual, tactile and auditory).</description>
