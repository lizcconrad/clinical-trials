      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Lotus™ Valve
      System and LOTUS Edge™ Valve System for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in
      symptomatic subjects with calcific, severe native aortic stenosis who are considered at
      extreme or high risk for surgical valve replacement.
