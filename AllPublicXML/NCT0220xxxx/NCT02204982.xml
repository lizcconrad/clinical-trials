      A study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IPI 145 administered in combination with
      rituximab vs placebo in combination with rituximab in patients with previously treated
      CD20-positive follicular lymphoma who are not suitable candidates for chemotherapy.

      Study IPI-145-08 is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of IPI-145 in combination with rituximab vs placebo in combination with rituximab in
      subjects with previously treated CD20-positive follicular lymphoma.

      Approximately 400 subjects will receive 25 mg of IPI-145 or placebo, orally BID for 28 day
      continuous cycles, in combination with 375 mg/m2 of Rituximab given once weekly for 4 weeks
      during Cycle 1 and then once on Day 1 of Cycles 4, 6, 8, and 10. Patients will remain on
      treatment for up to 27 cycles and may continue treatment if clinical benefit is observed.
