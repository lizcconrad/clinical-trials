      Primary Objective:

      To compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of single doses of insulin glargine given
      as U200 and U500 with those of a single dose (SD) of Lantus® U100 in a euglycemic clamp
      setting in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare the metabolic activity characteristics of single doses of insulin glargine given
      as U200 and U500 with those of a single dose of Lantus® U100 in a euglycemic clamp setting in
      subjects with type 1 diabetes.

      To assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of U200, U500 and Lantus® U100 in
      subjects with type 1 diabetes.
