    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited from the participants in the Union and Mecklenburg County Living
      Room Visits. Participants in the Living Room Visit will have been recruited using community
      event flyers. During the Living Room Visits, the Health Educator will provide a general
      overview of the study. Individuals who are interested in participating in the study will then
      be generally screened for eligibility by the Protocol Coordinator who will then proceed to
      provide informed consent to potential subjects.

      In an effort to increase early detection of breast cancer our program is designed to remove
      some of the most common barriers faced by uninsured Latino women including lack of breast
      health knowledge and inability to pay for screening. The Levine Cancer Institute offers
      breast cancer education and screening in the growing Latino populations of both Mecklenburg
      and Union Counties through educational programs known as &quot;Living Room Visits.&quot; Living Room
      Visits are educational sessions hosted at a participant's house that will be led by a
      Carolinas Healthcare System (CHS) certified bilingual health educator. At least 250 women
      will participant in the educational sessions between both counties with each session hosting
      12-15 participants. Of those women participating in Living Room Visits, those interested will
      be individually informed of the research opportunity and provided informed consent before
      being asked to take a pre-test survey. After the educational session, subjects who consented
      to the study will also complete a post-test survey. Three months after each Living Room
      Visit, subjects will also be called to complete another post-test survey to assess
      educational retention. Phone calls and post-test surveys will be administered by
      Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) trained CHS certified bilingual
      employees only. Analysis of the pre and post-intervention surveys will be administered by a
      CHS statistician using de-identified data.
