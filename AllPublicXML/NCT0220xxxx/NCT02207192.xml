  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural changes are known to affect normal lung volumes. A reduction in sitting to supine
      functional residual capacity (FRC) is well-described in non-obese subjects adopting a supine
      position. However, postural changes in lung volumes in the obese require further exploration.
      We aimed to longitudinally address the effects of weight loss on postural changes in lung
      volumes and pulmonary function, in obesity. We tested the hypothesis that supine reduction in
      FRC would be absent in morbid obesity and recovered upon weight loss.
