  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that for people with moderate to severe multiple sclerosis postural
      balance and walking improve and the risk of accidental falls are reduced after participating
      in a specific training intervention of 7 weeks. The hypothesis is also the the effect remain
      a further 7 weeks post training.

      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is disease affecting the central nervous system. Walking and postural
      balance are often affected early in the course of the disease. The risk of falls is large.
      Many persons with MS have decreased trunk stability compared to healthy persons . In an
      earlier study including people with mild to moderate MS we found that a period of core
      stability exercises reduced the risk of falls. In this study the training concept will be
      applied for persons with more severe walking limitations.
