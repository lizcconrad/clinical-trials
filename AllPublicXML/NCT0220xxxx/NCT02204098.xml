  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out about the safety of injecting the gene
      (DNA) for mammaglobin-A into people with breast cancer. The DNA used in this study was
      purified from bacteria and contains the gene for mammaglobin-A. Mammaglobin-A is a protein
      that is highly expressed by breast cancer cells. Injection of mammaglobin-A DNA may be a way
      to generate an immune response to breast cancer cells. There is evidence that an immune
      response may be a way to fight cancer. In addition to evaluating the safety of the
      mammaglobin-A injection, this study is also looking at the immune response that the
      participant's body has after each injection.

             menses for &lt;1 year with FSH and estradiol levels in postmenopausal range, according to
             institutional standards. Premenopausal women, verified by: (1) regular menses, or (2)
             FSH and estradiol levels in premenopausal range, according to institutional standards.

          -  Able to understand, and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be ineligible for inclusion in this study if ANY of the following criteria
        apply:

          -  Received any of the following for treatment of this cancer (except for the neoadjuvant
             endocrine therapy specified within this protocol):

               -  Surgery

               -  Radiation therapy

               -  Chemotherapy

               -  Biotherapy

               -  Hormonal therapy

               -  Investigational agent

          -  Receiving any other investigational agent(s) or has received an investigational agent
             within the last 30 days.

          -  Known metastatic disease.

          -  Known allergy, or history of serious adverse reaction to vaccines such as anaphylaxis,
             hives, or respiratory difficulty.

          -  Prior axillary lymph node sampling (sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node
             dissection). FNA of axillary lymph node is acceptable.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Prior or currently active autoimmune disease requiring management with
             immunosuppression. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis,
             Crohn's disease, systemic vasculitis, scleroderma, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis,
             hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, or other rheumatologic disease
             or any other medical condition or use of medication (e.g., corticosteroids) which
             might make it difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or
             to generate an immune response to vaccines. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease that does not require daily systemic corticosteroids is acceptable. Any
             patients receiving steroids should be discussed with the PI to determine if eligible.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. A negative serum or pregnancy test is required no more than
             7 days before study entry, and patients must be willing to employ adequate
             contraception. Women of childbearing potential must use two forms of contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation.

          -  Known HIV-positive status. These patients are ineligible because of the potential
             inability to generate an immune response to vaccines.

          -  Subjects with a strong likelihood of non-adherence such as difficulties in adhering to
             follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the Siteman Cancer Center should
             not knowingly be registered.

          -  Individuals in whom a skinfold measurement of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue
             for the eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm

          -  Individuals in whom the ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible
             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art

          -  Therapeutic or traumatic metal implant in the skin or muscle of either deltoid region.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or
             hepatic or renal functional abnormality as determined by the investigator based on
             medical history, physical examination, EKG, and/or laboratory screening test

          -  Any chronic or active neurologic disorder, including seizures and epilepsy, excluding
             a single febrile seizure as a child

          -  Syncopal episode within 12 months of screening

          -  Current use of any electronic stimulation device, such as cardiac demand pacemakers,
             automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator, nerve stimulators, or deep brain
             stimulators.
