  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young athletes are usually regarded as a special subgroup of healthy individuals with a
      unique lifestyle who are apparently invulnerable and often capable of extraordinary physical
      achievement. Most athletic disciplines to some extent combine endurance and strength modes of
      physical conditioning. Acute responses to endurance exercise training include substantial
      increases in maximal oxygen uptake, cardiac output, stroke volume, and systolic blood
      pressure in-spite of this, high intensity chronic training such as marathons, very long
      distance bicycle racing etc., can lead to transient acute volume overload of the atria and
      right ventricle, with transient reductions in right ventricular ejection fraction and
      elevations of cardiac biomarkers. Although these biomarkers generally normalize back within
      seven to ten days, these transient changes may sooner or later mark the beginning of
      processes like patchy myocardial fibrosis finally leading to grave chronic heart diseases .

      Inspite of the awareness regarding the cardio vascular risk in the athletes, there have been
      no new advancements in finding an alternate option which can protect the cardio vascular
      system in the athletes.

      Hence in order to address the need of the hour and also to avoid the cardio vascular risk in
      athletes along with improvising the endurance capacity, Enovate Biolife is in the process of
      development of an innovative product &quot;E-OJ-01&quot;.

      E-OJ-01 is expected to have beneficial effects on the cardio vascular system of the athletes
      by enhancing ejection fraction which in turn improves cardiac output. This finally is
      hypothysed to increase the maximal oxygen uptake capacity in athletes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male athletes aged 18 - 40 years having endurance exercise not less than 3-4 hrs. /
             week since at least last 12 weeks.

          -  Subject with left ventricular ejection fraction not less than 55% and not more than
             70%.

          -  Subjects having body fat less than 16% as determined by skin fold assessment.

          -  Subject is willing to refrain from vigorous physical activity 12 hrs prior to clinic
             visit.

          -  Subject is a non-alcoholic/ non-smoker.

          -  Subject understands the study procedures and signs forms providing informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Left Ventricular Ejection fraction less than 55 per cent by echocardiogram.

          -  Subjects suffering from anemia as defined by Hb levels ≤ 10 g/ dl.

          -  Subject has uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg) as defined by the average blood pressure measured at
