      In this study it's aimed to evaluated the patients in whom dental local anesthetic attempts
      were failed due to anxiety or fear and referred to our clinic for tooth extraction with deep
      sedation. All patients dates will evaluate from their patient file retrospectively from 2011
      to 2014.

      Majority of dental treatments can be performed under local anesthesia. However, this is not
      always possible for pediatric non-cooperated patients with severe anxiety. In these patients,
      unpleasant dental experiences may lead to development of dental phobia when they become
      adults . Therefore, it is important to eradicate anxiety, and to prevent a possible
      psychological trauma in pediatric patients. For this purpose, psychological and medical
      methods have been applied to increase patient compliance. It has been proven that general
      anesthesia especially prevents dental phobia in elderly, and increases the quality of life
      related to oral health. In this study we aimed to evaluated the patients in whom dental local
      anesthetic attempts were failed due to anxiety or fear and referred to our clinic for tooth
      extraction with deep sedation. All patients dates will evaluate from their patient file
      retrospectively from 2011 to 2014.
