  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the trial is to compare the influence of MICARDIS® (telmisartan) and
      COZAAR® / LORZAAR® (losartan) in lowering ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during
      the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval as measured by ABPM. Secondary objectives
      include evaluations of: 1) change from baseline in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) during
      the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval as measured by ABPM, 2) changes from baseline
      in SBP and DBP during other periods during the 24-hour ABPM profile, 3) changes from baseline
      in mean seated trough SBP and DBP as measured by manual cuff sphygmomanometer, and 4)
      responder rates based on both ABPM and trough cuff blood pressure
