  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a diabetic foot ulcer that is older than 4 weeks and has been treated with
      physician-selected standard of care treatment such as debridement, hydrogel or saline
      irrigation, primary dressing, and offloading will be randomized into one of two groups, the
      Standard of Care (SoC) or APIC-PRP + SoC. APIC-PRP has high level of platelets that produce
      growth factors that can help in wound healing.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior to the first clinical intervention, a signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) and
             Data Consent Form (DCF) must be obtained from the subject or legal representative

          -  Diagnosed with insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetes (Type I or II,
             respectively), requiring medical treatment as determined by the physician

          -  Subjects will have only one diabetic foot ulcer on the target limb (referred to as the
             Index Ulcer)

          -  The Index Ulcer, classified using the University of Texas Wound Classification System
             (Appendix 7), is located on the dorsal, plantar, medial, or lateral aspect of the foot
             or heel (including all toe surfaces)

          -  Debrided ulcer size between 1 cm2 and 4 cm2. See Appendix 3 for instructions on wound
             area measurement

          -  DFU with a duration ≥ 1 month at first visit

          -  The target ulcer is free of clinical signs of infection, identified by inflammation
             (redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, or pain) or purulent exudates (Lipsky et al,
             2012).

          -  The patient meets Medicare/Medicaid eligibility requirements. Subject's ulcer extends
             through the dermis and into subcutaneous tissue (granulation tissue may be present)
             but without exposure of muscle, tendon, bone or joint capsule.

          -  Post-debridement, subject's wound is free of necrotic debris and appears to be made up
             of healthy vascularized tissue.

          -  Demonstrated adequate offloading regimen.

          -  Subject has adequate circulation to the study foot as evidenced by a Doppler measured
             ankle-bronchial index (ABI) of ≥ 0.7 after 10 minutes of rest

          -  Age &gt;18 years old at the time the informed consent is signed

          -  Female subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to the first treatment

          -  Subject must be willing to comply with the Protocol, which will be assessed by
             enrolling clinician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has inadequate venous access the blood draw required for APIC-PRP
             Administration. Subjects with PIC or IV access are preferred.

          -  Hemoglobin of less than 12 g/dL

          -  Inadequate amount of blood drawn to produce sufficient APIC-PRP. One complete APIC-PRP
             preparation requires 114ml of blood drawn per APIC-PRP preparation.

          -  Subject's ulcer has increased in size by &gt;50% during the run-in Screening period.

          -  If the subject's ulcer healed by 25% or more during the run-in Screening period they
             will be excluded.

          -  Presence of another wound that is concurrently treated and might interfere with
             treatment of the index wound by APIC-PRP (malignancy in nearby wound)

          -  Ulcer not of DFU pathophysiology (e.g., venous, vasculitic, radiation, rheumatoid,
             collagen vascular disease, pressure, or arterial etiology)

          -  The target ulcer demonstrates underlying osteomyelitis, defined as infection in the
             bone, identified by Fever, chills, or pain in the infected bone. Any exposed bone will
             be classified as osteomyelitis.

          -  Subject has a history of bleeding disorder.

          -  Any malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer requiring treatment with
             immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy or corticosteroids less
             than 30 days before enrolment.

          -  Subject has gangrene present on any part of the affected limb. Subject's ulcer is over
             a Charcot deformity of the mid-foot (&quot;Rocker-Bottom Foot&quot;) or over the tarsal
             bones-talus, distal calcaneus, navicular, and cuboid.

          -  Subject's ulcer has tunnels or sinus tracts that cannot be completely debrided.

          -  Subject has severe malnutrition as evidenced by albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dL. A previous serum
             albumin test that is &lt;6 weeks old is sufficient for this criteria.

          -  Subject has Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), liver disease, aplastic anemia,
             scleroderma, malignancy, cellulitis, suspected osteomyelitis or other evidence of
             systemic infection, or is Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive.

          -  Subject has any elective osseous procedures to the study foot within 30 days prior to
             the Initial Visit.

          -  Subject is on dialysis.

          -  Subjects who are cognitively impaired and therefore can not give consent, and do not
             have a healthcare proxy

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, represent poor medical,
             psychological or psychiatric risks for whom therapy with an investigational product
             would be unwise.
