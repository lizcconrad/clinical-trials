  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would test how much of the new drug, AZD1775, is present in tumor, blood, and skin
      after one dose of the drug.

      The purpose of the study is not to treat the tumor, but to see if the drug actually gets into
      the tumor cells. This study does not replace routine cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be administered one dose of AZD1775 prior to surgical resection of their tumor.
      There will be 2 portions of this trial, referred to as Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 will involve
      a dose escalation strategy where 3 separate doses (100, 200, and 400mg) will be evaluated.
      Each dose cohort will involve 4 patients. Surgery, with tissue harvest for determination of
      both tissue drug level and biomarker evaluation, will occur at 8 hrs post drug
      administration.

      Part 2 will determine the potential tumor drug level and PD effects at various time intervals
      after drug administration of a single select drug dose. Currently, we are planning to use a
      dose (200 mg) that has been deemed safe when used in combination with cytotoxic therapy.
      However, if results from Part 1 suggest an alternate dose may be preferable, we will consider
      using that alternate dose in Part 2. Dosing will be followed by surgical resection at 2-4 hrs
      and at 22-26 hrs post dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with 1 prior resection of histologically-diagnosed de novo GBM

          2. Patient must have MRI evidence of disease recurrence

          3. Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2

          4. Patients ≥ 18 years of age

          6. Patients must not have co-morbid condition(s) that, at the opinion of the
             investigator, prevent safe surgical treatment

          7. Patients must not have active infection or fever &gt; 38.5°C
