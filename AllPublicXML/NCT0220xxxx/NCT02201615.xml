      Objective To examine the effects of perineal massage applied during the action of birth on
      the frequency of episiotomy procedures, perineal tearing and the duration of the second stage
      of birth.

      Methods The present study was a randomized controlled experimental. Women (284 women) were
      informed on the study and provided their written consent. 10-minute perineal massage with
      glycerine was applied to the women in the test group for 4 times during the first stage and 1
      time in the second stage of birth. The women in the control group received the routine care
      procedure at the clinic.

      Results According to the study findings, 31% of the women in the test group and 69.7% of the
      women in the control group were made subject to episiotomy (p&lt;0.05). In the test and control
      group 9.2%, 2.4% of the women developed spontaneous perineal laceration (p&gt;0.05). The average
      duration of the action of birth was 25.33 minutes in the test group and 28.18 minutes in the
      control group (p&lt;0.05).

      Conclusion The study results indicate that perineal massage applied during the action of
      birth decreased the rate of episiotomy procedure and shortened the duration of the second
      stage of birth.
