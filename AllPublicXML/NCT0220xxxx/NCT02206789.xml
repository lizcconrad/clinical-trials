      Aim/ Objective: Study consists of 2 separate and distinct entities A. Evaluation of the
      efficacy of 2% cyclosporine in preventing graft rejection in primary grafts w/o high risk
      characteristics study 1 (PKP study) B. Evaluation of the efficacy of 2% cyclosporine in
      preventing graft rejection in therapeutic keratoplasty- study 2(TKP study) Materials &amp;
      Methods: In both arms Patients requiring keratoplasty, above the age of 18 whom
      satisfactorily meet The inclusion criteria are different for each study Eligible candidates
      will be enrolled after signing an Informed Consent form Patients will be randomized into one
      of 2 groups

        -  Only on topical steroids group A

        -  On topical steroids + 2% cyclosporine Group B Study design: Prospective, randomized
           non-blinded study at a single centre. Methodology In both arms

           1. Schedule of topical steroid administration : 6 times for 2 weeks; 5 times for 2
           weeks; 4 times for a month; 3 times for a month, and, subsequently twice-a-day until 1
           year is completed Systemic steroids may be administered in the initial 2 weeks at the
           discretion of the investigators. (For all patients with fungal keratitis topical
           steroids can preferrably be administered only after 2 weeks post keratoplasty.) Until
           then voveran ophtha may be used

           3. Patients randomized to receive 2% cyclosporine will receive the same 3 times a day
           for 2years

           4. All patients will be followed for a minimum period of 2 years

           5. Follow up schedule - at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, then every 3
           months until 2 years are completed

           6. All episodes of graft rejection will be treated as per accepted norms and the patient
           will no longer follow the standardized protocol for steroid administration

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  FOR ARM 1

        Age greater than 18 years

        Vision more than 6/60 in the fellow eye.

        No prior keratoplasty

        Not more than 1 quadrant of corneal vascularisation

        No peripheral anterior synechiae.

        No active ocular surface disease (VKC, dry eye,)

        Uncontrolled uveitis or glaucoma

        No limbal stem cell failure.

        No Prior h/o HSV

        Primarily patients with dystrophies, degenerations and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and
        non vascularised non herpetic corneal scars will be enrolled

        ARM 2:

        Inclusion criteria as above &amp;

        Those patients with medically unresponsive keratitis with no limbal involvement and in whom
        the graft size can be restricted to less than 9mm will be included in the study. This is to
        ensure that postoperative issues such as synechiae, recurrence of infection and
        uncontrolled glaucoma do not affect the study. Grafts must also be clear at the end of one
        month after surgery for patients to continue in the study..

        Expected Outcome

          1. Incidence of graft rejection in both arms.

          2. secondary outcome Recovery from graft rejection in both arms.

          3. Secondary outcomes- incidence of glaucoma and cataract.

          4. secondary outcome Incidence of graft rejection in patients maintained only on
             cyclosporine after 1year.

          5. It is expected that patients receiving cyclosporine will have a lesser incidence of
             graft rejection and exhibit faster recovery. The efficacy of long term prophylaxis of
             only cyclosporine in preventing graft rejection will also be evaluated.

        Exclusion Criteria:Any condition that would increase the risk of non-rejection graft
        failure such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, xerophthalmia or severe exposure keratitis.
        Schirmer's test â‰¤ 5 mm in 1 minute Clinical evidence of limbal stem cell deficiency History
        of or active herpes simplex virus keratitis or other acute corneal infection
