  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence is one of the most salient predictors of patient outcomes in the era
      following development of effective treatment for HIV infection. Evolving strategies to
      improve adherence, specifically incentive interventions and real-time medication monitoring,
      have shown some success in limited studies. Further investigation into incentive
      interventions for HIV-infected adolescents with poor medication adherence is necessary.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To describe the effects of a novel incentive intervention model on HIV-infected youths'
           patterns of antiretroviral medication adherence.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of an outpatient incentive intervention model.

        -  To assess participant satisfaction with the incentive intervention model.

        -  To evaluate the effect of an outpatient incentive intervention model on targeted health
           behaviors (numbers of missed appointments and STI diagnoses).

        -  To measure the effect of the incentive intervention on HIV viral load and CD4+ count.

        -  To determine the overall and per patient cost of the incentive intervention model.

        -  To describe associations between adherence measures: real-time medication monitor data,
           pharmacy pill count, pharmacy prescription pick-up data, medication possession ratio,
           and self-report.

      Upon enrollment, participants will receive education and a real-time medication monitor.
      Participants will be followed monthly in the clinic and will be prescribed thirty-day
      supplies of medication. During weeks 1-4 participants will establish a baseline with the
      real-time medication monitor. During weeks 5-28, participants will receive remote incentives
      based on their level of medication adherence as measured by the real-time medication monitor.
      Additional lottery-style incentives will occur at regular follow-up visits. No incentives
      will be applied during weeks 29-48. Participants will complete the protocol at the week 48
      visit.
