  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicenter study to determine the difference in
      post-operative anastomotic leak rate in low anterior resection procedures where colon and
      rectal tissue perfusion is evaluated using PINPOINT as an adjunct to standard surgical
      practice compared to surgical procedures performed according to standard surgical practice
      alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Be undergoing open, or minimally invasive LAR for the treatment of a rectal or
             rectosigmoid neoplasm (Subjects with rectal or rectosigmoid neoplasm(s) may be treated
             with or without neoadjuvant therapy. Long-course neoadjuvant therapy must have been
             completed ≥6 weeks prior to LAR surgery (Day 0).

          -  Have a planned low circular stapled or transanally hand sewn anastomosis ≤10 cm from
             the anal verge.

          -  Have a colorectal or coloanal reconstruction with or without reservoir/pouch.

          -  Subjects who are women of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating,
             must have a negative pregnancy test at Day 0.

          -  Have signed an approved informed consent form for the study.

          -  Be willing to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Undergoing stapled anastomosis with the use of an experimental or non-FDA approved
             stapler.

          -  Undergoing ileoanal reconstruction, total colectomy or proctocolectomy,
             abdominoperineal resection, Hartmann's procedure, Hartmann's reversal or multiple
             synchronous colon resections (e.g., LAR and concomitant right colectomy).

          -  Has received and completed a course of pelvic radiotherapy ≥ 6 months prior to LAR
             surgery (Day 0).

          -  Has previously undergone a left sided colon resection.

          -  Has previously undergone a rectal resection.

          -  Has recurrent rectal or rectosigmoid cancer.

          -  Has a diagnosis of locally advanced rectal or rectosigmoid cancer undergoing extended
             en bloc operations.

          -  Has a diagnosis of Stage IV rectal or rectosigmoid cancer with any multifocal
             metastases or single site metastasis with tumor size of &gt; 2 cm (Intraoperative
             incidental finding or preoperative suspicion of Stage IV cancer with isolated (single
             site) metastasis (≤ 2 cm) or limited metastases (≤3), with largest lesion ≤ 2 cm in
             size, does not exclude the subject).

          -  Has a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Subjects with rectal or
             rectosigmoid cancer neoplasms and IBD are excluded.

          -  Has hepatic dysfunction defined as Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score &gt;12.

          -  Renal dysfunction defined as creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL.

          -  Has known allergy or history of adverse reaction to ICG, iodine or iodine dyes.

          -  Has, in the Investigator's opinion, any medical condition that makes the subject a
             poor candidate for the investigational procedure, or interferes with the
             interpretation of study results.

          -  Is actively participating in another investigational clinical study which, in the
             Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion, would interfere in this study.
