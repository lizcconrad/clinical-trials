      The purpose of this study is to evaluate bioinduction of new tissue and tendon healing after
      implantation of the Rotation Medical Bioinductive Implant used as either a standalone device
      or adjunct to surgical repair in the treatment of supraspinatus tendon tears.

             anchors) with the bioinductive implant; (B) Medium or large full-thickness tear
             primarily of the supraspinatus tendon planned for treatment with the bioinductive
             implant adjunctive to surgical repair
