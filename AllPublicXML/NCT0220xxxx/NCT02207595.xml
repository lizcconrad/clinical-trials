                  salpingectomy), or

               3. Congenitally sterile

                  administration

        When in doubt, the Investigator should confer with the Sponsor's Study Physician.

          -  Subject has a history of positive TB test or evidence of possible TB or latent TB
             infection at the Screening Visit (QuantiFERON® Gold Test)
