      Although induced hypertension decreased SVV and PPV,the influences of stroke volume variation
      and pulse pressure variation caused by phenylephrine,dopamine and ephedrine were unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) during mechanical
      ventilation have been shown to be effective parameters to predict preload responsiveness.
      Although induced hypertension decreases PPV and SVV, the influences of phenylephrine,
      dopamine and ephedrine on PPV and SVV are unknown.
