  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness, risk factors, and complications
      associated with use of supraglottic airway devices for primary airway maintenance during
      routine anesthesia in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the efficacy of supraglottic airway (SGA) use in children in a
      tertiary care Children's Hospital.

      Observational data regarding the type of SGA, experience level of practitioner, placement
      technique, number of placement attempts or placement failure, device failure, and cause of
      any related peri-operative complications will be prospectively collected.

      The data collected in this study will allow the investigators to assess the overall safety
      and efficacy of SGA use in various medical and surgical procedures performed under general
      anesthesia in children.
