    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of Tacrolimus,
      Methotrexate and Tocilizumab (Tac/MTX/Toc) in preventing graft versus host disease (GVHD)
      after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation compared to a contemporary control
      cohort selected from the Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)
      that is treated with standard methotrexate and tacrolimus for GVHD prevention. The control
      group of patients will satisfy similar eligibility requirements as the patients enrolled in
      the clinical trial and they will be matched for relevant clinical variables (age, sex,
      conditioning regimen, disease, graft source, etc).

      Patients enrolled in the clinical trial will receive tacrolimus per institutional guidelines
      at doses to maintain therapeutic levels and continued until at least Day 90 post transplant.
      Methotrexate will be dosed at 15 mg/m2 Day +1 and 10mg/m2 Days +3, +6 and +11. Tocilizumab
      will be administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg at Day -1.

      Ancillary Study:

      The ancillary study will evaluate whether tocilizumab is effective at positively impacting
      mood, fatigue, sleep, and pain in a group of individuals undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation as compared to individuals not receiving tocilizumab. We will also
      assess whether tocilizumab alters gene expression and Rap1 prenylation in a manner that may
      reduce further progression or relapse of cancer after transplant.
