  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will aim to evaluate the correlation between changes in ultrasound velocity and
      measures of hydration status including urine specific gravity, plasma and urine osmolality in
      male and female young adults after undergoing an acute dehydration and rehydration. The study
      will also test the hypothesis that body dehydration is a generalized physiological process
      equally affected all body muscles by comparing the data obtained on calf and biceps muscles.
