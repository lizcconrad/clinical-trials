    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well high-dose aldesleukin and ipilimumab works in treating
      patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Biological therapies,
      such as aldesleukin, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop
      tumor cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving high-dose aldesleukin together with
      ipilimumab may work better in treating patients with melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The best overall response rate within the first 24 weeks of combination interleukin (IL)-2
      (aldesleukin) and ipilimumab using the immune-related response criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Best overall response (BOR). II. Progression-free survival (PFS). III. Disease control
      rate (DCR). IV. Overall survival. V. To collect data on the safety and feasibility of
      combined high-dose IL-2 and ipilimumab.

      VI. To evaluate the cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+ T cell response in the tumor
      microenvironment and peripheral blood of patients treated on this study.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 22, 43,
      and 64 and high-dose aldesleukin IV on days 22-26 and 43-47.

      MAINTENANCE: Beginning on weeks 24, patients without disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 12 weeks for up to 24 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 36 months.
