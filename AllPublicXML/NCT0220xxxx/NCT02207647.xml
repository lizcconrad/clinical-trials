  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of all emergency room patients, persons presenting with encephalitis/meningitis syndrome of a
      potentially infectious nature are among those of greatest concern. Routine clinical and
      laboratory evaluation of such patients involves screening for known infectious disease
      agents, selection of which is nonstandardized. Progress in diagnostic technologies,
      especially molecular techniques based on genetic characteristics of potential pathogens, has
      greatly expanded the investigators capacity to evaluate specimens from patients for a much
      wider range of potential pathogens (bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic agents). Use of
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology offers the possibility of identifying causative
      agents for the approximately 50% of all such presentations which go un-diagnosed. The
      investigators propose a study involving a collaboration between the EMERGEncy ID NET, a
      network of 10 geographically diverse university-affiliated urban emergency departments
      (coordinated by Olive View-UCLA Medical Center) and the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC), to use these new technologies to address this issue.

        This study will be conducted by the Emergency ID Net Study group (P.I. David Talan), which
        consists of a network of 10 emergency departments in university-affiliated hospitals
        throughout the United States.
