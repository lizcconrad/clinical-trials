    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the effect of vapendavir daily doses of
      528 mg daily (QD) and 264 mg twice daily (BID) on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      midazolam, a cytochrome (CYP) 3A4 substrate. Additionally, the effect of midazolam on the PK
      profile of vapendavir, a PK profile comparison of vapendavir in males and females, as well as
      the safety of vapendavir will also be assessed.

    <time_frame>End of Study (up to 46 weeks in duration)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of vapendavir daily dose of 264 mg BID on the PK profile of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate. The primary outcome will be evaluated through a series of analyses of PK parameters including:
for midazolam including maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)
time at which Cmax was observed (Tmax)
plasma concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ctau)
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable plasma concentration (AUC0-last)
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the end of the dosing interval (AUC0-tau)
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf)
elimination half-life (t1/2)
apparent oral clearance (CL/F)
apparent oral volume of distribution (Vz/F).</description>

    <description>To evaluate whether the PK profile of vapendavir, is affected by the presence of midazolam, a strong CYP3A4 substrate. This outcome will be evaluated through a series of analyses of PK parameters for vapendavir including:
maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)
time at which Cmax was observed (Tmax)
plasma concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ctau)
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable plasma concentration (AUC0-last)

    <description>To evaluate the safety of vapendavir. This will be accomplished by assessing adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (including blood chemistry, hematology with differential and urinalysis), physical exams, ECG assessments, vital sign assessments and concomitant medications.</description>
