      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical validity of the minoxidil
      response in-vitro diagnostic kit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical minoxidil is the only US FDA approved drug used for the treatment of AGA in females.
      While topical minoxidil exhibits a good safety profile, the efficacy in the overall
      population remains relatively low i.e., 30-40% re-grow hair. To observe significant
      improvement in hair growth, minoxidil is typically used once daily for a period of at least
      24 weeks. Due to the significant time commitment and low response rate, a diagnostic test to
      identify non-responders prior to initiating therapy would be advantageous.

      Minoxidil is converted in the scalp to its active form, minoxidil sulfate, by the
      sulfotransferase enzyme SULT1A1. The enzyme expression is variable among individuals. We have
      demonstrated in two prior feasibility studies that the SULT1A1 enzyme activity in plucked
      hair follicles correlates with minoxidil response in the treatment of AGA and thus can server
      as a predictive biomarker.

      Consequently, we developed a minoxidil response in-vitro diagnostic kit intended to identify
      non-responders prior to initiating therapy with 5% topical minoxidil foam.
