  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, prospective pilot study of CDX-301 with or without
      plerixafor as a stem cell mobilizer for allogeneic transplantation (stem cells that come from
      another person). HLA-matched sibling healthy volunteers (donors) and patients with protocol
      specified hematologic malignancies (recipients) will be enrolled.
