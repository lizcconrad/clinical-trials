  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single cohort, prospective post approval study conducted on patients with COPD in
      Canada. The study will enroll patients that have not responded to their current treatment of
      tiotropium alone, or who are on the fixed dose combinations fluticasone
      propionate/salmeterol. Only patients for whom the physician has decided to change treatment
      due to lack of efficacy will be eligible to be enrolled in the study.

      Also will evaluate the real-life effectiveness of QVA149 (indacaterol 110 mcg/glycopyrronium
      50 mcg) in the management of patients.

    <description>BDI /TDI measure dyspnea symptoms at changes in breathlessness from this baseline state over time at 4 and 16 weeks. scores are obtained by interview conducted by the treating physician at 4 and 16 weeks. The questions assess the patient's subjective experience of breathlessness and its impact on activities of daily living.</description>

    <description>The CAT is an 8 item questionnaire that assesses the impact of COPD on the patient's functional status. The item scores range from 0 to 5 (0 = no impairment). An overall score is calculated by adding the score from each item.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient diagnosed and treated for moderate to severe COPD according to the Global
             Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease according to physician's assessment

          -  Smoking history of &gt; 10 pack - years.

          -  On-going treatment with tiotropium or fixed dose combination of LABA/ICS, specifically
             combinations fluticasone propionate/salmeterol for a minimum of three months but
             demonstrating persistence of symptoms indicating change of treatment to combination
             therapy **using a CAT score &gt; 10.

          -  Treatment with QVA149 is indicated as per the product monograph and appropriate for
             the patient as per the judgment of the treating physician.

          -  Patient has signed informed consent agreeing to participate in the study and undergo
             the study treatments and allowing the use of their data for the purposes of the study.

                  patient in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in this

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of asthma or history of asthma.

          -  Patients who have had two or more moderate to severe exacerbations during the last 12
             months prior to study enrolment. A moderate COPD exacerbation is defined by
             requirement for treatment with systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics or both. A
             severe COPD exacerbation is defined by hospitalization, including an emergency room
             visit of longer than 24 h.

          -  Patients who had an exacerbation within the previous 6 weeks to enrolment.

          -  Patients who as per physician clinical judgment will require ICS treatment
