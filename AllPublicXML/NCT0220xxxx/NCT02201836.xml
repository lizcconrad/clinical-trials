  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The onset of asthma is particularly frightening for children. When the symptoms of asthma
      decrease, children and parents forget about the maintenance and control of breath and lung
      volume. Because adherence is so poor, asthma is known as the emergency room illness. The
      playing of a wind instrument is a unique way to provide a creative means for children and
      teens to understand both the impact of diaphramatic breathing and their ability to control it
      as well. This study builds upon the evidence, though sparse, that suggest that the blowing of
      a wind instrument with clinical music therapy intervention strengthens the muscles of
      breathing and fortifies the incentive toward attending to the daily symptoms and general
      management of asthma.

    <description>The Juniper Questionnaire is a stringent quality of life measure that provides interview for children and teens and their parents. It is one of the few scales that requires these interviews to occur separately, so that children and parents do not feel compelled to answer what they think the other desires to hear. We also used take home journals and a comprehensive medical assessment to learn of ER visits, missed school days, avoidance of medication, and allergens in the home, as well as socio-economic status - these factors are known in the literature to effect outcomes and exacerbations with this population.</description>

    <description>One time music therapy session which consists of music meditation, including as assessment/evaluation of confined body breathing function as expressed through drawing and coloring post music imagery session. This is followed by an entrainment wind playing/breath expansion music therapy intervention. At the end of the session, the subjects are given a donated wind instrument for play at home.</description>

    <description>The weekly group music therapy intervention consists of children and teens using guided visualization and expressing their fears and or fantasies related to breathing with one another. This is followed by creative music improvisations with part-playing on flutes, slide whistles, recorders and melodicas.</description>
