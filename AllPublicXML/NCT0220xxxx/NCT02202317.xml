  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-blinded case series involving the acquisition of a pair production
      PET/CT as soon as possible after an already performed Y-90 Sirspheres treatment of hepatic
      malignancy. It will be performed in addition to the standard Brehmsstrahlung SPECT scan. The
      sequence of the two scans in each case (PET/CT vs SPECT) will be determined by availability
      of the scanners at the time. However, it is intended that both be acquired on the day of the
      Y-90 treatment.

      The length of subject participation will be one year.

      The measures used will be mostly qualitative in nature, and will include:

        -  Correlation with expected vs. achieved tumor coverage by the treatment

        -  Correlation between treatment distribution depicted by Brehmsstrahlung scans vs. the
           Internal Pair Production PET/CT scans, to.

        -  Detection of non-target embolization, where applicable, and qualitative comparison
           between the two modalities as to the conspicuity of the abnormality

      Qualitative methods will be used by the analysis of the obtained PET/CT images and comparing
      them to the Brehmsstrahlung SPECT images as previously described.
