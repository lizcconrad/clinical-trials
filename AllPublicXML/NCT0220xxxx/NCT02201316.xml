  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the relative bioavailability of two candidate formulations of
      mosapride citrate 5mg tablets compared the reference product GASMOTIN (mosapride citrate 5mg)
      from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Company in healthy adult subjects. This will be an open-label,
      randomised, single dose, three-way crossover, six sequence study. Subjects will receive a
      single oral dose separated by at least 7 days and no greater than 14 days washout period.
      This study is required to select a candidate mosapride citrate (GR107719B) formulation for
      further development and provide data to allow the design of a future pivotal bioequivalence
      study. The candidate formulations will be compared with the innovator GASMOTIN. GASMOTIN is a
      trademark of Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Company.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor if required agree and
             document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will
             not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index within the range 19 - 24.9 kg/m^2
             (inclusive).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40
             milli-international units per milliliter (MlU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per
             mililiter (pg/mL) [&lt;147 picomole per liter] is confirmatory]. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method;
             Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human
             chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing AND; Agrees to use
             one of the contraception methods listed in protocol for an appropriate period of time
             (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to
             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree
             to use contraception until the follow-up contact visit; OR has only same-sex partners,
             when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in Protocol. This criterion must be followed from the
             time of the first dose of study medication until the follow-up contact visit.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x upper limit of
             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Based on single or averaged corrected QT interval (QTc) values of triplicate
             electrocardiograms obtained over a brief recording period: QTcF &lt; 450 msec

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities

             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is
             equivalent to 8 gram of alcohol: a half-pint (approximately 240 milliliter [mL]) of
             beer, 1 glass (100 mL) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Gastrointestinal disease or with gastrointestinal surgical history which can affect
             the absorption of the investigational product.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

             in excess of 500 mL within a 90 day period.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 90 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
