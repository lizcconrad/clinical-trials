    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of EC1169 and the best dose to use in
      humans in future studies. This study will also determine how EC1169 is distributed, broken
      down, passed and absorbed through your body and how quickly it is eliminated (leaves the
      body). All patients will receive EC1169.

      As a secondary objective in Part A: To explore the relationships between baseline PSMA
      expression (tumor and patient level) as measured by 99mTc-EC0652 scans and the antitumor
      activity of EC1169.

      As an exploratory objective in Part B: To assess EC0652 as a predictive biomarker for the
      efficacy of EC1169 by comparing PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative lesions for response.

      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, oncology study to conducted in 2
      parts. Part A is a dose-escalation phase to determine the Recommended Phase 2 (RP2) dose and
      the following :

        -  Evaluate the administration of EC1169 QW on Weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week schedule

        -  Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of EC1169 and EC0652

        -  To assess preliminary efficacy results in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant
           prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, and
           previously treated with a taxane.

      The primary objective of Part B is to identify the radiographic progression-free survival
      (rPFS) in taxane-naïve and taxane-exposed PSMA-positive mCRPC patients receiving treatment
      with EC1169.
