      Objective: Several in vitro studies report positive effects of ginseng on spermatogenesis.
      However, no controlled human clinical study of the effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) on
      spermatogenesis has been performed. This study was performed to investigate the effects of
      KRG on semen parameters in male infertility patients in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. Methods: A total of 80 male infertility patients with varicocele
      were recruited from April 2011 to February 2012. The subjects were then divided into the
      following four groups: non-V + P group, placebo; V + P group, placebo and varicocelectomy;
      non-V + KRG group, 1.5-g KRG daily; V + KGR group, 1.5-g KRG daily and varicocelectomy. Semen
      analysis was performed and hormonal levels were measured in each treatment arm after 12
      weeks.
