  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the benefits of a structured
      occupational/physical therapy program on upper extremity morbidity for patients who have
      received bilateral breast reconstruction in comparison to a home therapy program and no
      post-operative therapy.

      Hypothesis: Patients who engage in therapist-supervised occupational therapy following
      bilateral breast reconstruction have less upper extremity morbidity than those patients who
      complete a home therapy program or no therapy program.

    <measure>Change in DASH: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>A change in DASH score will be calculated. The DASH: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Appendix D) questionnaire will be utilized to measure physical function and symptoms of the upper limbs. The DASH consists of 30-items to be self-reported by the patient: physical function twenty-one (21) items, pain symptoms five (5) items, and emotional and social function four (4) items. The result of the DASH is a numerical disability score ranging from zero to one hundred (0-100), with zero (0) being no disability and one hundred (100) being the most severe disability.</description>

    <description>Structured In-Office Therapy: Study subjects will receive structured, therapist-supervised occupational/physical therapy twice per week for four (4) weeks. Each visit will last approximately sixty (60) minutes. Patients in this arm will receive therapy instruction by a certified occupational therapist on upper extremity stretching, relaxation, cardio rehabilitation, and strength training. These patients will also receive exercise and stretching handouts to use at home between therapy visits. Will complete the DASH at week 1 and week 4.</description>
