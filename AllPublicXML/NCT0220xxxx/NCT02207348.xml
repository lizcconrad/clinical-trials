        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, age 18-60 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed
             consent

          -  Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 27.0 and less than 35.0 kg/m^2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant or is of
             child-bearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method. Only highly
             effective methods of birth control are accepted (i.e. one that results in less than 1%
             per year failure rate when used consistently and correctly such as implants,
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices), or sexual
             abstinence or vasectomised partner

          -  History or presence of cancer, or any clinically significant cardiovascular,
             respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrine (incl. diabetes),
             haematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological, psychiatric diseases or other
             major disorders that might have impact on the trial, as judged by the investigator

          -  Use of any prescription or non-prescription medication, except for paracetamol,
             acetylsalicylic acid, contraceptives and vitamins (but including mega-dose vitamin
             therapy, as judged by the investigator) within 2 weeks before the trial defined as
             screening

          -  Significant history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse within 1 year from screening,
             or a positive result of the urine drug screen or alcohol breath test, or consuming
             more than 21 units of alcohol per week (one unit of alcohol equals about 250 mL of
             beer or lager, one glass of wine (120 mL), or 20 mL spirits)

          -  Smoking more than 5 cigarettes, or the equivalent, per day and unable to refrain from
             smoking during the in-house periods
