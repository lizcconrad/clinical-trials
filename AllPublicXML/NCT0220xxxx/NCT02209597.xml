      Determine bioequivalence between branded and generic bupropion extended release (XL) products
      (and between generic products) at steady state in patients with major depressive disorder.

      The protocol is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, crossover study in 75 subjects
      (target, 60 evaluable) with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) receiving bupropion HCl 300mg XL
      (branded or generic). Subjects will be studied for a total of approximately 28 weeks: an
      approximately 4 week lead-in phase during which participants remain on their existing
      bupropion product, and then four randomized cross-over phases of approximately 6 weeks on
      each of the four bupropion study drugs (brand and 3 generics). For each of the four bupropion
      products, subjects will have (a) formal pharmacokinetic evaluation (24 hr plasma and urine)
      at steady-state, (b) every 3-week in-person standard structured clinical evaluations of
      depressive symptoms and side effects, and (c) once daily smart phone-based assessments to
      capture information on symptoms and side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Each subject must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Adult outpatients age 18-75 years

          2. Currently on once daily bupropion HCl 300mg XL (brand or any generic), for a minimum
             of 4 months

          3. Major depressive disorder (MDD), in partial or full remission for at least 4 months,
             as confirmed by the SCID. Spontaneous relapse of depression unrelated to medication
             changes is less likely - about 5% chance per year - after remission has been
             maintained for at least 4 months.2

          4. Ability to understand and willingness to comply with study procedures, and to provide
             written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects will not be enrolled if any of the following criteria exist:

          1. Remission from depression not clearly attributed to bupropion treatment

          2. Current severe side effects attributable to bupropion

          3. Poor adherence to bupropion treatment per patient self- report and history of refill
             persistence

          4. History of active seizure disorder, or seizure treatment within past year

          5. History of significant hepatic or renal disease, based on physician assessment

          6. Currently taking drugs or natural products known to influence cytochrome P450B6
             (CYP2B6) activity

          7. Currently taking drugs for hepatitis C or multiple sclerosis, due to their ability to
             cause depression

          8. Dementia or other significant cognitive impairment, per diagnosis or investigative
             team's assessment

          9. Lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform dis-order,
             delusional disorder, or current psychotic symptoms diagnosed by SCID

         10. Abuse of or dependence on alcohol or other substances within the past 6 months as
             determined by SCID, and confirmed by study physician interview

         11. Current suicidal ideation
