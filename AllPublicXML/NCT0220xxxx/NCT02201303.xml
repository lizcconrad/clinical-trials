  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine danirixin (GSK1325756) concentrations required to inhibit
      neutrophil activation in blood obtained from Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-infected
      children &lt;2 years and healthy adults. The study will evaluate differences in neutrophil
      activation between RSV-infected children &lt;2 years and healthy adults with escalating
      concentrations of Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 1 (CXCL1) and danirixin to determine if
      RSV-infected children and adult neutrophils are similarly activated by CXCL1 and inhibited by
      danirixin. This study will guide dose prediction to inhibit specific percentages of
      neutrophils in future pediatric RSV-infection studies. This single-center, in vitro study
      will consist of 2 parts. Approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled, including 12 healthy
      adults and 12 RSV-infected children &lt;2 years.
