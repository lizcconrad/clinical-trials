    <description>Medtronic CoreValve SystemTM is designed to replace the native or surgical bioprosthetic aortic heart valve without open heart surgery and without concomitant surgical removal of the failing valve. The support frame is manufactured by Nitinol, which has multi-level, self-expanding properties and is radiopaque. The bioprosthesis is manufactured by suturing valve leaflets and a skirt from a single layer of porcine pericardium into a tri-leaflet configuration. The bioprosthesis is processed with alpha-amino oleic acid (AOA™), which is a compound derived from oleic acid, a naturally occurring long-chain fatty acid. AOA™ is an antimineralization treatment shown to reduce both early and late valvular calcification.</description>

    <description>Patients should be accepted for TAVI by a multidisciplinary team. The procedure should use the Medtronic CoreValve SystemTM and point of enrolment is the day of the procedure. The choice of prosthesis size and access route (transfemoral, subclavian or direct aortic access) is to be left to the discretion of the operating team. Equally the intraprocedural details (anaesthetic, imaging etc.) will proceed as per usual practice.</description>

             patients in whom heart team has assessed the redo surgery at high risk

          -  The patient or legal representative has been informed of the nature of the procedure
             and the study and has consented to participate, and has authorized the collection and
