      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. determine the clinical impact of rapid Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT), Neisseria Gonorrhoeae
           (NG) testing on antibiotic over and under treatment for CT/NG in women evaluated in the
           Emergency Department (ED) for a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI).

        2. determine the clinical impact of rapid Trichomonas Vaginalis (TV) testing on antibiotic
           under and over treatment for TV in women evaluated in the ED for an STI

        3. evaluate the feasibility of integrating rapid Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT), Neisseria
           Gonorrhoeae (NG) and TV testing in the Emergency Department setting.

      To evaluate the impact or rapid CT/NG/TV testing an patient comprehension of Sexually
      Transmitted Infection diagnosis.
