    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a patient prewarming concept following the
      recommendations of the S3-guideline &quot;Prevention of perioperative hypothermia&quot; with respect to
      incidence and complications of perioperative hypothermia. The study hypothesis is that
      postoperative core temperature in adult patients after prewarming is significantly higher
      than in patients who were treated following actual standard protocol (passive insulation).

      The aim of the study is to evaluate a patient prewarming concept following the
      recommendations of the new german S3-guideline &quot;Prevention of perioperative hypothermia&quot; with
      respect to incidence and complications of perioperative hypothermia. Prewarming should enable
      the patients to preserve their core temperature for a longer period and to avoid
      perioperative hypothermia.The study hypothesis is that postoperative core temperature in
      adult patients after prewarming is significantly higher than in patients who were treated
      following the actual standard protocol (passive insulation).
