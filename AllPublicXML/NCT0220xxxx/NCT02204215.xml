  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is common and dramatically affect recovery.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether electric acupuncture therapy is effective
      in the treatment of ICU-AW especially in the patients receiving mechanical ventilation with
      sepsis or multiorgan system failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle of acupuncture is to produce bioelectric current, as a consequence, to
      invigorate the circulation, promote tissue regeneration, relieve pain, enhance the immune
      function, etc. And electric acupuncture can stimulate bioelectricity activities at acupoints,
      out of reach for ordinary acupuncture effect, especially in the fields of nerve/muscle
      recovery and regeneration.
