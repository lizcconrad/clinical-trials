  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work will provide critical insights into the potential impact of a
      biomarker-based algorithm on reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in different adult and
      pediatric/neonatal ICU's. This proposal will also assess the costs (or savings) of a
      biomarker-based intervention. Overall, the results of this work will be critical in informing
      future strategies to eliminate unnecessary antibiotic use and curb the continued rise in
      antimicrobial resistance.

      The goal of this project is reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics in the ICU. The purpose of
      Phase I of the study is to identify the biomarker, or combination of biomarkers, that
      provides optimal test characteristics in identifying adults and children/neonates with
      presumed sepsis who have a very low likelihood of bacterial infection. Results of Phase I
      will result in development of a biomarker-based algorithm to inform need for antibiotic use
      in ICU patients. In Phase II, the impact of this biomarker-based algorithm on reducing
      antibiotic use in the ICU will be determined. Costs or savings associated with the algorithm
      will also be assessed.

    <description>9 blood biomarkers (including C reactive protein and Procalcitonin) will be assessed across 3 days. Results will not be shared with the subject's medical team. At 3 days, the definitive diagnosis of infection will be determined using Center for Disease Control (CDC) criteria; this will serve as the gold standard for determining biomarker test characteristics. Additional data to collect: demographics, comorbidities, medication use (like antibiotics), lab cultures, x-rays, sepsis resolution, length of hospital stay, and ultimate outcome (i.e., discharge, death). Phase I will identify the biomarker(s) providing the greatest negative predictive value in identifying patients at very low likelihood bacterial infection.</description>

    <description>The Algorithm arm is equivalent to the intervention. Biomarker algorithm along with the patient's biomarker assay results will be given to clinical team to assist in deciding to continue antibiotics.
The intervention will consist of using the biomarker identified as useful in Phase I to compile an algorithm along containing the patient's biomarker assay results and providing this as additional information for a clinical team consider using to assist in deciding to continue antibiotics. Biomarker algorithms may be different for adult versus pediatric patients, and across different types of ICUs.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. SIRS Criteria

             SIRS is considered to be present when patients have more than one of the following
             clinical findings:

               -  body temperature &gt;38°C or &lt;36°C

               -  heart rate &gt;90 min-1

               -  respiratory rate of &gt;20 min-1 or a Paco2 of &lt;32 mm Hg

               -  and a white blood cell count of &gt;12,000 cells µL-1 or &lt;4,000 µL-1

          2. new empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated, indicating the suspicion of infection.
             Accepted criteria for SIRS will be used for the Medical Intensive Care Unit and
             Surgical Intensive Care Unit populations, with appropriate age-specific vital signs
             definitions to help make the definitions relevant for the Pediatric Intensive Care
             Unit population.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. a code status of &quot;do not resuscitate&quot;

          2. absence of initiation or expansion of antibiotic therapy despite meeting criteria for
             sepsis

          3. presence of an immunocompromising condition.

        An immunocompromising condition will be defined as one of the following:

          -  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with a t-helper cell (CD4) count &lt;200
             cell/mm3; 2) immunosuppressive therapy after organ transplantation

          -  neutropenia (&lt;500 neutrophils/mm3)

          -  active chemotherapy within the 3 months preceding eligibility or

          -  diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

        These criteria all represent conditions in which antibiotic use is much less likely to be
        decreased regardless of the results of a biomarker and are consistent with exclusion
        criteria used in past studies of the impact of biomarkers.
