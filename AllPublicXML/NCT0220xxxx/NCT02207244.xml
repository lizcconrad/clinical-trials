  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of guselkumab
      (CNTO 1959) in the treatment of participants with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis
      (scaly skin rash).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo- (inactive
      substance identical in appearance to study drug) and active-comparator-controlled (use of an
      approved drug to compare with study drug) study of guselkumab. The active comparator study
      drug is adalimumab, an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis. Participants who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly
      assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups (arms): Group I (guselkumab 100 mg
      dose regimen), Group II (placebo then crossover to guselkumab at Week 16), or Group III
      (adalimumab at standard psoriasis dosing). From Week 28 up to Week 76, treatment for all
      participants will be based on their level of response. All participants will receive
      guselkumab every 8 weeks from Week 76 through Week 252 with a final safety follow-up visit at
      Week 264 (open label treatment period). The end of the study is defined as the time the last
      participant completes the Week 264 visit. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 268 weeks (includes a 4-week screening period). Participants will be monitored
      for safety throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these area was assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

    <description>The PSSD (24 hour version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items (&gt;=50 percentage of 5 items) on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score = average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100= most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these area was assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Adalimumab Group at Week 24</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Week 16 in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <description>The PSSD (24 hour version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items (&gt;=50 percentage of 5 items) on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score = average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100= most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

The presentation of data from the adalimumab group from Week 28 to Week 48 is divided into 2 arms (adalimumab then guselkumab 100 mg (Week 28 - 48) and adalimumab (Week 28 - 48) in order to represent exposure to 2 different active study agents (adalimumab vs guselkumab).</description>

          <description>Participants who were assigned to adalimumab through Week 28 were assessed for PASI 90 response at Week 28. Participants who were PASI 90 responders and were subsequently treated only with placebo matched to guselkumab subcutaneous injection through up to Week 48 (never met the criterion for treatment with guselkumab). The group also includes participants who were assigned to adalimumab, discontinued study agent prior to or at Week 28 and completed safety follow up after Week 28. The presentation of data from the adalimumab group from Week 28 to Week 48 is divided into 2 arms (adalimumab then guselkumab 100 mg (Week 28 - 48) and adalimumab (Week 28 - 48) in order to represent exposure to 2 different active study agents (adalimumab vs guselkumab).</description>
