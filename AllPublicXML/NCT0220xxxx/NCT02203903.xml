      This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to evaluate the safety of administering
      rapidly-generated multi-antigen-specific T lymphocytes, to HSCT recipients (Arm A) or future
      HSCT recipients (Arm B) for the treatment or relapsed or refractory hematopoietic
      malignancies, to determine if event-free survival (EFS) at six months after HSCT is improved
      with TAA-L administration at six months after HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia and MDS (Arm
      C).

      This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to evaluate the safety of administering
      rapidly-generated multi-antigen-specific T lymphocytes, to HSCT recipients or future HSCT
      recipients for the treatment or relapsed or refractory hematopoietic malignancies.

      This study will first enroll 2 adult patients to each arm (A and B) prior to enrolling
      pediatric patients, all of whom will have either relapsed or persistent hematological
      malignancies pre- or post- allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. TAA-CTL may be generated
      from host lymphocytes (pre-HSCT) or donor lymphocytes (post-HSCT) obtained from either
      patient PBMC or donor PBMC.

      Four different dosing schedules will be evaluated. Two to four patients will be evaluated on
      each dosing schedule (See below). This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation
      study.

      For Arm A Patients (post HSCT): T cells will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment
      post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first.

      For Arm B Patients (pre HSCT): T cells will be infused any time &gt;1 week after previous
      therapy for relapsed disease.

      For Arm C Patients (post HSCT): T cells will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment
      post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first.

      In each group, a patient will be enrolled to one of the following dosing schedule.

      Dose Level One: 5 x 106 cells/m2 Dose Level Two: 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three: 2 x 107
      cells/m2 Dose Level Four: 4 x 107 cells/m2

      Each patient will receive at least one infusions according to the enrolled dose level, where
      the expected volume of infusion is 1 to 10 cc. Patients will receive cells either because: of
      prior refractory disease and/or high risk for relapse and/or detectable disease at the time
      of infusion. Group A and Group B patients will use the dose escalation strategy described
      above. We strongly recommend that patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic
      agents for at least 6 weeks after infusion of TAA-specific T-cells (for purposes of
      evaluation), although such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the
      attending physician.

      Arm C patients will (post HSCT): T cells will be infused any time after neutrophil
      engraftment post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first, on the top dose level determined in
      the safety phase of Arm A.

      TAA-CTL cells may be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment post-HSCT or day 30,
      whichever comes first if patient is post-allo HSCT, and at greater than 1 week after prior
      cytoreductive therapy if patients is pre-allo HSCT. We strongly recommend that patients
      should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 6 weeks after infusion
      of TAA-specific T-cells (for purposes of evaluation), although such treatment may be added if
      deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician and not under IND. Exclusions to
      this include: agents that have shown success in disease reduction and safety after HSCT (to
      include FLT3 inhibitors and BCR-ABL inhibitors). For autologous recipients, this could
      include PD-1 inhibitors or other immune activators if these have been previously tolerated
      without autoimmunity; however, allogeneic patients are not eligible to receive these agents
      in conjunction with TAA-L cells. If patients with active disease do not have &gt;grade 3
      toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to cells and fail to rapidly
      progress with disease requiring urgent therapy, patients may receive subsequent doses.
      Subsequent doses will be available for those patients who have stable disease or a mixed,
      partial, or complete response by the International Working Group (IWG) criteria at the
      evaluation after dose 1. They are eligible to receive up to 6 additional doses of TAA-CTLs at
      monthly intervals-each of which will consist of the same cell number as their tolerated dose
      level. Notably, these doses will be identical to the treated dose for this patient (i.e. no
      subsequent dose escalation). Patients will not be able to receive additional doses until the
      initial 28 day evaluation for toxicity and efficacy following the second infusion.
