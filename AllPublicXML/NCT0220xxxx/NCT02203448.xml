    <textblock>
      A Multi-centre, Prospective, single-arm post market clinical follow up study (PMCF) of the
      FACET WEDGETM spinal system to assess outcomes in subjects with chronic low back pain due to
      Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD), facet joint disease and/or pseudo arthrosis post anterior
      instrumentation. The objective of this study is to assess outcomes following implantation of
      the FACET WEDGE spinal system when used to provide fixation of lumbar motion segments.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the rate of re-operations at the index
      level(s).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and performance of the
      device and to collect patient reported outcome data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects diagnosed with at least one of the following:

               -  Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD);

               -  Degenerative facet joint disease (isolated facet based symptomatic back pain);

               -  Pseudoarthrosis post anterior instrumentation;

          2. Subjects who are a fusion candidate for single or multiple levels fusion between
             L1-S1;

          3. Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this
             clinical investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing
             to return to the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Preoperative exclusion criteria:

          1. Segmental instability of the index level in case of planned stand-alone FACET WEDGE
             usage;

          2. Unilateral application , except in combination with pediclescrew fixation on the
             contralateral side;

          3. Compromised facets due to decompression techniques;

          4. Spondylolisthesis;

          5. Fracture or other instabilities of the posterior elements;

          6. Tumor;

          7. Acute or chronic systemic or localized spinal infections;

          8. Nursing mothers or women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the time
             of the study;

          9. Subjects aged below 18 years;

         10. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that
             would compromise their participation and follow-up in this clinical investigation;

             Intraoperative exclusion criteria:

         11. Intraoperative decision to use implants other than the device under investigation.
