  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and a good performance status (PS), pemetrexed and
      cisplatin has been recommended for first-line NSCLC treatment. Recently, results from the
      PARAMOUNT trial showed that patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who had a good PS and had not
      progressed after completing four cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin induction therapy benefitted
      from pemetrexed continuation maintenance therapy. Furthermore, pemetrexed with bevacizumab
      continuous maintenance might be better treatment option, considering the results from
      AVAPEARL trial. Pemetrexed rechallenge has been reported to be effective in some patients.
      Therefore, in order to investigate the safety and efficacy of pemetrexed rechallenge with
      bevacizumab,we conducted this study.
