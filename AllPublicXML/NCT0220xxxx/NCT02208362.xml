      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified T-cell
      immunotherapy in treating patients with malignant glioma that has come back (recurrent) or
      has not responded to therapy (refractory). A T cell is a type of immune cell that can
      recognize and kill abnormal cells in the body. T cells are taken from the patient's blood and
      a modified gene is placed into them in the laboratory and this may help them recognize and
      kill glioma cells. Genetically modified T-cells may also help the body build an immune
      response against the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex vivo expanded
      autologous memory-enriched T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating
      (SIN) lentiviral vector to express an interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13R alpha
      2)-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), as well as
      a truncated human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) for participants with
      recurrent/refractory malignant glioma in one of the following ways: stratum 1 (intratumoral
      delivery of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ central memory T cells [Tcm]) (IL13R alpha
      2-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes),
      stratum 2 (intracavitary delivery of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ Tcm, stratum 3
      (intraventricular delivery of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ Tcm), stratum 4 (dual
      delivery [both intratumoral and intraventricular] of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ Tcm),
      or stratum 5 (dual delivery of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ naive and memory T cells
      [Tn/mem]).II. To determine maximum tolerated dose schedule (MTD) and a recommended phase II
      dosing plan (RP2D) for each stratum based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the full
      toxicity profile.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the timing and extent of brain inflammation, as assessed by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), following T cell administration.

      II. To describe cytokine levels (cyst fluid, peripheral blood) over the study period.

      III. In research participants who receive the full schedule of three CAR+ T cell doses:
      estimate the six month progression free survival rate, disease response rates, and median
      overall survival.

      IV. In research participants who receive intraventricular infusions after progressing
      following intratumoral/intracranial infusions (stratum 1 or 2): estimate disease response.

      V. In research participants who receive at least one dose of CAR+ T cells estimate the mean
      change from baseline in quality of life using the European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and EORTC QLQ brain
      neoplasm (BN)-20 survey scale, domain and item scores during and post treatment.

      VI. To evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor micro-environment and the location of the
      CAR T cells with respect to the injection. (For research participants who undergo a second
      resection or autopsy).

      VII. To evaluate IL13R alpha 2 antigen expression levels pre and post CAR T cell therapy.
      (For research participants who undergo a second resection or autopsy) OUTLINE: This is a
      dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 5 strata.

      STRATUM I (Intratumoral delivery) CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 03/02/2018: Patients receive IL13R alpha
      2-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes
      via intratumoral catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week
      later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients remain eligible
      and there is product available. Patients who progress on intracavitary or intratumoral
      administration may move to intraventricular catheter for the optional infusions.

      STRATUM II (Intracavitary delivery): Patients receive IL13R alpha 2-specific,
      hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes via
      intracavitary catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week later,
      patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients continue to remain
      eligible and there is product available. Patients who progress on intracavitary or
      intratumoral administration may move to intraventricular catheter for the optional infusions.

      STRATUM III (Intraventricular delivery): Patients receive IL13R alpha 2-specific,
      hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes via
      intraventricular catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week
      later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients continue to
      remain eligible and there is product available.

      STRATUM IV (Dual delivery): Patients receive IL13R alpha 2-specific, hinge-optimized,
      41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes via intratumoral catheter and
      intraventricular catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week
      later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients continue to
      remain eligible and there is product available. Based on clinical response after the first 3
      infusions, the study principal investigator may decide to continue with the optional
      infusions at either one or both sites (instead of requiring injections at both sites).

      STRATUM V (Dual delivery): Patients receive IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ Tn/mem via
      intratumoral catheter and intraventricular catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks.
      Beginning as early as 1 week later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long
      as patients continue to remain eligible and there is product available. Based on clinical
      response after the first 3 infusions, the study principal investigator may decide to continue
      with the optional infusions at either one or both sites (instead of requiring injections at
      both sites).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12
      months and then yearly for 15 years.

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.3

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x upper
             limits of normal

          -  An interval of at least 12 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of initial
             radiation therapy

          -  At least 6 weeks since the completion of a nitrosourea-containing chemotherapy regimen

          -  At least 23 days since the completion of Temodar and/or 4 weeks for any other
             non-nitrosourea-containing cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen; if a patient's most recent
             treatment was with a targeted agent only, and s/he has recovered from any toxicity of
             this targeted agent, then a waiting period of only 2 weeks is needed from the last
             dose and the start of study treatment, with the exception of bevacizumab where a wash
             out period of at least 4 weeks is required before starting study treatment

        ELIGIBILITY FOR ENROLLMENT AND TO PROCEED WITH CAR T CELL INFUSION:

          -  Research participant has a released cryopreserved T cell product

          -  Research participant does not require supplemental oxygen to keep saturation greater
             than 95% and/or does not have presence of any radiographic abnormalities on chest
             x-ray that are progressive

          -  Research participant does not require pressor support and/or does not have symptomatic
             cardiac arrhythmias

          -  Research participant does not have a fever exceeding 38.5° Celsius (C); there is an
             absence of positive blood cultures for bacteria, fungus, or virus within 48-hours
             prior to T cell infusion and/or there aren't any indications of meningitis

          -  Serum total bilirubin does not exceed 2 x normal limit

          -  Transaminases does not exceed 2 x normal limit

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.8 mg/dL

          -  Research participant does not have uncontrolled seizure activity following surgery
             prior to starting the first T cell dose

          -  Platelet count must be &gt;= 100,000; however, if platelet level is between
             75,000-99,000, then T-cell infusion may proceed after platelet transfusion is given
             and the post transfusion platelet count is &gt;= 100,000

          -  Research participants must not require more than 2 mg thrice daily (TID) of
             dexamethasone during T cell therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

        SCREENING EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Research participant requires supplemental oxygen to keep saturation greater than 95%
             and the situation is not expected to resolve within 2 weeks

          -  Research participant requires pressor support and/or has symptomatic cardiac
             arrhythmias

          -  Research participant requires dialysis

          -  Research participant has uncontrolled seizure activity and/or clinically evident
             progressive encephalopathy

          -  Failure of research participant to understand the basic elements of the protocol
             and/or the risks/benefits of participating in this phase I study; a legal guardian may
             substitute for the research participant

          -  Research participants with any non-malignant intercurrent illness which is either
             poorly controlled with currently available treatment, or which is of such severity
             that the investigators deem it unwise to enter the research participant on protocol
             shall be ineligible

          -  Research participants with any other active malignancies

          -  Research participants being treated for severe infection or who are recovering from
             major surgery are ineligible until recovery is deemed complete by the investigator

          -  Research participants with any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active
             infection; research participants with known active hepatitis B or C infection;
             research participants with any signs or symptoms of active infection, positive blood
             cultures or radiological evidence of infections

          -  Research participants who have confirmed HIV positivity within 4 weeks of screening

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study
