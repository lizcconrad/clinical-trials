    <textblock>
      Anti-inflammatory tablets (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) continue to be used
      commonly worldwide to relieve pain caused by arthritis. Likewise, aspirin is used by many
      patients in order to prevent blood clots. Despite their desired benefits, these medicines can
      cause internal bleeding from the digestive system. The source of this bleeding can be obvious
      (overt), or obscure and thought to come from the small intestine. Obscure bleeding can show
      as anemia due to lack of iron in the blood. Small intestine ulcers are now easily diagnosed
      using an endoscope the size of a big pill (video capsule endoscopy). Small bowel ulcers are
      not related to stomach acid and therefore do not heal using remedies usually taken to stop
      acid formation. A different drug, misoprostol, consists of a chemical (prostaglandin) that is
      usually lacking in patients using aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs. Misoprostol is licenced
      to heal stomach and duodenal ulcers in patients using these drugs. Our hypothesis is that
      misoprostol might be effective in healing small bowel ulcers as suggested by pilot studies;
      however, such works only included small numbers of patients, did not include control groups
      and both patients and investigators knew the nature of the tablets used. To test this
      hypothesis, we propose to compare misoprostol to a dummy tablet. The numbers of subjects to
      be studied have been calculated using established statistical methods

      METHODOLOGY:

        -  Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy on patients with obscure bleeding and/
           or iron deficiency anemia.

        -  Video capsule endoscopy on those fulfilling the inclusion criteria

        -  Randomization to Misoprostol 200 micrograms or placebo, 4 times each day given for 8
           weeks to aspirin/ NSAID users with erosive small bowel lesions.

        -  Video capsule endoscopy at 8 weeks to check healing of small bowel lesions.

        -  Full blood count at baseline and monthly intervals (0, 4, and 8 weeks)

          -  Positive fecal occult blood test within last 3 months

          -  Iron deficiency anemia (ferritin &lt;100 ug/l, hemoglobin [Hb] 7-12 g/dl [female] or 7-13
             g/dl [male])

          -  Drop in haemoglobin, &gt; 2gm/dl from baseline, in the absence of potential or actively
             bleeding lesion detectable on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy.
