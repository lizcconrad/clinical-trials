  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major function of blood vessels is to control blood flow by dilating or constricting
      depending on the demand. Vascular dysfunction is a state in which blood vessels fail to carry
      out its normal roles such as regulating blood flow. Diabetes is a risk factor for vascular
      dysfunction. Dysfunction may involve the smaller and/or larger blood vessels. Failure in the
      ability of large (conduit) blood vessels to control blood flow may be an early feature of
      atherosclerosis, a leading cause of stroke and heart attack. Measures of blood vessel
      dilation give an indication of the health of the vessel. Ultrasound and MRI can assess
      vascular function by measuring changes in blood vessel dilation. Diabetes may also affect
      tiny vessels in the kidney. These vessels become porous allowing albumin (a protein in the
      blood) to leak into the urine. The investigators can easily measure the presence of albumin
      in the urine.

      This study aims to explore if MRI can demonstrate an association between vascular health in
      tiny and larger (conduit) blood vessels, by testing for an association between blood flow
      regulatory capacity of large vessels and presence of albumin in the urine.
