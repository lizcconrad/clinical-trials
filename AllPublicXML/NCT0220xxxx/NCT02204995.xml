  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis is a common cause of pain and loss of hand function in
      postmenopausal women. Many surgical treatments have been described and recent literature has
      show that the relatively simple trapeziectomy gives equal results and less complications,
      when compared to other techniques such as ligament reconstructions and interpositions. These
      studies have been conducted predominantly in patients with stage 2 or 3 osteoarthritis. Stage
      4 osteoarthritis is characterized by more cartilage and soft-tissue damage, which increases
      the chance for collapse of the first metacarpal bone and associated problems.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that an LRTI can be of additional value in patients with
      stage 4 osteoarthritis.
