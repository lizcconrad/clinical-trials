    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-week open-label trial to assess the effectiveness of Omega-3 fatty acids
      for deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) as a supplement to Attention
      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) treatment in children and adolescents with Attention
      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Subjects will be between the ages of 6-17 and will currently
      be on medication for their Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder but still experience DESR
      traits.

    <measure>Emotional Control Subscale of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Parent Form (BRIEF-Parent)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Parent Form (BRIEF-Parent) is a 75-item checklist with a large normative sample, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and external and concurrent validity, divided into nine empirically and theoretically derived and T-scored subscales. The Emotional Control subscale measures the impact of executive function problems on emotional expression and assesses a child's ability to modulate or control his or her emotional responses. It is a 10-item subscale, and each item is scored &quot;Never,&quot; &quot;Sometimes,&quot; or &quot;Often.&quot; Raw scores for all scales are computed with Software Portfolio (BRIEF-SP), which provides a raw score and T score (based on child's age) for each scale. Higher scores represent more greater emotional dysregulation.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Improvement for Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a clinician rated measure of illness severity, improvement, and efficacy of treatment (collected at all study visits). We examined the CGI Improvement specifically. The CGI Improvement for Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR) was reported at baseline and completion. The CGI-I is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. It is rated as:
Very much improved
Much improved
Minimally improved
No change
Minimally worse
Much worse
Very much worse</description>

          <title>Emotional Control Subscale of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Parent Form (BRIEF-Parent)</title>
          <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Parent Form (BRIEF-Parent) is a 75-item checklist with a large normative sample, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and external and concurrent validity, divided into nine empirically and theoretically derived and T-scored subscales. The Emotional Control subscale measures the impact of executive function problems on emotional expression and assesses a child's ability to modulate or control his or her emotional responses. It is a 10-item subscale, and each item is scored &quot;Never,&quot; &quot;Sometimes,&quot; or &quot;Often.&quot; Raw scores for all scales are computed with Software Portfolio (BRIEF-SP), which provides a raw score and T score (based on child's age) for each scale. Higher scores represent more greater emotional dysregulation.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Improvement for Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR)</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a clinician rated measure of illness severity, improvement, and efficacy of treatment (collected at all study visits). We examined the CGI Improvement specifically. The CGI Improvement for Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR) was reported at baseline and completion. The CGI-I is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. It is rated as:
Very much improved
Much improved
Minimally improved
No change
Minimally worse
Much worse
