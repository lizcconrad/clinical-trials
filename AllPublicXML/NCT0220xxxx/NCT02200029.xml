    <textblock>
      A research study of an approved drug called Heptral®, ademetionine, to treat adults with
      intrahepatic cholestasis (a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum)
      in pre-cirrhotic and cirrhotic states. Experience from clinical studies in subjects with
      liver disease has shown that ademetionine is effective.
