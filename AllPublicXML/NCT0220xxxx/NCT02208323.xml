      This study proposes that modifying the current form of bCPAP by adjusting the nasal prongs to
      fit older children, will create a safe form of respiratory support that may help to decrease
      respiratory distress and thus mortality from pneumonia.

      This study proposes that modifying the current form of bCPAP by adjusting the nasal prongs to
      fit older children, will create a safe form of respiratory support that may help to decrease
      respiratory distress and thus mortality from pneumonia. Children age 1 month (mo) to 5 years
      (y) admitted to Gulu Regional Referral Hospital in Gulu, Uganda with respiratory distress
      will be evaluated for use of the modified bCPAP device as treatment for their respiratory
      distress (in addition to their routine care, i.e. antibiotics, nutrition support)
