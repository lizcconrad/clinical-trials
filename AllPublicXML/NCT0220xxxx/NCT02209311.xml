    <textblock>
      Autologous MMSCs will be isolated from oral mucosa biopsy sample and expanded in vitro.Tissue
      engineered construction will be created using synthetic tricalcium phosphate and autologous
      MMSCs. Patients will undergo sinus lift procedure with implantation of created
      tissue-engineered construction. This is a single arm study with no control. All patients
      receive cell therapy.

      Patients with verified diagnosis partially edentulous maxilla and alveolar bone atrophy will
      undergo oral mucosa biopsy and autologous MMSCs will be derived and expanded in vitro during
      3-4 weeks. After that tissue engineered construction will be created using synthetic
      tricalcium phosphate and autologous MMSCs. Patients will undergo sinus lift procedure with
      implantation of created tissue-engineered construction. Six months later patients will
      undergo dental implant installation. Biopsy of bone tissue at the site of sinus lift will be
      performed as a part of dental implant installation with subsequent histological analysis of
      bone specimen.
