    <textblock>
      This multi-centre study will provide sound, generalizable data on the effectiveness of a
      POC-based algorithm to determine to what extent this guideline can reduce blood product
      transfusions. Investigators will study outcomes in 7000 patients undergoing heart surgery at
      10 participating hospitals. The proposed trial addresses several important research and
      clinical issues and has the potential to markedly improve the transfusion management and
      surgical care in general of cardiac surgery patients.

      The intervention will be a novel POC-based algorithm that has been shown in a pilot study by
      us to be associated with a substantial reduction in blood product transfusions. The algorithm
      will employ viscoelastic and aggregometric POC-tests and an objective measure of blood loss.
      The primary outcome will be avoidance of red blood cell transfusion during hospitalization.
      The study has a 90% power to detect a 12% increase in avoidance rate. Secondary outcomes will
      include avoidance of red blood cell use and other blood products (plasma, platelets, and
      cryoprecipitate), units of blood products transfused, and adverse clinical outcomes related
      to transfusion (acute kidney injury, infections, and death). Data will also be collected for
      future health-economics analyses.

      Largely due to the limitations of existing evidence, however, such algorithms are rarely used
      in clinical practice. The proposed trial will provide sound, generalizable data on the
      effectiveness of a POC-based algorithm to guide their future use. An integrated blood
      management algorithm that employs POC coagulation tests will reduce blood product
      transfusions in cardiac surgery, thereby improving clinical outcomes.

      Does an integrated blood transfusion algorithm that employs POC coagulation tests applied
      across a network of hospitals reduce blood transfusions and associated adverse outcomes in
      cardiac surgery?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite major advances in cardiac surgery, coagulopathy continues to carry a heavy burden in
      cases that require the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), occurring frequently and
      resulting in excessive blood loss, blood product transfusions, and adverse clinical outcomes.
      Current management of coagulopathy is hampered by the inability of conventional laboratory
      tests to delineate its etiology in a timely manner, thereby precluding timely and targeted
      transfusion therapy. With the advent of point-of-care (POC) coagulation tests that can
      rapidly identify the etiology of coagulopathy, it may now be possible to reduce the burden of
      coagulopathy and thereby reduce transfusions and adverse outcomes. Several single-centre
      studies (including one by the investigator group) have found that the use of POC-based
      algorithms in cardiac surgery can markedly reduce blood product transfusions and by that
      means reduce morbidities and mortality.
