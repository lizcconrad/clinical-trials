      'Haut-Tief' (Skin Deep) is an educational, stress reducing program for patients with
      psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. A range of support activities will be offered in order to

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The educational program consists of 2-hours of educational (dermatology, specialized nurse,
      psychologist) and stress-reduction sessions (yoga, meditation, physiotherapy) twice a week
      during 9 weeks.

      A multidisciplinary team of trainers is involved. Primary endpoint is the general and skin
      dependent quality of life measured by questionnaires. HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life)
      is measured at baseline, after 3 months, 6 months and 9 months follow up. Patients are
      recruited from the out-patient clinic at the Department of Dermatology of the University
      Hospital Zurich. Patients are randomized in an intervention and control group. Intervention
      group receives the education program additionally to follow-up visits whereas the control
      group receives follow-up visits. Several runs are planned.
