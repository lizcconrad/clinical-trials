  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of the present study was to assess the safety and tolerability of
      intravenously administered Technetium 99m (99mTc) and Rhenium-186 radionuclide (186 Re)
      -labelled hMAb BIWA 4, to confirm preferential accumulation in the tumour of 99mTc - labelled
      hMAb BIWA 4, to determine the maximum tolerated radiation dose of 186 Re-labelled hMAb BIWA 4
      and to propose a safety dose for phase II development.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             neck

          -  Patients destined for surgery by means of neck dissection (Part A) or :

             treatment options were not available or distant metastases. The tumor deposits had to
             be measurable either clinically or by one or more radiological technique (s) (CT, MRI,
             bone scintigraphy). Because RIT was expected to be more effective in smaller size
             tumor deposits, patients with lesions measuring &gt; 3 cm in greatest dimension were
             preferred (Part B)

          -  Patients over 18 years of age

          -  Patients younger than 80 years of age

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Patients with a good performance status: Karnofsky &gt; 60

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life-threatening infection, allergic diathesis, organ failure (bilirubin &gt; 30µmol/l
             and/or creatinine &gt; 150 µmol/l) or evidence of a recent myocardial infarction on ECG
             or unstable angina pectoris

          -  Pre-menopausal women (last menstruation &lt;= 1 year prior to study start)

               -  Not surgically sterile (hysterectomy, tubal ligation) and

               -  Not practicing acceptable means of birth control, (nor not planned to be
                  continued throughout the study). Acceptable methods of birth control include
                  oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives

          -  Women with a positive serum pregnancy test at baseline

          -  Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks before inclusion in the study

          -  White blood cell count &lt; 3000/mm³, granulocyte count &lt; 1500/mm³ or platelet count &lt;
             100000/mm³

          -  Hematological disorders, congestive heart failure, bronchial asthma, alimentary or
             contact allergy, severe atopy or allergy
