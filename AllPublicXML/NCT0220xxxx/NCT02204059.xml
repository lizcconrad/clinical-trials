    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      intravenously (i.v.) administered 186 Rhenium-isotope (186Re)-labelled bivatuzumab and to
      investigate the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 186 Re-labelled bivatuzumab in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
