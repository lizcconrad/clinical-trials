    <textblock>
      The program consists of a 6-week small-group workshop for caregivers of people with memory
      problems.

      The goal of the study is to evaluate in a one year longitudinal study, program effectiveness
      in reducing caregiver stress, depression, fatigue, burden, days lost from work and improving
      sleep, healthful behaviors and self-efficacy

      The Building Better Caregivers workshop meets for 2.5 hours per week for 6 weeks in small
      groups of 10-16. It is peer-led (leaders already trained in the Stanford model must take a
      2-day cross-training before leading a BBC workshop).

      Participants will learn self-management skills such as decision making, goal setting, action
      planning, stress management, dealing with difficult behaviors, working with the health care
      system, planning for the future,building an exercise program, communication skills, healthy
      eating, etc.

      All participants will complete follow up questionnaires and 6 and 12 months. They will have
      the option of completing the questionnaire by mail or telephone interview.

      Once a particular workshop site is identified by a partner organization, Stanford will
      provide packets of consents and questionnaires to the site coordinator(non-Stanford). The
      site coordinator will either schedule an extra hour for the first meeting of the 6-week
      series, or an orientation meeting held a week or so before the workshop begins. During this
      time, the coordinator will announce to the prospective subjects that this study is being
      conducted and that they are invited to participate, and will pass out a consent,
      questionnaire and consent copy to each prospective participant. The consent and questionnaire
      are self-administered.

      This study is longitudinal, so no randomization will take place.

      Stanford holds no meetings, but receives the data. The site coordinators hold the orientation
      meetings. The workshops are scheduled by the various organizations, and they determine when
      and how the orientation time is scheduled. It will vary from site to site.
