    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the major health problem worldwide and the
      understanding of genetic contributions on the development of cardiovascular diseases is
      increasing significantly. The CD36 is a protein associated with uptake of oxidized forms of
      LDL and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1761667 A/G in the CD36 gene is correlated
      with increased consumption of total fat. The transcription factor STAT3 is released during
      the inflammatory acute phase response and the SNP rs8069645 G/A in the STAT3 gene is
      associated with abdominal obesity and higher intake of saturated fat. Studies have been shown
      the benefits of the Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and
      these dietary patterns have been often studied with nutrigenetic approach; these studies,
      however, are often limited to European populations, making it difficult to generalize to
      different populations.

      Hypothesis: Different dietary approaches may similarly influence in modifying metabolic,
      inflammatory and anthropometric profile, especially among patients with coronary arterial
      disease (CAD). The genetic interaction with environmental factors such as the nutrient
      intake, and the prescription of a different diet according to individual genotype, could
      influence the development and/or the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of three dietary approaches on metabolic, inflammatory and
      anthropometric profile in patients with CAD and possible interactions with polymorphisms in
      CD36 and STAT3 genes.

      A randomized clinical trial with a nutrigenetic approach among patients ≥ 40 years diagnosed
      with CAD. Randomization will be made in blocks from a list of random numbers generated by
      site www.randomization.org (sealed opaque envelopes). A questionnaire with demographic and
      clinical data will be applied; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist, hip and neck
      circumferences, height and weight will be assessed. Nutrients intake will be assessed through
      a food diary. Laboratory evaluation will consist of lipid profile (LDL-cholesterol,
      HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol, serum triglycerides), glycemic profile (fasting plasma
      glucose, glycated hemoglobin) and inflammatory profile (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
      fibrinogen, TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10). Genotyping will be made by TaqMan
      SNP Genotyping Assay®. Patients will be randomized in three groups: Group 1 Intervention
      [Supplementation with nuts (SN)]: standard dietary guidelines + 30g of nuts a day; Group 2
      Intervention [Supplementation with olive oil (SAO)]: standard dietary guidelines + 30ml of
      olive oil a day; Group 3 [Control diet (CO)]: standard dietary guidelines. Patients will be
      followed for three months (12 weeks) and the primary endpoint will be the change in
      LDL-cholesterol. The follow-up visits will be made at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days (final
      visit).
