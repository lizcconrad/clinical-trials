  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive dysfunction (impaired memory, thinking, etc) frequently occurs in Parkinson's
      disease (PD), often progresses to dementia, and profoundly affects quality of life.
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder in the general population that is
      treatable with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. It is known to impair cognitive
      function, but whether treatment improves cognitive function is less clear. When already
      affected by a degenerative process like PD, the brain might be more vulnerable to the effects
      of OSA, and more responsive to OSA treatment. To date, OSA has not been recognized as a
      significant factor in PD. In preliminary work in PD patients, the investigators have found an
      association between OSA and poor cognition, and cognitive improvement with PAP therapy. The
      investigators now wish to more rigorously evaluate the effect of OSA treatment on cognitive
      function in PD in a randomized controlled trial. The investigators primary objective is to
      assess, in PD patients with OSA and cognitive deficit, the effect of OSA treatment on global
      cognitive function. The investigators will also assess other non-motor symptoms of PD,
      quality of life, and specific domains of neurocognitive function. PD patients will be
      recruited from the McGill Movement Disorders Clinic and other Quebec Parkinson Network
      Centres. Participants will need to have evidence of cognitive deficit and presence of OSA on
      screening diagnostic polysomnography (sleep study). Ninety subjects will be randomly assigned
      to PAP or nasal dilator strips. Detailed neuropsychological testing and other measurements
      (including quality of life) will be done at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. At the end of
      the study period, subjects will have polysomnography on their respective treatment to assess
      efficacy with respect to OSA treatment. This study may demonstrate that a non-pharmacologic
      intervention has the potential to have a marked beneficial impact on cognitive function and
      quality of life in a significant proportion of PD patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Idiopathic Parkinson's disease as per the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank
             criteria

          -  Evidence of cognitive dysfunction (clinical impression of mild cognitive impairment
             and MOCA &lt;=27)

          -  Presence of OSA (apnea-hypopnea index RDI â‰¥ 15/h) on screening diagnostic
             polysomnography (PSG)

          -  Stable regimen of anti-PD medication for 1 month prior and during the trial

          -  Adequate knowledge of English or French for completion of study assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Oxygen saturation &lt;75% for &gt;10% of the diagnostic polysomnography as this should lead
             to active PAP treatment

          -  Active cancer or other disorder with an expected survival &lt; 6 months

          -  Active treatment of OSA (prior diagnosis of OSA will constitute an exclusion criterion
             only if the patient is currently being treated for the OSA)

          -  Significant vision or hearing impairment that could affect performance on
