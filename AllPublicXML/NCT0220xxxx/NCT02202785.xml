  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of MLN0264 in
      patients with advanced or metastatic guanylyl cyclase C (GCC)-positive adenocarcinoma of the
      pancreas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0264. MLN0264 is being tested to treat
      tumors in people who have metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas expressing guanylyl
      cyclase C (GCC). This study will assess tumor size reduction in patients who are administered
      MLN0264.

      The study will enroll 42 to 81 patients. All participants will be administered MLN0264 at 1.8
      mg/kg as a single, 30-minute, intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment
      cycle, followed by a rest period of 20 days. Participants will continue to receive MLN0264
      for up to 1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 19 months. Participants will make 3 to 6 visits to the clinic per
      treatment cycle, an end-of-treatment visit will occur 30 days after the last dose of study
      medication, and follow-up assessments will occur every 12 weeks until death or 6 months after
      the last patient completes treatment - whichever occurs first.

CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion, and no new lesions. SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter (LD) since the treatment started.</description>
