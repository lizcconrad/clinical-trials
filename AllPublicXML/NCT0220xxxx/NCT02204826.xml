  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Korean Red ginseng (KRG) has long been applied to various diseases as a health-promoting
      herbal medicine in Korea. Many clinical studies of ginseng have been performed to elucidate
      its therapeutic characteristics. KRG has been shown to be effective in many diseases, such as
      cancers, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
      and sexual dysfunction. Several studies have indicated effects of ginseng on improving
      spermatogenesis in animals. The major mechanisms behind these effects were speculated to be
      anti-oxidant and anti-aging effects, as well as modulation of the
      hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis [7 - 10]. However, there have been no controlled human
      clinical trials to evaluate the effects of KRG on spermatogenesis in patients with male
      infertility.

      Only a small proportion of causes of male infertility are currently curable, including male
      hypogonadal disorders that can be cured by gonadotropic agents, and obstructive azoospermia
      that can be corrected by surgery. In addition, evidence-based medicine has revealed that most
      empirical treatments are ineffective. Similarly, the efficacies of carnitine, anti-estrogens,
      kallikrein, vitamins C and E, and glutathione have not been confirmed.

      Therefore, the investigators investigated the effects of KRG on semen parameters in male
      infertility patients. This is the first placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the therapeutic
      effects of KRG in male patients.

    <description>The KRG capsules were provided by Korean Ginseng Corporation (Daejeon, Korea). KRG powder was manufactured from roots of a 6-year-old red ginseng, Panax ginseng Meyer, harvested in Republic of Korea. KRG was made by steaming fresh ginseng at 90-100 ◦C for 3 h and then drying at 50-80 ◦C.
KRG powder prepared from grinded red ginseng (KRG capsule : 500mg/capsule). KRG was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. KRG extract contained major ginsenoside-Rb1: 4.26mg/g, -Rb2: 1.62mg/g, -Rc: 1.80mg/g, -Rd: 0.29mg/g, -Re: 1.71mg/g, -Rf: 0.67mg/g, -Rg1: 2.61mg/g, -Rg2: 0.20mg/g, -Rg3: 0.13mg/g, and other minor ginsenosides. During the study period, three capsules were taken daily for 12 weeks.</description>
