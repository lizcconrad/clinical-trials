  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is more common in areas of the world with less sunlight exposure. Sunlight is
      a major source of vitamin D. There is some research to suggest that patient's with higher
      vitamin D levels are less likely to undergo surgeries and have better control of their
      disease. We intend to study the effects of high dose vitamin D supplementation in patients
      with vitamin D deficiency and Crohn's disease. We hypothesize that patients given high doses
      will have less hospitalizations, surgeries, steroid use.

      Subjects are randomized to low or high dose vitamin D, and outcomes including steroid
      prescriptions, CD-related hospitalizations, CD-related surgeries, and the modified
      Harvey-Bradshaw Index are measured.

    <measure>Change in Modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI Without Examination)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>modified Harvey-Bradshaw is a disease assessment scale. 0 is the lowest score and would be considered remission. Scale ranges to over 16 (upper limit is defined by the number of bowel movements in the prior day) with numbers over 16 being severe disease. A positive change (such as that indicated below) therefore references slightly worsening disease while a negative change references improving disease.
Originally planned to collect at Day 180 and Day 360. Only 1 subject remained in the study to Day 180 so that data is presented here. 1 subject had an increase of 1 unit on the modified HBI.</description>

        <title>Change in Modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI Without Examination)</title>
        <description>modified Harvey-Bradshaw is a disease assessment scale. 0 is the lowest score and would be considered remission. Scale ranges to over 16 (upper limit is defined by the number of bowel movements in the prior day) with numbers over 16 being severe disease. A positive change (such as that indicated below) therefore references slightly worsening disease while a negative change references improving disease.
Originally planned to collect at Day 180 and Day 360. Only 1 subject remained in the study to Day 180 so that data is presented here. 1 subject had an increase of 1 unit on the modified HBI.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Very few patients with inactive disease had low vitamin D levels, so most patients screened were ineligible. This made recruitment very slow, and the project was terminated.Suggests low vitamin D could be a marker of activity, rather than a cause</limitations_and_caveats>
