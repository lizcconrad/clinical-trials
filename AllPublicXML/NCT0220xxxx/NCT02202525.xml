  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this prospective, multicentre, french observational study is to analyse
      the evolution of pulse pressure (PP) and to identify its prognostic factors in hypertensive
      patients three months after initiation of a new hypertensive therapy. The PP is defined as
      the difference between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
