  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to confirm the safety profile of telmisartan (benefit-risk ratio) under normal
      conditions of use after market launch and to supplement the present data on the safety of
      telmisartan. Furthermore to assess effectiveness of a single dose of telmisartan per day to
      control blood pressure for 24 hours, especially during the last few hours of the dosage
      interval. Additionally to evaluate compliance with treatment, as an indirect measurement, and
      to confirm the efficacy and possible risks associated with treatment.
