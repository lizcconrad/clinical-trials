             coca cola drinks/ day).

          8. Abnormal physical findings of clinical significance at the screening examination or
             baseline which would interfere with the objectives of the study.

          9. Need of any prescription medication within 14 days prior to the administration of the

             msec, bradycardia (&lt;50 bpm) or clinically significant minor ST wave changes or any
             other abnormal changes on the screening ECG that would interfere with measurement of
             the QT interval.

         14. Symptoms of a significant somatic or mental illness in the four week period preceding
             drug administration.

         15. History of hepatitis HBV and / or HCV and / or positive serology results which
