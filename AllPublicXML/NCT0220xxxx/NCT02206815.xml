  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess safety of antithrombotic drug ticagrelor plus oral
      anticoagulation adopted in persistent or permanent AF(Atrial fibrillation)
      patients（CHA2DS2VASc≥2） after PCI-S with specially regard to the occurrence of major bleeding
      complications. We hypothesized that baseline characteristics (ie age, anemia, previous major
      bleeding) and type of antithrombotic regimen could influence any bleeding events and the time
      of bleeding occurrence. We will test this hypothesis by comparing those AF patients who
      subsequently received double antithrombotic therapy (Ticagrelor + Warfarin) vs. triple
      antithrombotic therapy (Clopidogrel + Aspirin + Warfarin) after undergoing PCI-S.

    <textblock>
      Currently, the optimal antithrombotic treatment of AF patients with indication for long-term
      oral anticoagulation undergoing PCI-S is unknown. The randomized trials to assess the best
      antithrombotic regimen in this setting and the management of this population are challenging.
      It poses imperative demands for future prospective randomized studies to define the optimal
      antithrombotic regimen in patients requiring chronic anticoagulation undergoing coronary
      stenting. Additionally, the vast majority of current clinical studies about antithrombotic
      therapy for atrial fibrillation together with PCI were retrospectively analysis to date
      ,whereas the prospective studies are rare and urgently needed
