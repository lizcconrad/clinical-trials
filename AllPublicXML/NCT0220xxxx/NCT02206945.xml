  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to train patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder to control a
      region of their brain that has been associated with their symptoms. Patients in the
      experimental group will be given direct feedback regarding activity in this brain area while
      they are undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, and will try to
      learn to control activity in the region during these feedback sessions. A separate group of
      patients will be given a control form of feedback that we do not believe can have clinical
      benefits. Our primary hypothesis is that the neurofeedback training will reduce OCD symptoms
      more than the control feedback.
