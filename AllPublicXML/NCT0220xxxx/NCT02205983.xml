  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will examine the effects of buprenorphine, as compared to
      placebo, upon physiological, subjective, and hormonal responses to a stressful speech task
      and a non-stressful control task in healthy adults. There is strong evidence in support of
      the role of endogenous opioids and opiates in mediating social behavior in humans and other
      animals, and particularly, in social distress. The investigators have recently shown that
      buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, reduces cortisol responses to stress. Here, the
      investigators propose to further explore the role of the opioid system in mediating stress
      responses in humans through the use of hydromorphone, a full mu opioid agonist, in addition
      to buprenorphine. The investigators hypothesize that like buprenorphine, hydromorphone will
      reduce both physiological and subjective measures of stress.

      Participants be randomly assigned to receive .2mg buprenorphine, 2mg hydromorphone, 4mg
      hydromorphone, or placebo at each of two sessions; one during which they well participate in
      a stressful speaking task, and one during which they'll participate in a nonstressful control
      task. Physiological and subjective measures will be taken throughout each session.

    <measure>Salivary Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 5 times (approx every 40 minutes) at each of two 4-hour laboratory sessions, conducted 7 days apart</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva samples for cortisol analysis will be obtained using cotton wands (Salivette, Sarstedt, Gemany). Levels of cortisol in saliva will be measured using standardized methods at the University of Chicago Endocrinology Laboratory.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate and blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 6 times (every half hour) at each of two 4-hour laboratory sessions, conducted 7 days apart</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate will be measured continuously and blood pressure readings and respiratory rate will be obtained at the dependent measures time points throughout the experimental session. Information about autonomic reactivity to stress will be obtained with the use of ECG electrodes.</description>

    <description>• The Profile of Mood States (POMS, McNair D. 1971): This version of the POMS consists of 72 adjectives commonly used to describe momentary mood states. Subjects indicate how they feel at the moment in relation to each of the 72 adjectives on a 5-point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;extremely&quot; (4). Eight clusters (scales) of items have been separated empirically using factor analysis (Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Vigor, Fatigue, Confusion, Friendliness, Elation). Two summary scales are derived from the other scales: Arousal=(Anxiety + Vigor) - (Fatigue + Confusion); Positive Mood=Elation - Depression.</description>

    <description>• The Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ, Johanson and Uhlenhuth 1980) VAS contains four questions; &quot;Do you fee any drug effect?&quot; (rated from &quot;none at all&quot; to &quot;a lot&quot;), &quot;Do you like the effects you are feeling now?&quot; (rated from &quot;dislike&quot; to &quot;like very much&quot;), &quot;Are you high?&quot; (rated from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very&quot;), and &quot;Would you like more of what you consumed, right now?&quot; (rated from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Genetic analysis of SNPs associated with physiological and subjective responses to the verbal task (cortisol, heart rate and blood pressure, anxiety).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>DNA samples will be collected to contribute to a larger database of samples from subjects who have participated in previous stress studies in the laboratory. This database of genetic information and responses to acute stress will help us to identify genes and polymorphisms associated with adverse stress reactions that may contribute to an individual's susceptibility to develop stress-linked disorders, including drug addiction.</description>
