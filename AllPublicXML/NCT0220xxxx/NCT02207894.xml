      This research program is initiated to evaluate and document data on the success of ITI in 300
      haemophilia A patients with newly developed or already existing FVIII-inhibitors (also
      patients who might potentially have failed in earlier ITIs), which will be treated with ITI -
      preferably high-dose based on individualized product selection, in order to improve
      management of this potentially devastating complication of haemophilia treatment.

      In order to investigate the role of in vitro tests on individual ITI success rate in patients
      undergoing ITI, the inhibitor plasma samples can be assayed against different FVIII
      concentrates using the following in vitro tests: Batch selection, Thrombin generation assay
      (TGA), Thrombin Generation Test (TGT) to monitor FVIII efficacy, Epitope mapping,IgG
      Subclasses specific for FVIII, Immunogenotyping.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a result of many technological advances in the last two decades, current factor VIII
      (FVIII) concentrates (both plasma-derived and recombinant products) are considered very safe
      in terms of pathogen safety.

      The development of inhibitors against FVIII or factor IX (FIX) is considered as a major
      complication during replacement therapy of haemophiliacs.

      Prospective studies of previously untreated patients (PUPs) have suggested that inhibitors
      develop in up to 33% of patients with moderate to severe haemophilia A. Several strategies
      are used to control bleedings in such patients, e.g. high-dose treatment with FVIII
      concentrates, treatment with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) or treatment
      with activated factor VII (FVIIa).

      Immune tolerance induction (ITI) in order to eradicate inhibitors in patients suffering from
      an inhibitor to FVIII with high dose treatment of FVIII was first reported in 1977 by
      Brackmann &amp; Gormsen in the so-called &quot;Bonn Protocol&quot; and was investigated from then on in a
      series of clinical studies applying the same or a modified version of the &quot;Bonn Protocol&quot;.
      During these investigations high dose FVIII treatment has been proven efficacious in inducing
      immune tolerance and was shown to exert a long lasting effect in more than 80 % of the
      patients treated.

      The observational immune tolerance induction research program (ObsITI) will allow a
      systematic prospective and retrospective data documentation and analysis on the success rate
      of ITI by using individualized concentrate selection.

      In order to investigate the role of in vitro tests on individual ITI success rate in patients
      undergoing ITI, the inhibitor plasma samples can be assayed against different FVIII
      concentrates using the following in vitro tests:

        1. Batch selection: The potential variation in inhibitor reactivity with different FVIII
           concentrates/batches of the same concentrate can optionally be studied according to a
           modified Oxford method (HZRM Hämophilie-Zentrum Rhein Main, Germany).

        2. Thrombin generation assay (TGA): In this optional in vitro test the plasma samples from
           an inhibitor patient can be spiked with different concentrates and the thrombin
           generation will be measured using the TGA to evaluate the potential of different FVIII
           concentrates to generate thrombin (Haemophilia Centre Malmö, Sweden).

        3. Thrombin Generation Test (TGT) to monitor FVIII efficacy: TGT will evaluate the
           correlation between clinical bleeding phenotype of patients and their thrombin
           generation capacity before and during ITI in order to predict the patients with the
           highest risk of bleeding. In vitro efficacy of two FVIII doses (low and high) in the
           presence and absence of FEIBA 80IU/kg will be evaluated. The aim of this study is to
           evaluate the correlation between the clinical bleeding phenotype of inhibitor patients
           before and during ITI in order to detect patients with the highest bleeding risk.

        4. Epitope mapping: The antibody epitopes on FVIII will be identified by screening peptide
           libraries and FVIII fragments with inhibitor patient plasma. This will help to identify
           relevant epitopes recognised by inhibitors in haemophilia A. This research program will
           give an opportunity to comprehensively study various aspects of inhibitors and the
           induction of immunotolerance in a relevant number of patients. Knowledge about relevant
           epitopes from patient plasma rather than from model systems (i.e. monoclonal antibodies
           or mouse models) will help to understand the immune response to FVIII and to develop
           novel strategies to deplete inhibitors or inhibitor secreting B cells (University
           Hospital Frankfurt, Laboratory for Molecular Haemostasis and Immunodeficiencies,
           Frankfurt, Germany).

        5. IgG Subclasses specific for FVIII: Plasma samples will be tested for IgG-subclasses
           specific for FVIII. Most inhibitors belong to the subclasses IgG1 and IgG4. There are
           some indications that the ratio of IgG1 and IgG4 might influence ITI outcome (University
           Hospital Frankfurt, Laboratory for Molecular Haemostasis and Immunodeficiencies,
           Frankfurt, Germany).

        6. Immunogenotyping: In addition this study will investigate genetic risk factors (gene
           defect responsible for haemophilia, HLA class II alleles, immune response genes) as a
           potential variable with impact on course and outcome of ITI. Recently a significantly
           higher inhibitor incidence has been found in patients (brothers) with IL-10.G allele
           134, TNFA - 308G&gt;A polymorphism within Hap and polymorphisms in the CTLA-4-gene compared
           to those brothers without the above mentioned polymorphisms (University Hospital Bonn,
           Haemophilia Centre, Bonn, Germany).

        7. Immune-monitoring of patients undergoing ITI: The evolution of several &quot; markers &quot; of
           the immune response during the treatment of inhibitor-positive patients with high dose
           FVIII will be evaluated in a subgroup of ≥40 patients. The goal of this study is to
           identify the &quot; immune markers &quot; that may predict the positive outcome of immune
           tolerance induction, (Sebastien Lacroix-Desmazes, INSERM, Paris, France, and Christoph
           Königs, Laboratory for Molecular Haemostasis and Immunodeficiencies at the University
           Hospital Frankfurt, Germany.
