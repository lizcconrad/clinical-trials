      The purpose of the study is to characterize the distribution and sources of variability in
      whole blood clotting time (WBCT) measurements in human blood collected from healthy
      volunteers by 5 different technicians.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated, written informed consent (Institutional Review Board [IRB]-approved
             informed consent form [ICF]).

          2. Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) with suitable veins
             for venipuncture. (Healthy as determined by medical history)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects who do not conform to the above inclusion criteria.

          2. Healthy subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator.

          3. History of major bleeding or major trauma within the past 6 months

          4. Healthy volunteer with a propensity to bleed (i.e. due to recent trauma, recent
             surgery, peptic ulcer, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding or bleeding from
             hemorrhoids).

          5. Significant infection or known inflammatory process within 2 weeks of screening.

          6. Treatment with any investigational products or therapies within 30 days (or 5 half
             lives, whichever is greater) prior to screening.

          7. Received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) or medications (including any type of
             anticoagulant or aspirin [ASA]) with a direct effect on hemostasis within 7 days of
             testing

          8. Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol.

          9. Subjects who are concurrently enrolled in any other clinical study.
