  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive training has emerged as a promising method to maintain, enhance, and rehabilitate
      cognitive function in older adults and individuals with dementia. In recent years, such
      training has become particularly appealing in the clinical context, with many paradigms aimed
      specifically at adults experiencing various stages of cognitive decline due to Mild Cognitive
      Impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementias. However, basic questions remain. For
      example, uncertainty persists regarding factors that influence observed improvements as well
      as the conditions that would maximize transfer and sustainability of training effects. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate factors that may maximize the benefits of computerized
      cognitive training in older adults.
