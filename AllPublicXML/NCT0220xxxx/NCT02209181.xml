  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and effectiveness one dose of a new pain reliever medicine (JNJ-10450232
      at either the 250 or 1000 mg strength) compared with placebo (sugar pill) or acetaminophen
      1000 mg after surgical removal of third molars. The primary endpoint will evaluate pain
      relief effectiveness up to 6 hours after administration of the study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel
      group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profile of JNJ-10450232,
      administered as a single dose in capsules (250 or 1000 mg), over a 24 hour period after molar
      extractions. Subjects will stay at the research center for ~24 hours after administration of
      study drug. Healthy male subjects, ages 18 to 45 years inclusive, will be screened by medical
      history, vital signs, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests. Eligible
      subjects will return to the clinic on the day of surgery and complete baseline vital signs
      and clinical laboratory tests. They will undergo dental extraction of a minimum of three
      third-molars and, if qualified, will be randomly assigned to one of four study treatments for
      pain.

    <measure>Analgesic Efficacy From 0 to 6 Hours After the Dose Using the Time-weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID 0-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Time-weighted sum of pain intensity difference by first multiplying each pain intensity difference (PID) score by the time from the previous time point, and adding them together for each scheduled time point within 0-6 hours. Time points included 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. The minimum SPID 0-6 was -30 and the maximum SPID 0-6 was 60, where higher is better. Pain intensity is the amount of pain experienced on a scale of 1-10 (where 1=no pain and 10=very severe pain).</description>

        <title>Analgesic Efficacy From 0 to 6 Hours After the Dose Using the Time-weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID 0-6)</title>
        <description>Time-weighted sum of pain intensity difference by first multiplying each pain intensity difference (PID) score by the time from the previous time point, and adding them together for each scheduled time point within 0-6 hours. Time points included 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. The minimum SPID 0-6 was -30 and the maximum SPID 0-6 was 60, where higher is better. Pain intensity is the amount of pain experienced on a scale of 1-10 (where 1=no pain and 10=very severe pain).</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity Difference From Baseline (PID) Scores at 24 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>Pain intensity is the amount of pain experienced on a scale of 1-10 (where 1=no pain and 10=very severe pain). The PID will be derived by subtracting the pain intensity from the baseline pain intensity.</description>

      <desc>Adverse events (AEs) were systematically collected during the study and during the adverse event follow-up telephone interview within 7 days after dental surgery. Serious AEs were reported through 30 days after product use. Spontaneously reported AEs collected outside of the regularly scheduled telephone interviews were also recorded. Any clinically important abnormalities or causally-related AEs events persisting were followed until resolution or until reaching a clinically stable endpoint.</desc>
