  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of safety and tolerability of four intradermal injections given at two week
      intervals. In addition the efficacy of transferrinfection was determined by quantifying
      Interleukin 2 (IL-2), which was locally produced by the implanted, transfected allogenic
      melanoma cells at the injection sites. Further determination of tumor specific and clinical
      host responses induced or augmented by the treatment were determined.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy or for whom conventional therapy
             is not available

          -  Metastatic melanoma (stage IV AJCC) which is surgically or medically incurable because
             of distant metastatic disease (i.e., a metastasis not in the same lymph node draining
             area as the primary malignant melanoma). Histologic confirmation of stage IV is
             required. Measurable disease that can be routinely assessed by physical examination
             and/or non-invasive radiological procedures

          -  Karnofsky performance status is at least 60% and life expectancy greater than 4 months

          -  Male or female, minimum age 18 years

          -  Written informed consent of the patient in accordance with good clinical practice and
             local legislation

          -  Availability of material for autologous Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) testing
             (material derived from autologous melanoma metastases and in-house preparation
             successful) is a requisite for entering the study

          -  Patients have to undergo biopsy of at least one metastasis before the first and after

             Colony Stimulating Factor, Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor) or any other
             investigational drugs in the 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination or prior to
             surgical removal of tumor specimens for DTH material preparation (patients are not
             permitted to receive such therapies 4 weeks prior to first cell inoculation except of
             tumor reductive surgery which are medically indicated)

          -  Patients with active intracranial metastases (CT/MRI) or choroidal melanoma

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease

          -  Patients with organ allografts

             class III or IV), history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias or
             angina], coagulation disorder, respiratory or nervous system disorder or with severe
             endocrinological disease

          -  Women of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test or without appropriate
             contraception (e.g. IUD [ Intra-Uterine Device], oral contraceptives) until at least
             28 days after the last vaccination

          -  Lactating women

          -  Impaired renal or hepatic function (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine
             clearance &lt; 75 ml/min). In amendments 1 and 3 serum creatinine levels were changed to
             2.5 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was reduced to 30 ml/min

          -  Impaired hematologic function with:

               -  White Blood Count (WBC) &lt; 2500/mm**3 or

               -  absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 1500/mm**3 or

               -  hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl or

               -  platelets &lt; 100,000/mm**3
