      The purpose of this study is to examine the placement, timing, associated complications,
      efficacy of temporary and tunneled catheters for renal replacement therapy in patient with
      acute kidney injury. In particular, we will be assessing renal replacement adequacy for
      patients on dialysis and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration by monitoring urea reduction
      ratios, venous and arterial pressures. We will also be monitoring infection rates. We will
      compare these outcomes in patients receiving tunneled catheters and patients receiving
      temporary catheters.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dialysis adequacy</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7d after starting renal replacement therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Adequacy will be measured using urea reduction ratio for patients on intermittent hemodialysis. For continuous renal replacement therapy, we will record the maximum blood flow rate achievable. These measurements/recordings will be made on average within 1-3 days of starting therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>blood stream infection rates</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30d of catheter placement</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be followed throughout their hospitalization, which can range from a few days to several weeks. Bloodstream infections within 30d of catheter placement will be recorded.</description>
