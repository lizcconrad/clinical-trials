      Study is a multicenter, two-part, open-label phase II study in adults, evaluating the safety
      and long-term efficacy of PF-06473871 one year after surgical revision and treatment with
      PF-06473871.

    <measure>Physician Scar Assessment Using Complete Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) at Part A Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after initial scar revision surgery in study B5301001</time_frame>
    <description>Physician scar assessment was performed using 10-point POSAS scale. Physician rated each of the items (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, surface area and overall opinion) for a scar on a score of 1 (normal skin) to 10 (worst scar imaginable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part B: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Vital Sign Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>Part B: Baseline up to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs included pulse rate and systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part B: Number of Participants With Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>Part B: Baseline up to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical laboratory tests included clinical chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, calcium, total, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), uric acid, amylase and lipase) and hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC) with differential, and platelet count) tests to be performed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part B: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Part B: Baseline up to Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 112 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Data for this outcome measure was not analyzed because part B was not initiated due to early termination of the study during Part A.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Assessment Using Overall Opinion of Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) at Part A Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after initial scar revision surgery in study B5301001</time_frame>
    <description>Patient global assessment was performed using the overall opinion question of the POSAS scale. Participants were asked to rate the severity of their scar compared to normal skin. The overall opinion scale score ranged from 1 (normal skin) to 10 (very different from normal skin).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Scar Evaluation Questionnaire (PR-SEQ) Symptom and Appearance Domain Score at Part A Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after initial scar revision surgery in study B5301001</time_frame>
    <description>PR-SEQ questionnaire consisted of 30 different attributes of scars that included following four dimensions: appearance (5 attributes), symptoms (3 attributes), bothersomeness (8 attributes), and impacts on the quality of life (physical and emotional wellbeing [14 attributes]). Each question had 5 possible responses: not at all (0), slightly (1), moderately (2), very (3), and extremely (4). Subjects completed an abbreviated version which included only the Symptoms and Appearance dimensions to evaluate treatment outcomes. Each of the item scores were transformed into a 0 to 100 scale. Each dimension score was calculated from averaging the transformed scores (0 to 100 scaled) for specified items. Each domain score ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician and Participant Photoguide Scar Assessment Scale Score at Part A Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after initial scar revision surgery in study B5301001</time_frame>
    <description>Physician and participants rated severity of each scar using a photonumeric guide on a scale ranging from 1 to 5 (where 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, 5 = very severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Volumetric &amp; Colorimetric Scar Assessment (3D Imaging) at Part A Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after initial scar revision surgery in study B5301001</time_frame>
    <description>Three-dimension digital photography was planned to be taken of the participants scars for determination of scar volume, height, and color performed in a subset of selected investigational centers equipped with specialized 3D photographic equipment.</description>

        <description>PR-SEQ questionnaire consisted of 30 different attributes of scars that included following four dimensions: appearance (5 attributes), symptoms (3 attributes), bothersomeness (8 attributes), and impacts on the quality of life (physical and emotional wellbeing [14 attributes]). Each question had 5 possible responses: not at all (0), slightly (1), moderately (2), very (3), and extremely (4). Subjects completed an abbreviated version which included only the Symptoms and Appearance dimensions to evaluate treatment outcomes. Each of the item scores were transformed into a 0 to 100 scale. Each dimension score was calculated from averaging the transformed scores (0 to 100 scaled) for specified items. Each domain score ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher severity.</description>
