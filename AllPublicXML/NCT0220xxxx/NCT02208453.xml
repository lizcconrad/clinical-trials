      A single arm, open-label, prospective, study to assess the feasibility, efficacy and safety
      of InSpace™ device implantation in a procedure under local anesthesia for a treatment of
      subjects with massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear.

      Subjects with radiological confirmed massive RCT who are eligible per inclusion/exclusion
      criteria, will be enrolled for the study treatment.

      Subjects will undergo surgical intervention under local anesthesia , fluoroscopic and/ or
      arthroscopic visualization of InSpace™ implantation.

      Subjects will then be followed for safety and efficacy for a 24 months following the
      implantation.

      The study objective is to assess the feasibility, efficacy and safety of the InSpace™ Device
      implantation in a surgical procedure under local anesthesia using arthroscopic and/or
      fluoroscopic visualization of the affected shoulder.

      The efficacy will be assess by using Constant and ASES outcome score The Constant and the
      ASES will be completed by the investigator at each study visit .The patient will complete the
      patient self-evaluation part of the ASES at each study visit.

      The Safety assessment will be conducted by collecting all device related AEs/SAEs throughout
      the entire study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 50 or older.

          2. Positive diagnostic MRI of the affected shoulder indicating full thickness massive
             irreparable RCT of at least 5cm in diameter (according to Cofield classification)
             including fatty infiltration grade III or IV (according to classification of
             Goutallier).

          3. Persistent pain and failure of non-operative treatment of the affected shoulder for at
             least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known allergy to the balloon material

          2. Evidence of significant osteoarthritis or cartilage damage in the shoulder

          3. Evidence of gleno-humeral instability

          4. Evidence of major joint trauma, infection, or necrosis in the shoulder

          5. Major medical condition or known drug or alcohol abuses that could affect quality of
             life and influence the results of the study.

          6. Concurrent participation in any other invasive clinical study one month prior to
             enrollment to the study and during the entire study period.

          7. Subjects with worker's compensation claims or other litigation claims related to the
             shoulder being treated in the study.
