  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the outcome of patients with pathologies of the
      ascending thoracic aorta (diseases in the great blood vessel or artery that leads away from
      the heart) including type A aortic dissection, retrograde type A aortic dissection,
      intramural hematoma, penetrating ulcer or pseudoaneurysm who are suitable for endovascular
      (within the vessel) repair with the Medtronic Valiant PS-IDE (Physician
      Sponsored-Investigational Device Exemption) Stent Graft. Type A aortic dissection is a
      condition where blood passes through the inner lining or between the layers of the blood
      vessel from a tear in the aortic wall (dissection) in the ascending aorta; a retrograde Type
      A aortic dissection is a condition where the dissection or tear in the ascending aorta starts
      from the descending aorta; an intramural hematoma is a collection of clotted blood within the
      aortic wall; a penetrating ulcer has a plaque or clot within the wall and a pseudoaneurysm is
      a false aneurysm . If left untreated in any of these conditions, the aorta can enlarge and
      rupture causing injury or death. The plan for these patients is to repair the ascending
      thoracic aorta using the Medtronic Valiant PS-IDE Stent Graft with the Captivia Delivery
      System. The Valiant Captivia has been evaluated worldwide and used extensively in patients
      with type B (descending) thoracic aortic dissection. Since the dissections in the ascending
      aortas mirror that of the descending aorta, it is expected that this stent graft will deliver
      similar performance and endurance in patients with type A aortic dissection. The
      investigators expect to reroute the blood to the true lumen (the inner space within the blood
      vessel) by covering the proximal (nearest to the heart) tear with the stent graft. The stent
      graft is a stent frame made from Nitinol wire and covered with an expandable material made of
      a polyester material. This new study will determine how well the device works to treat
      dissections, intramural hematomas, penetrating ulcers and pseudoaneurysms in the ascending
      thoracic aorta.

      This is a prospective study with 20 patients planned to be enrolled. Patients who participate
      will be followed for 5 years after the surgery in which the stent graft was implanted. This
      will include the following schedule: A CT with and without contrast and echocardiogram 30
      days after the Medtronic device is implanted, CT with and without contrast at 6 and 12 months
      post procedure and once a year from 2 years thru 5 years after the implant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have a Type A thoracic aortic dissection, retrograde Type A thoracic
             aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, penetrating ulcer or pseudoaneurysm of the
             ascending thoracic aorta affecting the area between the Sinus of Valsalva and the
             innominate artery orifice (with no involvement of the aortic valve) and be considered
             candidates for endovascular repair;
