    <textblock>
      Background： The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high in Taiwan. Though there
      are many factors that may affect the measurement of serum creatinine, it is a well-accepted
      marker for renal function assessment. The creatinine clearance (ClCr) estimated by
      Cockcroft-Gault is commonly used as a reference for dosage adjustment; while the estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) is used in
      CKD staging. ClCr and eGFR not only have different units, but the results of estimation from
      the two varied among races and individuals. Since 2010, US Food and Drug Administration
      required both the influences of ClCr and eGFR on the pharmacokinetics of a drug in renal
      insufficient patients during pharmacokinetic studies. Because most drugs are excreted through
      kidney, an understanding on the relationship between ClCr and eGFR is important to dose
      safely and effectively. Furthermore, identifying the factors that may influence the
      difference between ClCr and eGFR can provide in-depth consideration during clinical renal
      function assessment.

      Purpose： The purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation between different ClCr and
      eGFR equations in order to provide better renal dose. We also want to find the factors that
      may cause the differences between them.

      Methods： This study will conduct literature review to understand study population during the
      development of different ClCr and eGFR equations, as well as their scope of application.
      National Taiwan University Hospital electronic patient database will be used to analyze the
      correlation between ClCr and eGFR and to identify factors that may influence the difference
      between ClCr and eGFR. The data from patients who have completed 12-hr or 24-hr urine
      collection with calculated renal function will be used to verify the applicability of these
      equations (including a ClCr equation developed by our institute) in Taiwanese.
      Pharmacokinetic principles will be used to analyze the appropriate unit to be used for renal
      function while dosing a patient.
