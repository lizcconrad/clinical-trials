    <description>RO5479599 800 milligrams (mg) will be administered in the Safety Run-In Phase by intravenous infusion q3w on Day 1 of 3-weekly cycles (each cycle of 21 days) in combination with carboplatin (to produce an area under the curve [AUC] of 6 mg/milliliter [mL]*minute) and paclitaxel 200 mg per square meter (mg/m^2) by intravenous infusion q3w for 4 to 6 cycles. Thereafter, RO5479599 will be continued as a monotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel may be continued at the investigator's discretion) until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by sponsor, whichever occurs first.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             (PS) 0-1

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) squamous NSCLC

          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy, targeted therapy for metastatic NSCLC

          -  Evidence of at least one radiologically measurable lesion as per RECIST version 1.1

          -  Adequate hematological, liver and renal function

          -  Participants must agree to either remain completely abstinent or to use effective
             contraceptive methods from screening until 6 months after the last dose of study
             treatment

          -  Histologically confirmed squamous NSCLC participants eligible for enrollment must
             provide archival tumor biopsy tissue or if unavailable must be willing to undergo a
             fresh pretreatment primary tumor or metastatic biopsy

          -  Participants with Gilbert's Syndrome will be eligible for the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent therapy with any other investigational drug

          -  History or clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) primary tumors or
             metastases

          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases, which could affect
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus and/or significant cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled infection

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, a physical examination finding or a
             clinical laboratory finding, giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
             that would contraindicate the use of an investigational drug

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury less than (&lt;) 28 days prior to the first
             study treatment infusion (excluding biopsies) or anticipation of the need for major
             surgery during study treatment

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  History of other malignancies that could affect compliance with protocol or
             interpretation of results. Participants with malignancies diagnosed more than 5 years
             prior to study day one, adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal or
             squamous cell skin cancer are generally eligible
