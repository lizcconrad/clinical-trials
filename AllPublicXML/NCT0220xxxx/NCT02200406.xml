  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although substitution therapy has been shown to be highly effective to retain
      opioid-dependent patients in treatment and reduce drug use, this population is afflicted by
      numerous conditions including depression. Unfortunately, studies published thus far have
      reported inconsistent or no difference in response between placebo therapy and
      antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Objective: To assess the
      feasibility of Desvenlafaxine (DESV) administration among opioid-dependent subjects and
      explore its effect on depressive symptoms. Methods: Open-label pilot trial of 8 weeks of DESV
      50-100 mg/day in 20 methadone-maintained individuals with comorbid depressive symptoms at the
      Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal. Significance: This pilot study will lay down
      the foundation on which a larger multisite clinical trial could be conducted to examine DESV
      as new treatment for opioid-dependent population with comorbid depression.

      To assess the feasibility, tolerability and acceptability of 8 weeks of Desvenlafaxine (DESV)
      administration among opioid-dependent subjects in a methadone-maintenance program, we will
      collect detailed information on compliance to DESV treatment, side effects, methadone plasma
      levels, methadone dose changes and QTc measures.

      To explore the effects of DESV on depressive symptoms among opioid-dependent subjects on
      methadone-maintenance treatment. The severity and symptoms of depression will be evaluated by
      using the MADRS, the HRDS, and the CGI scale.

      To explore the effects of DESV on substance use, anxiety, craving, quality of life and
      suicidal risk.
