  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other 5 well-known
      hospitals in China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of recombinant human
      thrombopoietin combining with cyclosporin A for the treatment of adults with refractory
      immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), compared to cyclosporin A monotherapy.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicenter, randomized controlled trial
      of 120 steroid-resistant/relapsed ITP adult patients from 6 medical centers in China. One
      part of the participants are randomly selected to receive recombinant human thrombopoietin
      (given subcutaneously at a dose of 300 Units/kg for 14 consecutive days, following with a
      flexible dosage depending on platelet count until the 29th day), combining with cyclosporin A
      (given orally at a dose of 1.5-2.0mg/kg twice daily for 3 consecutive months, adjusted to
      maintain serum levels between 200-400 ng/ml and tapered by 50 mg/d per week if patients
      achieved a complete response). The others are selected to receive cyclosporin A monotherapy
      (given orally at a dose of 1.5-2.0mg/kg twice daily for 3 consecutive months, adjusted to
      maintain serum levels between 200-400 ng/ml and tapered by 50 mg/d per week if patients
      achieved a complete response). Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated
      before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order
      to report the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy compared to cyclosporin A
      monotherapy for the treatment of adults with steroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.
