  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III trial comparing, for newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients,
      nilotinib 600 mg BID as a standard arm and nilotinib 600 mg BID combined to interferon alfa 2
      a (pegylated form improving tolerance and maybe enhancing is efficacy) at increased doses for
      a total of 24 months of combination, in a 1:1 randomized manner. The assessment for the
      primary efficacy endpoint will be performed at 12 months (since nilotinib initiation) and is
      the rate patients obtaining MR4.5 will be measured at this time point.
