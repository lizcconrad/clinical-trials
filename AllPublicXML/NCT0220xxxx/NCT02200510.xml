  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop patient-provider clinical support tools to improve
      clinical practice, patient self-management, and disease outcomes in sickle cell disease
      during transition to adult care. The investigators hypothesize that these clinical support
      tools (patient tool, provider tool, and patient/parent web-based portal) will be feasible,
      user friendly, and beneficial. The investigators hypothesize that participants will
      demonstrate better disease self-efficacy at the end of the 6 week intervention and maintain
      these gains during the follow-up period (up to 1 year post-intervention).
