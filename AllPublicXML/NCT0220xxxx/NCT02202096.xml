  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that a comprehensive transitional care program based on the premise
      of a patient-centered medical home versus routine care reduces emergency room visits and
      hospital readmissions without increasing costs among cancer patients undergoing surgery at a
      large safety-net hospital.

    <description>Drs. Stefanos Millas (colorectal surgery) and Curtis Wray (surgical oncology) will be responsible for coordinating care with medical and radiation oncology as well as consulting when patients are readmitted to the hospital (if not admitted to the surgical service). Changes will be made to the clinic scheduling process for colorectal cancer surgery patients to minimize wait times, to allow them to be seen on a &quot;walk-in&quot; basis, and to prioritize visits for patients with urgent problems as identified by follow-up calls or inquiries to the Ask My Nurse hotline.</description>

    <description>Follow-up will occur within 24 hours of calling the Ask My Nurse number. Patients with emergent problems will be seen immediately by the surgical oncology team if available or the on call surgery team. Patients with non-urgent matters will be called by a member of the surgical oncology team. Arrangements will be made to see the patient in clinic or the ER within the next 8-16 hours depending upon severity and time of day.</description>
