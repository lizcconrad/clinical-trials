  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to evaluate the safety and toxicity proﬁle of intravesically
      administered multidrug regimen of Cabazitaxel, Cisplatin and Gemcitabine in treatment
      refractory Transitional Cell Carcinoma.The investigators propose to conduct a combined phase
      I trial to assess the safety, toxicity, and efﬁcacy of a novel multidrug intravesical regimen
      consisting of Cabazitaxel, Gemcitabine, and Cisplatin (CGC) in the treatment of BCG resistant
      non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. This phase I trial will have a
      combined dose and cycle-escalation scheme with enrollment of up to 24 patients.

    <textblock>
      Nonsurgical treatment strategies for BCG refractory bladder cancer have failed to prove
      themselves as reliable options for increased survival among this subset of bladder cancer
      patients. For these patients, removal of the bladder with all the associated perioperative
      risks and the subsequent reduction of quality of life, remains the only option. Prior
      attempts at second line treatments have included intravesical (within the bladder)
      monotherapy with a range of drugs including Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel (a taxane, similar to
      Cabazitaxel). These drugs have shown some potential improvement for a small number of
      patients Given the synergy of systemic chemotherapy, it is believed that a multidrug regimen
      would allow for further improvement in survival among these patients.
