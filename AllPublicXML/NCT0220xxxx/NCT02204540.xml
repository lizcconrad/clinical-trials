    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility of having study participants use webcams to participate in
      research studies. The study scientists hypothesize (1) that webcams will be an adequate
      method of detecting a participant's ability to perform a tasks for a clinical trial (e.g.,
      swallowing a pill, eating food) and (2) that a majority of study participants would be
      willing to use a webcam to participate in a research study.

  <detailed_description>

      In the first phase of this study, the study scientists will research and compare technologies
      that will be used in video monitoring via webcam. The study team will also develop a
      standardized protocol for using the webcam technology through hands-on testing (without the
      use of study participants).

      In the second phase of this study, video monitoring via webcam will be tested. Specifically,
      the study scientists will see whether the video recordings can be used to assess compliance
      to clinical interventions. Study participants will be recruited from among Pennington
      Biomedical Research Center employees and assigned to be either evaluators or testers. Testers
      will act as if they were study participants in a clinical study who are supposed to adhere to
      an intervention such as swallowing a pill or consuming food. They will be video-recorded by
      webcam while performing these tasks. Evaluators will then try to detect how well the testers
      followed the instructions for the task through in-person observation and by watching video
      recordings. Data from these tests will then be used to see whether watching the video
      recordings is as effective as watching in-person.

      In the third phase of this study, past, current, and potential study participants at
      Pennington Biomedical Research Center will be surveyed to determine their comfort with using
      webcams and their likeliness to opt to use webcams to participate in clinical studies.

    <measure>Sensitivity of Detecting Non-Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The sensitivity (true positive rate, as a percentage of total non-compliant events) of observers charged with detecting non-compliance to a mock study intervention will be tested both via in-person monitoring and monitoring by webcam. The mock study interventions that will be monitored will include pill swallowing and eating. Non-compliance events will be chosen from a defined list of non-compliant behaviors (e.g., tampering with the pill, spitting food into a napkin and not eating it), and will be performed by mock study participants. The observers will record the number of non-compliant events they actually observe the mock study participants performing. This data will be analyzed as described here in order to determine the validity of monitoring non-compliance by webcam, in comparison to in-person monitoring.</description>

    <description>The specificity (false positive rate, as a percentage of distinct events) and inter-rater agreement (as a percentage of total events and as calculated via Cohen's kappa) of observers who are charged with monitoring and recording non-compliance events in-person versus by webcam will also be assessed, similarly as described above.</description>
