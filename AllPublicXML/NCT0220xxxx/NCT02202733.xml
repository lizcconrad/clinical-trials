  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to use an iterative process to develop and refine a
      skill-based cooking intervention to decrease the consumption of energy from foods prepared
      away from home for evening meals, decrease energy intake, and promote a healthy weight in
      parents and children aged 3-10 years.

      Phase I. Conduct 2-4 focus groups with 6-10 caretaker, who report eating foods prepared away
      from home ≥3 times per week, per group to gain insight into current eating behaviors of foods
      prepared away from home, current perceptions about a home prepared evening meal, and barriers
      to preparing evening meals at home. Information gathered during Phase I will be used to
      inform intervention development in Phase II.

      Phase II. Develop, refine, and manualize a skill-based cooking intervention for
      overweight/obese caretakers of a child aged 3-10 years. The aim of Phase II is to test the
      feasibility of a skill-based cooking intervention to reduce the consumption of foods prepared
      away from home for the evening meal (e.g., pre-prepared frozen foods, restaurant foods, fast
      food, take-out), energy intake from evening meals, and promote a healthy weight in parents
      and children. Information collected during Phase I will inform the development of the
      skill-based cooking intervention. Once developed, the intervention will be refined with 6
      primary caretakers of a child, who meet criteria for being overweight/obese during a testing
      phase. Conducting the intervention with at least six families will provide the opportunity
      for further refinement of intervention procedures. The results will be important to
      demonstrate feasibility for a future pilot randomized controlled trial that will test the
      impact of a skill-based cooking intervention compared to a standard cooking demonstration
      where recipes are simply provided to families.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary Intake (Phase II only)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will be asked to complete a 7-day dietary record of what they and their child eat at the evening meal. For each evening meal, the caretaker will be asked to describe the meal type (fast food, restaurant, pre-prepared frozen meal, or home prepared); the specific foods and drinks consumed, and the amount consumed by the child. Data from dietary records will be input into Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) software and analyzed for energy intake, percent energy from fat, and food groups (fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, dairy) from the evening meal. Foods prepared away from home will be classified based on caretaker indication of fast food, restaurant, pre-prepared frozen meal, or home prepared on the dietary record.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caretaker Attitudes and Confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caretakers will report ease of providing foods prepared away from home (i.e., pre-prepared frozen meals, restaurant food, fast food, take-out) for an evening meal, ease of providing a home prepared evening meal, and their confidence with meal preparation using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Further caretakers will rate their ability, enjoyment of cooking and desire to cook on a 100-mm VAS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Costs</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caretakers will be provided with four visual images with each image showing one adult evening meal and two child evening meals. Caretaker will record the total cost of the meals shown in each image.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Portions</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caretakers will be provided with visual images of foods in different portion amounts and asked to identify which image best represents the amount their child would be served for dinner. Caretakers will also identify the images that best represent the amount they would serve themselves for dinner.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dinner Choices</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caretakers will complete a 10-question, open-ended questionnaire that solicits information related to choices of foods prepared away from home and foods prepared at home.</description>
