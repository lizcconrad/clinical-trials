  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is associated with poor wound healing and worse results after hand surgery.
      Nicotine and cigarette smoke has been shown to affect blood flow in blood vessels in the
      hand.

      Patients are increasingly using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as a method of quitting
      smoking. E-cigarettes consist of a replaceable nicotine cartridge, a heating element and a
      battery source. They are able to deliver vaporised nicotine in the absence of other
      ingredients found in normal cigarettes such as tar and carbon monoxide.

      Although e-cigarettes lack a lot of the harmful ingredients of regular cigarettes, nicotine
      still has toxic effects on the body. Nicotine causes the release of chemicals within the body
      that act to reduce blood flow in small blood vessels of the hand.

      E-cigarettes remain a controversial topic among healthcare professionals due to the lack of
      research surrounding them. A recently published literature review identified only three
      significant studies into the effects of smoking e-cigarettes. All of these studies showed the
      harmful effects of e-cigarettes on the lungs but to date, there is no published research
      investigating the effects of e-cigarettes on the blood flow within the small blood vessels of
      the hand.

      Currently, we advise patients to quit smoking after they sustain a hand injury to improve
      healing and recent research suggests that patients should be advised to quit smoking 4 weeks
      before routine hand surgery. However, there is no guidance on whether we should also advice
      patients to refrain from using e-cigarettes for this time period.

      Our aims are to answer the following questions:

        1. Do electronic cigarettes have any effect on the blood flow in the hand?

        2. Do we need to give cessation advice to patients with hand injuries who smoke electronic
           cigarettes?
