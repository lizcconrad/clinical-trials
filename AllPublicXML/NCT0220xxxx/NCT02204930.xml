      The purpose of this First in Man study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as
      to explore efficacy of PeproStat, a new peptide based coagulant (haemostat), when used in
      patients undergoing open liver resection surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in this study,
             confirmed by signing the informed consent documents

          -  Adult males and females ≥18 years of age

          -  Female subjects must be post-menopausal. Post-menopausal status is defined as any of
             the following: natural menopause with menses &gt;1 year ago; radiation induced
             oophorectomy with last menses &gt;1 year ago; chemotherapy induced menopause with 1 year
             interval since last menses

          -  Willing and able to comply with all protocol requirements including follow-up

          -  Subject must have a haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL at screening

          -  Subject must have a platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 at screening

          -  Subject is undergoing a planned open liver resection

          -  Male subjects must be willing and able to use adequate contraception from enrollment
             through to the 30 day follow-up visit

          -  During the surgery, the subject presents an identified target bleeding site (TBS) with
             oozing, mild or moderate bleeding, which conventional surgical techniques are
             insufficient to control and would otherwise be a candidate for standard haemostats

          -  During the surgery, subject presents no intraoperative complications, other than
             bleeding, that may interfere with study assessments as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is undergoing emergency surgical procedure

          -  Recipient of a liver transplant

          -  Females of child-bearing potential

          -  Active infection at the time of the liver resection

          -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 2.0 or APTT ratio &gt; 2.0 at screening

          -  Fibrinogen level &lt; 1.5g/L at screening

          -  History of thromboembolic disease and/or thrombophilia

          -  Any other disease or condition that may affect normal blood clotting, for example
             thrombocytopenia, as judged by the investigator

          -  A known history of anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to human albumin, PEGylated
             proteins, yeast or moulds, porcine products or other components in the IMP

          -  Participation in another investigational drug or device research study within 30 days
             before and after enrolment in the current study

          -  Current known or suspected alcohol and/or drug abuse or dependence at the time of
             screening

          -  Any concurrent medical, surgical, or psychiatric condition that may, in the
             investigator's opinion, affect the subject's willingness or ability to meet all study
             requirements during the study duration

          -  During the surgery, subject presents severe bleeding where use of a topical haemostat
             would be inappropriate

          -  Subject is taking any prohibited medications

          -  BMI at screening of ≥35
