      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Ligamys
      technique for the treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament in a
      multicenter routine clinical setting. To conduct a long-term follow-up of the case series as
      a post-market product surveillance endeavor.

      The Ligamys method was successfully applied in an animal study including eleven white alpine
      sheep. Healing of the torn ACL and a stable joint without signs of intra-articular damages or
      osteoarthritis three months postoperative were observed (Kohl KSSTA 2013). In a first
      clinical study with ten patients, the Ligamys surgical technique resulted in stable clinical
      and radiological healing of the torn ACL in nine patients with one re-rupture after four
      months. Nine patients obtained normal knee scores, reported excellent patient satisfaction,
      and could return to their previous levels of sporting activity (Kohl Swiss Med Wkly 2011).
