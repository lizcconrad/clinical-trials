      This methodology study will evaluate the sensitivity in using sitting knee digital caliper to
      measure changes in sitting knee length from over a 12-week study period amidst children in
      the age of 6 to 12 years in a community-based study in children ages 6 to 12 years who are
      receiving nutritional supplementation with micronutrients or without micronutrients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children (participants), both boys and girls, aged 6 to 12 years.

          -  Participant height to be within the 25th to the 75th percentile of the standard height
             average in Indian children population

          -  Participant will agree not to take any other nutritional supplements products during
             the study except the trial supplement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has any of the following medical conditions: Genetic disorders, chronic

          -  Participant who in the past 6 months has used dietary or nutritional supplements with
             micronutrient fortification, or any form of dietary or herbal supplement intended to
             increase micronutrient intake, at a frequency of greater than 3-4times per month.

          -  Participant receiving any supplements (such as calcium, iron and/or multivitamin at
             the time of screening).

          -  Children (Participant) in Care are not allowed to participate in the study.

             any behaviour-related disorders and/or stimulants.

          -  Current or relevant history of any serious, severe or unstable physical or psychiatric
             illness or any medical disorder, including history of alcohol or substance abuse, that
             would make the participant unlikely to fully complete the study or any condition that
             presents undue risk from the study product or procedures in the opinion of the
             PI/medical examiner.

          -  Clinical Study/Experimental Medication: Participation in another clinical study or
             receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit.
