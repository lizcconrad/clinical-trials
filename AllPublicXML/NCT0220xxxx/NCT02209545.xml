  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research work is to assess the impact of a single preoperative dose of buccal
      misoprostol in reducing blood loss during abdominal fibroid surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial of women undergoing fibroid surgery at a university-affiliated tertiary care
      center. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive preoperative 400ucg buccal (under
      the tongue) misoprostol or placebo on the basis of total fibroid volume, location, parity.
      Intra-operative blood loss will be compared between groups.
