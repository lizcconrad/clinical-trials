  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study compares two ways to biopsy lymph nodes in the chest using endobronchial
      ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration&quot; (EBUS-TNBA). During a EBUS-TBNA
      procedure, the patient is sedated, and a flexible camera and ultrasound probe is inserted
      through the mouth into the large airways of the chest, allowing us to see (via ultrasound)
      and biopsy the lymph nodes in the chest.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the EBUS-TBNA procedure can be made
      simpler. In today's practice, the biopsy needle has two parts, 1) the needle itself and 2) an
      inner stylet that runs through the middle of the needle. Because many other biopsy needles
      (such as the needles used in breast biopsy and different types of lung biopsy needles) do not
      use an inner stylet, the investigators do not think the use of a stylet is necessary. If this
      step can be safely eliminated without decreasing the effectiveness of the procedure, this
      could shorten the procedure (saving time). This study is deigned to formally test the
      hypothesis that a stylet is not necessary in EBUS-TBNA.

    <description>The main outcome is the agreement (concordance) between the pathological diagnosis obtained by preforming EBUS with a stylet with EBUS without a stylet. Each patient will receive both techniques on each lymph node. We will then compare the diagnostic reached by each technique, and calculate the percentage of the time these techniques result in the same diagnosis.</description>

    <description>All patients in our study are in the same arm, as each patient serves as their own internal control. More specifically, each enrolled patient will receive both traditional EBUS (with the usage of stylet) and experimental EBUS (EBUS without a stylet) at each lymph node that is included in the experimental analysis.</description>

    <description>the patient will receive both conventional ebus with the stylet and experimental ebus (without the stylet). The two techniques will then be compared to each other on a per lymph node basis.</description>
