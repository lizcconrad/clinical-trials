      The goal of this study is to assess the experience of our patients with head and neck cancer
      in regard to the information they receive, their symptoms, and their understanding of their
      diagnosis, to determine ways to improve upon these aspects of patient care in the future.

      There will be two phases of the study. In &quot;Phase I&quot;, 30 participants will be recruited for
      assessment of information satisfaction, psychological stress, illness perception, and symptom
      burden throughout their head and neck cancer treatment without any intervention. This group
      will represent the current standard of care in the head and neck group and serve as a
      &quot;historical control&quot; for the second group. In &quot;Phase II&quot;, which will occur after &quot;Phase I&quot;
      group, 30 new participants will be recruited to receive a handbook and to have it integrated
      into their cancer care. The same participant reported outcome measures of information
      satisfaction, psychological stress, illness perception, and symptom burden will be assessed
      such that comparisons between phases can be made. This will serve as a pilot study of the
      implementation and maintenance of an educational intervention in clinical practice and how it
      affects participant-reported outcomes. Comparison of these two groups of participants will
      provide the baseline data to plan future interventions.

    <description>Prior to starting treatment, patients will be approached for trial participation and baseline questionnaires (demographics, psychological distress, symptom burden, and illness perception).
After enrollment and baseline data collection, the participant will be given the handbook. The clinician giving out the handbook will give an overview of the handbook and flip through the important sections. The clinician will encourage the participant to bring it back and forth.
Participants will complete questionnaires at 3 weeks into treatment and 2 weeks after treatment has ended (information satisfaction, psychological distress, symptom burden, and illness perception).</description>

    <description>Prior to starting treatment, patients will be approached for trial participation and baseline questionnaires (demographics, psychological distress, symptom burden, and illness perception).
The first group of participants will not receive the handbook but will receive the current standard care in the head and neck disease center.
Participants will complete questionnaires at 3 weeks into treatment and 2 weeks after treatment has ended (information satisfaction, psychological distress, symptom burden, and illness perception).
At completion of &quot;Phase I&quot;, all 30 participants will also be given a copy of the handbook and an accompanying questionnaire.</description>
