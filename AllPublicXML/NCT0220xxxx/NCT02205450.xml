  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PWS is a genetic disease with intellectual disabilities associated with multiple
      manifestations in other body systems. It is characterized by hypothalamic-pituitary
      abnormalities with severe hypotonia during the early years of life, conditioning feeding
      difficulties. Hyperphagia appears later, causing severe obesity in pre - school ages. Other
      endocrine abnormalities associated produce short stature, GH deficiency and hypogonadotropic
      hypogonadism. These patients also have varying cognitive dysfunction associated as well as
      learning problems, compounded by the development of psychological-psychiatric and behavioral
      problems language. The aetiology of GH decreased secretion of the SPW is controversial, it is
      known that IGF -1 levels are reduced in children and adults with PWS. The rational use of GH
      is derived from knowledge of comorbidities observed in PWS, which seem to be related to GH
      deficiency: hypotonia, altered body composition, decreased growth, even obesity.

      • The GH is accepted since 2000 for the treatment of PWS. Following fatal episodes in our
      country, it was decided to start treatment at 2 years of age in an arbitrary manner, but not
      in the U.S. or France. Subsequent studies have found that GH per se is not a risk factor for
      mortality. The currently published data supporting the benefits of GH treatment when started
      between 4 and 6 months of life, even some experts advocate starting at 3 months, but due to
      the lack of consensus on the age of onset treatment, despite the benefits of your home at an
      early age before the onset of obesity often starts around 2 years of life.

      HYPOTHESIS The use of GH is safe and effective in patients with PWS children under 2 years
      old.
