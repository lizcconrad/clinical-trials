  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young children in Guatemala are at risk for nutrient deficiencies due to plant-based diets
      and poor sanitation. Stunting, frequent diarrhea, and respiratory infections are common.
      Supplementation of Zn to children during diarrhea episodes has been shown to diminish
      duration and severity of illness. Poor Zn absorption due to high fiber and phytate in this
      diet might play a role in these processes. Supplementation of this micronutrient in the diet
      might be beneficial. The investigators will compare absorption of Zn from white maize
      tortillas enriched with 20% amaranth to traditional white corn tortillas in preschool
      children in Guatemala.

      This is a randomized cross-over study of zinc absorption in young children living in the
      Western Highlands of Guatemala. Absorption of zinc will be measured from maize tortillas and
      maize tortillas fortified with 20% amaranth as the major food staple which provides at least
      70% energy and at least 90% zinc and phytate of the diet. Participants will be randomized as
      to which type of tortilla they receive on the first and second day. Fractional absorption of
      zinc (FAZ) from all meals in one day for one type of tortilla and one day for the other will
      be measured by extrinsic labeling with stable isotopes of zinc. FAZ will be measured by a
      dual isotope tracer ratio (DITR) technique based on ratio of urine enrichment of orally
      versus intravenously administered zinc stable isotopes. Measurement of total zinc in
      duplicate diets on test days allow for determination of quantities of this micronutrient
      absorbed.

    <description>Absorption of zinc will be compared in young children when fed the common maize tortilla and a tortilla fortified with 20 % amaranth.. Fractional absorption of zinc for a day will be measured by extrinsic labeling with stable isotopes of zinc. Fractional absorption of zinc will be measured by a dual isotope tracer ratio technique. Measurement of total zinc in duplicate diets on test day will allow determination of quantity of this micronutrient absorbed (mg/d).</description>
