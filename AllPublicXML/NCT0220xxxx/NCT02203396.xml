  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acquired aplastic anaemia (SAA) is a bone marrow failure disease characterized by
      pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow. The corn pathophysiological mechanism is the
      destruction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells mediated by auto-reactive effector T
      cells. Immunosuppressive therapy with horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus cyclosporine
      (CSA) is currently the standard of treatment in patients with aplastic anaemia who are not
      eligible for bone marrow transplantation and with response rates from 40% to 70%. Previous
      studies showed that horse ATG (hATG) is apparently more effective than rabbit ATG (rATG) as
      the latter has higher treatment related mortality (TRM). Unfortunately hATG is unavailable in
      China, so we conduct a optimized standard treatment (9 days protocol) of rATG plus CSA and
      Levamisole (LMS) Sequential maintaining (termed Optimized Standard Protocol, OSP) for severe
      aplastic anemia. This prospective study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Optimized Standard Protocol as first line therapy in newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia
      patients.

    <textblock>
      During the treatment period, rATG is administered at a dose of 1.97 mg/kg/day for 9 days by
      slow intravenous infusion. CSA is administered orally at a dose of 3 mg/kg qod, and
      Levamisole was administered orally at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg qod. The CSA and Levamisole (LMS)
      is designed to alternately every other day.

    <description>Response will be evaluated at each clinic visit. Complete response (CR) was defined as achieving all three peripheral blood count criteria: (1) Hb level up to the normal range; (2) ANC≥1.5×109/L; (3) PLT≥100×109/L.
Partial response (PR) was defined as transfusion independent, no longer meeting criteria for severe disease. Persistence of transfusion requirement or death was evidence of no response (NR).</description>

    <measure>Relapse rate, sustained response (SR), survival, and clonal evolution to myelodysplasia and acute leukemia.</measure>
    <time_frame>month +12, month +60</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse was defined as a responder who met criteria for SAA again after achieving response and keeping stable blood counts for at least 3 months.
Sustained response (SR) was defined as Hb &gt; 10 g/dL at month +12 and +60, in the absence of any treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed SAA (according to the standard criteria)

               1. Bone marrow cellularity less than 30% (excluding lymphocytes)

               2. At least two of the following: Absolute neutrophil count less than 500/ uL;
                  Platelet count less than 20,000/ uL; Absolute reticulocyte count less than
                  20,000/ uL.
