      The purpose of this clinical study is to test the hypothesis that market released Cardiac
      Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices which contain the AdaptivCRT® (aCRT) algorithm have a
      superior outcome compared to standard CRT devices in CRT indicated patients with normal
      atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction and left bundle branch block (LBBB).

    <measure>Clinical Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Composite Score classifies patients according their clinical status at 6 months post randomization into categories Improved, Unchanged, and Worsened. A patient is classified Worsened in case of death, hospitalization for worsening heart failure, worsened NYHA class (using last observation carried forward), or worsened status on the Global Assessment Score. Also patients that exit the study or cross over because of worsening heart failure are classified Worsened. A patient is classified Improved when not Worsened and there is an improvement in NYHA class or Global Assessment Score. Patients that are not Worsened or Improved are Unchanged.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing to sign and date the study Patient Informed Consent Form.

          -  Subject is indicated for a CRT device according to local guidelines.

          -  Sinus Rhythm at time of enrollment

          -  Complete Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) as documented on an ECG (within 30 days prior
             to enrollment). Strauss Criteria used for LBBB.

          -  Intrinsic, normal AV conduction as documented on an ECG by a PR interval less than or
             equal to 200ms (within 30 days prior to enrollment).

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% (documented within 180
             days prior to enrollment).

          -  NYHA class II, III or IV (documented within 30 days prior to enrollment) despite
             optimal medical therapy. Optimal medical therapy is defined as maximal tolerated dose
             of Beta-blockers and a therapeutic dose of ACE-I, ARB or Aldosterone Antagonist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is less than 18 years of age (or has not reached minimum age per local law).

          -  Subject is not expected to remain available for at least 2 years of follow-up visits.

          -  Subject has permanent atrial arrhythmias for which pharmacological therapy and/or
             cardioversion have been unsuccessful or have not been attempted

          -  Subject is, or previously has been, receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy.

          -  Subject is currently enrolled or planning to participate in a potentially confounding
             drug or device trial during the course of this study. Co-enrollment in concurrent
             trials is only allowed when documented pre-approval is obtained from the Medtronic
             study manager.

          -  Subject has unstable angina, or experienced an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or
             received coronary artery revascularization (CABG) or coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
             within 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject has a mechanical tricuspid heart valve or is scheduled to undergo valve repair
             or valve replacement during the course of the study.

          -  Subject is post heart transplant (subjects on the heart transplant list for the first
             time are not excluded).

          -  Subject has a limited life expectancy due to non-cardiac causes that would not allow
             completion of the study.

          -  Subject is pregnant (if required by local law, women of child-bearing potential must
             undergo a pregnancy test within seven days prior to device implant).

          -  Subject meets any exclusion criteria required by local law.
