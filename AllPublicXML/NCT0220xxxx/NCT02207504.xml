      This research study is comparing the combination of drugs Crizotinib and Enzalutamide as a
      possible treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

      -  A traditional 3+3 dose escalation scheme will be used to identify the recommended phase
           2 dose (RP2D) of crizotinib when used in combination with standard fixed dose
           enzalutamide.

        -  Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive
           crizotinib and enzalutamide.

        -  After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:

             -  The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment
                cycle. The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of
                study drugs that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side
                effects in participants that have, not everyone who participates in this research
                study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on
                the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and how well
                the dose was tolerated.

             visceral lesions on CT or MRI)

               -  Require at least a 6 week withdrawal period from the last dose of bicalutamide,
                  or nilutamide or 4 weeks from last flutamide or enzalutamide dose Must have a
                  documented PSA rise after stopping the antiandrogen --- Will require a 2 week
                  washout period from last dose of ketoconazole, chemotherapy, or radiation

          -  Prior radiation is allowed

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (See Appendix 1)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months

                  of liver metastases

                  --- *For patients with documented bone metastases, AST can be &gt; 2.5x ULN if the
                  investigator can provide evidence of no underlying liver dysfunction and thus, it
                  is likely that the AST is originating from bone source.

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          -  The effects of crizotinib and enzalutamide on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason and because investigational agents as well as other standard
             antiandrogen agents used in this trial may be teratogenic, men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of crizotinib
             administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathology consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate

          -  Prior treatment with c-Met inhibitors

          -  Participants who have received any other investigational systemic agents in the last 2
             weeks.

          -  Persistent grade &gt;1 (NCI CTCAE v4.0) AEs due to investigational drugs that were
             administered more than 14 days before study enrollment with the exception of alocepia.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction or seizures that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to crizotinib or enzalutamide.

          -  History of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior
             cortical stroke or significant brain trauma, history of loss of consciousness or
             transient ischemic attack within 12 months of study entry).

          -  Concomitant medications that would lower seizure threshold

          -  Concomitant use of medications that may alter pharmacokinetics of crizotinib or
             enzalutamide. See section 5.5, but would exclude the use of strong CYP3A or CYP2C8
             inhibitors, strong or moderate CYP3A inducers, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19
             substrates with narrow therapeutic indice.

             -- Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
             regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as:
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

               -  Clinically significant heart disease defined as:

                    -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months of Screening visit.

                    -  Uncontrolled angina within 3 months of Screening visit.

                    -  Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4, or
                       subjects with history of congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 or 4 in the
                       past, or history of anthracycline or anthracenedione (mitoxantrone)
                       treatment, unless a screening echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition scan
                       (MUGA) performed within three months of the Screening visit results in a
                       left ventricular ejection fraction that is ≥45%.

                    -  History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular
                       tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes).

                    -  Prolonged corrected QT interval by the Fridericia correction formula (QTcF)
                       on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG) &gt; 470 msec.

                    -  History of Mobitz II second degree or third degree heart block without a
                       permanent pacemaker in place.

                    -  Hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;86 mmHg) or bradycardia with a heart
                       rate of &lt;50 beats per minute on the Screening ECG, unless pharmaceutically
                       induced and thus reversible (i.e. beta blockers) or known, chronic
                       asymptomatic baseline heart rate.

                    -  Uncontrolled hypertension as indicated by a resting systolic blood pressure
                       &gt;170 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;105 mmHg at the Screening visit.

                    -  No medications known to prolong the QT interval as crizotinib may increase
                       the risk for QT prolongation

               -  Thrombosis or vascular ischemic events within the last six months, such as deep
                  venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attack, cerebral
                  infarction, or myocardial infarction

          -  No medications known to prolong the QT interval as crizotinib may increase the risk
             for QT prolongation

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because women do not get prostate cancer,
             as they have no prostate.

          -  No defined washout period from major or minor surgery is required but incisions must
             be fully healed.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with crizotinib or enzalutamide. In
             addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
