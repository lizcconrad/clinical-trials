  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, randomized, double-blind, three period cross-over, placebo-controlled,
      proof of mechanism study in healthy male subjects. The study will investigate whether the
      directionality of brain activity and connectivity in response to intranasal vasopressin
      treatment is similar to earlier studies and explores the effect of short-term treatment with
      RG7314 on functional MRI as a pharmacodynamic marker. While in the scanner, the participants
      will be asked to perform a face matching task and a Theory of Mind task, among other
      assessments. Participants' exposure to study drug will be assessed and all participants will
      receive follow-up examination 1 and 4 weeks after last dose.
