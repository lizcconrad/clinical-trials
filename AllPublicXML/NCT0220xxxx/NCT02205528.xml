    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of the trial is to
      investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily subcutaneous (SC) injections
      of NNC0090-2746 for 12 weeks, as an adjunct to metformin, in participants with T2D.
