  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a marked and long-lasting improvement in glucose homeostasis that follows Roux-en-y
      gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) in humans. This improvement has been attributed in large part
      to an intestinal hormone, called GLP-1, that is released into the circulation immediately
      after eating. The purpose of this study is to determine if GLP-1 mediates the beneficial
      effects of RYGB surgery on glucose homeostasis in humans.

    <textblock>
      To conduct this study, we will enroll humans who previously underwent Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass surgery, who are medically and weight stable and with no signs of type 2 diabetes
      either before or after surgery. Potential subjects will first be screened for eligibility and
      also to verify that they can safely participate in the study. Each study subject will be
      administered a meal tolerance test (MTT) on 3 separate occasions. For the MTT, a liquid meal
      (Boost Plus) will be ingested following an overnight fast. A primed-continuous infusion of
      vehicle alone (human albumin) or xenin-25 alone (at a dose of 4 or 12 pmoles x kg-1 x min-1)
      will be initiated 15 minutes before the meal is ingested. Blood samples will be collected
      before and during the MTT for the measurement of glucose and insulin levels, as well as a
      host of other hormones. A comparison of the results will tell us if the effects of xenin-25
      on insulin release are mediated by GLP-1 in humans.
