  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, more than 3 million neonatal deaths occur worldwide and greater than 200 million
      children under the age of 5, almost all in low- and middle-income countries, are not
      fulfilling their developmental potential. The development of the growing brain can be
      affected through multiple mechanisms including the same insults that are major causes of
      mortality, namely hypothermia and infection. The first month of life is a crucial period in
      neurodevelopment (ND). In this study, the investigators propose the home-based use of an
      integrated evidence-based toolkit to improve health status, reduce the incidence of neonatal
      insults that may affect brain development, decrease neonatal mortality rate (NMR), and
      provide early identification of danger signs. The investigators hypothesize that use of the
      neonatal toolkit will result in an improvement of at least one standard deviation in
      neurodevelopment as measured at 12 months of age by the Protocol for Child Monitoring Infant
      and Toddler (PCM-IT) version.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year there are over 3 million global neonatal deaths. While significant progress has
      been made on overall under 5 mortality over the past decade, minimal progress has been made
      in reducing neonatal deaths and these now represent about 40% of all deaths in children under
      the age of 5. The majority of neonatal deaths occur in rural areas of developing countries
      and approximately two thirds are due to infection and complications relating to low birth
      weight (LBW) and prematurity. Additionally, more than 200 million children under 5 years old,
      almost all in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), are not fulfilling their developmental
      potential. To date, most neonatal intervention trials in LMIC have focused on reducing
      mortality and little research has been performed on the consequences of severe but non-fatal
      neonatal insults on neurodevelopment (ND). Subsequently, little is known about interventions
      that may reduce the risk of long-term neurocognitive sequelae.

      The first month of life is a critical period in ND in which there is significant
      neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and myelination. Stimulation of the infant's brain during this
      period may have significant downstream positive effects. Development of the growing brain can
      be affected through multiple mechanisms including the same insults that are major causes of
      mortality, namely hypothermia and infection. Reducing the incidence of these insults during
      this period may not only save lives but also save brains and improve ND outcomes.

    <description>Mothers in the neonatal kit clusters will receive a neonatal kit and training on how to use the kit components during their third trimester of pregnancy. The kit will contain a clean birth kit to be used at the time of delivery either at home or in a facility, 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) lotion, sunflower oil emollient, ThermoSpot, a Mylar infant sleeve, and a reusable, non-electric, heating device. Community Health Workers will be equipped with a hand-held battery operated scale to identify low birth weight newborns.</description>

    <description>During home visits in the 3rd trimester, mothers in the neonatal stimulation clusters will be taught 3 core messages pertaining to neonatal stimulation. First, mothers will be taught how to make eye contact and talk to their child. This type of interaction encourages social inclusion, attachment, and development of social-communication skills. Second, mothers will be taught techniques to foster responsive feeding and caregiving. Finally, mothers will be encouraged to sing songs and nursery rhymes, including those with gentle touch in order to support the development of communication skills, and introduce a tactile component to caregiving. These messages will be reiterated at subsequent home visits by the CHW after the baby is born.</description>

    <description>In control clusters, CHWs will visit the home according to the regular schedule (same as in the intervention clusters) and deliver the standard CHW post-natal care that consists of talking to mothers about:
Exclusive breastfeeding and proper nutrition for both the mother and the baby.
Ensuring warmth to the baby.
Full immunization and growth monitoring of newborn.
Hygiene and sanitation practices.
Family Planning and promote the proper use of Insecticides Treated Nets.
Identifying any danger sign/complication for both mothers and new-borns and refer for prompt treatment (within 24 hours) for management and treatment.
Promoting the use of services such as birth registration.
Giving advice on proper care of the umbilical cord.</description>

    <description>A sub-set of children in the study will receive a neonatal stimulation program either on its own or in combination with the neonatal kit described above. The stimulation program will focus on teaching three key messages to enhance the caregivers' current caregiving practices, and each message is to be integrated into daily activities (e.g. during feeding, bathing, bedtime routines). By integrating the delivery of the interventions into the caregivers' daily routine, no additional time inconvenience will be added to their schedules. The key messages include:
Eye contact and talking to children
Responsive feeding and caregiving
Singing songs, including those with gentle touch</description>
