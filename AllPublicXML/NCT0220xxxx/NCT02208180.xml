    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a two group intervention to study to the effect of
      individualized heart disease genomic risk results on motivation towards diet and physical
      activity behaviors to reduce heart disease risk. The intervention includes provided
      participants with genomic and lifestyle risk estimates. Investigators will follow
      participants for 3 months to determine if motivation towards and engagement in diet and
      physical activity behaviors change.

    <description>The Prevention and Planning Behaviors Scale is a recently developed tool that provides a direct measure of degrees of influence on participants' motivation to change their health behavior in translational genomic studies. It has 23-items where participants rate themselves using a 5-point Likert scale (1=A Lot Less Motivated to 5=A Lot More Motivated).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eating Habits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Eating habits will be assessed using a 10-item Block questionnaire designed to capture the frequency with which participants eat particular items from different food groups. Participants will rate themselves on a 6-point scale ranging from &quot;Less than 1 time per WEEK&quot; to &quot;2+ a DAY.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 16-item RESIDE Neighborhood Physical Activity Questionnaire will be used to assess context-specific walking behavior through self-report. Participants are asked how often they walk, how long, to where, and similar questions about what other types of physical activity they might engage in.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psychological Adaptation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Psychological Adaptation Scale (PAS) measures adaptation to health risk information via a 20-item questionnaire rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1=Not At All to 5=Very Much). This questionnaire measures adaptation in 4 domains: coping efficacy, self-esteem, social integration, and spiritual well-being. This scale was developed specifically for use in genomic studies to measure adaptation and aid understanding in the relationship between health outcomes and psychological well-being.
