    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of benzonatate (200 mg and
      800 mg) on the QT interval following single dose oral administration at each time point
      post-dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive.
             Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12- lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following
             criteria:

               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as: cessation of regular menses for at
                  least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological
                  cause; and have a serum FSH level within the laboratory's reference range for
                  postmenopausal females;

               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

               3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including
                  females with tubal ligations and females that do NOT have a documented
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and/or ovarian failure) will be considered
                  to be of childbearing potential.

          -  History or risk factors of QT prolongation or torsades de pointes, congenital deafness
             and family history of sudden death.

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;110 msec at Screening.

          -  Use of medications or dietary supplements capable of inducing or inhibiting hepatic
             enzyme metabolism or transport (e.g., barbiturates, rifampin, carbamazepine,
             phenytoin, primidone, or St. John's Wort) within 28 days of the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit containing products within 7 days prior to the
             first dose of study medication.

          -  Known history of hypersensitivity, allergy, severe adverse drug reaction or
             intolerance to quinolone antibiotics.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to benzonatate or other ester-type local anesthetics (ie,
             tetracaine, procaine).

          -  Subjects with a presence or history of dysphagia or difficulty swallowing pills.

          -  Subjects taking any concomitant anticonvulsant medications or with a history of
             seizure disorder.

          -  Subjects with a positive response to the question of actual attempt in the suicidal
             behavior section of the C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale). Subjects with
             active suicidal ideation with intent to act within 6 months of screening as determined
             by a positive response to questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section of the
             C-SSRS.

          -  Screening laboratory values considered clinically significant by the investigator.

          -  Screening supine blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of rest.
