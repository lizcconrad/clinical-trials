  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Registry is to collect real-world outcome data for bronchial
      thermoplasty (BT) procedures in patients with severe persistent asthma who remain symptomatic
      despite taking standard of care maintenance medications.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be used to confirm the impact of BT on safety, effectiveness, quality of life, and
      the anticipated reduction in healthcare utilization events and cost by way of a reduction in
      severe asthma exacerbations.

    <description>Severe asthma exacerbation is defined as worsening of asthma symptoms requiring use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) (NAEPP Guidelines, 2007).
For patients already taking oral corticosteroids on a daily or alternate day basis, a severe asthma exacerbation is defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms requiring any increase in daily dose of systemic corticosteroids.
For consistency, courses of corticosteroids separated by 1 week or more will be treated as separate severe exacerbations.</description>
