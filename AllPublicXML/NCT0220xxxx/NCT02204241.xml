      Treatment schedule for 9 cycles of induction:

      Phase I:

      In the phase I portion of the study, the following dose levels of carfilzomib will be studied
      with fixed doses of dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide to define the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD):

      Level-1:

        1. Carfilzomib given 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1-2 of Cycle 1 only followed by 36
           mg/m2 on days 8-9, 15-16, of Cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 36 mg/m2 IV once
           daily on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16.

        2. Cyclophosphamide given orally at the dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15

        3. Dexamethasone given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 20 mg on days
           1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23

      Level 0:

        1. Carfilzomib given 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1-2 of Cycle 1 only followed by 45
           mg/m2 on days 8-9, 15-16, of Cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 45 mg/m2 IV once
           daily on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16.

        2. Cyclophosphamide given orally at the dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15

        3. Dexamethasone given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 20 mg on days
           1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23

      Level +1:

        1. Carfilzomib given 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1-2 of Cycle 1 only followed by 56
           mg/m2 on days 8-9, 15-16, of Cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 56 mg/m2 IV once
           daily on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16.

        2. Cyclophosphamide given orally at the dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15

        3. Dexamethasone given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 20 mg on days
           1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23

      Level +2:

        1. Carfilzomib given 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1-2 of Cycle 1 only followed by 36
           mg/m2 on days 8-9, 15-16, of Cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 70 mg/m2 IV once
           daily on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16.

        2. Cyclophosphamide given orally at the dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15

        3. Dexamethasone given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 20 mg on days
           1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23

      Patient will be observed at the end of the second cycle of therapy for the assessment of side
      effects and observation of DLTs. Dose escalation will proceed as follows:

        -  3 patients will be entered at dose level 0

        -  If 0/3 patients experience DLT, dose escalation will continue

        -  If 1/3 patients experience DLT, 3 additional patients will be added to this cohort (max
           6)

        -  If no further patients experience DLT (1/6) dose escalation will continue

        -  If 2/6 patients experience DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded and the MTD will be the
           previous dose at which &lt;2/6 experienced DLT

        -  If 2/3 patients experience a DLT at any given dose, the MTD will have been exceeded and
           the MTD will be the preceding dose at which &lt; 2/6 (or 1/3) patients experienced a DLT.

      Phase II:

      The dose used to treat patients in the phase II will be the MTD defined in the phase I of the
      study.

      Treatment schedule for maintenance until progression or intolerance:

      Carfilzomib at the MTD defined by phase I study IV once daily on days 1-2, 15-16.

             transplantation.

          -  Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the
             protocol requirements.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future
             medical care.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within the 7
             days prior to study drug administration and a negative urine pregnancy test within the
             3 days prior to the first study drug administration.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and male subjects who are sexullay active with WOCBP
             must agree to use 2 highly effective methods of contraception during the study and for
             30 days following the last dose of study treatment including a male condom.

          -  Patient is a newly diagnosed MM patient.

          -  Patient has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum monoclonal
             protein value (generally, but not necessarily, ≥ 0.5 g/dL of M-protein) and, where
             applicable, urine light-chain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours. For patients with oligo
             or non-secretory MM, it is required that they have measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as

             abnormal free light chain ratio (n.v.: 0.26-1.65). We anticipate that less than 10% of
             patients admitted to this study will be oligo- or non-secretory MM with free light
             chains only in order to maximize interpretation of benefit results.

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status ≥60%.

          -  Patient has a life-expectancy &gt;3 months.

          -  Patient has the following laboratory values within 14 days before Baseline (day 1 of
             the Cycle 1, before study drug administration):

               -  Platelet count ≥50 x 109/L (≥30 x 109 /L if myeloma involvement in the bone
                  marrow is &gt; 50%) within 14 days prior to drug administration.

          -  Patient with peripheral neuropathy &gt; CTCAE grade 2.

          -  Known history of allergy to Captisol (a cyclodextrin derivative used to solubilize
             carfilzomib).

          -  Contraindication to any of the required concomitant drugs or supportive treatments,
             including hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation and antiplatelet options, antiviral
             drugs, or intolerance to hydration due to preexisting pulmonary or cardiac impairment.

          -  Subjects with pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis or ascites requiring
             paracentesis within 14 days prior to baseline.

          -  Patient has any other clinically significant illness that would, in the investigator's
             opinion, increase the patient's risk for toxicity.

             cell carcinoma, or in situ cancer of the cervix or breast, or localized prostate
