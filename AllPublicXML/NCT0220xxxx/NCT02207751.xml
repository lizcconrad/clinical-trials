    <textblock>
      The objective is to understand the best way to place Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) catheters, and
      the best way to collect data regarding their function in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

      Phase 1: We will carry out a detailed examination of existing returned pilot data with
      emphasis on data fields with poor data completeness and perform root cause analysis, and
      assess deficiencies in data field definition to identify improvements to be implemented. We
      will construct and disseminate electronic survey material to all study centres with targeted
      visits by the Principle Investigator undertaken. These visits will facilitate insight into
      local organization of data collection including interaction with designated individuals
      responsible for data returns. PD training days will be organized with emphasis on clinical
      practice feedback utilizing data acquired in the initial phases. Hospital Episode Statistics
      will be linked to existing acquired PD patient information to ensure the accuracy of
      collected data. An online data acquisition system will be developed to allow direct data
      entry from centres.

      Phase 2: On-going and sustained data acquisition performed on a prospective basis.

      Phase 3: Primary data analysis including clinical practice variation in England, Wales and
      Northern Ireland to identify site specific PD catheter functionality variation. Additionally,
      patient and site specific characteristics that predict clinical outcomes in PD will be
      identified and characterised.

      Phase 4: Clinical guidelines will be developed.
