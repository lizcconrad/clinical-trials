      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of consuming cocoa on blood glucose
      levels, glucose metabolism, and other markers of pre-diabetes in overweight and/or obese
      individuals. Our hypothesis is that consumption of cocoa improves insulin sensitivity and
      glucose metabolism in subjects at risk for developing type-2 diabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 25 and less than 40.

          -  Have at least one of the following: 1) impaired fasting glucose (IFG) after an
             overnight fast with plasma glucose concentration between 100-125 mg/dl, 2) impaired
             glucose tolerance (IGT) as identified by the standard Oral Glucose Tolerance Test
             (OGTT) with 2 hour plasma glucose concentration between 140-200 mg/dl following 75 g
             glucose OGTT, 3) HbA1c levels between 5.7-6.4% or 4) considered at risk to developing
             type 2 diabetes by the American Diabetes Association risk assessment. If subjects are
             above the prediabetic range for any of these tests (indicating they may be type 2
             diabetic), they will be excluded and referred to their physician.

          -  Weight stable (+/-2 kg) for the last 6 months.

          -  Sedentary to recreationally active (less than 2 d/wk, 20 min/d).

          -  Have a blood pressure that is less than 160/100 mmHg, total cholesterol that is less
             than 300 mg/dl and a triglyceride concentration of less than 450 mg/dl.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past or current history of coronary heart disease, stroke or major cardiovascular
             disease events, respiratory diseases, endocrine or metabolic diseases (including type
             1 and type 2 diabetes), inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or neurological or
             hematological disorders that would compromise the study or the health of the subject.

          -  Past or current history of gastrointestinal disorders (including lactose intolerance,
             ulcers, cancer (stomach, intestinal, colon, pancreatic, liver, etc) NASH, NAFLD,
             cirrhosis, IBD/IBS, celiac disease, etc).

          -  Current use of any medication including but not limited to cholesterol lowering
             medication (including fibric acid derivatives and niacin), antibiotics,
             immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDs), hormone replacement therapy or antioxidants/supplements.

          -  Use of antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics within the prior 3 months.

          -  Smoking or other tobacco use

          -  Habitual consumption of alcohol more than 2 servings/d for males and 1 serving/d for
             females.

          -  Strict vegetarians or vegans, or strong aversions to major food groups that may be
             part of the controlled diet.

          -  Recent surgery

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Pregnant or plan to become pregnant
