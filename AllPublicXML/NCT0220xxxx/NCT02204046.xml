    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study were to assess the safety and tolerability of
      intravenously (i.v.) administered 186Rhenium (186Re)-labelled bivatuzumab and to investigate
      the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 186Re-labelled bivatuzumab in patients with
      adenocarcinoma of the breast
