      Motor deficits are common after stroke, being one of the major causes of disability in this
      population. Because of the impact that motor impairments have in the life of patients and the
      associated financial costs, it is a health care priority to develop effective and efficient
      treatments to restore motor deficits. Music-supported therapy (MST) has been recently
      developed to enhance the use of the affected extremity after stroke.

      In the present project, a new multidisciplinary approach (neurology, neuropsychology, music
      and cognitive neurosciences) will be undertaken in order to investigate the effectiveness of
      MST as a neurorehabilitation technique to restore the motor function in stroke patients. In
      addition, the complex pattern of reorganization of the sensorimotor system will be studied in
      order to provide information about the physiological mechanisms underlying the
      neurorehabilitation process.

      A randomized controlled trial is proposed to compare for first time the effectiveness of MST
      (at the hospital and at home) compared to conventional treatment in subacute stroke patients
      suffering from motor deficits. Our hypothesis is that patients will experience a large
      improvement in the functional use of the affected arm due to the implementation of the MST
      program when compared to conventional treatment. We also expect to observe improvements in
      cognitive functions, mood and quality of life. Besides, we hypothesize that these
      amelioration in motor and cognitive domains will be accompanied by neuroplastic changes in
      the sensorimotor cortex and corticospinal tract.

      According to the World Health Organization, stroke is one of the major's causes of acquired
      disability in developed countries. Strokes are cerebrovascular disorders in which the blood
      supply to the brain is disturbed either by an ischemic or hemorrhagic event in cerebral
      arteries. Motor deficits, in terms of loss in strength and dexterity, are present in a
      majority of patients. Such deficits limit the accomplishment of daily activities (disability)
      and affect the participation of patients in their communities (handicap), impacting the
      different roles that they have in various social, familiar and working contexts.
      Consequently, quality of life of the patients diminishes as well as their emotional valence
      and mood, which could evolve into a psychiatric disorder (e.g., depression and apathy).

      In addition to the economic cost of medical treatments once the stroke has occurred, the
      ability of patients who are on working age to contribute to the society through the
      development of a remunerable occupation are clearly disrupted. Thus, there is a large cost in
      the maintenance of patients that cannot recover their motor function successfully. In this
      regard, stroke is an important health care priority due to direct (medical) and indirect
      (i.e. unemployment and loss of autonomy) costs.

      Relevant findings in the medical acute management of stroke (i.e. minimization of
      complications, treatment optimization, thrombosis and standardized stroke units in hospitals)
      have been made. However, there is still little scientific evidence in the field of
      neurorehabilitation that clearly support the application of certain therapies that are used
      in several centres. Thus, it is extremely important to investigate motor rehabilitation
      therapies to provide evidence for clinicians of their effectiveness.

      One of the approaches is to validate therapies that could promote brain plasticity, the
      ability whereby the brain changes its structure, functions and connections. Brain plasticity
      can occur spontaneously after the lesion, but it is also found during and after learning.
      Many consistent studies have demonstrated brain plasticity at cortical and subcortical levels
      due to motor skill learning in healthy subjects. Thus, interventions implying acquisition of
      new motor skills could be a good approach to promote the recovery of motor functions in
      stroke patients. An example of a motor skill involving fine hand movements is musical
      instrument playing, an activity with is unique and request complex demands for the central
      nervous system. Interactions between the auditory and motor systems are established during
      music performance as the sound of the instrument is processed and is postulated to be used to
      readjust movements. Furthermore, musical training has been proved to lead structural and
      functional changes in motor-related areas.

      Recently, Schneider and colleagues developed a new neurorehabilitation tool to restore motor
      deficits after a stroke: the Music-supported Therapy (MST). In this therapy, patients are
      trained to play a MIDI-piano and an electronic drum to train fine and gross movements,
      respectively. Studies in acute and chronic stages have demonstrated that patients improve
      their motor function due to the therapy and that those changes are accompanied by brain
      plasticity. However, until now, no clear evidence exist of the advantage of this therapy
      (MST) compared to conventional therapy provided in hospital in subacute patients. Besides, no
      previous study has directly compared the changes observed in the brain in acute stroke
      patients using functional and structural neuroimaging after MT when compared to conventional
      or standard therapy.

      We propose a multicentre randomized controlled trial to test the benefits of MST compared to
      conventional treatment in subacute stroke patients with motor deficits. In this study, 3
      groups of treatment are established (MST training at the hospital, MST training at home and
      Conventional Treatment). Participants from all groups will be evaluated before and after the
      treatment to asses motor and cognitive functions, emotional status, quality of life and the
      brain plasticity associated with the treatment assessed with neuroimaging techniques. A
      follow-up evaluation will also be performed to assess if improvements are maintained within
      time.

      The underlying hypothesis is that music therapy, which requires learning to play an
      instrument, will indirectly boost the neuroplasticity of the affected sensorimotor cortex in
      stroke patients due to the recruitment of audio-motor premotor circuits in the brain,
      necessary to play an instrument and for integrating auditory and motor aspects of music
      playing.

    <description>The excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) will be evaluated using a single pulse protocol of TMS (70 mm figure-of-8 coil, Magstim Rapid 2 Stimulator; Magstim Company, Carmathenshire, Wales) to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Using surface Ag/AgCl disk electrodes in a belly-tendon montage, electromyographic activity from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous will be recorded for a total of 70 ms including a 100 ms pre-stimulus window (Medelec Synergy, Oxford Instruments, Pleasantville, NY, USA).
Both hemispheres will be tested to assess the excitability of the corticospinal pathway using the following parameters: (i) coordinates of Hot Spot, (ii) resting motor threshold, (iii) active motor threshold (Rossini et al., 1994), (iv) cortical silent period (Liepert et al., 2005), (v) MEPs peak-to-peak amplitude, (vi) motor map area and volume, (vii) and the coordinates of the center of gravity of the map (CoGx and CoGy) (Wassermann et al., 1992; Byrnes et al., 1999).</description>

    <description>A Music-supported Therapy training will be provided to participants in the hospital during 4 weeks (5 sessions per week, 30 min per session). In this treatment, two different musical instruments will be used: a MIDI-piano and an electronic drum set to train fine and gross movements of the affected hand, respectively. Exercises will follow a modular therapy regime with stepwise increase of complexity in the number of tones to perform, velocity, order of playing, and fingers used for playing. Each exercise will be first played by the experimenter and will be subsequently repeated by the patient.</description>

    <description>A Music-supported Therapy training at home will be provided to participants during 4 weeks (5 sessions per week, 30 min per session). Patients will play a portable roll-up MIDI-piano at home connected to the Synthesia LLC software. This software displays visual stimuli across a virtual piano on the computer screen which are served as cues to press the correct piano keys. A modular regime with stepwise increase in difficulty will be set in the program. With the aim to reinforce the training and solve problems that could appear at home, once per week patients will carry out the MST session in the hospital with the therapist. During this visit, each patient will complement his/her training with the electronic drum set and in order to train gross movements.</description>

    <description>This intervention comprises intensive training of the affected upper extremity during 4 weeks (5 sessions per week, 30 min per session). The conventional therapy program corresponds to standard therapies, prescribed by attending neurologists and adapted to the needs of every individual patient. Patients will receive intensive training on fine and gross movements of the affected upper extremity. A physical and occupational therapist will provide multiple exercises from the following options:
Passive mobilization: controlled manipulation of movements to release a joint.
Stretch and progressive resistance training.
Task-specific training: reaching and manipulation of different objects.
Intense physical training: repetition of sequence of movements.</description>
