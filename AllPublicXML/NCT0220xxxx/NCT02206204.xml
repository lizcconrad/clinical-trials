  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled,
      double-dummy, parallel-group, multiple-dose, up-titration study with a nested cross-over
      comparison between moxifloxacin and placebo in healthy male and female subjects. The primary
      objective is to demonstrate that selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 do not have an
      effect on cardiac repolarization exceeding the threshold of regulatory concern, at two orally
      administered dose levels (800 and 1600 μg twice daily) in healthy male and female subjects.
      Moxifloxacin is included as a positive control.
