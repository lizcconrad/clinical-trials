  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Governmental initiatives (such as Sure Start in the UK) have integrated an oral health
      promotion intervention within their maternal and child health program and delivered dental
      education and enabling resources (a gift bag including a baby toothbrush, fluoride toothpaste
      and a trainer cup) to infant's mothers. Whilst this approach has minimal financial
      implications of human resources, no evidence exists regarding its effectiveness in
      establishing desirable infant's oral health behaviours. In Syria, there is a great need for
      developing an infant's oral health promotion program to promote oral hygiene practice,
      provide access to fluoride and terminate bottle-feeding practice. Thus, the current study
      aimed to test the effectiveness of an integrated infant's oral health promotion intervention
      within the Syrian national immunization program, which delivered printed dental education
      materials, a baby tooth brush, fluoride toothpaste (1000 ppm) and a trainer cup, in
      establishing one-year old infant's oral hygiene and bottle-feeing termination practices.

      The current randomized controlled trail allocated 92 one-year old infants, attending a
      maternal and child health center in Sweida city-Syria, to receive their vaccination, into
      three groups: test, control 1 and control 2. The test group received an infant oral health
      promotion package including a child oral health pamphlet, a baby toothbrush, fluoride
      toothpaste (1000 ppm) and a trainer cup. Control 1 received only an infant pamphlet, whilst
      Control 2 received no intervention. A mother's self-completed structured questionnaire and an
      infant's clinical examination were completed and performed, at baseline and after one month,
      to assess tooth brushing and bottle-feeding practices as well as the presence of old plaque
      on infant's primary teeth, respectively.
