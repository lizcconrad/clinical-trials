  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is the leading cause of death in people 44 years of age or younger. After major
      trauma, such as following high-speed motor vehicle collision, bleeding coupled with clotting
      defects is responsible for most of deaths in the first hours of hospital admission. Of note,
      these bleeding-related deaths are potentially preventable. Accordingly, the initial
      in-hospital management of severely injured patients focuses on stopping bleeding, replacing
      blood loss and correcting clotting defects.

      Recently, animal and human research demonstrated that one of the major clotting defects
      following injury and bleeding is the drop in blood levels of fibrinogen (a clotting factor),
      which is detected on hospital admission in severely injured patients. These low fibrinogen
      levels are associated with increased blood transfusion and death. However, in North America,
      the standard of care for replacing low fibrinogen requires the use of cryoprecipitate, which
      is a frozen blood product with long preparation time, and similarly to other blood products,
      carries the risk of viral transmission and transfusion complications. Alternately, many
      Europeans countries where cryoprecipitate has been withdrawn from the market due to safety
      concerns, use fibrinogen concentrate. Fibrinogen concentrate undergoes pathogen inactivation,
      which is a process to eliminate the risk of transmitting viruses, bacteria and parasites, is
      likely a safer and faster alternative to cryoprecipitate. In Canada, fibrinogen concentrate
      is licensed for congenital low fibrinogen only.

      Although preliminary data suggest that fibrinogen supplementation in trauma is associated
      with reduced bleeding, blood transfusion, and death, the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      early fibrinogen replacement remains unknown. We proposed to conduct a feasibility randomized
      trial to evaluate the use of early fibrinogen concentrate against placebo in injured patients
      at our trauma centre.

      A pilot trial is necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly preparing, delivering,
      and infusing fibrinogen concentrate as an early therapy to prevent excessive bleeding in
      trauma. This feasibility trial will provide preliminary safety and clinical outcome data to
      inform the design of larger trials; which ultimately aims to prevent bleeding-related deaths
      in the trauma population.

    <description>Fibrinogen concentrate (RiaSTAP™) is a freeze-dried lyophilised plasma product presented in powdered form. The powder is reconstituted with water for intravenous injection at a concentration of 20 mg fibrinogen per ml. The concentrate is formulated with human albumin, L-arginine, sodium citrate and sodium chloride. RiaSTAP™ is supplied as a purified lyophilisate in a 1g dosage form and is reconstituted in 50 ml of sterile water. The final volume of RiaSTAP™ to be infused in this study will therefore be 300 ml.</description>
