      An Open-Label Phase 1 Pilot Study to determine the safety and feasibility of CART-EGFRvIII
      (autologous T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express a chimeric antigen
      receptor specific for EGFRvIII) in the treatment of patients with EGFRvIII+ glioblastoma who
      have had their first recurrence as determined by standard imaging or have have residual
      disease after initial resection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             at least 5 days prior to apheresis.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Documented negative serum HCG for female patients of
             child-bearing potential.

               -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal

               -  Coagulation tests PT and PTT have to be within normal limits, unless the patient
