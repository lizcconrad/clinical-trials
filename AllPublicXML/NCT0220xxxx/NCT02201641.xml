      This study aims to investigate the tooth nerve response to a recently introduced therapeutic
      filling material (calcium silicate cement) called Biodentine and to assess the quality of the
      overlying filling compared to another material (glass ionomer cement) called Fuji IX used
      more commonly. Also to compare the effectiveness of cone beam computed tomography x-rays
      compared to conventional periapical x-rays in detecting lesions around these teeth.

    <textblock>
      Tooth decay is one of the most widespread diseases in the world. Very often, a patient comes
      to the dental clinic when experiencing pain which commonly means the decay is deep and is
      very close to or has penetrated the nerve of the tooth. When the decay is very close to the
      pulp or nerve of the tooth, a procedure called pulp capping is done in an attempt to save the
      tooth and to prevent root canal treatment. A material has been introduced to the market for
      this purpose, called Biodentine. This study aims to investigate the nerve response to this
      material and to assess the quality of the overlying filling compared to another material
      (glass ionomer cement) used more commonly. Also, X-rays are a routine procedure used to
      assess how close the decay is to the nerve and to see if there are abnormalities around the
      tooth. However conventional X-rays may not be accurate. A new technique called Cone Beam
      Computed Tomography (CBCT) has been developed which shows a 3-D image of the tooth and may be
      more accurate. We aim to compare the images gained from conventional X-rays and CBCT to help
      improve diagnosis and care planning for patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The principal outcome of the study is whether the tooth restored with the test or control material remains vital (alive) at follow-up examination.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The vitality of the restored tooth (whether the nerve of the tooth is alive or dead) is determined clinically by a positive response to cold test, absence of spontaneous pain, negative sensitivity to percussion, absence of sinus/fistula/swelling and abnormal mobility, and absence/reduction of periapical radiolucencies as determined by PA radiographs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The integrity of the composite restoration overlying the test or control material is either acceptable or not.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed clinically by USPHS criteria and Hickel's criteria for the assessment of dental restorations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The CBCT scans of the teeth restored with the test or control material are either more effective or are comparable to conventional radiographs in detecting the presence of early peri-radicular lesions associated with the restored teeth.</measure>
