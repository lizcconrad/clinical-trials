  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition affects 50% of hospitalized patients around the world and causes changes in
      respiratory muscles predisposing the development of pulmonary complications probable, because
      of the ineffectiveness of cough. How the training of respiratory muscles can improve the
      effectiveness of cough, malnourished patients could benefit from this train however, the
      training of the muscles in malnourished patients has not been tested for safety or
      efficiency. So, the aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficiency of respiratory
      muscle training to improve the potency of cough in malnourished patients.
