  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet quality has been associated with a variety of chronic diseases including obesity. One
      measure that has been studied as an indicator for diet quality is fruit and vegetable intake.
      Although the US government has suggested that American's increase their intake of fruit and
      vegetables, epidemiological data suggest that most Americans have not been successful doing
      do, with the strongest disparity seen in people of low socioeconomic status (SES). This
      disparity in fruit and vegetable intake is thought to be the result of both individual and
      environmental factors that influence this health behavior. To help decrease the disparate
      rise in incidence of chronic disease in people of low SES, effective, cost-efficient and easy
      to implement interventions to improve fruit and vegetable intake and diet quality are needed.

      Theoretical models of health behavior change have been successfully used in research
      targeting individual factors associated with health behaviors. One theory, the Theory of
      Planned Behavior (TPB), and a proposed extension of this model (implementation intentions)
      have been shown to be effective to increase fruit and vegetable intake in (mostly) white
      adults of average socioeconomic status. It is not know whether an implementation intention
      intervention to increase fruit and vegetable intake would be effective in women who are of
      low socioeconomic status. The primary aim of this research is to study (using quantitative
      and qualitative analysis) an implementation intention intervention to produce a positive
      change in fruit and vegetable intake. We theorize that the setting of an implementation
      intention in this group will be effective, cost-effective, and easy to implement intervention
      to promote an increase in fruit and vegetable intake.

    <description>Change in mean intake of fruit and vegetables (servings per day) will be assessed in both the experimental and control groups using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Fruit and Vegetable Module. Inferential statistics will be used to assess differences in change in mean fruit and vegetable intake both within and between groups.</description>
