    <textblock>
      Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) are well established in anesthetic practice. Among these
      devices ,classic laryngeal airway has been typically widely used. The self-pressurised air-Q
      (air-Q) is newly developed supraglottic airway devices. It is a new single-use device that
      may optimise the airway sealing while reducing the potential for postoperative complications
      such as sore throat. The overall structure of the air-Q SP is identical to the original
      air-Q, except with regard to the inflatable cuff. The aim of this randomized trial was to
      compare the clinical performance of the classic LMA and the air-Q SP.

    <measure>airway leak pressure measured after device insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>within 5min to 10 min insertion of each device</time_frame>
    <description>Airway leak pressure was determined by adjusting the expiratory valve of the breathing circle to 40 cmH2O (fixed fresh gas flow 3 L/min) and recording the pressure when equilibrium was reached.</description>

    <measure>Insertion time</measure>
    <time_frame>During and 1 min after insertion of each device</time_frame>
    <description>Insertion time was defined as the time from the attending anesthesiologist picking up the LMA until the confirmation on capnography.</description>
