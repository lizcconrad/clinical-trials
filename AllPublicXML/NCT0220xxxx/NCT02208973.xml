               3. Clinically acceptable blood pressure and pulse rate in supine and standing
                  position. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after a minimum of 3 minutes
                  of resting.

               4. Body weight within normal range (Quetelet's index between 19 and 26) expressed as
                  weight (kg) / height (m2).

               5. Able to understand the nature of the study and comply with all their
                  requirements.
