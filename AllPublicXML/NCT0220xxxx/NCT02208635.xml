  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the quantity of Zn absorbed from an accurately
      weighed quantity (~100 g) of minimally milled control maize (~15 µg Zn/g maize), from
      biofortified maize (~30 µg Zn/g) and from the same control maize that has been fortified
      (total level of ~60 µg Zn/g) when fed to young children age 24-36 months whose major habitual
      food staple is maize.

      Participating children were randomized to receive an accurately weighed quantity of ~100g/day
      of either the control, fortified or biofortified study maize for 1 day.

      On day 1, mothers brought their child to the health center before breakfast. All meals were
      extrinsically labeled with a zinc stable isotope (70Zn). Meals on this day were consumed in
      the presence of the research staff. The quantities of nshima or porridge prepared and eaten
      were accurately weighed and duplicate meals were collected for subsequent mineral analyses.

      Between lunch and dinner on day 1 at the Health Center, a blood sample was collected for Hb
      and plasma Zn analyses and, immediately after and through the same needle, a stable isotope
      of zinc was intravenously administered into a forearm vein over 1-2 minutes. The family then
      returned home.

      Morning spot urine samples were collected twice daily starting on day 5 and continuing
      through day 8. Once these collections were finished, the study for this child was complete.

      Dietary Zn was measured from laboratory assays of the duplicate test meals. Fractional
      absorption of Zn (FAZ) was measured by dual isotope tracer ratio methods in urine. Absorbed
      Zn was calculated by multiplying dietary Zn by FAZ.

    <description>Absorption of zinc will be measured in young children fed a diet of control, Zn-biofortified, or Zn-fortified maize. Fractional absorption of zinc from all meals of the day will be measured by extrinsic labeling with stable isotopes of zinc. Fractional absorption of zinc will be measured by a dual isotope tracer ratio technique. Measurement of total zinc in duplicate diets on test day will allow determination of quantity of this micronutrient absorbed (mg/d).</description>
