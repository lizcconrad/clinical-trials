    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (before the injection of propofol or mixture of propofol and etomidate) to 10 min after the injection</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate will be recorded immediately when the patient arrived at the operating room, 2 min, 4 min, 6 min, 8 min and 10 minutes after the the injection of propofol or mixture of propofol and etomidate.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to discharge from the hospital, expected to no more than 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The following point-in-time will be recorded to calculated the period from the injection of propofol or mixture of propofol and etomidate: disappearance of eyelash reflex, injection of supplementary propofol or mixture of propofol and etomidate, awaking, obeying commands, discharge. Anesthesia time was defined as the period from disappearance of eyelash reflex to awaking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose of propofol or mixture of propofol and etomidate</measure>
    <time_frame>from the injection of propofol or mixture of propofol and etomidate to the last supplement of hypnotic agents, expected to be no more than 5 min</time_frame>

    <time_frame>from 5 min after the operation to discharge from the hospital, expected to be no more than 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal rating scales of uterine contraction should be recorded at 5 min, 15 min after the operation and before discharge from the hospital</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction degree of the patient, the surgeon and the anesthetist</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min before discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction degree will be rated as excellent, good and poor based on a scale of 1 to 10. Excellent is 8 to 10, good is 5 to 7 and poor is 1 to 4.</description>

    <description>In group A, propofol (1%) was mixed with etomidate in the ration of 1:1 (volume). The mixture will be injected continuously until the eyelash reflex disappears. During the operation, supplementary mixture will be administered if the patient has spontaneous movement that hampered the conduct of the procedure.</description>

    <description>In group B, propofol (1%) was mixed with etomidate in the ration of 7:5 (volume). The mixture will be injected continuously until the eyelash reflex disappears. During the operation, supplementary mixture will be administered if the patient has spontaneous movement that hampered the conduct of the procedure.</description>
