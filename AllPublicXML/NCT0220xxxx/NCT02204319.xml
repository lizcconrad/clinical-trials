      The objectives of this pilot study are to demonstrate effectiveness of application of the
      Erchonia Laser (manufactured by Erchonia Corporation),a non-invasive, non-significant risk
      low level laser red diode light therapy device, in providing relief of pain symptoms in
      patients with provoked and non- provoked vulvar vestibulitis; to reduce the frequency of use
      of oral medications to manage pain symptoms; and to reduce the debilitating affect vulvar
      vestibulitis has on the patient's daily activities, relationships and emotional well-being.

    <textblock>
      In the current proposed pilot study, application of a low level laser light device,
      manufactured by Erchonia Corporation, to reduce the pain of vulvar vestibulitis will be
      evaluated. The Erchonia Laser device will emit three independent 7 milliWatt, 635 nanometer
      red light diodes in a hand-held device and is a variable frequency pulsed wave device.

      Erchonia low level lasers have been determined safe and effective and non-significant risk
      (NSR) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for application for numerous and various pain
      reduction indications, providing justification for the anticipated safety and effectiveness
      of application of the Erchonia Laser to reduce pain in patients with vulvar vestibulitis. The
      FDA has granted 510(k) clearances for Erchonia low level laser devices for five pain
      reduction indications, all cleared under Product Code 'NHN', defined as: &quot;A light based
      non-laser device that emits energy in infrared or other wavelengths, provides non-heating and
      non-thermal effect, and is indicated for adjunctive use in pain therapy or related
      indication. It does not provide therapeutic topical heating.&quot;

      The research will be conducted at ProHealth Care; Inc. across four campuses. Patients will be
      seen in private rooms in the therapy departments.

      All study staff are licensed in the field of either Occupational Therapy or Physical therapy
      (2 in each) with the advanced continuing education necessary to call them a &quot;specialist&quot; in
      the treatment of pelvic floor disorders. All investigators will complete CITI training for
      research.

      Subjects will be referred into the ProHealth Care system via a prescription for pelvic floor
      therapy signed by a licensed medical professional with the expertise to diagnose Vulvar
      vestibulitis. Written information regarding the study and proposed treatment will also be
      mailed to a larger group of pelvic floor therapists in the greater Milwaukee Wisconsin region
      through a &quot;Pelvic Floor Study Group&quot; list informing them of the need for subjects with this
      diagnosis so that they may inform their clients of the availability of such research. These
      clients may then request a referral from their private health care provider.

      The pilot study will be completed in twelve months following the commitment of ProHealth
      Care, Inc. Institutional Review Board as well as procurement of initial funding through
      grants applied for during 2013. There will be 10 patients enrolled in the pilot study.

      Patients will be screened after they are referred by their physician for physical therapy.

Each participant received six cold laser light therapy treatments and were assessed pre and post treatment with Q tip testing at each treatment visit. There was also a two week follow up scheduled for re-assessment.
Treatment for each patient was not standardized since there were four therapists involved in data collection and treatment. The treatments included manual therapy mobilizations, neuromuscular rehabilitation with or without EMG biofeedback, home care training which may have included lubricant usage, dilator training, and exercises for the pelvic floor as well as methods of pain relieving modalities.</description>

            <description>10 enrolled in the study. Seven completed the study and three withdrew. Each participant received six cold laser light therapy treatments and were assessed pre and post treatment with Q tip testing. There was a two week follow up scheduled for assessment.
Treatment for each patient was not standardized since there were four therapists involved in data collection and treatment. The treatments included manual therapy mobilizations, neuromuscular rehabilitation with or without EMG biofeedback, home care training which may have included lubricant usage, dilator training, and exercises for the pelvic floor as well as methods of pain relieving modalities.</description>

          <description>The laser unit emits three independent 7 mW, 635 nm red light diodes in a hand-held device and is a variable frequency pulsed wave device. Erchonia low level lasers have been determined safe and effective and non-significant risk (NSR) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for application for numerous and various pain reduction indications, providing justification for the anticipated safety and effectiveness of application The cold laser was administered over 10 minutes as follows: 5 minutes at the area of sacral nerve roots 2-4 in the side-lying position- hertz settings: 14, 8, 12, 28; and 5 minutes at the vulva in the lithotomy position, hertz settings 2: 9,16,33,60 while the outer labia were held open by the therapist. A sweeping motion was used during administration. The laser head was positioned approximately 3 inches from the skin surface and did not touch the skin. The patient wore safety goggles while the laser treatment was provided.</description>
