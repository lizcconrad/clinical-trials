    <textblock>
      The objective of the SIM trial is to investigate whether using the Surefire Infusion System
      during holmium-166 radioembolization increases the posttreatment tumor to non-tumor activity
      concentration ratio, compared with using a standard end-hole microcatheter.

      Study design: clinical within-subject randomized controlled trial.

      Study population: 25 patients with unresectable, chemorefractory, liver-dominant colorectal
      liver metastases.

      Intervention: scout and therapeutic doses of holmium-166 microspheres will be administered in
      the left and right hepatic artery during two sequential angiography procedures on the same
      day. In all subjects, the use of the Surefire Infusion System and the standard end-hole
      catheter will be randomly allocated to the infusion site (left and right hepatic artery).

      Baseline and follow-up investigation: at baseline and during follow-up, patients will undergo
      physical examination and laboratory investigations for toxicity assessment, and a whole-body
      18F-FDG-PET + dual-phase liver CT (at baseline and 3-months follow-up) for tumor response
      assessment. After the scout procedure and therapeutic procedure, a holmium-166 SPECT/CT will
      be obtained for the assessment of the microsphere distribution.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The primary endpoint is the tumor to non-tumor activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT.

      Secondary endpoints include mean absorbed doses of radioactivity in tumorous and healthy
      liver tissue, tumor response, the predictive value of holmium-166 scout dose and infusion
      efficiency. These endpoints will be compared between the Surefire Infusion System and
      standard microcatheter infusions. A dose-response relationship, clinical toxicity and overall
      survival will be assessed for the entire cohort.
