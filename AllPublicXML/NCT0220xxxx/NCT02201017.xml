      A total of 621 consecutive male and female subjects, without established CAD, referred to
      exercise stress testing (EST) due to 1) chest pain syndromes or equivocal/equivalent angina
      with intermediate pretest probability for CAD; 2) , or asymptomatic subjects with diabetes
      mellitus who are referred EST for risk assessment prior to initiation of an exercise program.

      To validate the diagnostic performance of the HeartTrends device for the detection and ruling
      out of myocardial ischemia in a population of subjects who are currently referred for
      cardiovascular evaluation using EST.

      Prospective multicenter single-armed study, assessing the diagnostic accuracy of HRV analysis
      by the HeartTrends device for the detection of myocardial ischemia, as determined by stress
      echocardiography.

        A total of 621 consecutive male and female subjects, without established CAD, referred to
        exercise stress testing (EST) due to 1) chest pain syndromes or equivocal/equivalent angina
        with intermediate pretest probability for CAD; 2) , or asymptomatic subjects with diabetes
        mellitus who are referred EST for risk assessment prior to initiation of an exercise
        program.

        Pretest probability of CAD will be based on the ACC 2002 guideline update on exercise
        stress testing1.
