  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among existing surgical techniques, spinal fusion is considered as the gold standard to treat
      a broad spectrum of degenerative spine disorders, including spondylolisthesis and scoliosis,
      with regard to pain reduction and functional improvement. However, pseudarthrosis and failure
      to relieve low back pain are unfortunately still frequent, irrespective of the type of
      procedures and grafts used by the surgeon.

      The present Phase 2a study aims at demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ALLOB®, a
      proprietary population of allogeneic osteoblastic cells, in lumbar spinal fusion.
