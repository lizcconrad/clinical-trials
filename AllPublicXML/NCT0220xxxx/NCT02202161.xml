    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of GSK2330672 compared to sitagliptin when administered with metformin for
      14 days to subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Approximately 72 male and female
      subjects aged 30-64 years with T2DM and currently taking metformin will be recruited for this
      study. Eligible subjects will begin a run-in period of 13-15 days to stabilize on metformin
      850 milligram (mg) twice a day (BID). Subjects will then be randomized to GSK2330672 10 mg,
      20 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg, matching placebo or open-label sitagliptin 50 mg for 14 days BID.
      Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 7-10 days after discharge.

             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's
             medical records]; OR Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             &gt; 40 million international units (MlU)/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147
             picomol per liter) is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods as described by the Investigator/designee, if they wish to continue their HRT
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive
             method

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods as described by the Investigator/designee. This criterion

The solution of GSK2330672 (2 mg/mL), was prepared by clinical staff pharmacists after reconstitution of GSK2330672 powder with phosphate buffer into amber glass bottles for administration. All dosing treatments, bottle rinses and additional water was consumed within a 15 minute period. Participants continued to receive metformin 850 mg tablet BID throughout the study (run-in and treatment period). Participants swallowed the whole metformin tablet with 240 mL of water and were instructed to avoid chewing or crushing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Derived Plasma Glucose Parameter Over a 24-hour Period-fasting and Weighted Mean Glucose Area Under Curve (AUC[0-24 Hour])</title>
        <description>The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-Baseline values. Baseline was defined as pre-dose Day -1 value. It was assessed on Baseline, Day 7 and 14. Data for fasting and weighted mean (WM) AUC(0-24 hour) glucose is provided. Statistics for least square mean is provided and participants withdrawing early were excluded. Results were based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model: change from Baseline = Baseline + treatment.</description>

        <title>Summary of Urinalysis Data-mean Specific Gravity</title>
        <description>Data for mean specific gravity is provided. Specific gravity is a measure of the amount of material dissolved in the urine. Specific gravity is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of a substance to the density (mass of the same unit volume) of a reference substance. Normal urine has a specific gravity between 1.010 and 1.020.</description>

        <title>Summary of Urinalysis Data-mean pH</title>
        <description>Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0).</description>

        <description>The site staff classified participant’s stools and record the date and time of occurrence after any bowel movement that occurs while participants were in residence in the clinic. BSFS is scale between type 1-7, it measured the shape of the stool, type 1: separate hard lumps, like nuts; type 2: sausage shaped but lumpy; type 3: like a sausage or snake but with cracks on its surface; type 4: like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; type 5: soft blobs with clear cut edges; type 6: fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool and type 7: watery, no solid pieces. Participants were discharged after they have had at least one bowel movement after the Day 14 dosing and after the investigator/designee had reviewed the Day 15 end of study questions.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Gastrointestinal Tolerability Assessments as Rated Using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS; With Worsening Symptoms &gt;=2 Levels)</title>
        <description>GSRS is a rating scale consisting of 15 items. Each item was scored from 1: no discomfort at all, 2: minor discomfort, 3: mild discomfort, 4: moderate discomfort, 5: moderately severe discomfort, 6: severe discomfort, 7: very severe discomfort. The overall GSRS score is the mean of these 15 items, varying from 1 to 7; a score of 1 indicates that no symptoms are present, and a score of 7 indicates the worst possible degree of all symptoms. A higher score relative to Baseline indicates worsening of severity. There were 5 defined syndrome scores and 1 overall score that was derived by computing the mean of the scores for specific subsets of questions as indicated below: abdominal pain (1, 4, 5); reflux syndrome (2, 3); diarrhea syndrome (11, 12, 14); indigestion syndrome (6, 7, 8, 9); constipation syndrome (10, 13, 15) and overall GSRS (1-15). The data is presented for participants with worsening of symptoms in &gt;=2 levels.</description>

            <description>Participants were randomized to receive solution of GSK2330672 90 mg orally BID for 14 days. Participants drank the contents of dosing bottle (45 mL) followed by 2×50 mL rinses of bottle and then an additional 95 mL water for a total volume of 240 mL consumed. The solution of GSK2330672 (2 mg/mL), was prepared by clinical staff pharmacists after reconstitution of GSK2330672 powder with phosphate buffer into amber glass bottles for administration. All dosing treatments, bottle rinses and additional water was consumed within a 15 minute period. Participants continued to receive metformin 850 mg tablet BID throughout the study (run-in and treatment period). Participants swallowed the whole metformin tablet with 240 mL of water and were instructed to avoid chewing or crushing.</description>
