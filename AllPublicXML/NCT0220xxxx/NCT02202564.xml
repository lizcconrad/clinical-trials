  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HCC patients with tumors &gt;5 cm in diameter, regardless of involvement in the intrahepatic and
      extrahepatic portal branches participated in the study. Patients were randomized allocated in
      liver transplantation (LT) only group and LT plus ADV-TK therapy group. All patients received
      orthotopic liver transplantation; in the LT plus ADV-TK group, ADV-TK therapy was delivered
      to patients twice.
