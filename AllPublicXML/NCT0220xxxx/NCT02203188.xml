  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjogren's Syndrome is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own glands in the
      body. Some of these glands are responsible for providing lubrication for the eye. As a
      result, individuals with Sjogren's Syndrome often experience dry eye. Recently, a study had
      shown that dry eye symptoms were improved by removing debris and old skin cells along the
      eyelid margin. This technique is called eyelid debridement-scaling. The purpose of this study
      is to determine how well this technique works in improving dry eye signs and symptoms in
      individuals with Sjogren's Syndrome.

    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index Score (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Prior to treatment (if applicable). The OSDI is a questionnaire that consists of 12 questions about ocular irritation and the effect of dry eye on vision. For every question, participants check a score between 0 and 4, where 0 equals &quot;none of the time&quot; and 4 equals &quot;all of the time&quot;. OSDI scores are calculated according to: OSDI = [(sum of scores for all questions answered)*100] / [(total number of questions answered)*4]. The possible range of the OSDI score is 0 to 100.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;

          -  Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          -  Has a systemic condition, other than Sjogren's Syndrome and its associated conditions,
             that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study outcome variable;

          -  Is using any systemic or topical medications, other than those indicated for Sjogren's
             Syndrome and its associated conditions, that in the opinion of the investigator may
             affect a study outcome variable;

          -  Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;

          -  Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment;

          -  Is aphakic;

          -  Has undergone refractive error surgery; * For the purposes of this study, active
             ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which requires therapeutic
             treatment. Lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae),
             corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered active ocular
             disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia,
             infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.
