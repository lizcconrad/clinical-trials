  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to find out more about the addition of the antibiotic,
      doxycycline, to standard anti-amyloid therapy in people with amyloidosis. The investigators
      want to find out whether doxycycline improves the response to standard anti-amyloid therapy
      and whether it causes any problems (side effects).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Organ response to anti-plasma cell therapy in AL amyloidosis tends to lags behind hematologic
      response as chemotherapy may not clear pre-formed organ amyloid. Doxycycline has been shown
      to have inhibitory effects on amyloid fibril formation as well as de-fibrillogenic effects
      and shown to be beneficial in in vitro, murine models and other preclinical studies. The
      investigators will prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of doxycycline in AL
      amyloidosis patients when used in conjunction with anti-plasma cell chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with biopsy proven AL amyloidosis.

          2. Patients â‰¥ 18 years of age are eligible.

          3. Patient must provide informed consent.

             Breast feeding is not permitted.

          6. Patients who have previously been taking doxycyline will be eligible as long as there
             is no contraindication to stay on doxycycline 100 mg BID for 1 year in the opinion of
             the treating physician.

          7. Creatinine clearance of &gt;25 ml/min.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with severe malabsorption syndrome precluding absorption of oral agents will
             be excluded.

          2. Known intolerance or allergic reactions with doxycycline.

          3. Previous chemotherapy for AL amyloidosis.
