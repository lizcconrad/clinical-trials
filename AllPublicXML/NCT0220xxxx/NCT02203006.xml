      The purpose of this study is to improve our knowledge concerning HIV infection, treated or
      not, in the current conditions of care to optimize it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the arrival of highly active tritherapies, HIV infection became mainly an ambulatory
      chronic pathology centred on a long term care taking into account the complication of
      long-term treatment as well as the arisen of new problem bound to a prolonged survival and
      ageing. So the care is more and more in a prevention and screening approach with in
      particular the care of metabolic and cardiovascular complication due to antiretroviral
      treatment.

      As a reorganization of the coverage of the HIV infected people take place on the Hotel Dieu
      Hospital it thus seems important to double this care optimization with a clinical research
      side. This will be done in constituting an HIV patient cohort including a blood sample
      collection to contribute to the vigilance of the complication to due the infection.

      Our ultimate objective is to optimize the selection of the treatment. It is important to do
      it to be able to have, on many years duration, precise clinical information and biological
      sample allowing to realize later some assay and analyse the influence of some genetic
      markers.
