    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness (good
      and bad effects) of ixazomib given as part of a combination therapy to treat subjects with
      relapsed (subjects whose disease came back) or refractory (subjects whose disease did not
      respond to past treatment) multiple myeloma. More specifically, the study is focused on
      subjects who were previously treated with bortezomib (Velcade®) or carfilzomib (Kyprolis®)
      and showed worsening of their myeloma while receiving either one of these drugs in
      combination therapy. This study is a Phase I/II. Ixazomib is an investigational drug, which
      means that ixazomib is currently being tested and is not yet approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
      Ixazomib is a new study drug that belongs to the same class as bortezomib and carfilzomib;
      however, unlike bortezomib and carfilzomib, ixazomib is taken by mouth. Current studies
      investigating ixazomib are demonstrating that it is as safe as bortezomib and effective for
      the treatment of multiple myeloma both on its own and in combination with other multiple
      myeloma medications, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or prednisone and melphalan.

      This is a phase 1/2, intra-patient, multicenter, open-label and non-randomized study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixazomib as a replacement for bortezomib or carfilzomib
      among multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have failed proteasome inhibitor (PI)-containing
      combination regimens. Patients will receive ixazomib once a week in place of bortezomib or
      carfilzomib in combination with an alkylating agent (melphalan or cyclophosphamide),
      anthracycline (pegylated doxorubicin [PLD]), immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide,
      pomalidomide), ascorbic acid and/or a glucocorticosteroid (dexamethasone, prednisone or
      methylprednisolone) administered using the same dose(s) and schedule(s) as the last
      PI-containing regimen that the patients had received and failed. The total number of
      different prior bortezomib- or carfilzomib-containing regimens that will be evaluated is 10,
      reflecting those commonly used in the community as follows:

        -  bortezomib + melphalan + prednisone

        -  bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + ascorbic acid

        -  bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone

        -  bortezomib + PLD + dexamethasone

        -  bortezomib + dexamethasone

        -  carfilzomib + dexamethasone

        -  bortezomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone

        -  bortezomib + pomalidomide + dexamethasone

        -  carfilzomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone

        -  carfilzomib + pomalidomide + dexamethasone

      This study will enroll 60 patients who are refractory to a bortezomib- or
      carfilzomib-containing combination regimen, as demonstrated by progressive disease (PD) while
      being treated, or who have relapsed within 8 weeks from the last dose of bortezomib or
      carfilzomib in their last PI-containing combination regimen.

      Ixazomib will replace bortezomib or carfilzomib using the same PI-containing regimen the
      patients failed.The study will consist of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day
      treatment cycles; 3) a maintenance period; 4) a final assessment to occur 28 days after the
      end of the last treatment cycle; and 5) a follow-up period.

      Ixazomib will be administered PO at 4 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle to patients
      enrolled in seven regimens (bortezomib + melphalan + prednisone, bortezomib + dexamethasone,
      carfilzomib + dexamethasone, bortezomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone, bortezomib +
      pomalidomide + dexamethasone, carfilzomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone, carfilzomib +
      pomalidomide + dexamethasone). Subjects on those regimens receiving 4 mg of ixazomib from the
      beginning of the trial will continue to do so for the length of the study, unless they suffer
      from adverse events requiring dose reductions. For the other three regimens, bortezomib +
      cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone, bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + ascorbic acid, and
      bortezomib + PLD + dexamethasone, the MTD for ixazomib is unknown and intra-patient dose
      escalation will be performed to determine the specific MTD for each of them. For these three
      regimens, ixazomib will be administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle at a starting
      dose of 3 mg in Cycle 1, and then intra-patient dose-escalation will proceed to 4 mg in Cycle
      2. All other agents will be administered at the same schedule and dose intensity as those of
      the last PI-containing treatment the patient failed.

                    2. monoclonal immunoglobulin present but of lesser magnitude than given under
                       major criteria

                    3. lytic bone lesions

                    4. normal IgM less than 50 mg/dL, IgA less than 100 mg/dL, or IgG less than 600
                       mg/dL

             Any of the following sets of criteria will confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma:

               -  any 2 of the major criteria

               -  major criterion 1 plus minor criterion 2, 3, or 4

               -  major criterion 3 plus minor criterion 1 or 3

               -  minor criteria 1, 2, and 3, or 1, 2, and 4

          3. Currently has progressive MM that has previously progressed or is currently
             progressing while receiving or within 8 weeks of receiving bortezomib or carfilzomib
             as part of a combination treatment. MM patients that demonstrate refractory disease,
             as defined below, are both eligible for enrollment provided they fulfill the other
             eligibility criteria:

             • Patients are refractory to a bortezomib or carfilzomib combination regimen, when
             they progress while currently receiving a bortezomib or carfilzomib combination
             treatment, or within 8 weeks of its last dose. Patients are considered relapsed, when
             they progress between 8 and 12-weeks from their last dose of bortezomib or carfilzomib
             as part of a bortezomib or carfilzomib combination therapy. Prior treatment with four
             days or less of a total of 400 mg of prednisone (or an equivalent potency of another
             steroid) for MM will not be considered a regimen.

          4. Patients that were on bortezomib-containing regimens must have been administered at
             least 4 doses of a minimum of 1.0 mg/m2 in no more than 28-days cycles. Subjects must
             have received at least one cycle meeting this definition and have shown PD to be
             considered eligible

          5. Patients that were on carfilzomib-containing regimens must have received at least 6
             doses of at least 27 mg/m2 in no more than 28 days per cycle. Subjects must have
             received at least one cycle meeting this definition and have shown PD to be considered
             eligible

          6. Progressed from one of the specific bortezomib- or carfilzomib-containing regimens as
             listed on page 51. Although bortezomib- and carfilzomib-containing combination
             regimens that are otherwise identical except for the PI result in the same ixazomib
             regimen, they will be enrolled separately so that safety/efficacy can be separately
             determined, thereby allowing comparisons based on the prior PI that subjects were
             exposed to as part of the regimen that they failed (carfilzomib vs. bortezomib)

          7. Patient may have received a carfilzomib- or bortezomib-containing regimen at any time
             and may have received other non-proteasome inhibitor-containing intervening treatments

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has been diagnosed with:

               1. Plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy,
                  monoclonal protein (M protein) and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome.3

               2. Primary amyloidosis

               3. Plasma cell leukemia

               4. Severe hypercalcemia, i.e., serum calcium = 12 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) corrected for
                  albumin

          2. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years before study enrollment or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type
             are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.

          3. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including
             myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment, New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) Class II or greater heart failure, uncontrolled angina, clinically significant
             pericardial disease, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, echocardiogram or
             multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) evidence of left ventricular ejection fraction
             (LVEF) below institutional normal within 28 days prior to enrollment,
             electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system
             abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be
             documented by the investigator as not medically relevant

          4. Patient has peripheral neuropathy grade 3 or higher or Grade 2 with pain on clinical
             examination during the screening period

          5. Patient has received the following prior therapy:

               1. Chemotherapy within 21 days of enrollment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas)

               2. Corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) within 21 days of
                  enrollment

               3. Immunotherapy or antibody therapy as well as thalidomide, pomalidomide,
                  lenalidomide, arsenic trioxide, carfilzomib, or bortezomib within 21 days before
                  enrollment

          6. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the
             various formulations of any agent

          7. Known GI disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or
             tolerance of ixazomib including difficulty swallowing
