      This study will compare the Gingival Bleeding and Gingival Inflammation following twice daily
      use of a sodium bicarbonate experimental dentifrice compared to a 0% sodium bicarbonate
      toothpaste after 24 weeks of use. The study will be conducted at Salus Research, Inc.
      Participants will be recruited from their database and by use of an external recruitment
      agency

      This study will be a single-centre, examiner blind, two treatment, parallel group, stratified
      (by baseline number of bleeding sites smoking status and bacterial sampling) randomized
      clinical study. At the screening visit, following provision of written informed consent,
      eligible participants will be provided with a standard toothpaste and toothbrush for brushing
      once in at the clinic and for approximately one week use at home until the baseline visit.
      Participants will be asked to abstain from brushing over a 12 hour period prior to the
      Baseline visit. At the baseline visit an oral soft tissue (OST) assessment, Modified Gingival
      Index (MGI) and Bleeding Index (BI), and then dental plaque assessment will be performed.
      Participants will be stratified according to their baseline number of bleeding sites, smoking
      status and whether selected for bacterial sampling. Participants will be then randomized into
      one of two treatment groups. After using, their assigned treatment twice daily at home for 6
      weeks (visit 3), 12 weeks (visit 4) and 24 weeks (visit 5), participants will return to the
      site with overnight plaque at approximately the same time of day as the Baseline visit if
      possible. Participants will undergo a full OST examination and the recording of any Adverse
      Events (AEs). Participants will then undergo MGI, BI followed by dental plaque assessment.
      Microbiological samples will be collected on a subset of 50 participants (Determined by first
      50 participants randomized).

    <measure>Number of Gingival Bleeding Sites at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Bleeding Index was performed by a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system used is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Gingival Index (MGI) at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MGI was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces at two sites on each tooth (papillae and margin). The scoring of the MGI was performed under dental office conditions using a standard dental light for illuminating the oral cavity. Compressed air, water and mouth mirrors were available to each examiner. This procedure was performed by a single examiner. The MGI scoring system is as follows: 0 = absence of inflammation; 1 = mild inflammation; slight change in color, little change in color; little change in texture of any portion of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 2 = mild inflammation; criteria as above but involving the entire marginal or papillar gingival units; 3= moderate inflammation; glazing, redness, edema, and/ or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 4 = severe inflammation; marked redness, edema and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, spontaneous bleeding, congestion, or ulceration</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BI was performed by a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1mm into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system used is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed</description>

    <measure>Plaque Control (Overall and Interproximal Dental Plaque Scores) at 6, 12 and 24 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The dental examiner had used the Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index to assess plaque on all gradable teeth. Interproximal Dental Plaque Scores were analyzed in the same way as for Overall scores but just based on mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces. Dental Plaque (Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification Index) Units on a scale 0 to 5: 0= No plaque; 1= Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth; 2= A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth; 3= A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth; 4= Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the crown of the tooth; 5= Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth.</description>

    <measure>Bacterial Count at Baseline, After 6, 12, 24 and 32 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological samples were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 32 weeks. Plaque was harvested from contra-lateral 1st molar teeth, where no restorations are present, using a sterile paper point. The paper point was immersed into 4 ml of Calgon Ringer's solution in a sterile bijou and kept on ice until they can be taken to the laboratory for processing (within 24 hours).</description>

        <title>Number of Gingival Bleeding Sites at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Bleeding Index was performed by a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI scoring system used is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed</description>

        <title>Modified Gingival Index (MGI) at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>MGI was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces at two sites on each tooth (papillae and margin). The scoring of the MGI was performed under dental office conditions using a standard dental light for illuminating the oral cavity. Compressed air, water and mouth mirrors were available to each examiner. This procedure was performed by a single examiner. The MGI scoring system is as follows: 0 = absence of inflammation; 1 = mild inflammation; slight change in color, little change in color; little change in texture of any portion of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 2 = mild inflammation; criteria as above but involving the entire marginal or papillar gingival units; 3= moderate inflammation; glazing, redness, edema, and/ or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 4 = severe inflammation; marked redness, edema and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, spontaneous bleeding, congestion, or ulceration</description>

        <title>Plaque Control (Overall and Interproximal Dental Plaque Scores) at 6, 12 and 24 Weeks.</title>
        <description>The dental examiner had used the Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index to assess plaque on all gradable teeth. Interproximal Dental Plaque Scores were analyzed in the same way as for Overall scores but just based on mesiofacial, facial, distofacial, mesiolingual, lingual and distolingual surfaces. Dental Plaque (Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification Index) Units on a scale 0 to 5: 0= No plaque; 1= Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth; 2= A thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth; 3= A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of the tooth; 4= Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the crown of the tooth; 5= Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth.</description>
