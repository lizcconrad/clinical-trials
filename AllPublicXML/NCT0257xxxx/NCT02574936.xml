      The purpose of this study is to reduce the volume of dead space by a modification in kardakis
      flap procedure and consequently, to reduce the use of drains, wound drainage, seroma and
      hematoma formation, skin degradation and recurrence rates.

      The study was a pilot study of 80 patients. Excluding criteria were previous sinüs surgery,
      active infection, patients who did not accept the procedure and patients under age of 18.
      After excision of the sinüs volume was measured using a beaker. A flap extending across the
      cut (Karydakis) was prepared in medial edge of the wound, 1 cm deep and 2 to 3 cm to be
      towards the interior. Prepared flap was shifted to the medial and sutured to presacral fascia
      with vicryl 2/0. To reduce the volume of the dead space formed in the lateral, 5 mm skin was
      excised along the incision in the flap side. Skin was approximated with sutures in the form
      of intermittent, using 2/0 poliprolen. No drain used. All patients were discharged on
      postoperative day 1. Sutures were removed 2 weeks later. All patients for at least 6 months
      were followed for wound drainage, seroma and hematoma formation, separation of skin and and
      recurrence.
