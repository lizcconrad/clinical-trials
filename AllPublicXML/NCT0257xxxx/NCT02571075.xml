      The purpose of this study is to determine if auricular acupuncture significantly reduces
      post-operative pain in comparison to the standard of care. Post-operative pain score will be
      collected by subject self-report of pain according to the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (0= no
      pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain) up to 10 days post-operation.

      DESIGN:

      Design type: Prospective, randomized control trial Sample

        -  Description of the population: All adults, greater than or equal to 18 years, undergoing
           a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy at Womack Army Medical Center are eligible
           for participation in the study.

        -  Sample Size: 100 subjects. A target of 45 subjects per group for a total of 90 subjects,
           and accounting for a 10 percent drop out rate. In Fiscal Year 12, 92 tonsilectomies in
           patients over the age of 12 were performed at Womack Army Medical Center. Therefore, the
           investigators anticipate the study will take up to 4 years to enroll 100 adult subjects.

        -  Power Analysis: Under the assumption of a linear time by treatment interaction, assuming
           subject-level randomization, five time-points, power of 80 percent, a Type I error rate
           of 5 per cent and no attrition, to detect a 1.6 difference in pain score requires a
           total sample size of 90 subjects or 45 per treatment arm.

    <description>Pain scores will be collected daily during the post op period in the recovery room using the NRS (numerical pain scale) and recorded by the participant at home using the same type scale that is provided to them. The Hypothesis is that subjects receiving intraoperative auricular acupuncture during a tonsillectomy will have statistically significantly less post-operative pain scores compared to those that do not.</description>

    <description>The intraoperative and recovery room morphine equivalents will be calculated and upon diary return what use is recorded by the patient will be done as well. The participant is instructed to write down the type and amount they take throughout that time period.</description>
