      Study in 400 patients with bipolar disorder I or II, of relapse risk factors. The principal
      objective of this research is to test the predictive value of core vulnerability dimensions
      such as affective instability and emotional reactivity, measured by validated questionnaires
      (AIM and ALS) on recurrence of affective major episode (depressed, hypomanic or manic) during
      a 24 months prospective follow-up.

      In addition, several arguments suggest that inter-individual variability in the risk of
      relapse is influenced by genetic factors. In particular, the implication of such factors have
      been demonstrated in rapid cycling or antidepressants induced mania. However, this has never
      been tested in cohorts followed prospectively. Finally, the existence of neuropsychological
      deficits in bipolar disorder is well documented and their role in the risk of relapse is
      suspected. Yet the nature of these deficits, their origin and evolutionary course remain
      poorly investigated. In summary, the secondary objectives of this research are the study of
      the influence of these other clinical, neuropsychological and genetic factors on the risk of
      relapse.

      • Scientific rationale The dimensions of affective instability and emotional reactivity, are
      considered core psychological and temperamental vulnerability dimensions to bipolar disorder.
      Differences in levels of instability and reactivity may account for the inter-individual
      variability observed in bipolar disorder in terms of risk of relapse. These dimensions are
      measured using validated questionnaires (Affective Instability Measure (AIM) and Affective
      Lability Scale (ALS)). Relapsing is defined as the occurrence of a depressive episode,
      hypomanic, manic or mixed episode (DSMIV criteria).

      Other factors that may influence the risk of relapse have been suggested in the literature
      but have not been formally tested in prospective studies:

        1. cognitive deficits: the existence of neuropsychological deficits in bipolar disorder are
           well documented and their role in the risk of relapse is suspected. Yet the nature of
           these deficits, their origin and their course remain poorly investigated. Indeed, some
           appear to be related to the neurotoxicity of the episodes themselves, the other being
           related to the vulnerability to bipolar disorder

        2. The involvement of genetic vulnerability factors in bipolar disorder is widely
           demonstrated. Several arguments suggest the implication of genetic factors in the risk
           of relapse. This is the case for some outcome patterns such as rapid cycling or
           antidepressants induced mania. Again, this has never been tested in cohorts followed
           prospectively.

        3. The role of certain inflammatory and infectious factors in the etiology of bipolar
           disorder has been suggested but it is clear whether these biomarkers are &quot;state&quot; or
           &quot;traits&quot;. Thus, the role of neurotoxic inflammatory or infectious factors in relapse
           mood has never been tested in a prospective follow up studies.

             -  Main objective of the project To determine if the scores of AIM and ALS, assessed
                at baseline in euthymic bipolar patients is associated with relapse in patients
                during a 2 years follow-up period.

             -  Secondary objectives of the project Determine if the neuropsychological performance
                at T0, measured in euthymic patients predict relapse during a 2 years follow-up
                period.

      Determine whether the neuropsychological deficits observed in euthymic bipolar patients that
      contribute to functional impairment worsen with time.
