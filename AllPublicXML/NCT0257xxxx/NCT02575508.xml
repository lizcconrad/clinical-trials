    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pan fibroblast growth factor
      receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor BGJ398 when given together with fluorouracil, irinotecan
      hydrochloride and oxaliplatin (combination chemotherapy) in treating patients with untreated
      pancreatic cancer that has spread to another place in the body. Pan FGFR kinase inhibitor
      BGJ398 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and
      oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pan FGFR
      kinase inhibitor BGJ398 together with fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin
      may be a better treatment for pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine dose-limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II
      dose of BGJ398 (pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398) administered in combination with modified
      (m)FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin) in patients with
      advanced pancreatic and colorectal cancer patients. (Phase Ib)

      II. To determine the 6-month overall survival rate of patients with treatment-naïve
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with BGJ398 plus mFOLFIRINOX. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BGJ398, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan
      (irinotecan hydrochloride) and their metabolites when administered in combination and explore
      for drug-drug interactions. (Phase Ib)

      II. To determine the 1-year overall survival rate, response rate, progression free survival
      and cancer antigen (CA)19-9 changes in treatment-naïve metastatic pancreatic cancer patients
      treated with BGJ398 plus mFOLFIRINOX. (Phase II)

      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of BGJ398 in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in
      the study population.

      IV. To explore plasma and tumor biomarkers associated with efficacy to the study combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV
      over 90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Patients
      also receive pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days and then every 4
      months for up to 2 years.

             significant traumatic injury =&lt; 4 weeks and minor procedures (including percutaneous
             biopsies, placement of vascular access device, laparoscopy +/- biopsy) =&lt; 1 week prior
             to starting study treatment; patients who have minor procedure(s) &gt; 1 week prior to
             starting study treatment and have recovered from side effects of such procedure are
             eligible

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements

          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the participant an unsuitable
             candidate to receive study drug

          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Pregnant or nursing women; a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) =&lt; 3 days prior
             to starting study treatment

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant) unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during study treatment and for 3 months following the discontinuation of study
             treatment; highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject); periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment;
                  in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening); for female patients on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient

               -  Combination of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                    -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception

                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository; oral contraceptives (OC), injected or implanted hormonal
                       methods are not allowed as the sole method of contraception

          -  Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study; women are considered
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago;
             in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse during and for 3
             months after the last dose of the study treatment and should not father a child in
             this period; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to
             prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid
