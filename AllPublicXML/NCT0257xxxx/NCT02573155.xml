  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomised, placebo-controlled 2-part study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AZD8871 delivered by inhalation, in
      asthmatic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an integrated Phase I protocol divided into 2 parts.

      Part 1: single ascending dose study (6 AZD8871 dose levels) in 16 male subjects with mild
      asthma. AZD8871 will be administered (by the GenuairÂ® inhaler) under supervision at the study
      centre, according to the randomisation scheme

      Part 2: a 5 treatment period single dose study (of AZD8871 [two doses], indacaterol,
      tiotropium and placebo) in 40 male and non-childbearing female subjects with moderate to
      severe COPD. Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days.
      The primary comparison for bronchodilation will be between AZD8871 doses and placebo.
