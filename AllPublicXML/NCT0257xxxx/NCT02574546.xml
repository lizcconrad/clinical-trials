    <textblock>
      This research is being done to learn more about the risk of developing breast cancer by
      studying cells from both normal breast tissue and breast cancer tumor tissue. The goal is to
      study cells, genes, and gene products to help us to learn how to detect cancer in its
      earliest stages, and if this information may differ in patients with different ethnic
      backgrounds.

      Evidence suggests that, besides reduced access to care, the increase in breast cancer
      incidence and mortality in AA (African American) compared to EA (European American or
      Caucasian) women is influenced by the biology of the tumor. Gene methylation changes caused
      by environmental factors starting at birth is one mechanism through which genetic and
      non-genetic factors could affect development of breast cancer and which could underlie
      disparities in aggressiveness. The investigators were the first to show that a panel of genes
      was hypermethylated specifically in AA-ER-negative tumors in young women in comparison to
      EA-tumors in women of the same age. Gene promoter methylation is found at low levels in
      healthy breast tissues from women without cancer. Race and family history of cancer increase
      the likelihood of these early events. Thus, epigenetic changes may be early events in
      transformation of breast cells and tumor formation.

      This study will enroll women from different ethnic backgrounds undergoing mastectomy in order
      to collect normal and tumor tissue to study these genetic changes and breast cancer risk.

          -  Women

          -  18 years and older

          -  Histologically proven infiltrating carcinoma of the breast on diagnostic biopsy. NOTE:
             Individuals planning bilateral mastectomy procedures (for either bilateral cancers or
             contralateral prophylactic procedures) either at the same time or in the future will
             be asked to have tissue removed for the study from both breasts.

          -  ER-negative, any PR status, and any HER2 status (i.e., ER-, PR any, HER2- or ER-, PR
             any, HER2+; &quot;triple positive&quot; breast cancers are not eligible).

          -  Unresected, untreated breast cancer planning surgical management with mastectomy (with
             or without axillary nodal evaluation/dissection and/or with any other clinical
             assessment).

          -  Willing and able to sign an informed consent form
