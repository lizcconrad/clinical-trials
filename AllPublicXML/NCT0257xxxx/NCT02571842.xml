    <textblock>
      Currently, the treatment options of recurrent IgA nephropathy (IgAN) are conflicting and
      largely based on expert opinions. Consequently, the recent KDIGO clinical practice guideline
      for the care of kidney transplant recipients has concluded that there are no definite
      strategies for prevention and treatment. However, recurrent IgAN in the transplanted kidney
      is common and may contribute to graft loss, in particular, if cresentic formation, extra- or
      endocapillary proliferation were presented in kidney pathology. Herein, the investigators
      assume that rituximab, anti-CD20 Ab agent, can reduce circulating IgA with subsequently
      decrease rate of polymeric forms of IgA deposition in glomerular capillaries. Therefore, the
      investigators speculate that rituximab may have potential effect to reduce circulating
      polymeric forms of IgA and slow progression of recurrent IgAN.

      Hypothesis: In kidney transplant recipients with active endocapillary proliferation pathology
      of recurrent IgAN, an intravenous infusion of 375mg/m2 of rituximab on 4 consecutive monthly
      dose is superior to conventional therapy in reducing 24-hour proteinuria, and slowing
      progression of recurrent IgAN.

An ACEI and /or ARBs will be used to achieve proteinuria reduction and a blood pressure goal of &lt;130/80 mmHg. Patients not attaining the target blood pressure with an ACEI or ARB alone should be treated with the combination of ACEI + ARB
Corticosteroids will be used as prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day with gradually taper off in 6-8 weeks to 5mg/day daily
