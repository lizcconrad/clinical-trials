  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In human, 2% of couples experimented Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Currently, while
      etiological investigations were performed, 40 to 50 % of RPL were unexplained. In animals'
      studies, several studies have underlined the importance of sperm quality for a normal embryo
      development. In human, epidemiological studies have demonstrated that several male risk
      factors have effects on development (male mediated development toxicology). However, few
      studies have explored sperm DNA fragmentation on embryo development but after in vitro
      fertilization. In natural pregnancy only rare studies have been performed but with different
      populations definitions and different methods of sperm exploration. In this context sperm DNA
      fragmentation exploration appears justified. The present study purpose to conduct a case -
      control study in order to research paternal role in RPL.
