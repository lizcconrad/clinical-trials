  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the relation between the structural brain changes
      associated with heart failure, neurocognitive performance, and how these changes impact
      self-care behaviors.

      The purpose of this study is use neuroimaging techniques to better understand the underlying
      structural brain changes and physiological mechanisms that guide the thinking and decision
      making processes required for people with heart failure. The study will compare how the
      underlying brain structures and circulation are similar to or different in persons with heart
      failure to healthy, aged matched controls using special neuroimaging procedures.
