  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual disorders are often overlooked in the treatment of cognitive disorders of the elderly.
      Yet the visual deficit impacts the quality of life, the evolution of the autonomy and
      psycho-behavioral disorders in cognitive diseases. The main objective of the study is to
      evaluate the prevalence of visual disorders among elderly patients at consultant outpatient
      center of Nantes clinical gerontology as part of the consultation geriatric memory. Secondary
      objectives are to describe ophthalmological diseases detected and taken into the proposed
      ophthalmic load, to determine if there are associations between eye diseases and cognitive
      disorders, to estimate the proportion of patients who may have an ophthalmologic evaluation
      to determine the cognitive profiles and geriatric evaluation and ocular pathological,
      depending on the assessment of arterial stiffness. The results of this study will build a
      testing strategy to promote access of older patients with cognitive impairment to vision
      care.
