  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this extension study was to further assess the safety and
      tolerability of talimogene laherparepvec. Secondary objectives were to assess objective tumor
      response rate and survival.

    <textblock>
      This was an extension study to the multicenter, open-label, phase 2 Study 002/03
      (NCT00289016). Participants who had received the maximum 24 treatments under Study 002/03 and
      met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were eligible to enroll.

      Participants continued to receive talimogene laherparepvec until discontinuation criteria
      were met. The discontinuation criteria were complete response, clinically significant
      progressive disease that rendered further dosing futile, receipt of 24 treatments or 12
      months on treatment (whichever was longer), occurrence of an unacceptable toxicity, death,
      investigator determination that other treatment was warranted, or another criterion for
      withdrawal from treatment (participant request, noncompliance with study procedures, or
      sponsor request).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec in Study 002-03-E and within 30 days of the last dose; median duration of treatment was 267 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of an adverse event (AE) was graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3 (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, 5 = death).
Serious adverse events include death, life-threatening events, events requiring or prolonging hospitalization, result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or otherwise important medical events that may jeopardise the patient or require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With an Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 12 weeks from the start of therapy in this extension protocol, or 12 weeks from the last assessment in the 002/03 protocol (whichever date is later) through 30 days after administration of the last dose; median duration of treatment was 267 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is defined as participants with an overall best response of complete response or partial response. The objective response to treatment was assessed by computed tomography (CT) scanning or other clinical measurement using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Responses must have been confirmed two visits not less than 4 weeks apart.
Tumor burden for a visit was calculated as the sum of the longest diameters of all tumors identified and measured up to that visit. Tumor response at each visit was derived from tumor burden, as follows:
Complete response (CR): zero tumor burden
Partial response (PR): a 30% or greater decrease in tumor burden
Progressive disease (PD): a 20% or greater increase in tumor burden
Stable disease (SD): none of the above (a &lt; 30% decrease and &lt; 20% increase in tumor burden)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Previously participated in Study 002/03 and met 1 of the following:

               1. Received the maximum 24 treatment injections in Study 002/03 and had not yet
                  achieved a complete response (CR) and whose response to OncoVEX^GM-CSF indicated
                  that treatment beyond 12 months was warranted, or

               2. Did achieve a CR in Study 002/03 and developed disease progression within 12
                  months of achieving a CR, or

               3. Terminated treatment in Study 002/03 to allow for treatment of brain metastases.
                  Treatment for brain metastases was no longer ongoing and the patient was able to
                  return to OncoVEX^GM-CSF injections within 3 months of completing treatment for
                  brain metastases.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 or 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 toxicity
             related to OncoVEX^GM-CSF of any organ system (with the exception of injection site
             reactions, fever and vomiting);

          2. History of Grade 3 fatigue lasting &gt; 1 week while on OncoVEX^GM-CSF treatment;

          3. History of Grade 3 arthralgia/myalgias while on OncoVEX^GM-CSF treatment;

          4. History of ≥ Grade 2 autoimmune reactions, allergic reactions or urticaria or other
             OncoVEX^GM-CSF-related non-hematological toxicities while on OncoVEX^GM-CSF treatment
             that required a dose delay or discontinuation of OncoVEX^GM-CSF therapy;

          5. Symptomatic malignant disease progression that required alternative melanoma
             treatment;

          6. Primary malignancy disease progression despite treatment with OncoVEX^GM-CSF;

          7. Patient requested to be withdrawn from or was unable to comply with the demands of
             Study 002/03.

        <title>Number of Participants With an Objective Response</title>
        <description>Objective response is defined as participants with an overall best response of complete response or partial response. The objective response to treatment was assessed by computed tomography (CT) scanning or other clinical measurement using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Responses must have been confirmed two visits not less than 4 weeks apart.
Tumor burden for a visit was calculated as the sum of the longest diameters of all tumors identified and measured up to that visit. Tumor response at each visit was derived from tumor burden, as follows:
Complete response (CR): zero tumor burden
Partial response (PR): a 30% or greater decrease in tumor burden
Progressive disease (PD): a 20% or greater increase in tumor burden
Stable disease (SD): none of the above (a &lt; 30% decrease and &lt; 20% increase in tumor burden)</description>
        <time_frame>Every 12 weeks from the start of therapy in this extension protocol, or 12 weeks from the last assessment in the 002/03 protocol (whichever date is later) through 30 days after administration of the last dose; median duration of treatment was 267 days.</time_frame>

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension).
