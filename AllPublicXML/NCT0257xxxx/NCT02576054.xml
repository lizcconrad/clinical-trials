    <textblock>
      This is a study of V501 [quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) (Type 6, 11, 16 and 18) L1
      Virus-Like Particle (VLP) vaccine] in healthy Japanese boys. This study will consist of two
      periods. Period I of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and tolerability of V501 up
      to Month 7. Period II of the study is to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety
      from Month 7 to Month 30. Two analyses are planned. The first analysis will be conducted when
      all subjects have completed their Month 7 visit or have been discontinued before that time.
      The second analysis will be conducted at the end of study. The primary hypothesis tested in
      this study is that seroconversion rates for the vaccine HPV types will be &gt;90% at 4 weeks
      postdose 3.
