  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a single-arm trial design, this study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of
      evaluating QuitAdvisorDDS, a clinical decision support software application designed to
      facilitate implementation of evidence-based tobacco treatment interventions into the dental
      setting. The study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of evaluating the impact of
      the QuitAdvisorDDS tool on patient outcomes related to tobacco use and cessation attempts as
      well as provider knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding tobacco treatment.
      Practitioners (dentists and hygienists) will complete surveys at baseline and follow-up,
      while patients will complete surveys at baseline and 1-month follow-up. An embedded substudy
      will also evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of collecting biospecimens (saliva) to
      serve as biochemical verification of smoking status.
