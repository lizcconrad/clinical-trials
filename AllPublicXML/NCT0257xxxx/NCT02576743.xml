    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the blood hemodynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution
      in patients with brain aneurysms and AVMs as well as in healthy controls. Parameters such as
      peak blood velocity, wall shear stress and other derived parameters will be obtained from 4D
      flow MRI data acquired at ultra-high field strength (7 Tesla).

      The hemodynamic factors responsible for hemorrhagic stroke, resulting in wide variations in
      the clinical management of underlying vascular lesions, especially when they are found in
      asymptomatic individuals or individuals with symptoms not related to the disease. Therefore,
      there is an urgent need for the development of reliable biomarkers based on hemodynamic
      parameters, which can then enable improvements in risk assessment in patients presenting with
      these lesions. This need can be met by non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      techniques that provide information on high resolution vascular anatomy, visualization of
      cerebral hemodynamics and quantitative information about blood velocity. However, such
      techniques as presently employed at 1.5 or 3 Tesla are limited by spatial resolution and
      prolonged data acquisition times.

      The primary goal of this proposal is to overcome these current limitations by exploiting
      Ultra-High Fields (UHF, i.e. â‰¥ 7 Tesla (7T)) to attain significantly higher spatial
      resolution, faster acquisitions and increased lesion conspicuity utilizing

        -  Qualitative exploration of intracranial blood hemodynamics,

        -  Quantitative imaging of the spatiotemporally resolved blood velocity vector,

        -  Derivation of hemodynamic parameters.
