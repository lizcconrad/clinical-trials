      Aim: To evaluate the effect of caffeine on acupuncture analgesia with the human pain model.

      Design: Double blind, randomized controlled trial will be performed in Chengdu. The study
      including two pain models : Potassium pain model and Capsaicin pain model. Both models
      including the following several groups: 200mg caffeine group, 400mg caffeine group, and
      decaffeinated group. Participants will be randomly assign to the three groups. Each
      participants will receive coffee drinking and acupuncture intervention. Each subjects of the
      Potassium pain model will receive be measured the pain at baseline, 30 minutes after drinking
      coffee, 10, 20, 30 minutes during acupuncture and 30 minutes after acupuncture intervention
      completed. Blood samples will be collected at baseline, 30 minutes after drinking coffee, 30
      minutes during acupuncture and 30 minutes after acupuncture intervention completed. Each
      subjects of the capsaicin pain model will be measured the spontaneous pain with VAS scale and
      the area of hyperalgesia with Von Frey hair at the time of 5 minutes after topical
      application of capsaicin , 30 minutes after drinking coffee, 10, 20, 30 minutes during
      acupuncture and 30 minutes after acupuncture intervention completed. Blood samples will be
      collected at the time of 5 minutes after topical application of capsaicin, 30 minutes after
      drinking coffee, 30 minutes during acupuncture and 30 minutes after acupuncture intervention
      completed.
