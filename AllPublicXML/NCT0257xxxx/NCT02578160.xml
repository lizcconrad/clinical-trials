  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. The aim of this study
      will be to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;Tell-Show-Do&quot; Behavior Management Technique versus
      a Conventional technique (covering the patient's vision) during an inferior alveolar and
      lingual nerve block in preschool children referred for treatment at the School of Dentistry,
      University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The sample will consist of 52 children from 3 years old to 5
      years 11 months old who need dental pulp treatment and / or tooth extraction of primary
      molars. Preschool children with no history of allergies to Lidocaine anesthetic or
      systemic/neurological diseases and who did not take local anesthesia before the study will be
      include in this research.

    <textblock>
      Children will be randomly allocated to treatment groups (n = 26 for each group) according to
      the technique: (1) Tell-Show-Do and (2) Conventional. Anxiety and pain will be evaluated by
      the scale of Facial Image (EIF) and Wong-Baker Pain Scale, respectively. The cooperation of
      the patient will be evaluated by behavioral scale Frankl.
