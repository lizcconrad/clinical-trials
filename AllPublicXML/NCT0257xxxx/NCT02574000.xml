  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to address the following questions.

        1. How many people develop stroke-shoulder pain within 3 days of stroke?

        2. How many people have stroke shoulder pain at 8-10 weeks after stroke?

        3. Does having stroke-shoulder pain within 3 days of stroke predict the likelihood of
           having stroke-shoulder pain at 8-10 weeks?

        4. What are the best bedside examination tests to identify stroke-shoulder pain?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be assessed very early after stroke (within 72 hours) and followed up 8-10
      weeks later. Findings will enable planning of fully-powered randomised controlled trials of
      both, pain-prevention strategies and treatment.
