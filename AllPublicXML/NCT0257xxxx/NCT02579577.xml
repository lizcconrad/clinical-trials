  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population of children with life-limiting illnesses (LLI) in England is increasing and
      there is growing need to improve the quality of children's palliative care. Families of
      children with LLI are confronted with many care decisions for their children, such as whether
      and when to commence artificial nutrition or ventilation. They may also have the opportunity
      to consider the care that may be appropriate for their child in the future. Despite the
      important decisions families and professionals are required to make, there is little
      empirical evidence regarding the process of decision making and future planning for this
      population. Few studies have investigated the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and none
      have addressed multiple perspectives longitudinally. Therefore the relational and contextual
      aspects of decision making and future planning for children with LLI have as yet not been
      identified.

      A multiple embedded case study utilising ethnographic methods (semi-structured interviews,
      observation and notes review) is proposed to address this knowledge gap. Families of children
      with LLI cared for in either of two participating hospitals will be recruited and followed up
      for up to 12 months. The family will be invited to nominate 'significant others' (e.g.
      relatives, friends, health care professionals) who assist them in decision making and future
      planning, to participate in the study. Outpatient clinic appointments or ward rounds during
      periods of hospitalisation will be observed and semi-structured interviews will be conducted
      approximately three times with each participant. Medical notes will be reviewed at the end of
      the study.

      This research will enable a better understanding of the experiences and preferences for
      engaging in decision making and future planning from the perspectives of all stakeholders. It
      will also provide an awareness of the communication practices involved in discussions and the
      networks of care surrounding children with LLI, including specific support needs in relation
      to their role.

    <description>Interviews will be semi-structured, with a broad opening question asking the participant about the child at the centre of the case; both in terms of their illness and their context (family, personality, values and goals). Although the topics of decision making and future planning will be covered within the interview, the way in which these are initiated are likely to be different for each participant and asked in relation to the responses given to the opening question.</description>

        Each case will be centred around a child with a life-limiting illness and their parents who
        will have been identified as eligible by their usual care team. Additional significant
        others who are important in their decision making and future planning will be identified by
        the family and will ideally include at least one health professional. However, the
        composition of each case will be determined by the child and family and may involve only
        them. Nominated 'significant others' may include extended family, peers, ministers of
        religion, key workers etc.

        Inclusion criteria - Parent

          -  Their child must be between 28 days and 18 years old

          -  Their child must have a LLI within categories 2-4 (Association for Children with
             Life-threatening and Terminal Conditions and their Families, 2004) (see page 8)

          -  Child must be under the care of a consultant at either of the two NHS Trusts included
             in the study

          -  The parent must be aware of the child's LLI diagnosis

          -  Participants must speak English. This is both due to resource constraints and due to
             the sensitive topic such that difficulties in translating questions sensitively may
             cause greater distress to participants.

        Inclusion criteria - Child

          -  Children will be classed as participants if their parent is a participant and consents
             to their child's medical notes being accessed.

          -  For children to participate in the interview component of the study, they must be over
             the age of 7 years and cognitively able to provide their own assent (or consent, if
             over 16 years old)

          -  Parents must have agreed to the child's participation if they are under 16 years old

          -  Participants must speak English or be able to communicate in some way using
             alternative or augmentative communication.

        Inclusion criteria - Significant Others/Professionals

          -  Significant others must have been identified by the eligible child and/or parents as
             being important in their decision making and future planning

          -  Participants must speak English

          -  Participants must be over the age of 7 years and provide their own assent alongside
             parental consent (if under 16 years old) or provide consent if they are over the age
             of 16 years (in the case of a friend or sibling being nominated as a 'significant
             other').

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Families and significant others of children with ACT Category 1 life-threatening
             illnesses (Conditions for which curative treatment may be feasible but can fail)

          -  Participants who do not meet the inclusion criteria.
