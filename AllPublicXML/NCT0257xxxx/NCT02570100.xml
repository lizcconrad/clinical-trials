  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From a cellular perspective, breast cancers appear to develop hierarchically from a small
      contingent of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The presence of CSCs in tumor tissue is associated
      with an increased risk of recurrence and metastasis, as well as a worse prognosis. Thus,
      these CSCs exhibit resistance to conventional anti-tumor treatments such as radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Moreover, these treatments would favor the emergence of these CSCs and the
      reprogramming of non-CSCs in CSCs. It has been demonstrated in neoadjuvant that the
      proportion of CSCs before any treatment is correlated with chemoresistance and that a
      resurgence of CSCs after chemotherapy is correlated with a poor prognosis. However, the
      mechanisms involved in the emergence of CSCs by reprogramming of non-CSCs are not yet known.

      The Oscar Lambret Center proposes a monocentric prospective interventional study based on the
      cellular and molecular analysis of the tumor, serum and circulating cells, before, during and
      at the end of the treatment for each patient receiving a neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast
      cancer. The identification of the mechanisms contributing to the enrichment of CSCs resistant
      to chemotherapy could lead to therapeutic solutions.

      Patients responding criteria for selection will sign an informed consent form.

      Before the initiation of chemotherapy, a tumor specimen (under echographic control) and four
      blood samples will be collected. The chemotherapy consists of 3 cycles of (F)EC100 spaced 21
      days apart :

        -  Epirubicin, 100 mg/m² in intravenous (IV)

        -  Cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m² in IV

        -  +/- 5-fluorouracile (5FU), 500 mg/m² in IV

      Followed by 3 cycles of Taxotere (Docetaxel, IV, 100 mg/m²) spaced 21 days apart +/-
      Herceptin (Trastuzumab, IV, 8 mg/kg during C1 and then 6 mg/kg) for 1 year in the case of
      overexpression of the HER-2 oncoprotein.

      After 3 cycles of chemotherapy (that is to say at the end of the (F)EC100 treatment, at the
      time of the usual ultrasound examination), a tumor specimen and four blood samples will be
      taken. After 6 cycles of chemotherapy (that is to say at the end of the Docetaxel +/-
      Trastuzumab treatment), four blood samples will be collected. A partial or total mastectomy
      could be performed during the 6 cycles of chemotherapy. During surgery, a tumor specimen will
      be taken. The indication of breast surgery will remain at the discretion of the
      pluridisciplinary committee of the participating center.

      Prior to the start of treatment, patients will have a clinical and a paraclinical examination
      and will undergo laboratory examinations. On day 1 of the fourth cycle and after the sixth
      cycle of chemotherapy, patients will have a clinical examination and will undergo laboratory
      examinations. After three cycles of chemotherapy, at the time of the intermediate breast
      ultrasound, patients will have paraclinical examinations. Finally, at the end of the study
      (after partial or total mastectomy), anatomopathological examinations will be performed on
      the operative specimen.
