    <textblock>
      Comparing intermediate-dose CTX (ID-CTX)and G-CSF with rhTPO or without for peripheral blood
      stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma, try to find out whether rhTPO
      combined to ID-CTX + G-CSF could improve the results of peripheral blood stem cell
      mobilization.

      The purpose of this study is to try to find out whether rhTPO combined to ID-CTX + G-CSF
      could improve the results of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization. Comparing ID-CTX and
      G-CSF plus rhTPO or not for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple
      myeloma. rhTPO15000U/d were given from day 5~7 after chemotherapy until the stem cell
      collection .
