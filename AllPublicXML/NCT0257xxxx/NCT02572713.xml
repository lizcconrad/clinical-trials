  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure alpha-synuclein in peripheral body tissues and fluids
      in Parkinson's disease (PD). This may help in developing better treatments for PD patients in
      the future.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice
             (GCP), International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and local regulations.

             incontinence) suggestive of an atypical parkinsonism.

          -  Has atypical features of parkinsonism including but not limited to supranuclear gaze
             palsy, early recurrent falls, corticospinal track abnormalities, cerebellar
             abnormalities, significant cognitive dysfunction.

        Exclusion criteria (HC subjects):

             disorders, encephalitis, repeated head trauma, polyneuropathy).
