  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputees have reduced joint mobility and strength which negatively influence an
      individual's ability to maintain balance. Individuals with lower limb amputation also have an
      increased fear of falling and reduced social participation because of this fear. Improving
      balance ability, reducing falls and fear of falling through effective balance training
      interventions would have a number of socio-economic benefits. The aim of the current study is
      to investigate whether taking part in a games console based-balance intervention, improves
      balance ability in individuals with lower limb amputation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation (LLA) results in the loss of the biological joint structures such as
      the ankle and knee, along with the associated musculature. This reduces joint mobility and
      strength and thus adversely affects amputees' ability to maintain balance. As a result,
      individuals with a LLA have been shown to fall more often when compared to age-matched and
      otherwise healthy individuals. In addition, individuals with LLA also have an increased fear
      of falling and reduced social participation because of this fear. Improving balance ability,
      reducing falls and fear of falling in this patient group through effective balance training
      interventions would have a number of socio-economic benefits. Such benefits may include but
      are not limited to reduced care costs, reduced burden on healthcare services and an improved
      sense of patient well-being. Therefore, the main aim of the current randomised control trial
      (RCT) is to investigate whether taking part in a games console based-balance intervention,
      improves experienced LLAs balance ability. The RCT also aims to assess how this intervention
      affects an amputee's falls rate, fear of falling and quality of life. After providing
      informed consent, unilateral lower limb amputees will be randomly allocated to one of two
      groups; an experimental group (12-week balance training intervention) or a control group (no
      intervention). Amputees in the experimental group will be loaned the use of a games console
      for the duration of the home-based intervention. Balance ability, falls rate, fear of falling
      and quality of life will be assessed prior to and post the intervention period as well as
      after three months following the end of the intervention period. Falls rate will also
      assessed one year post the intervention period. Results from the current study will provide
      evidence for the use of games-console based balance interventions in improving balance and
      falls outcomes for LLA.

    <measure>Limits of Stability Test Protocol Directional Control Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 Month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will also be required to complete the Limits of Stability test (LOS) which measures a participant's ability to perform postural movements in order to voluntarily move their centre of gravity (COG) as they stand on a force platform. The LOS requires participants to move their COG in the direction of eight pre-determined target directions as quickly and as accurately as possible. The eight pre-determined target directions will be representative of an individuals' 100% limit of stability based upon their height. Assuming that the body acts as an inverted pendulum with rotation about the ankle, this relates to the amount of movement possible before the COG position necessitates adjustment of the base of support by stepping. The directional control score (%) will be produced from this test protocol.</description>
