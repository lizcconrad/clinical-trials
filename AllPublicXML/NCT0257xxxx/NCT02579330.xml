  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In various transanal and anal procedures it is desirable to clean the operating field from
      stool contamination. Thus mechanical bowel preparation is not well tolerated by patients.
      Enema does not provide sufficient effect. By the use of Coloshield a rectal washout might be
      performed and enable a clean operating field. In this randomized controlled trial the
      macroscopic contamination of the rectum with and without Coloshield is compared using the
      Boston Bowel Preparation Score (0-3).

    <description>Coloshield is designed to occlude the rectum during surgery thus enabling the possibility for rectal washout and maintaining a clear operating field. The rod-shaped Instrument contains two silicon balloons which are inflated by means of a catheter. Several holes at the section in between the two balloons are connected to another catheter, which enable negative pressure to be established. By insufflation of the two balloons and establishment of a negative pressure between the balloons by means of connection to a closed drainage bottle the colon is occluded for the duration of surgery.</description>
