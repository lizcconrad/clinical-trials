    <textblock>
      This type of study is called a radiolabeled study. For this study, LY3023414 has been
      specially prepared to contain the radioactive carbon atom [¹⁴C]. [¹⁴C] is a naturally
      occurring radioactive form of the element carbon. Adding a low dose of radiation to the study
      drug does not change how the drug works but helps to identify when the drug appears in the
      blood, urine, breath, and stool after it is given. The study will last about 15 days for each
      participant, not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to
      enrollment. This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical
      condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy men or women

               -  Male participants: Will be sterile (including vasectomy), confirmed by
                  documentation. Men who are sexually active with a pregnant partner agree to use a
                  condom for 91 days from the time of dosing

               -  Female participants: Women not of childbearing potential due to surgical
                  sterilization (at least 6 months after hysterectomy with or without bilateral
                  oophorectomy or at least 6 months after tubal ligation) confirmed by medical
                  history or menopause. Postmenopausal women include women with spontaneous
                  amenorrhea for at least 12 months, not induced by a medical condition such as
                  anorexia nervosa and not taking medications during the amenorrhea that induced
                  the amenorrhea (eg, oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotropin releasing
                  hormone, anti-estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or chemotherapy)
                  and a follicle-stimulating hormone level greater than 40 milli international
