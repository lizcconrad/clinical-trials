    <textblock>
      PregSource uses a crowd-sourcing approach, asking pregnant women to enter information
      regularly and directly about their pregnancies throughout gestation and the early infancy of
      their babies into online surveys and trackers via a website and/or mobile application
      (&quot;app&quot;). In exchange, participants can track their data over time, print out reports to share
      with their healthcare team, and see how they compare to other women. In addition, PregSource
      will provide participants with links to trusted, evidence-based information about pregnancy
      management, issues, and complications.

      The objective of PregSource: Crowdsourcing to Understand Pregnancy (PregSource) is: to better
      understand the range of physical and emotional experiences and alterations in behavior that
      women have during pregnancy and after giving birth, the impact of these experiences on
      women's lives, and the perinatal challenges encountered by special sub-populations of women.

      PregSource uses a longitudinal, crowd-sourcing, citizen science approach, asking pregnant
      women regularly and directly about their pregnancies. Participants enter information
      throughout gestation and the early infancy of their babies into online surveys and trackers
      via a website and/or mobile application (&quot;app&quot;). In exchange, participants will be able to
      track their pregnancy data over time, print out reports to share with their healthcare team,
      and view summaries of de-identified data to see how they compare to other women. In addition,
      PregSource will provide participants with links to trusted, evidence-based information from
      partner organizations about pregnancy management, issues, and complications.

      Participants may also be a potential pool of recruits for clinical studies. Based on
      information they enter, eligible women who are interested in participating in clinical
      studies may be sent contact information about observational or interventional studies. Their
      contact information will not be shared directly with researchers.

      After a critical mass of data is collected, de-identified data will be available to approved
      researchers for analysis.
