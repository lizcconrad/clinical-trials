      The purpose of this study was to determine the metabolism and elimination of 14C-lenvatinib
      in participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas, who were unsuitable for, or had
      failed, existing therapies.

    <textblock>
      The study comprised of two phases, the Study Phase and Extension Phase. Participants received
      14C-lenvatinib on Day 1 of the Study Phase. Thereafter participants were given daily oral
      doses of 24 mg of lenvatinib over a 28 day cycle. During the Study Phase, participants
      received an initial single dose of 14C-lenvatinib oral patient dosing solution containing 24
      mg of lenvatinib as anhydrous free base and radioactivity of 100 mCi (3.7 MBq) on Day 1,
      followed by collection of blood, urine and feces samples for pharmacokinetic analysis between
      Day 1 and Day 8, with a discharge visit on Day 8. Participants then entered the Extension
      Phase of the study to continue to receive once daily oral administration of non-radiolabeled
      lenvatinib at a dose of 24 mg. Each 28-day dosing period will be considered one treatment
      cycle.

    <description>A response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) was assigned by the investigator as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node had to be reduced in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. PD was defined as a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment start or the appearance of one or more new lesions. CR or PR was confirmed no less than 4 weeks after first observation of the response. For SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. SD is defined as lasting at least 5 weeks.</description>

          <description>Study Phase: Participants received a single dose of an oral dosing solution of 14^C-labeled lenvatinib (approximately 100 μCi or 3.7 MBq) and approximately 24 mg non-radiolabeled lenvatinib on Day 1. From Days 1 to 8, participants remained in the research unit so blood, urine, and fecal samples could be collected for PK analysis and determination of 14^C-lenvatinib concentrations prior to, and for 7 days following, drug administration. Participants were discharged after the checkout procedures were completed on Day 8, or when the level of radiation in urine and fecal samples was less than 1% of the total radioactive dose.
Extension Phase: Participants received 24 mg oral lenvatinib once daily at home or at the clinic on Visit Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each treatment cycle (1 treatment cycle = 28 days) until discontinuation from the study. The dose of lenvatinib could be reduced or discontinued during any cycle because of toxicity</description>

        <title>Terminal Exponential Half-life (t1/2) of Radiolabeled 14^C-Lenvatinib and Non-Radiolabeled Lenvatinib in Plasma</title>
        <description>Blood samples were drawn at specific time points then analyzed for the amount of 14^C-lenvatinib and non-radiolabeled lenvatinib in the plasma. The terminal phase t1/2 is the time required to divide the plasma concentration of study drug by two after reaching pseudo-equilibrium, and not the time required to eliminate half of the administered dose of study drug. The t1/2 during the apparent terminal disposition phase was calculated at 0.693/λz and was summarized as the Geometric Mean (CV%) for all participants and expressed as hours.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose, post-dose at 15 and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours), Day 2 (24 hours), Day 3 (48 hours), Day 4 (72 hours), Day 5 (96 hours), Day 6 (120 hours), Day 7 (144 hours) and Day 8 (168 hours)</time_frame>

            <description>Study Phase: Participants received a single dose of an oral dosing solution of 14^C-labeled lenvatinib (approximately 100 μCi or 3.7 MBq) and approximately 24 mg non-radiolabeled lenvatinib on Day 1. From Days 1 to 8, participants remained in the research unit so blood, urine, and fecal samples could be collected for PK analysis and determination of 14^C-lenvatinib concentrations prior to, and for 7 days following, drug administration. Participants were discharged after the checkout procedures were completed on Day 8, or when the level of radiation in urine and fecal samples was less than 1% of the total radioactive dose.
Extension Phase: Participants received 24 mg oral lenvatinib once daily at home or at the clinic on Visit Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each treatment cycle (1 treatment cycle = 28 days) until discontinuation from the study. The dose of lenvatinib could be reduced or discontinued during any cycle because of toxicity.</description>

            <description>Study Phase: Participants received a single dose of an oral dosing solution of 14^C-labeled lenvatinib (approximately 100 μCi or 3.7 MBq) and approximately 24 mg non-radiolabeled lenvatinib on Day 1. From Days 1 to 8, participants remained in the research unit so blood, urine, and fecal samples could be collected for PK analysis and determination of 14^C-lenvatinib concentrations prior to, and for 7 days following, drug administration. Participants were discharged after the checkout procedures were completed on Day 8, or when the level of radiation in urine and fecal samples was less than 1% of the total radioactive dose.
Extension Phase: Participants received 24 mg oral lenvatinib once daily at home or at the clinic on Visit Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each treatment cycle (1 treatment cycle = 28 days) until discontinuation from the study. The dose of lenvatinib could be reduced or discontinued during any cycle because of toxicity.</description>

        <description>A response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) was assigned by the investigator as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node had to be reduced in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. PD was defined as a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment start or the appearance of one or more new lesions. CR or PR was confirmed no less than 4 weeks after first observation of the response. For SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. SD is defined as lasting at least 5 weeks.</description>

            <description>Study Phase: Participants received a single dose of an oral dosing solution of 14^C-labeled lenvatinib (approximately 100 μCi or 3.7 MBq) and approximately 24 mg non-radiolabeled lenvatinib on Day 1. From Days 1 to 8, participants remained in the research unit so blood, urine, and fecal samples could be collected for PK analysis and determination of 14^C-lenvatinib concentrations prior to, and for 7 days following, drug administration. Participants were discharged after the checkout procedures were completed on Day 8, or when the level of radiation in urine and fecal samples was less than 1% of the total radioactive dose.
Extension Phase: Participants received 24 mg oral lenvatinib once daily at home or at the clinic on Visit Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each treatment cycle (1 treatment cycle = 28 days) until discontinuation from the study. The dose of lenvatinib could be reduced or discontinued during any cycle because of toxicity.</description>

          <description>A response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) was assigned by the investigator as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node had to be reduced in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. PD was defined as a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment start or the appearance of one or more new lesions. CR or PR was confirmed no less than 4 weeks after first observation of the response.
