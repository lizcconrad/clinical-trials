  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac Arrest is among the leading causes of death, with survival still well under 50% and
      the majority of the survivors suffering from moderate to severe neurologic deficits. The
      human, social and economic costs are staggering.

      During resuscitation, damage is mitigated if chest compressions and other medical care are
      optimal, allowing some blood to reach the brain and some oxygen to reach the cells. Once the
      heart starts beating again, which is called return of spontaneous circulation, brain
      perfusion is reestablished, but usually not to normal. The now damaged brain is very fragile,
      can be sensitive to any changes in blood pressure or metabolic abnormalities, and swelling
      might set in. Hypoperfusion can persist, without the clinician's knowledge. All of these
      events further damage the brain and diminish the odds that the patient will regain a normal
      life. Therefore, the hours following return to spontaneous circulation are critical to the
      patient's future recovery, and constitute a window of opportunity to maximize the brain
      ability to heal.

      In order to optimize resuscitative efforts and post-arrest management, clinicians must know
      what is actually happening with the most vital organ, the brain. The problem is that it is
      very difficult to do in a comatose patient. The available technologies only reveal indirect
      evidence of brain suffering, like the swelling on CT-scans, but not to continuously evaluate
      at the bedside if the brain actually receives enough blood.

      The FDA recently approved a device named the c-flow, made by ORNIM. This device looks at red
      blood cells in the brain and the speed at which they move to evaluate an index of cerebral
      perfusion. It does so with sensors put on the patient's forehead, which emit and detect
      ultrasounds and infrared light. This index can inform the clinician about the amount of blood
      flow the brain receives, and it can be put in place very quickly, even during resuscitative
      efforts, and without any danger for the patient.

      The study looks at how well the information obtained with the c-flow matches the one obtained
      from other indirect indices and, more importantly, how well it predicts patient outcome. The
      investigators wish to establish threshold values of this index of perfusion that predict a
      good recovery so that this information may be used to optimize patient's neurological outcome
      in the near future.

      Primary Objective:

      Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is undergoing a major paradigm shift, with new emphasis
      on optimizing neurological recovery. As a result, Cardio-Cerebral Resuscitation (CCR) is now
      the preferred term for describing protocols directed at promoting survival and recovery from
      cardiac arrest. Establishing and maintaining brain perfusion is the critical endpoint of
      resuscitation; however, there is currently no simple and reliable way to evaluate the
      adequacy of brain tissue perfusion in cardiac arrest patients. The overall goal of the NINCA
      study is to determine if non-invasive cerebral blood flow index (CFI) can be used as a simple
      and effective measurement of brain perfusion during and after resuscitation from cardiac
      arrest. Our researchers hypothesize that this monitoring may one day be routinely used to (1)
      evaluate the adequacy of chest compressions, (2) avoid brain tissue hypoperfusion induced by
      excessive hyperventilation or shivering, (3) serve as an endpoint for goal-directed
      hemodynamic support, (4) evaluate the potential for neurological recovery, and (5) help guide
      post-cardiac arrest care.

      Implications for Further Research:

      Successful completion of the research will hopefully establish that non- invasive cerebral
      blood flow monitoring is feasible during and after CPR; is dependent on adequate MAP, CO,
      temperature, SpO2 and ventilation; and is a valid predictor of neurological recovery. If
      confirmed, such monitors may one day become part of standard ICU post-cardiac arrest
      monitoring and even be part of standard resuscitation equipment.

      Determination of optimal CFI thresholds or targets will support future studies to determine
      if &quot;goal directed&quot; and individualized post-resuscitation ICU care is feasible using
      non-invasive cerebral perfusion indices. This could lead to a new way of optimizing
      hemodynamic support, temperature management and ventilation strategies to maintain adequate
      cerebral perfusion and improve neurological outcomes.
