  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of group-therapy
      supported internet-delivered CBT for adolescents (13 - 17 years) with social anxiety
      disorder. Investigators will conduct an open trial with N = 30 participants. Participants
      will be assessed at baseline, immediately after treatment and at a 6-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety disorder (SAD) among youths is highly prevalent and causes significant
      impairment in the lives of the affected. In spite of CBT being the most effective treatment,
      evidence suggests that many young people with this disorder do not have access to
      good-quality CBT. Internet-based CBT is, as numerous prior studies have shown, an effective
      method to treat psychiatric conditions in adults, but little is known about ICBT for
      adolescents and there are but a few controlled studies on ICBT for children and adolescents
      with anxiety disorders. This pilot trial will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a
      blended ICBT-treatment where internet-based and group-based sessions are combined.
      Furthermore, as ICBT is a novel format in the treatment of psychological problems in young
      people, it is essential to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the technical
      solutions that carry the active treatment. The study will also include genotyping of
      participants to further our understanding of etiology of SAD and to explore the relationship
      between genetic variations and treatment outcome. Additionally, as there is little known
      about the affect of ASD symptoms on treatment outcome in face-to-face CBT in general, and in
      ICBT in particular, the association between autistic traits and treatment outcome will be
      evaluated. Lastly, the role of attentional processes in the maintenance of social anxiety has
      been scarcely studied and an aim with the current study is to further our understanding of
      the cognitive factors that underlie SAD

    <description>The group therapy supported ICBT treatment program is a combined web-based and face-to-face intervention that will involve adolescents as well as their parents. The program is founded on and inspired by previously evaluated and evidence-based interventions. Altogether, adolescents go through 12 chapters/sessions, 3 of which are face-to-face group sessions at the research clinic, and 9 of which are web-bases chapters. The program is divided into three different phases, starting with psychoeducation regarding social anxiety and the rationale for a cognitive behavioral intervention. Phase two is the main part of treatment and contains behavioral interventions, mainly exposure and habituation to feared situations and/or stimuli.</description>
