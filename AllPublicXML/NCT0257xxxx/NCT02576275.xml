    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of duvelisib in combination with
      bendamustine and rituximab (DBR) vs placebo in combination with bendamustine and rituximab
      (PBR) in subjects with previously-treated indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).

    <textblock>
      Study IPI-145-22 is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, two-arm Phase 3 study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of DBR vs
      PBR in subjects with previously-treated iNHL (including follicular lymphoma [FL], small
      lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL] and marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]).

      Approximately 600 subjects will receive 25 mg of duvelisib or placebo, orally BID for 28 day
      continuous cycles, in combination with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab given on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6
      and 90 mg/m2 of bendamustine given on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycles 1-6. Subjects will receive
      duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    The scope of the program has been reduced to focus resources on studies which can potentially
    enable the registration of duvelisib.
