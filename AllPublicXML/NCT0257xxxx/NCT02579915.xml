  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop a personalized, user-friendly computerized treatment
      for anxiety disorders linked to primary care. The computerized treatment is a type of
      Cognitive Bias Modification, which targets attention and interpretation biases known to
      maintain anxiety disorders.

    <textblock>
      The primary goals of our 3-year, 2-phase project are to develop AIM for primary care linkage
      and assess its feasibility and acceptability. This protocol description only pertains to
      Phase 2 (Randomized Controlled Trial).

      42 primary care patients with primary Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder,
      and/or Panic Disorder (with or without Agoraphobia) will be randomly assigned to the AIM
      treatment or to a symptom tracking control group. Full assessments will occur pre- and
      post-treatment and 3-months follow-up. A mid-treatment assessment will include measures of
      cognitive biases and the primary outcome. Weekly measures of anxiety and depression will be
      collected, as will feedback from patients and PCPs about the research and delivery
      procedures.

    <description>Treatment will consist of 8, 30-minute, twice-weekly sessions designed to: a) decrease attention bias to threat and b) extinguish threat interpretations/reinforce benign interpretations of ambiguity. Attention bias will be modified via a dot probe task that increases attentional control by directing attention away from threat faces via probe location. Patients will complete 256 trials per session. Interpretation bias will be modified via a word-sentence association task which provides positive feedback when participants endorse benign interpretations of ambiguous sentences and negative feedback for threat interpretations. Participants will complete 150 training trials per session. A FaceAnxiety Specialist facilitates program completion.</description>
