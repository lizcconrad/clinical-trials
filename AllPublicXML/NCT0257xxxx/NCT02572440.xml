      Perioperative blood loss continues to be a serious problem in complex aortic arch surgery
      using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). Major blood loss causes increased morbidity
      and mortality [1]. These patients often require transfusion of allogeneic blood products. It
      has been estimated shortages of blood supply in China will worsen [2]. Clinicians have made
      significant progress to decrease the quality of allogenic blood transfusion.

      Increasing postoperative hemorrhage risk of aortic arch patients undergoing DHCA may be
      related to CPB induced hemostatic defect, the use of the CPB is likely to contribute to
      coagulation factor lost and platelet dysfunction [3, 4]. We are aware of the potential
      benefit of aPRP, withdrawal of aPRP immediately before initiating CPB appears to be a
      promising approach because it avoids CPB-related platelet damage and limits post-CPB blood
      loss. So we adopted and used aPRP as a blood conservation technique to reduce blood
      transfusion in aortic arch surgery with DHCA. Autologous red blood cells were infused to
      maintain a HGB level above 100 g/L after heparin neutralizing activity. And aPRPs were
      transfused after heparin neutralizing activity as no active bleeding was observed. Our goal
      was to determine the effect between aPRP and homologous transfusion on perioperative bleeding
      during complex aortic arch surgery using DHCA.

      1. Patient selection 42 type A aortic dissections patients were asked to participate in a
           prospective, randomized trial comparing aPRP technique with regular blood conservation.
           6 patients were excluded The patients were randomized into two groups: regular blood
           conservation group(n=18) and aPRP group(n=18). Patients gave informed consent, and
           ethical permission was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen
           Hospital. The grouping situation is blinded to the surgeon, perfusionist and
           statistician.

        2. Anesthesia and monitoring method All patients were monitored according to the American
           Society of Anesthesia guidelines and received standard general anesthesia. A
           post-operative analgesic pump was used until four days after surgery. The same group of
           surgeons performed all operations. Extracorporeal circulation used DHCA and axillary
           arterial anterograde cerebral perfusion. In addition, the same group of physicians
           managed extracorporeal circulation.

        3. Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma Harvest Technique In the treatment group, shortly after
           administration of general anesthesia, blood was collected via central venous catheter 60
           ml per minute (that was proven to be safe) and approximately 15-20 mL/kg of whole blood
           was collected. The harvested blood was then centrifuged at 2400 rpm to separate the red
           blood cells (RBC) from the autologous platelet rich plasma (aPRP). The separated blood
           component was processed by acid sodium citrate glucose solution (AcD-A) for
           anti-coagulation. No systemic heparin was administered at this time. The aPRP component
           was then stored at 20℃ - 24℃. When the blood withdrawal was proceeding, lactated
           ringer's solution and succinylated gelatin were used via the peripheral vein to dilate
           circulating capacity and maintain hemodynamic stability. A vasoactive drug was used if
           necessary. The systematic heparinization began after blood collection had completed.
           General blood salvage was performed during surgery and transfused according to the
           patient's actual intraoperative needs.

           The mean quantity of whole blood collected for Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma Harvest
           was 1037 ± 286 mL. The control group was only subjected to general intraoperative blood
           conservation using red blood cell salvage and allogenic blood transfusion.

        4. Transfusion Practice Autologous red blood cells were infused to maintain the HGB level
           above 100 g/L. While on CPB, the hemoglobin (HGB) level was maintained between 70 g/L to
           90 g/L. Salvaged blood was also used following CPB. FFP, platelets, and aPRP were
           transfused after protamine reversed heparinization, since no active bleeding was
           observed. Therapeutic transfusion triggers were: INR TEG-R&gt;11 min for FFP
           administration; TEG-a &lt;63 degrees for human fibrinogen; and TEG-MA &lt;52 mm for aphaeresis
           platelets
