    <textblock>
      IMCgp100-102 is a Phase I study of the weekly intra-patient escalation dose regimen with
      IMCgp100 as a single agent in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM). According to
      this regimen, all patients in the trial will receive 2 weekly doses of IMCgp100 at a dose
      level below the identified weekly recommended Phase II dose (RP2D-QW) and then a dose
      escalation will commence at the third weekly dose at C1D15. The Phase I testing of the
      intra-patient escalation dosing regimen is designed to achieve a higher exposure and maximal
      plasma concentration of IMCgp100 after doses at Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) and thereafter .

      This is a Phase I clinical study of IMCgp100 in patients with advanced melanoma. In the Phase
      I FIH study of IMCgp100 in advanced melanoma, a dose escalation was conducted with IMCgp100
      administered on a weekly basis (Middleton, 2015). In this study, the MTD when IMCgp100 is
      administered on a weekly basis was declared at 600 ng/kg. With a data cut off of 18 August
      2015, it was observed that DLT of grade 3 (n=3) and grade 4 (n=1) hypotension in the weekly
      dosing cohort was observed with the first dose in this trial. Based on observed safety and
      the PK profile, a flat dosing regimen was implemented across the program and the RP2D of the
      RP2D-QW was identified as 50 mcg QW.

      In this same FIH study, several patients with metastatic uveal melanoma were treated in the
      weekly dosing regimen at the MTD dose level (600 ng/kg) and as well at the dose level above
      MTD, 900 ng/kg (n=5, data cut off 18 August 2015). Based on review of the observed objective
      responses in the Phase I trial in UM as well as objective responses noted in cutaneous
      melanoma, it was noted that patients with larger diameters of disease burden (both cutaneous
      and UM) experienced objective tumor responses at the higher overall exposures to IMCgp100.
      The intra-patient dose escalation study design is based on 2 observations in the clinic: (1)
      objective partial and minor tumor responses in patients with higher tumor burdens were
      generally observed at the higher absolute doses in the Phase I trial and (2) the occurrences
      of more severe toxicity leading to dose limitation were limited to the first 2 weeks of
      dosing on C1D1 and C1D8. Based on these 2 observations, it is hypothesized that an increased
      exposure to drug in the weeks following the occurrence of the more severe toxicity (at the
      first 2 doses) may lead to an enhanced tumor response in a setting of an unfavorable tumor
      microenvironment such as UM.

      This is a Phase I study of IMCgp100 administered on a weekly basis with an intra-patient
      escalation dosing regimen. The intra-patient escalation occurs at the third weekly dose on
      Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15). According to this regimen, all patients in the trial will receive 2
      weekly doses of IMCgp100 at a dose level below the identified weekly recommended Phase II
      dose (RP2D-QW) and then a dose escalation will commence at the third weekly dose at C1D15
      with the goal to achieve a long-term dosing regimen at a dose higher than that identified for
      the straight weekly dosing regimen (RP2D-QW). The dose escalation will identify the RP2D-IE.

      The Phase I portion of the study will be a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. After the
      dose escalation portion is complete and the recommended Phase II dose of the intra-patient
      escalation dose regimen (RP2D-IE) is identified, 2 expansion cohorts in metastatic uveal
      melanoma will be completed. The cohorts will enroll patients with metastatic uveal melanoma
      and are defined based on prior therapy The expansion portion will enroll approximately 150
      patients.

             growth factors. An erythroid stimulating agent is allowed as long as it was initiated
             at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and the patient is not red
             blood cell transfusion dependent

         17. Pregnant, likely to become pregnant, or lactating women (where pregnancy is defined as
             the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation)

         18. Patients with adrenal insufficiency or patients currently requiring chronic, systemic
             corticosteroid therapy at any dose for longer than 2 weeks. Local steroid therapies
             (eg, otic, ophthalmic, intraarticular, or inhaled medications) are acceptable

         19. Patients may not have been included in any prior IMCgp100 trial, regardless of
