      Prospective, multi-center, randomized 1:1 single blind trial using NOVA sirolimus eluting
      stent versus Apollo bare metal stent conducted in approximately 15 interventional neurology
      centers in China. The study was sponsored by Sino Medical Sciences Technology Inc.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 264 subjects overall in two groups (randomized 1:1). The study
      follow-up will occur at 1, 6 and 12 months post-stent implantation. All patients will undergo
      angiography assessment (DSA/CTA) at 12 months follow-up. Angiography assessment will be
      performed at baseline (pre- and post-procedure) and 12 months follow-up.
