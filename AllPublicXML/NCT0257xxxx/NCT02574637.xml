      A Phase 2b study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MEDI2070 in Subjects with Moderate to
      Severe Crohn's Disease Who Have Failed or Are Intolerant to Anti Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha
      Therapy

    <textblock>
      This is a four-part Phase 2b study comprised of a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      Induction Period, a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, Maintenance Period, a 24-week,
      Open-label Period and a post-treatment 28 week observational safety follow-up period designed
      to evaluate the short-term efficacy and the short- and long term safety of MEDI2070 in
      subjects with moderate to severe, active CD who have failed or are intolerant to anti-TNFα
      therapy as determined by the Investigator.
