      This NANT trial will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of autologous expanded
      natural killer (NK) cells when combined with standard dosing of ch14.18 and will assess the
      feasibility of adding lenalidomide at the recommended Phase II dose of the expanded NK cells
      with ch14.18, for treatment of children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma.

      Ch14.18 is a chimeric antibody against GD2, which is expressed on a majority of neuroblastoma
      cells. It has been shown to increase EFS and OS in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma when
      given after autologous stem cell transplant in combination with subcutaneous GM-CSF and
      intravenous IL-2, followed by isotretinoin. Lenalidomide has been studied in children with
      solid tumors and can safely be given to patients based on 2 prior trials in children. It was
      also shown to have immunomodulatory effects and is synergistic with ch14.18. Lenalidomide is
      also an oral agent that can be given in the outpatient setting. Natural killer cells are
      lymphocytes of the innate immune system that have the ability to recognize and kill malignant
      cells, including neuroblastoma. Ch14.18 and lenalidomide both exert part of their anti-cancer
      effect through the activation of natural killer cells. Patients are being given in
      combination in NANT 2011-04 where the safety and immunomodulatory effect has been established
      in that study at the dose level proposed in this study. Natural killer cells are
      dysfunctional and low in number in many cancer patients, and number and function are further
      suppressed by chemotherapy and radiation. Investigators hypothesize that autologous NK cells
      can be expanded and activated ex vivo and readministered to restore number and function, and
      in combination with lenalidomide and ch14.18 will provide an anti-tumor effect in patients
      with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.

      Investigators will determine the feasibility of centralized expansion, cryopreservation, and
      distribution of autologous NK cells. Investigators will then determine the maximum tolerated
      dose by assessing the toxicities of autologous expanded NK cells given with ch14.18; by
      assessing the toxicities, cytokinetics and immunomodulatory effects, Investigators will
      select the recommended Phase II dose of the two-agent combination after dose escalation of
      the NK cells and then adding lenalidomide to the combination to establish the three-agent
      combination.

      Cytokinetics (persistence of infused NK cells) and immune function studies will be required
      for all patients entered on this study. In addition to routine assessment of response,
      quantification of rare tumor cell detection in blood and bone marrow using TLDA will also
      provide another measure of possible anti-tumor efficacy to support the rationale for the
      final schedule chosen.

    <description>The number of viable NK cells finally available for infusion back into the patient: After NK expansion and verification that the resulting NK cells meet purity, gram stain, and endotoxin release criteria, NK cells will be divided into aliquots, each with sufficient cells for one infusion at the dose level the patient was assigned. So the primary measured endpoint is the number of viable NK cells. The derived endpoints, based on the number of viable NK cells in the final product are: (1) whether there are sufficient cells to give at least 1 dose at the lowest dose level (at least 80% of 107 NK cells per kg), (2) whether there are sufficient cells to give at least one dose at the assigned dose level (at least 80% of the planned dose for one dose), (3) the number of doses possible at the assigned dose level, and (4) the number of doses possible at the RP2D, as well as (5) the number aliquots (treatments) available for each patient at the assigned dose.</description>

    <description>The toxicities and adverse events experienced during and following treatment on this protocol: These will be graded and classified according to the CTCAE v4.03..

The criteria for whether or not a patient experiences a DLT are based on the toxicities and adverse events that occur during the 1st course.</description>
