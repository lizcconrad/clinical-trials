  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ASP2215 in
      subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy subjects with normal
      hepatic function.

      This study will also assess the safety and tolerability of single-dose ASP2215 in subjects
      with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and matched control subjects.

      Subjects will be admitted to the site one day before each study drug administration (i.e. Day
      -1) and confined at the site till the collection of post-dose PK samples (Day 21). For
      subjects with hepatic impairment, subject will discharge on Day 21, and will visit the
      clinical unit on Day 24 (±1 day) and Day 28 (±1 day) for collection of post-dose PK samples.
      End of study Visit For Healthy subjects will take place 1 to 5 days following collection of
      last PK sample.
