  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell
      lymphoma (rrPMBCL) or relapsed or refractory Richter Syndrome (rrRS) will receive
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475). The efficacy of pembrolizumab in the treatment of rrPMBCL and rrRS
      will be evaluated. The primary study hypothesis is that intravenous (IV) administration of
      single agent pembrolizumab will result in an Objective Response Rate (ORR) of greater than
      15% using the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria (Cheson, 2007) by
      independent central review.

      Effective with Protocol Amendment 04, enrollment into the rrRS cohort was closed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue for a maximum of 35 administrations (approximately
      2 years) or until documented disease progression by investigator assessment, unacceptable
      adverse event(s) (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of
      treatment, participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with
      study treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PMBCL:

          -  Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma AND

          -  Has relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) or has failed to achieve
             a Complete Response or Partial Response within 60 days of auto-SCT. Participants may
             have received intervening therapy after auto-SCT for relapsed or refractory disease,
             in which case they must have relapsed after or be refractory to their last treatment.

        OR

             prior therapy and has failed to respond to or relapsed after their last line of
             treatment. For participants who received consolidative local radiotherapy after
             systemic therapy, local radiotherapy will not be considered as a separate line of
             treatment.
