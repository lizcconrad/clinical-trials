          2. Confirmed diagnosis of Type I or Type II Diabetes

          3. An Index Ulcer defined as chronic (presence of wound for &gt; 4 weeks), but not present
             for more than 52 weeks at the Screening Visit

          4. Index Ulcer is located below the malleoli on the plantar or dorsal surface of the foot

          5. The Index Ulcer is between 1 cm2 and 15 cm2, inclusive, at the Screening Visit

          6. The Index Ulcer extends into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue without evidence of
             exposed muscle, tendon, bone, or joint capsule

          7. Wound is free of necrotic debris

          8. Patient has adequate circulation to the foot as documented by either:

               -  Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) &gt; 0.70 and &lt; 1.30, or

               -  In patients with non-compressible ankle vessels defined as an ABI ≥ 1.30, a Toe
                  Brachial Index (TBI) ≥ 0.50, or

               -  In patients with non-compressible ankle vessels defined as an ABI ≥ 1.30 and TBI
                  cannot be performed (e.g., toe is absent, wounds are present, or site cannot
                  perform a TBI), a Doppler waveform in the posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis
                  arteries at the ankle consistent with adequate flow in the foot (biphasic or
                  triphasic) and other diagnostic confirmation of adequate flow (e.g., duplex
                  imaging, normal pulse volume recording [PVR] testing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Index Ulcer is of non-diabetic pathophysiology

          2. Gangrene is present on any part of the affected foot

          3. Index Ulcer is over an active Charcot deformity

         21. Patient has had within the last 30 days, or is currently undergoing, or is planning
             for wound treatments with growth factors, living skin, dermal substitutes or other
             advanced biological therapies

         22. Patient is an employee, or an immediate family member of an employee, of the sponsor
             company or site research staff conducting the study
