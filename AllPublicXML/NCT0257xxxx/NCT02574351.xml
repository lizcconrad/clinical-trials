      To study whether the immune response as directed by regulatory T cells is different between
      obese asthmatics, normal weight asthmatics and healthy controls.

      The investigators hypothesize that the increase in asthma severity in obese patients is, at
      least in part, related to a defective number or function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). That
      is in the obese asthmatic subject a defective Treg profile would augment the inflammation of
      asthma (a synergistic effect). Alternatively, that Treg dysfunction in obesity might affect
      asthma independently (an additive effect). To test these hypotheses, the investigators plan
      to conduct an observational controlled study to compare Treg profile in obese and
      normal-weight individuals with and without asthma.

      This is an exploratory study to investigate the following:

        1. To determine whether Treg number and function differs between obese and normal-weight
           individuals with and without asthma.

        2. To determine whether serum leptin levels differ between obese and normal-weight
           individuals with and without asthma.

          2. Normal weight asthmatics

          3. Healthy obese

          4. Health non-obese

        Asthmatic subjects will be recruited:

          1. If they have a physician diagnosis of adult onset asthma (asthma diagnosed after the
             age of 18).

          2. If they have stable disease without exacerbation, physician or emergency department
             visits, or change in asthma medication for the past 4 weeks, inhaled steroids will be
             allowed.

        Non asthmatic subjects

          1. Will not have had a prior diagnosis of asthma,

          2. Have no history of atopy.

          3. Have no history of lung diseases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt; 10 pack year smoking history, or currently smoking

          2. Pulmonary disease other than asthma.

          3. History of heart disease

          4. Weight loss greater than 10 kg, or greater than 10% initial body weight within the
             past 3 months.

          5. Any agents that could potentially alter the inï¬‚ammatory system such as
             thiazolidinedione, a statin, or oral steroid therapy.
