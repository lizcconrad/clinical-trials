  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to provide long term clinical and virologic follow up in subjects
      infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who received interferon-based therapy or direct-acting
      antiviral agents (DAAs)-based therapy. This long term follow up study is observational and no
      treatment is provided for HCV infection.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained virological response (SVR)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the occurence (yes or no) of sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; ie, 15 IU/mL) in serum at least 3 months after stopping therapy. Point estimates and confidence intervals will be calculated to describe the frequency of SVR in various patients receiving IFN or DAAs based treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment persistence</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment persistence will be the duration of treatment measured from the first dose of medication until treatment is discontinued. Reasons for premature discontinuation of treatment will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Virological breakthrough</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of virological breakthrough defined as an increase of HCV RNA by at least 1-log over nadir or to &gt;100 IU if previously undetectable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver disease progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Post treatment 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Liver disease progression is a composite endpoint measured by laboratory parameters (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, albumin, platelets, prothrombin time (PT) and Î±-fetoprotein) and observed or reported clinical signs and symptoms.</description>
