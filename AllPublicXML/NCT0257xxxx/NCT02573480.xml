      This study is an optimization study to evaluate how a wraparound program for youth who have
      been injured by violence helps to change violence related attitudes and beliefs, change
      individual risk factors for violence and reduce the risk of future injury due to violence.
      Wraparound care involves linking the youth with a support worker who will work with the youth
      to develop positive support networks and help them link with services that address risk
      factors towards future violence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, violence is the most common reason for youth (aged 12- 24) to visit an emergency
      department (ED) and the leading cause of hospitalization among males aged 20 to 24. Injury is
      a chronic, recurring disease. In Winnipeg, Canada, 20% of youth injured by violence visited
      the same ED in the next year with a repeat injury due to violence. Currently the standard of
      care for this vulnerable population is to discharge them from our EDs with no effort to
      prevent the next injury.

      There are 5 components key to implementing wraparound care for youth who are at risk of
      violence. The 1st component is the establishment of a relationship between support worker and
      youth at the time of injury - i.e. during a teachable moment. The 2nd component is that the
      support worker has extensive &quot;lived experience&quot;. Many youth affected by violence have been
      marginalized by society and have significant trust issues with figures of traditional power
      (i.e. doctors, social workers etc.). It is imperative that the support worker establish trust
      quickly and act as a role model. The 3rd component is that the care program is individualized
      for and by each youth. The support worker helps the youth to define their own goals and the
      steps required to achieve them. The 4th component is to provide trauma-informed care.
      Trauma-informed care is an approach used by caregivers that acknowledges the current and past
      traumas a person may have experienced and helps the person heal and build a sense of control
      over their lives. The final component is the opportunity to access community supports within
      their own culture.

    <description>Many risk and protective factors such as education, employment, family, child protective services, access to health care, addictions, mental health, housing and interaction with the justice system have all been shown to be risk and in some cases protective (active education or employment) factors for violent injury among youth.</description>

    <description>Based on a 3-part measurement developed by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) as well as the more standard intensity measurements of total time used by San Francisco WrapAround care program and Healing Hurt People Program in Philadelphia. This measurement include: CHOP-method: 1) # of weeks receiving care, 2) # of needs addressed and 3) # of staff-client encounters; Standard Method: Total in-person contact time.</description>

    <description>Using ADT (Admissions, Diagnosis, Triage) and E-Triage and chart review, any visit to any ED in Winnipeg for intentional injury 1-year pre-index visit and 1-year post-index visit will be identified. Deaths due to violence will be identified using Vital Stats. Following the identification of a visit to the ED in the year pre and post the index injury (i.e. the injury at which time the youth participant was enrolled), a chart review at that hospital of that year will be completed.</description>

    <description>Wraparound care starts by linking an individual with a support worker who works with them to address risk factors and empower the individual to make positive choices. It not only includes connecting the youth with existing community resources such as education, employment, cultural services and substance counselling, it also helps build problem-solving skills, coping skills, and self-efficacy of the youth and family members. The support worker provides mentorship to the youth. Mentorship both teaches and emulates appropriate behaviours with respect to attitudes and behaviours associated with violence.</description>
