      ATYR1940-C-004 is a Phase1b/2 open-label intrapatient study dose escalation study aiming to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, biological activity of intravenous
      ATYR1940, administered once weekly for 8 weeks, then twice a weekly for 4 weeks in adult
      patients with LGMD2B and FSHD. Approximately 8 LGMD2B and 8 FHSD patients will be enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provided informed consent

          -  Investigator's opinion, patient is willing and able to complete all study procedures
             and comply with the study visit schedule.

        Patients with LGMD2B:

          -  Established, genetically confirmed diagnosis of LGMD2B.

          -  Either the presence of a STIR-positive muscle on lower extremity skeletal muscle MRI,
             or, if no STIR-positive muscles, meets muscle biomarker criteria.

        Patients with FSHD:

          -  Established, genetically confirmed diagnosis of FSHD.

          -  The presence of a STIR-positive muscle on lower extremity skeletal muscle MRI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently receiving treatment with an immunomodulatory agent, including targeted
             biological therapies within the 3 months before baseline; corticosteroids within 3
             months before baseline; or high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents within 2
             weeks before baseline.

          -  Currently receiving curcumin or albuterol; use of a product that putatively enhances
             muscle growth on a chronic basis within 4 weeks before baseline; statin treatment
             initiation or significant adjustment to statin regimen within 3 months before baseline
             (stable, chronic statin use is permissible).

          -  Use of an investigational product or device within 30 days before baseline.

          -  Evidence of an alternative diagnosis other than LGMD2B or FSHD or a coexisting
             myopathy or dystrophy, based on prior muscle biopsy or other available investigations.

          -  History of severe restrictive or obstructive lung disease or evidence for interstitial
             lung disease on screening chest radiograph.

          -  History of anti-synthetase syndrome, prior Jo-1 Ab-positivity, or a positive or
             equivocally positive Jo-1 Ab test result during screening.

          -  Chronic infection, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
             or a history of tuberculosis.

          -  Vaccination within 8 weeks before baseline or vaccination is planned during study
             participation.

          -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or severe cardiac arrhythmia that may in the Investigator's
             opinion, limit the patient's ability to complete the study protocol.

          -  Muscle biopsy within 30 days before baseline.
