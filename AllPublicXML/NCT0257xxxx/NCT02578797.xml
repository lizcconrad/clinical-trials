  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether daily treatment with apalutamide affects
      the ventricular repolarization in participants with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
      (CRPC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (a study in which the drug, procedure is known to participant and
      investigator), multicenter, Phase 1b study to investigate the effect of apalutamide on
      ventricular repolarization at a dose level of 240 milligram (mg daily). Approximately 42
      participants with high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer (NM-CRPC), defined as having a
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time less than or equal to (&lt;=) 10 months, or
      participants with metastatic CRPC will be enrolled. The study consists of a 28-day Screening
      Phase, a Treatment Phase and a Follow-up Phase. In the Treatment Phase the study drug will be
      administrated in cycles of 28 days and the participants will be monitored for safety
      (including cardiac safety) and pharmacokinetics of the study drug. Adverse Events will be
      monitored throughout the study and in the Follow-up Phase until 30 days after the last dose
      of study drug. All participants will continue on study until disease progression, withdrawal
      of consent, lost to follow-up, the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, the participant is no
      longer receiving clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator, or termination of the
      study by the sponsor. Upon discontinuation of study drug, the participants will return for an
      End-of-Treatment (EoT) visit no later than 30 days after their last dose. The end of the
      study is defined as 30 days after the last participants' last dose of study drug.
