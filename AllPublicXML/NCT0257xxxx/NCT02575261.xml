      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a recombinant receptor with both antigen-binding and T
      cell activating functions. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell Immunotherapy has more advantages
      compared with conventional immunotherapy, especially in dealing with patients of hematologic
      malignancies and solid malignant tumors.This study design a novel specific Chimeric antigen
      receptor aiming at EphA2 antigen.After CAR-T cell infusion,At periodic intervals, the
      investigators will evaluate clinical symptoms Improved conditions of this disease.Through
      this study,the investigators will evaluate the safty and effectiveness of CAR-T cell
      immunotherapy in treating with EphA2 positive malignant glioma patients.
