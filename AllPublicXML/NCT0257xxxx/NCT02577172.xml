  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study examine the effects of an aerobic and strength training program on
      cardiorespiratory fitness in testicular cancer (TC) patients during chemotherapy. Half of the
      participants will receive the exercise program and the other half will receive one individual
      lifestyle counseling session. The investigators hypothesize that TC patients in the exercise
      group will have less reduction in cardiorespiratory fitness during chemotherapy treatment
      compared to patients in the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Testicular cancer (TC) patients receiving chemotherapy often experience troublesome
      side-effects during and after treatment. Both aerobic and strength exercise have showed
      beneficial effects on side-effects during and after treatment in other cancer diagnosis.
      Knowledge of the effects of physical exercise during and after chemotherapy in TC patients is
      insufficient and studies are needed. The primary aim is to examine the effects of physical
      exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness in TC patients during chemotherapy. Secondary aims are
      to examine the effects of physical exercise on other secondary health outcomes during and
      three and twelve months after chemotherapy.

      The present study is a randomized controlled trial comparing a tailored exercise program
      consisting of aerobic and strength training during chemotherapy to a control group receiving
      one individual lifestyle counseling session during the first chemotherapy cycle. The TC
      patients will be included and assessed before the first cycle of chemotherapy and further
      assigned to either a exercise group or a control group. The intervention will last for 9 or
      12 weeks (depending on the number of bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP)/etoposide,
      cisplatin (EP) cycles received) and it will consists of two-three one-hour sessions per week
      mostly supervised by a personal trainer. All variables will be assessed pre- and
      post-intervention, and at three and 12 months follow-up.

    <description>The intervention will be conducted during chemotherapy and tailored for each patient. The program will include 1) weight bearing aerobic exercises to maintain the oxygen transport and thereby reduce the decline in VO2max during chemotherapy and 2) strength training exercises to maintain muscle mass and muscle strength. The intervention will last for 9 or 12 weeks, depending on the number of BEP/EP cycles received. The program will consist of two-three one-hour exercise sessions per week, of which most supervised by a personal trainer. The intensity of each exercise sessions will varies from easy (warm-up: 60-70 % of peak heart rate) to moderate/high (between aerobic intervals 60-70% of peak heart rate and during aerobic intervals 85-95 %).</description>
