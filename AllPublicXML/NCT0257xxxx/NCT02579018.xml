  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two major goals of this investigation. First, to develop pilot data to justify a
      larger randomized clinical trial of an intervention designed to train interoceptive signals
      (IS) and interoceptive responsivity (IR) in persons with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Second, the
      investigators will determine whether persons with AN have similar or different IS and IR for
      heart rate while exercising as compared to age and gender matched controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot investigation is to assess AN interoceptive sensitivity and
      responsivity as it pertains to heart rate during exercise. Thirty adults, 18 years and older
      will be recruited for a cross-sectional comparison of IS and IR in the context of exercise.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Study participants will include adults with anorexia spectrum disorders
        and healthy age and gender matched controls. There will be two control groups, one that
        includes regularly exercising age and gender matched persons and one where controls do not
        engage in regular exercise.

        For those with AN, the following INCLUSION criteria must be met:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  BMI 25 kg/m2 or less

          -  Diagnosis of anorexia spectrum disorder

          -  Medications: Stable use of all medications ≥ three months

        For age and gender matched controls, the following INCLUSION criteria must be met:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  BMI 25 kg/m2 or less

          -  No diagnosis of anorexia spectrum disorder

          -  Medications: Stable use of all medications ≥ three months

          -  Age (+/- 2 years) and gender matched to study participant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of diabetes, heart disease or taking medications for those conditions

          -  History of hypertension (high blood pressure) not controlled with medication

          -  Orthopedic limitations, musculoskeletal disease and/or injury

          -  Inability to consent

          -  Lack of transportation to the Duke Center for Living campus
