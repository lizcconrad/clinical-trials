  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of dengue fever and to build capacity
      for dengue vaccine trials in dengue-endemic regions of South Asia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the burden of dengue illness in selected sites South Asia and to
      prepare sites for the conduct of future vaccine efficacy trials.

      Operational goals include:

        -  Build long-term collaboration with sites in dengue-endemic regions of South Asia where
           the incidence of clinical dengue illness can be studied.

        -  Establish dengue surveillance cohorts that can be followed long-term.

        -  Establish operational feasibility of future Phase III studies with regard to
           recruitment, case capture and sampling procedures.

        -  Prepare sites for participation in Phase III clinical endpoint studies.

    <description>Blood samples will be collected during the Suspected Dengue First Visit. All study subjects with AFI (fever [body temperature ≥ 38°C/≥ 100.4°F] on ≥ 2 consecutive calendar days, measured at least twice, at least 8 hours apart) should be seen at a designated study hospital/clinic by the study physician. The Suspected Dengue First Visit should be scheduled within 7 days from the onset of fever (Days 2-7) and should ideally take place on the second day of fever (Day 2).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject and/or subject's parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) who,
             in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the
             protocol. (e.g., willingness to go to the hospital/clinic for visit[s] in case of AFI,
             able to observe the signs of dengue and to understand how to take and report body
             temperature, etc.).

          -  Signed/thumb-printed (and video recorded if required by law) informed consent (and
             assent if applicable) must be obtained from the subject/subject's parent(s)/LAR(s) at
             the hospital/clinic or during a home visit. If the subject/subject's parent(s)/LAR(s)
             are illiterate, the informed consent form (ICF) (or informed assent form [IAF] when
             applicable) will be countersigned by an impartial witness.

          -  Subject is part of a household with at least one child (aged less than 18 years) and
             in which informed consent (and assent if applicable) to study participation was
             obtained from at least one adult and one child.

          -  Male or female aged between and including 6 months and 50 years at the time of
             enrolment.

             during the two-year study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care.

          -  Participation (current or planned) in another epidemiological study or in a clinical
             trial that would conflict with the current study, based on investigator's judgement.

          -  Terminal illness based on investigator's judgement.

          -  Mental incapacity based on investigator's judgement.
