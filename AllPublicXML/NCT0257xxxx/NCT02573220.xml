      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of irinotecan hydrochloride,
      based on a genetic test, when given in combination with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and
      cetuximab as first-line therapy in treating patients with an abnormal gene called RAS
      wild-type that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Patients may also have a
      gene called uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) that may interfere with the
      way irinotecan hydrochloride is absorbed by the body and may not be able to tolerate it.
      Determining the presence of this gene may help determine the best dose of irinotecan
      hydrochloride when given with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium (FOLFIRI). Combination
      chemotherapy, such as FOLFIRI, works in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Cetuximab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving FOLFIRI together with cetuximab may be a better treatment for
      patients with colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the phase
      II recommended dosage of irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) administered in the FOLFIRI
      regimen plus cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with *1/*1 and *1/*28
      uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) genotype treated as first line
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To estimate the response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and metastasectomy (with
      curative intent) rate in the overall patient population (both genotype cohorts).

      OTHER OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the variability of irinotecan pharmacokinetics, in combination with cetuximab,
      in patients with *1/*1 and *1/*28 genotype and the effect of the pharmacokinetic profile on
      toxicity and response rate.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of irinotecan and its major metabolites in the
      absence and the presence of cetuximab administration, in order to define the effect of the
      chimeric monoclonal antibody on irinotecan pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan hydrochloride in patients with UGT1A1.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours, fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 46 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive
      cetuximab IV over 2 hours on days 3 and 15 of course 1 and days 1 and 15 of all subsequent
      courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD recommended for phase II studies will be defined as the dose level immediately below the one at which 1 out of 3 patients or 1 out of 6 patients experienced DLT. Therefore at the MTD, 1/3 out of at least 10 patients experienced DLT. No intra-patient dose escalation is allowed. There will be two genotype cohorts of patients: one for each genotype. The cumulative hematological and non-hematological toxicities as well as the number of dose reductions and a delay in starting the next cycle of treatment will be used as secondary indicators to differentiate the two genotype cohorts of patients. Patients can continue receiving the same dose of irinotecan in the absence of major toxicity if before retreatment they fully recover from any non-hematological toxicity, absolute neutrophil count is 1500 microliters and platelet count is 100,000 microliters. Chemotherapy is discontinued on evidence of disease progression by RECIST version 1.1.</description>
