  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether certain metabonomics and/or lipidomics
      features in correlation with pharmacokinetics before, during and after treatment with
      sunitinib or pazopanib in first line can predict toxicity and efficacy of sunitinib or
      pazopanib in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Woman or man ≥ 18 Years old, histologically proven metastatic clear cell (or al least
             clear cell predominant) RCC,

          -  Good or intermediate risk according to MSKCC-criteria, Subjects falling into
             conditions for reimbursement of sunitinib or pazopanib in the context of mRCC,

          -  Measurable disease based on RECIST criteria (version 1.1) , Subject has given
             voluntary written informed consent,

          -  Subject with a life expectancy ≥ 3 months,

          -  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab is allowed however it should
             have been started before screening of the study. If possible starting new medications
             between the baseline metabolo- and lipidomotype- and the first metabolo- and
             lipidomotypeanalysis should be avoided,

          -  Subjects having recovered from side effects from previous therapies to a grade 1 CTC
             vs 4.0 criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with non-clear cell RCC and/or with sarcomatoid differentiation,

          -  Patients presenting any other type of cancer disease within 5 years from inclusion
             into this study; in the absence of cervical cancer or basocellular carcinoma, Patients
             with uncontrolled arterial hypertension,

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypo- or hyperthyroidism,

          -  Patient had major surgery within 4 weeks before enrolment,

          -  Patient with myocardial infarction within 6 months prior enrolment or with NHYA class
             III otr IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular
             arrhythmia or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction
             system abnormalities,

          -  Patient has another serious medical condition that could potentially interfere with
             the completion of study,

          -  Sero-positive for HIV, Subject known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive or who
             has an active hepatitis C infection,

          -  Subject has an active systemic infection requiring treatment,

          -  Female subject is pregnant or breast feeding, Subject enrolled in another clinical
             trial and/or receiving an investigational agent.
