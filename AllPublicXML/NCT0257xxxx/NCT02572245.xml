        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy female subjects and/or male subjects, who, at the time of screening, are
             between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically
             relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, complete physical
             examination including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests.

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 32 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110
             pounds).

          3. Chest X ray with no evidence of current, active TB or previous (inactive) TB, fungal
             or general infections, heart failure, malignancy, or other clinically significant
             abnormalities taken at Screening or within 24 weeks prior to Day 1 and read by a
             qualified radiologist.

          4. Female subjects of non childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following
             criteria: a. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular
             menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or
             physiological cause; status may be confirmed by having a serum follicle stimulating
             hormone (FSH) level confirming the post menopausal state; b. Have undergone a
             documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; c. Have medically confirmed
             ovarian failure.

        All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be
        of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant infectious, hematological, renal,
             endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric,
             neurologic, autoimmune, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding
             untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          2. Evidence or history of nervous system demyelinating diseases (including multiple
             sclerosis, optic neuritis, Guillain Barr√© syndrome).

          3. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts.

          4. Previous history of cancer, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin
