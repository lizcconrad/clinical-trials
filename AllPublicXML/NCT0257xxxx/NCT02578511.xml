      In this phase I study, escalating doses of IXAZOMIB will be combined with the POMP/D regimen.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      The primary objective is to determine the maximum-tolerated dose of IXAZOMIB (MLN9708)
      (maximum of 4 mg, which is the recommended phase II dose for IXAZOMIB (MLN9708) in
      combination with standard maintenance therapy with POMP/D (methotrexate, 6- mercaptopurine,
      vincristine, prednisone/dexamethasone) and to assess the tolerability of POMP/D and IXAZOMIB
      (MLN9708) maintenance in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic
      lymphoma (LBL) or mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) in complete remission (CR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

      To determine the three-year progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with oral
      IXAZOMIB (MLN9708) and standard maintenance regimen. Progression-free survival will be
      measured from the start of induction to disease relapse.

      STUDY DESIGN

      The maximum-tolerated dose of single agent IXAZOMIB was 1.76 to 2.0mg/m2 when given on a
      twice a week schedule1 and &gt; 2.34 mg/m2 to 2.97 mg/m2 on a weekly schedule in previous
      studies.

      Three patients will be treated per dose level unless dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is
      observed. The starting dose of IXAZOMIB will be 3 mg orally on days 1, 8 and 15. If no DLT is
      seen in the first three patients, the dose will be increased to 4 mg on days 1, 8 and 15 in a
      classic 3 +3 phase I design. We will not attempt to increase the dose beyond 4 mg orally
      which, if achieved with acceptable toxicity, would be accepted as the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D). Zero of three DLTs would allow escalation to the next dose level. One of three
      DLTs will require expanding to six patients; one of six DLTs will allow escalation again. Two
      DLTs will require dose de-escalation. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) will be the highest
      dose administered at which no more than one DLT was observed.

    <description>The patient cohort enrolled at each dose level will be monitored for dose-limiting toxicity for eight weeks prior to enrolling the next cohort of patients at a new dose level. Subsequent patient cohorts will be enrolled at doses according to the CRM design. A maximum sample size of 12 patients will be enrolled over four potential doses to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ixazomib with POMP/D maintenance. Adverse events will be summarized with descriptive statistics at each dose level of ixazomib.</description>

    <description>Patients who are receiving maintenance therapy with the POMP/D (Methotrexate, 6-Mercaptopurine, Vincristine, Prednisone/Dexamethasone) will be enrolled. Each cycle will be 28 days. The patients will receive IV vincristine, dexamethasone or prednisone, methotrexate and 6 - Mercaptopurine. Ixazomib will be administered on days 1, 8 and 15.
Both prednisone and dexamethasone are acceptable drugs in maintenance therapy. For example, in the HyperCVAD regimen or the CALGB 8811 prednisone is used. Patients will continue the same maintenance regimen they are receiving and ixazomib will be added to that.</description>
