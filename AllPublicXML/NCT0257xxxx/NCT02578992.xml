  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate two different patient's head and neck
      positions(neutral head position and head-lift position) for the effectiveness of orotracheal
      intubation with using the &quot;Clarus Video System (Trachway®)&quot; intubating stylet.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sniffing position has traditionally been considered the optimal head position for direct
      laryngoscopy, However, it may aggravate cervical spine injury. The Trachway® video stylet is
      an intubating device that may avoid cervical movement during intubation. Nonetheless, the
      effectiveness of limited neck movement in patients with neutral head or head-lift position
      using the Trachway® video stylet remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare
      the intubation time of the two positions with the Trachway® video stylet.
