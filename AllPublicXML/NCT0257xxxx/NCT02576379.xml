  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, and 15 million people suffer a stroke each
      year; one-third die and one-third are left permanently disabled. Because the risk of stroke
      increases with age, it has been considered a disease of the elderly, but stroke also occurs
      in middle-aged people.

      Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the preferred choice of reperfusion
      therapy of ischemic stroke if performed within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Time to
      thrombolysis is associated with improved outcome: the sooner the treatment, the less risk of
      serious - and possibly permanent - damage to the brain. Unfortunately, only a small fraction
      of stroke patients make it to thrombolysis within the 4.5-hour; one explanation may be system
      delays including prolonged transportation.

      In May 2010, the first physician-staffed Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) was
      implemented in the Eastern part of Denmark. An observational study evaluating the short-term
      effects of HEMS implementation compared patients transported by conventional ground ambulance
      (Ground Emergency Medical Service (GEMS)) to patients transported by HEMS. Patients
      transported by helicopter had increased time to specialized care. However, both 30-day and
      1-year mortality was slightly lower in patients transported by HEMS, although not
      significant, as was the degree of disability at three months measured by the modified Rankin
      Scale (mRS).

    <description>Mortality during the follow-up period will be analysed for differences between GEMS and HEMS. Follow-up period is until May 1st 2015. Because of varying access to information on covariates depending on the diagnosis and treatment of the patient, we conduct the analysis as follows: 1) the whole study population; adjusted for sex and age, 2) patients who were suspected of suffering from a vascular condition; adjusted for sex, age and comorbidity (defined as one of the following conditions; diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, and previous stroke), and 3) patients who underwent thrombolysis; adjustment for sex, age, comorbidity, and initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score.</description>

        All patients arriving at the regional stroke unit at Copenhagen University Hospital,
        Roskilde, suspected of an acute vascular condition within the geographical area covered by
        both HEMS and GEMS in a 40-month period from January 1st 2010 until April 30th 2013.

        The geographical catchment area is defined as the area from where HEMS transported patients
        the first year of implementation.

        We compare stroke patients transported by HEMS with stroke patients transported by GEMS.
