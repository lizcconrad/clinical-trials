  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Correct methods and compliance of intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) is very important for the
      treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). The animated cartoon-aided teaching of INCS
      administration was created to decrease workload of health care professionals. The aim of this
      study is to compare the achievement of the children with AR in using INCS between the group
      which were instructed by animated cartoon-aided teaching or oral presentation without
      demonstration.

      The study was a prospective randomized control trial in children aged 5 - 16 years with
      moderate to severe intermittent or persistent AR who had never used INCS. The patients were
      randomly divided into 2 groups; 1) Teaching how to use INCS by oral presentation and 2) by
      animated cartoon-aided teaching. Successful achievements were recorded when the patients were
      able to use INCS (all five-point checklists) correctly. If they were unable to use the INCS
      correctly after the first teaching, the same instruction would be repeated and the second
      assessment would be performed.
