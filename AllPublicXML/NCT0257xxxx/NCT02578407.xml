      This study aims to determine the treatment effect of accommodative/vergence therapy on myopic
      children by assessment of accommodative function before and after therapy.

      1. Specific aims of the proposed clinical trial:

           1.1 To prove accommodative/vergence therapy (AT) can normalize the accommodative
           function of myopic children.。 1.2 If the accommodation function of myopic children can
           be improved with AT therapy, the outcome will supply a basic for a randomized,
           multi-center clinic trail to determine the effectiveness of AT to slow the progression
           of myopia.

        2. Hypothesis:

      Accommodative/vergence therapy can normalize the accommodative functions of 8-12 years old
      Chinese myopic children.

    <description>We will measure the level of fluctuation in lag of accommodation at 33 cm objectively by using open-field autorefractor. A 1 minute continuous measurement will be taken in right eye. The unit of measurement is spherical equivalent dioptric power.</description>

    <description>We will measure the accommodative facility at 40 cm by flipper bar method using a ±2.00 diopters lens flipper. 1 measurement will be taken in right eye. The unit of measurement is cycles per minute.</description>
