  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have resulted in increased survival of the
      HIV-infected population; however, this gain in longevity is associated with an increased risk
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although ART and traditional risk factors contribute to CVD
      in this population, heightened markers of immune activation, inflammation, and coagulation
      independently predict morbidity and mortality, suggesting that dysregulation of these systems
      plays a significant role in the increased risk of CVD. The investigators believe that
      platelet activation is an important driver in HIV-associated immune activation, inflammation,
      and coagulation, leading to an increased CVD pathophysiology and risk. Platelets initiate
      thrombus formation and also play a key role in vascular inflammation by releasing
      pro-inflammatory mediators and cross-talking with other relevant cell types including
      leukocytes. Researchers have described platelet hyperreactivity in chronic HIV infection.
      Importantly, the investigators demonstrated that one week of anti-platelet therapy (aspirin)
      decreased platelet activation and immune activation, with an improved trend in inflammation
      and immune parameters. The overall hypothesis is that platelet activation is a major driver
      of immune activation, inflammation, and thrombosis in ART-treated HIV infected patients. The
      purpose of the proposed proof-of-concept study is to understand the mechanism(s) by which
      anti-platelet therapy improves immune and inflammatory parameters in chronic HIV infection.
      To test this, the immune modulating and anti-inflammatory effects of 24 weeks of the
      anti-platelet drug aspirin as compared to the anti-platelet drug clopidogrel will be
      evaluated. Given their different mechanisms of action and inhibitory potency, the
      investigators can differentiate whether the potential benefits are mediated via inhibition of
      arachidonic acid (aspirin) or inhibition of ADP (clopidogrel) or by the antithrombotic
      activity. A secondary goal is to perform multidimensional assays of platelet activity and
      thrombogenicity alongside immune activation assays and careful assessments of traditional
      risk factors and medication regimens, to understand which parameters are highly associated
      with thrombogenicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 40 HIV-1 infected
      participants on stable ART randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to aspirin 81mg daily vs clopidogrel
      75mg daily vs placebo for 24 weeks. A subset of patients in each arm will participate in a
      sub-study to evaluate thrombogenicity, to be performed prior to the first study treatment and
      at 24 weeks of study treatment. 10 HIV uninfected control subjects will participate the study
      to evaluate baseline characteristics.

      The primary endpoint is to determine the impact of aspirin as compared to clopidogrel on
      immune activation and inflammation in HIV infected, ART treated adults. This will be
      determined by measuring the change in the clinically relevant soluble marker of inflammation
      sCD14 over 24 weeks of study drug. Secondary objectives will be to measure safety and
      tolerability, to measure the effects of study drugs on important soluble markers of
      inflammation (sCD163, IL-6, d-dimer, sTNFRI and II), by measuring monocyte subsets (CD14,
      CD16, CD69), by measuring platelet activation by light transmission aggregometry,
      monocyte-platelet aggregates, and soluble CD40L, by measuring clot formation kinetics by
      thromboelastography, and in a subset of patients, by measuring thrombogenicity by Badimon
      Chamber and cholesterol uptake by monocytes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        HIV infected participants:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection

          -  Currently on continuous ART for ≥48 weeks prior to study entry. NOTE: This is defined
             as continuous active therapy with no treatment interruption longer than 7 consecutive
             days and a total duration off-treatment of no more than 14 days during the 48 weeks
             prior to entry.

          -  No change in ART regimen within the 12 weeks prior to study entry (except as noted
             below).

        NOTE: Modifications of ART dosing during the 12 weeks prior to entry are permitted. In
        addition, the change in formulation (eg, from standard formulation to fixed dose
        combination or single tablet regimen) or dosing (eg, from once a day to twice a day) is
        allowed within 12 weeks prior to entry. Within-class single drug substitution (eg, switch
        from nevirapine to efavirenz or from atazanavir to darunavir), are not allowed within 12
        weeks prior to entry. No other changes in ART in the 12 weeks prior to entry are permitted.

        if FSH testing is not available, have had amenorrhea for 24 consecutive months, or women
        who have undergone surgical sterilization, (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal
        ligation or salpingectomy)), she is eligible without requiring the use of a contraceptive
