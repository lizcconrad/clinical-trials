  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Spray cryotherapy (SCT) using liquid nitrogen has been safely and effectively used
      in the esophagus, airways and pleura. Treatment with SCT for central airway stenosis may
      provide an effective, and more durable and perhaps safer alternative to the current
      therapeutic modalities.

      Objectives:

        1. To investigate the feasibility of using Spray cryotherapy (SCT) for the treatment of
           malignant and benign central airway disease.

        2. To investigate the safety of using Spray cryotherapy (SCT) for the treatment of
           malignant and benign central airway disease.

        3. To investigate the efficacy of using Spray cryotherapy (SCT) for the treatment of
           malignant and benign central airway disease.

      Study design: This study will be a prospective, single arm, open label intervention study
      performed at the University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands Study population: The
      study population exists of 25 patients with malignant or benign central airway disease.
      Patients in which current treatment options are regarded to be suboptimal can be included in
      the study.

      Intervention: TruFreeze Spray CryoTherapy

      Main study parameter:

      Feasibility is defined as being able to apply the SCT as planned in one, or more
      bronchoscopies according to the instructions for use (IFU).

      Secondary study parameters:

      Safety will be assessed by capturing all adverse events (AEs) that occur 1) during the SCT
      procedure, and 2) all AEs that occur until hospital discharge.

      Efficacy will be measured using 1) patient reported outcomes (questionnaires), 2) percentage
      improvement in airway stenosis, 3) durability of treatment effect, 4) need to re-intervene
      with other therapies because of treatment failure.

      Nature and extent of the burden, risks and benefit associated with participation.

      Patients that will be recruited and participate in this prospective clinical trial have a
      severe central airway disease which is highly symptomatic for which current available
      therapies are either very difficult to perform, are hazardous, have no real benefit, or just
      simply not available yet. The current treatment risks of this patient group are high,
      especially in the patients where the airway patency is at risk. The main additional risk
      associated with the use of SCT is the occurrence of a pneumothorax. Patients participating
      will adhere to their current medical care, with the one addition of a voluntary follow-up
      bronchoscopy after SCT.
