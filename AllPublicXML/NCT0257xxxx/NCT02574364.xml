  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The traditional open appendectomy in the clinical effect is not prefect, and for a long time
      there is no measurable improvement. The application of abdomen CT before surgery provides a
      new approach to the incision and new perception.

      In a randomized controlled trial of modified incision versus traditional incision. Length of
      hospital day was the primary terminus, while operating time, postoperative complication, scar
      and time to resume normal activity and work as secondary terminus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional open appendicectomy have many drawbacks, such as false-positive, cut infection,
      scar, extended cut, slower rehabilitation and return to work. In the past few years, in order
      to improve diagnostic accuracy, the abdomen CT is been general applied before appendicectomy,
      in addition to, a modified incision (MI) was designed based on it. Using a MI compare
      traditional incision (TI) to the patient including cut extended, operating time, cut
      infection, false-positive rate, rehabilitation and return to work. It seems that MI would
      prove superior to TI in terms of hospital day (primary terminus), with operating time,
      postoperative complication, scar and time to resume normal activity and work as secondary
      terminus.
