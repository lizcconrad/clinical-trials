    <textblock>
      Depending on disease stage, testicular cancer (TC) treatment consists of an orchidectomy,
      alone or followed by radiotherapy (RT) or platinum-based chemotherapy (CT). TC survival rates
      are above 90% nowadays, which results in growing TC survivor population. Because of the long
      life expectancy of these survivors, prevention or early detection of late treatment effects
      has become increasingly relevant. Yet known late effects are nephrotoxicity, cardiovascular
      disease (CVD), secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN), neurotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity,
      Raynaud's phenomenon, hypogonadism, fatigue and psychosocial problems. Nephrotoxicity is an
      important late effect, but data is lacking in very long-term survivors since performed
      studies have a follow-up duration of 5-14 years. Decreased renal function is a known risk
      factor for CVD development and also an association between renal function and neurtoxicity
      via circulating platinum levels has been shown. It is hypothesized that treatment induced
      nephrotoxicity is prevalent in TC survivors and might be a mediator for development of late
      effects. The secondary aim is to assess prevalence of late effects in very long-term TC
      survivors: until now, most data have been collected through questionnaires in large
      epidemiological studies in TC survivors till approximately 10 years after treatment. The
      prevalence of late effects may increase over time: 10 years after treatment late effects may
      not be present yet, whilst late effects can emerge just after 20 years. Consequently, health
      status and possible late effects, resulting in morbidity, are underestimated in patients who
      are 20-30 years after treatment. By investigating health status of these very long-term
      survivors a more profound insight in the prevalence and aetiology of these late effects and
      the development over time can be assessed. Current treatment is very similar to TC treatment
      20-30 years ago and therefore knowledge on late effects is relevant for currently treated
      patients. Furthermore, as a result of this study, we will better understand which factors and
      issues should be watched closely during follow-up, which TC survivors are at increased risk
      of developing late treatment effects and how to detect early damage before overt morbidity
      occurs.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to compare glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in very
      long-term testicular cancer (TC)-survivors treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery
      only and non-cancer treated healthy controls. Secondary aim is to assess prevalence of
      adverse late treatment effects in very long-term TC-survivors treated with chemotherapy (CT),
      radiotherapy (RT) or surgery only (SU) and investigate the relationship between GFR
      parameters and these late effects.

      Study population: Patients treated with CT, RT or only surgery for TC more than 20 years ago
      and an age-matched male control population.

      Study design: An observational cross-sectional cohort study will be performed. Patients will
      be invited for a single study visit, which consists of collection of urine during 24 hours,
      withdrawal of blood samples, filling in questionnaires, physical examination, vascular
      function and structure tests, lung function tests, digital cooling tests, neuropsychological
      assessment and a walk test.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary study parameter is renal function as expressed by
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Secondary endpoints are the prevalence of the following
      defined adverse late effects: cardiovascular disease (CVD), peripheral neuropathy, reduced
      lung function, Raynaud's phenomenon, hypogonadism, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Other
      secondary parameters are health related quality of life (HRQoL), physical fitness, markers
      for (subclinical) vascular damage, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and aging markers.

        Potential participating TC survivors will be identified by the TC registry of the
        uro-oncology tumor working group of the UMCG. The investigators will randomly select (with
        an SPSS-query) 70 potential participants from the CT-group and search for age-matched
        controls in the RT-, SU- and CO-group. A margin of three years will be accepted. If no
        matching RT-patients, SU-patients or healthy volunteers are available, age-matching
        criteria will be relaxed by allowing the difference to increase with one year at each step,
        to a maximum of six years. Vital status will be checked with help of information from the
        municipal population registry (GBA:'gemeentelijke basisadministratie'). Healthy volunteers
        are recruited via advertisements in local door-to-door papers and by flyers exposed in the
        UMCG.
