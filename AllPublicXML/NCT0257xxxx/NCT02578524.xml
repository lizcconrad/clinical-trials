  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine patient satisfaction and spectacle independence using a survey in
      patients who have undergone uncomplicated cataract surgery with a presbyopia-correcting lens
      at least 2 years prior to administration of the survey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To compare patient-reported satisfaction with a multifocal vs an accommodating
      presbyopia-correcting at least two years following implantation of either type of implant.

      Number of study subjects: 200 (half with multifocal and half with accommodating lens
      implants)

      In this study, we will send a secure, online questionnaire to patients who have previously
      undergone cataract surgery at least two years previously. Patients will receive an email
      invitation, and by clicking the embedded link and verifying their identity with date of birth
      and phone number, they will be directed to a survey. The survey will ask the following types
      of questions:

        -  overall satisfaction with the surgery

        -  would they do the same surgery again?

        -  would they choose the same (elective) lens implant again?

        -  for what types of activities (reading newspaper, driving, driving at night, fine print)
           do they require glasses to see clearly?

        -  do they experience glare and halo symptoms?

        -  how bothered is the patient by these symptoms?

      These data will be stored on a secure server. Statistical analysis will be done by a
      statistician, using a student's t-test to determine statistical significance of any
      difference between patients with different types of lens implants.

      No intervention will be planned with patients, other than analyzing the survey results. All
      patient identifying (demographic) information will be carefully protected according to HIPAA
      and HITECH standards.
