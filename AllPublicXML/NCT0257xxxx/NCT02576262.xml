  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Papanicolaou (Pap) triage, with high specificity, has been recommended for primary Human
      papillomavirus (HPV) testing but is flawed by poor sensitivity and cytologist dependence. the
      investigators evaluated the potential role of HPV Integration detection in cervical
      exfoliated cells in HPV-positive women from a clinic-based population.
