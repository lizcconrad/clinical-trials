  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a screening evaluation, all subjects will have a needle placed transcutaneously at the
      baseline visit to confirm that the subject feels a pulsation on the foot or toes with or
      without flexion of one or more of the toes. This motor nerve test demonstrates that the nerve
      is responsive to stimulation as an indicator that the subject is an eligible candidate for
      both PTNS and CAN-Stim therapies.

      Subjects will be randomized to either CAN-Stim or PTNS after eligibility is determined from
      the screening test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAN-Stim subjects will be implanted unilaterally (implantation side is up to the
      investigators discretion). Subjects will be educated on the use of the transmitter and
      programmer. Therapy will be delivered for a minimum of 8 hours per day for 12 weeks. Subjects
      who are considered a responder at the 13-week follow-up, will continue therapy and followed
      for a total of 12 months. Non-responders will be offered an explant of the device and will
      exit the study. (Subjects having less than 50% improvement may choose to keep the device even
      though they may not be eligible to continue with the study. PTNS subjects will receive
      in-office PTNS therapy using the Uroplasty device. Unilateral percutaneous stimulation will
      be performed in the standard fashion for a total of 12 weeks. Primary objectives will be
      measured at the 13-week follow-up. At this point study participants who received the
      in-office PTNS therapy may choose to receive a CAN-Stim device at least 8 weeks after their
      last PTNS session. Otherwise, they may exit the trial and can be managed with standard of
      care. If they choose to have the CAN-Stim device, the subject will be implanted unilaterally
      (implantation side is up to the investigators discretion). The subject will be educated on
      the use of the transmitter and programmer. Therapy will be delivered for a minimum of 8 hours
      per day for 12 weeks. Subjects who are considered a responder at the 13-week follow-up, will
      continue therapy and followed for a total of 12 months.
