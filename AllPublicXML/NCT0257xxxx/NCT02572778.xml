  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to have a collection of fresh primary or recurrent tumor tissue for
      establishment of patients-derived xenografts in order to:

      generate a biobank of in vivo patient xenografts representing the different subgroups of
      tumors for head and neck cancer

        -  perform genetic and transcriptional profiling of the primary, metastatic tumors and
           xenograft tumors

        -  evaluate the efficacy of new targeted agents, whether or not in combination with
           standard treatment options

        -  evaluate biomarkers of drug sensitivity

        -  study primary and secondary (acquired) resistance in these models
