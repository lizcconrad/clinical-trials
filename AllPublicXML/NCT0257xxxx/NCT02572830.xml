    <textblock>
      Blocking of reconsolidation by pharmacological or behavioral means offers the therapeutic
      possibility of weakening traumatic memories in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Two
      reconsolidation-based interventions, propranolol and extinction learning, have been shown to
      weaken fear memories in human healthy subjects. However, the success of these interventions
      seems to be limited to weak conditioned fear memories. This calls for new, potentially more
      efficacious, interventions to be tested. Bilateral eye movements seem to be a promising
      candidate intervention for blocking reconsolidation due to the compelling evidence of Eye
      Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing as effective treatment in PTSD. The investigators'
      aim is to test bilateral eye movements as an active reconsolidation-blocking intervention in
      an optimized differential fear conditioning procedure that the investigators have recently
      developed. This novel experimental assay creates stronger fear memories in healthy
      individuals.
