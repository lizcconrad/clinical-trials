      Part A

      -Cohort 1 DSM265 will be administered as a single dose (400 mg). For cohort 1 only, an
      additional single dose (400 mg) of DSM265 may be given if gametocytemia develops. Treatment
      with DSM265 will be given after an overnight fasting period of ≥ 8 hours. If dosing is to
      occur in the evening, subjects will be required to fast for ≥4 hours prior to receiving
      treatment. Subjects will be required to fast for a further four hours anytime after dosing
      with DSM265.

      Part B

        -  Cohort 2 OZ439 will be administered as a single 200 mg dose. If recrudescence is
           observed, a single 400 mg dose of OZ439 will be given. Treatment with OZ439 will be
           administered after an overnight fasting period of ≥ 6 hours. If dosing is to occur in
           the evening, subjects will be required to fast for ≥4 hours prior to receiving
           treatment. Participants will drink 200 mL of milk prior to drug administration, and then
           swallow the appropriate volume of OZ439 suspension. Subjects will be required to fast
           for a further six hours anytime after dosing with OZ439.

        -  Cohort 3 DSM265 will be administered as a single dose (400 mg) as described for cohort
           1. No additional dose will be administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open label study using induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) infection
      to assess the effectiveness of the investigational drugs DSM265 or OZ439 in reducing
      parasitemia. Transmission blocking activity of DSM265 (in P. falciparum infection; cohort 1
      only) and infectivity to vector mosquitoes prior to drug treatment (in P. vivax infection;
      cohort 2 and 3) will also be assessed. This study will be conducted in up to three cohorts (n
      = 8 per cohort), and will be divided into 2 parts. In Part A (cohort 1) the efficacy of a
      single administration of 400 mg DSM265 for the clearance of asexual blood stages of P.
      falciparum will be determined. Activity of a second single dose of 400 mg DSM265 against
      gametocytes will be assessed in this cohort only if sexual stages are identified by PCR
      following the initial drug treatment. In Part B, subjects will be infected with P. vivax by
      IBSM, then treated with a single 200 mg dose OZ439 (cohort 2) or 400 mg dose of DSM265
      (cohort 3). For cohort 2, if recrudescence occurs following initial drug treatment with 200
      mg OZ439, then affected participants who reach the treatment threshold will receive a single
      400 mg dose of OZ439. The PK/PD relationship following drug treatment will be determined in
      order to further characterize the antimalarial activity of the investigational drug in the
      IBSM system using P. falciparum (for cohort 1; 400 mg DSM265) or P. vivax (for cohort 2, 200
      mg OZ439; cohort 3, 400 mg DSM265).

      The treatment effects on gametocytemia (if sexual blood stages are detected by PCR) and
      transmission blocking activity of DSM265 will be investigated as a secondary objective for
      cohort 1 (P. falciparum infection). Prior to drug treatment, the infectivity of P. vivax IBSM
      infection to vector mosquitoes will also be investigated as a secondary objective for Part B,
      cohorts 2 and 3. The exposures achieved with the doses proposed for DSM265 used in Part A and
      DSM265 or OZ439 in Part B are associated with a safety profile which is well described from
      previous studies and significantly below the maximum tolerated exposures reported for either
      drug.

             laboratory norm and haemoglobin must be equal or higher than the lower limit of the
             normal range

          -  As there is the risk of adverse effects of the investigational drugs (DSM265 and
             OZ439), and standard curative treatment (Riamet and primaquine - cohort 1 only) in
             pregnancy, it is important that any participants involved in this study do not get
             pregnant or get their female partners pregnant (refer to Section 6.7).

        Male participants to be dosed with DSM265 in cohort 1 or 3 must agree to use a double
        method of contraception including condom plus diaphragm or condom plus stable
        oral/transdermal/injectable hormonal contraceptive by female partner from at least 14 days
        prior to the time of the dose of the study drug through 120 days (17 weeks) after the last
        dose of DSM265.

        Abstinent male participants must agree to start a double method if they start a sexual

             the study.

          -  Any participant without a good peripheral venous access.

             virus 1 and 2 antibodies (anti-HIV1 and anti HIV2 Ab)

          -  Any drug listed in Table 2 (Drug Screening) in the urine drug screen unless there is
             an explanation acceptable to the medical investigator (e.g., the participant has
             stated in advance that they consumed a prescription or OTC product which contained the
             detected drug) and/or the Participant has a negative urine drug screen on retest by

        Specific to the study_

          -  Cardiac/QT risk

               -  Family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval
                  or known congenital prolongation of the QTc interval or any clinical condition
                  known to prolong the QTc interval.

               -  History of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant
                  bradycardia. Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia,
                  or hypomagnesaemia.

               -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities in the standard 12-lead ECG (at screening)
                  which in the opinion of the Investigator is clinically relevant or will interfere
                  with the ECG analyses on study

          -  Known hypersensitivity to DSM265 or OZ439, or any of its excipients or
             4-aminoquinolines, artemether or other artemisinin derivatives, lumefantrine, or other
             arylaminoalcohols.

          -  Known severe reaction to mosquito bites other than local itching and redness.

          -  Unwillingness to abstain from consumption of citrus (grapefruit, Seville orange, etc.)
             for ≥21 days prior to initiation of the study (inoculation; Day 0) and for the study
             duration.

          -  Unwillingness to abstain from consumption of quinine containing foods/beverages such
             as tonic water, lemon bitter, from inoculation (Day 0) to the end of the malaria

          -  Any history or presence of lactose intolerance.

          -  Use of prescription drugs, herbal supplements, within four weeks prior to
             administration of the study drug, and/or over-the-counter (OTC) medication, dietary
             supplements (including vitamins) within two weeks prior to initial dosing (Note:
             diazepam interferes with the analysis of blood levels of DSM265 and thus should not
             have been used for at least 8 weeks prior to administration of the study drug). If
             needed (i.e. an incidental and limited need) paracetamol is acceptable up to 4 g/day.

        Participants are requested to refrain from taking non-approved concomitant medication from
        recruitment until the conclusion of the study.

        Participants who are excluded from participation on study days for any of the above reasons
        may be eligible to participate on a postponed schedule if the Investigator considers this
        appropriate.
