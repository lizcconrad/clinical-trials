    <textblock>
      In this study, the recent trends in outcomes according to the dialysis modality in Korea
      since 2009, the effect of the use of peritoneal dialysis solutions containing icodextrin or
      high-glucose on various outcomes, the usefulness of 'PD first strategy', and the economic
      burden according to the dialysis modality will be investigated retrospectively using the
      Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database.

      This study is designed as an observational and retrospective cohort study, thus there will be
      no intervention or specified prescription.

      For the comparison of outcomes according to dialysis modality, we will adopt an
      intention-to-treat analysis, and consider the dialysis modality at day 90 to be the initial
      dialysis modality. However, the investigators will also regard the dialysis modality at day
      30 as the initial dialysis modality in order to evaluate and compare earlier mortality.
