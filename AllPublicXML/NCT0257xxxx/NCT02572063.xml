  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to stratify a frailty population based on nutrients
      profiling (amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids) and metabolic profiling (low
      molecular weight metabolites in urine and plasma) at baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study will investigate ways to better characterize the frailty phenotype by
      a combination of i) geriatric assessment (here only: frailty criteria according to Fried),
      ii) clinical surrogate markers (including those of inflammation), iii) body composition, iv)
      nutritional profiling, v) metabolite profiling using a metabolomics approaches.
