      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, single dose, two-period, two-sequence
      crossover study to investigate the bioequivalence of PEG-IFN alfa-2a BA-free formulation
      versus the reference market formulation (PEG-IFN alfa-2a [PegasysÂ®]) following subcutaneous
      administration via prefilled syringe in healthy Chinese participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy female and male Chinese participants

          -  Body mass index between 19 and 28 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive

          -  Participants determined as healthy by their medical history, physical examination,
             vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory measurements performed
             at the Screening visit

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential: willing to use highly effective methods
             of contraception throughout the study and for 90 days after the last dosing

          -  Male participants: agreement to remain abstinent or use spermicide and barrier method
             contraception throughout the study and for 90 days after the last dosing

          -  Able to participate and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with
             the study restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

             I, anti-HIV II) tests at Screening

          -  Participants with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) above the upper limit of normal at
             Screening or on Day -1 of Period 1

          -  Any other condition or disease (other than those already stated) which, in the
             judgment of the Investigator, would place the participant at undue risk, interfere
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of PEG-IFN alfa-2a, or
             interfere with the ability of the participant to complete the study

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last year before screening

          -  Treatment with interferon or PEG-IFN alfa-2a within 3 months prior to the first dosing

             pregnancy test at screening or have a positive urine pregnancy test on Day -1 of
             Period 1

          -  Use of any prescribed or over the counter medication or herbal medicine taken within
             14 days prior to the first dosing or within 5 times the elimination half-life of the
             medication prior to the first dosing (whichever is longer). Exceptions are
             paracetamol, the contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy and commonly used
             vitamin supplements, which are permitted
