  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of ipragliflozin once daily
      in Japanese participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have inadequate glycemic
      control on sitagliptin, diet, and exercise therapy. The primary hypothesis for this study is
      that the addition of ipragliflozin compared with placebo provides greater reduction in
      hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) as assessed by change from baseline at Week 24.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HbA1c at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is measured as percent. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 24 HbA1c percent minus the Week 0 HbA1c percent. Statistical analysis based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model with terms for treatment, time, prior use of AHAs, the interactions of treatment by time, time by prior use of AHAs, treatment by time by prior use of AHAs, and baseline eGFR value with the constraint that the mean baseline HbA1c is the same for both treatment groups.</description>

Statistical analysis based on a cLDA model with terms for treatment, time, prior use of AHAs, the interactions of treatment by time, time by prior use of AHAs, treatment by time by prior use of AHAs, and baseline eGFR value with the constraint that the mean baseline 2-hr PMG is the same for both treatment groups.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of treatment period study medication and have at least one measurement of 2-hr PMG (baseline or post-baseline).</population>
