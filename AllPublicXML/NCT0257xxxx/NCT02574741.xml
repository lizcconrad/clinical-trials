  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two main elements: the enrollment of 72 children aged 6-11 years
      with ASD and low language competency to receive a thrice-weekly one hour language
      intervention for 12 weeks; and, beginning at the same time, subjects will be equally
      randomized to receive either aripiprazole (Abilify) (flexibly dosed from 2-10 mg per day) or
      placebo for 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following screening for eligibility and baseline, study visits will be scheduled three times
      per week, with 2 sessions on-site at UCLA and one at home for parent training (allowing
      flexibility, as needed); study physician visits will occur once weekly for 6 weeks, then
      biweekly. Screening procedures may be completed in one or two visits, and measures obtained
      in other UCLA clinical or research setting may be used if assessments were done within one
      month of screening. Major outcome assessments will occur at baseline (Week 0), mid-point
      (Week 6), and final week (Week 12) by study personnel blind to visit number and drug group
      assignment; minor assessments will occur weekly along with study physician assessments
      occurring weekly for side effect and compliance checks. EEG will occur at or prior to
      baseline and at Visit 36 (Wk12). Arrangements will be made to transfer participants to
      standard clinical care following visit 36. Six months after visit 36, families will be seen
      for final follow-up assessments of language usage, social communication, overall functioning,
      health and ongoing treatment.
