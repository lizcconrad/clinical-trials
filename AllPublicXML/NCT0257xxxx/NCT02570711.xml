        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  No previous radiotherapy, chemotherapy or investigational therapy for the treatment of
             metastatic disease. Prior treatment with 5-FU or gemcitabine administered as a
             radiation sensitizer in the adjuvant setting is allowed, provided at least 6 months
             have elapsed since completion of the last dose and no lingering toxicities are
             present.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior malignancy (other than pancreatic cancer), except for adequately treated basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which
             the subject has been disease free for ≥ 2 years or which will not limit survival to &lt;
             2 years.

          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias,
             congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or
             resection of the stomach or small bowel, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease,
             partial or complete bowel obstruction, or gastric restrictions and bariatric surgery,
             such as gastric bypass.

          -  Biliary obstruction or presence of a percutaneous biliary drain. Note: Subjects with
             endobiliary stents may participate as long the enrollment criterion relating to serum
             bilirubin concentration is met.

          -  Breastfeeding or pregnant
