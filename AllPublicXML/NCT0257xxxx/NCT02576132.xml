      This study was part of a quality improvement project at the Department of Anesthesiology and
      Intensive Care Medicine, Charité - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin.

      Being in pain is reported to be one of the most important stressors in critically ill
      patients and worsens outcome. The evaluation of pain using validated scores in patients who
      are able to self-report significantly improves the quality of analgesic therapy and health
      related outcomes in intensive care patients.

      However, behavioral pain score that are used in sedated or delirious patients, often
      underestimate the severity of pain.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate if measurement of the pupillary light reflex
      Amplitude correlates with the results of pain assessment using validated pain scores in
      critically ill patients.
