    <textblock>
      Development of pressure ulcer (PU) is complex and multifactorial. The association of a
      constituted PU and of clinical / biological major elements is demonstrated and justifies.
      Prevention of PU is an important health priority, one that requires clear identification of
      risk factors.

    <description>- Prognostic Inflammatory and Nutritional Index (PINI) is a simple clinical [PINI = AAG x CRP / albumine x prealbumin] and classificated as follows: normal (1&lt;PINI score &lt;10), mild malnutrition (11&lt;PINI score&lt;20), severe malnutrition (21&lt;PINI score&lt;30) and risk for death when PINI score &gt;30.
These scores gained in popularity as it uses an objective rather than subjective measurements to determine nutritional risk in hospitalized patient populations.</description>

wound per patient suffering from pressure ulcer was cultured by swab to determine the bacterial species of the infection and helps guide antibiotic therapy.
The representative sample is collected before topical or systemic antibiotics are initiated and pain assessment should be conducted prior to wound procedures such as dressing changes and debridement. Bacterial swabs provide information on the predominant flora.</description>
