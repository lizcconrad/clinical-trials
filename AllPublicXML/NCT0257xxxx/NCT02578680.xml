  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combined with
      pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy versus pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone in
      participants with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
      have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab combined with pemetrexed/platinum (Investigators
      choice of cisplatin or carboplatin), OR pemetrexed/platinum (Investigators choice of
      cisplatin or carboplatin).

      The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed/platinum
      chemotherapy prolongs Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) compared to
      pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone.
