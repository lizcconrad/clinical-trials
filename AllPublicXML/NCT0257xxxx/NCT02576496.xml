    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of EDO-S101 in patients with
      relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. All patients will receive EDO-S101.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EDO-S101 is a new chemical entity, a first-in-class fusion molecule of an alkylator,
      bendamustine and a histone-deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), vorinostat. It is anticipated that
      EDO-S101 may have activity in various hematological malignancies and solid tumors. This phase
      1 study will enroll patients with various hematological malignancies.

      The study consists of 2 stages:

        -  Stage 1: Dose Escalation to determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) at the optimal
           infusion time and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles; is expected to enroll between 21
           and 48 patients

        -  Stage 2: Expansion in four Cohorts, in which approximately 12 patients will be enrolled
           per cohort, for a total of 48 patients.

      In Stage 1, EDO-S101 doses will be escalated following the standard 3+3 design. The decision
      to escalate to the next dose level will occur after all cohort patients have completed 3
      weeks (21 days) of observation and have been evaluated for safety and toxicity.The starting
      dose is a 1 hour infusion of 20 mg/m2, and the maximum dose level is 150 mg/m2. Reduced
      infusion times of 45 minutes and 30 minutes will also be assessed once the maximum tolerated
      dose at a 1-hour infusion is determined.

      In Stage 2, four cohorts of patients (with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma or
      Waldenström Macroglobulinemia; relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma; relapsed/refractory
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [except chronic
      lymphocytic and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma] who have been treated or are refractory to
      bendamustine); and relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and T-cell
      Prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) will be enrolled and treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) based on results of Stage 1. Treatment will occur every 21 days. Patients in each
      stage of the study are expected to receive a median of four 3-week Cycles of therapy, and the
      maximum number of treatment Cycles allowed is 6.
