  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the HPV
      Integration-based cervical screening for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial
      neoplasia (CIN), using colposcopic inspection as the reference method. Lesions will be
      confirmed as malignant or CIN by colposcopic inspection and histopathologic examination.
