        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males that are 18 years or older with established severe haemophilia A as evidenced by
             their medical history. Patients will be considered as severe if their FVIII baseline
             level is 1 IU/dL or less

          -  Treated/exposed to FVIII concentrates or cryoprecipitate for a minimum of 150 exposure
             days (EDs)

          -  Greater or equal to 12 bleeding episodes only if receiving on-demand therapy over the
             previous 12 months. Does not apply to patients on prophylaxis

          -  Able to sign informed consent and comply with requirements of the trial

          -  No history of inhibitor, or no inhibitor on 2 consecutive occasions within the past 12
             months using a modified Nijmegen Bethesda assay higher than 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU)

          -  Sexually active patients must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception
             such as double barrier, including hormonal contraception for at least 6 months
             post-treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Detectable pre-existing immunity to the AAV capsid as measured by AAV transduction
             inhibition and AAV total antibodies

          -  Any evidence of active infection or any immunosuppressive disorder.

          -  Patients that are HIV positive are excluded.

          -  Significant liver dysfunction as defined by abnormal elevation of ALT (alanine
             transaminase) to 3 times the upper limit of normal, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,
             or an INR (international normalized ratio) of 1.4.

          -  Potential participants who have had a liver biopsy in the past 3 years are excluded if
             they had significant fibrosis of 3 or 4 as rated on a scale of 0-4.

          -  Evidence of any bleeding disorder not related to Haemophilia A

          -  Platelet count of &lt; 100 x 10e9/L

          -  Creatinine â‰¥ 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Liver cirrhosis of any etiology as assessed by liver ultrasound

          -  Hepatitis B if surface antigen is positive

          -  Hepatitis C if RNA is positive

          -  Treatment with any IP within 30 days prior to the screening visit

          -  Any disease or condition at the physician's discretion that would prevent the patient
             from fully complying with the requirements of the study. The physician may exclude
             patients unwilling or unable to agree on not using alcohol for the 16-week period
             following the viral infusion.

          -  Receipt of any vector or gene transfer agent.
