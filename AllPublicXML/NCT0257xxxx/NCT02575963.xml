      The study is a multicenter, open label Phase I/II trial.

        1. Establish the MTD of fractionated doses of Lintuzumab-Ac225 in combination with low dose
           cytosine arabinoside (Low Dose Ara-C, LDAC) (Phase 1 portion)

        2. Determine the response rate (CR + CRp + CRi) to fractionated doses of Lintuzumab-Ac225
           alone (Phase 2 portion)

    <time_frame>Cycle 1, up to 52 days</time_frame>
    <description>If two or more patients in a cohort experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded, and no further dose escalation will occur. If only three patients were treated at a dose level under consideration as the MTD, then up to three additional patients will be accrued. If no more than one of the six patients at that dose level experiences DLT, then that dose level will be confirmed as the MTD.</description>

    <description>Cytarabine + Lintuzumab-Ac225 Cytarabine days 1 to 10 of each cycle. Doses were divided into 2 equal fractions with the first fraction given approx. 4-7 days after 1 cycle of low dose cytarabine and the second fraction given 4-7 days after the first fraction, followed by up to 11 more cycles. Furosemide (Phase 1 only) and Spironolactone were administered after Lintuzumab-Ac225.
Experimental: Phase 2
Experimental: Lintuzumab-Ac225 The Phase II dose determined during the Phase I dose escalation was 4.0 μCi/Kg Lintuzumab-Ac225 and 25 μg/Kg unlabeled HuM195 divided into 2 equal fractions with the first fraction given on Day 1 and the second fraction given on Day 5-8. Spironolactone is administered after Lintuzumab-Ac225.</description>
