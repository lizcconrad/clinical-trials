      The current study aims to examine the safety and feasibility of utilizing tDCS to enhance
      affect-laden episodic memory consolidation among adults with co-occurring alcohol use and
      anxiety disorders who have recently undergone detoxification as a step toward the
      translational clinical application of this approach.

          -  minimum of a sixth grade English reading level (deemed necessary to complete study
             materials); as determined by their being able to read and understand the consent form.

          -  Living within reasonable driving distance (1 hour or less) of the Twin Cities to allow
             for in-person follow-up interviews

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  lifetime history of psychosis or mania by history.

          -  cognitive (e.g., dementia) or physical impairment (e.g., blindness) that interferes
             with study participation report or as judged by PI/study physician.

          -  Current suicide risk as deemed by the PI and study physician to be serious and ongoing

          -  any medical condition or treatment with neurological sequelae (e.g., stroke, tumor,

          -  history of ECT

          -  document loss of consciousness (LOC) for longer than 30 minutes or LOC with
             neurological sequelae

          -  pregnancy

          -  Although seizures are not a known risk of tDCS intervention (Fregni et al., 2006;
             Nitsche et al., 2008), anyone with a history or a risk for seizures will be excluded
             from the study

          -  anyone with metal objects implanted in their head or neck

          -  anyone taking stimulant medications for any reason as we wish to avoid two sorces of
             neurostimulation
