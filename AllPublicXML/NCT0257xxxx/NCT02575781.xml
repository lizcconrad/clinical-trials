      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR428926 when administered as a single
      agent in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      To evaluate the anti-tumor response of SAR428926 when administered as a single agent in
      patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) positive for the protein targeted
      by SAR428926 To assess the preliminary anti-tumor response of SAR428926 when administered as
      a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors positive for the protein targeted by
      SAR428926

      Secondary Objectives:

      To determine the overall safety profile of SAR428926 as a single agent. To characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of SAR428926 and its metabolites.

      To identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SAR428926 as a single agent. To evaluate
      the immunogenicity of SAR428926. To assess the tumor response and duration of tumor response
      in all treated patients.

      To evaluate the benefit of primary prophylaxis on the occurrence of corneal
      (keratopathy/keratitis) toxicity (Expansion cohorts).

      The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of
      up to 28 days, a treatment period, an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit around 30 days following
      the last administration of SAR428926, and at least one follow-up visit around 30 days after
      the EOT visit. The treatment period may continue until disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity, or investigator, Sponsor, or patient decision to discontinue therapy. Patients who
      discontinue treatment for reasons other than progression of disease will be followed every 3
      months until progression, initiation of subsequent therapy, or until the primary analysis
      cutoff date, whichever comes first.
