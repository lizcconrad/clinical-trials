    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of nivolumab before surgery in patients with high-risk clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma who are eligible for nephrectomy. Nivolumab is an antibody that may
      help activate the immune system by blocking the function of an inhibitory molecule, PD-1.
