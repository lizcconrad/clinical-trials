    <textblock>
      Obesity risk is shared within married couples yet most existing weight loss programs focus on
      individuals and not the marital dyad. This project will test the effects of a couples weight
      loss program that teaches spouses how to provide each other with autonomy support and create
      an interpersonal environment that promotes sustained behavior change.
