    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. About 40%
      of pancreatic cancer patients were diagnosed as locally advanced unresectable status without
      distant metastasis. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was a reasonable treatment modality
      for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, several adverse events of chemoradiation
      could lead unfavorable treatment results, which included unique gastrointestinal (GI)
      toxicities, such as ulcer and hemorrhage in the stomach and duodenum that are included in the
      radiation field. According to the study in the investigators hospital, 45% of locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with CCRT suffered from GI ulcers, and among
      them, 65% of the patients experienced the significant hemorrhage events. Although these GI
      toxicities, the studies for radioprotective agents were limited. Albis® is a newly developed
      drug comprised of ranitidine, bismuth and sucralfate. The investigators will investigate the
      radioprotective effect of Albis® for locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with
      CCRT.
