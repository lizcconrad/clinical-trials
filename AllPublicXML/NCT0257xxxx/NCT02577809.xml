      This is an interventional drug trail to evaluate the effect of different intrathecal opioids
      on post-operative pain experiences in women who have undergone caesarean section surgery.

      1. To evaluate the effect of three different intrathecal opioid mixtures on post-operative
           pain experiences in women who have undergone caesarean section surgery, relating
           specifically to:

             1. Post-operative analgesic requirements at two time points (12 hours and 24 hours)
                after surgery

             2. Pain scores at two time points (12 hours and 24 hours) after surgery

             3. Sedation scores at two time points (12 hours and 24 hours) after surgery

             4. Post-operative nausea scores at two time points (12 hours and 24 hours) after
                surgery

             5. Post-operative pruritis scores at two time points (12 hours and 24 hours) after
                surgery

        2. To determine the impact that the patients' post-operative pain has on their activities
           in the first 24 hours after surgery

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Analgesic Requirements measured by total morphine usage on Patient Controlled Analgesic pump</measure>
    <time_frame>For 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The total administered morphine dose administered to the patient through the PCA pump will be documented. This is documented at 24 hours after surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Pain Score measured by the Numeric Pain Rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument consists of 11 numbered points ( 0 to 10) each of which represent a different pain level for the patient. The scale ranges from 0=NO PAIN up to 10= worst pain possible. This is assessed at 24 hours after surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient sedation scores measured by a 4 point sedation scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument consists of 4 numbered points ( 0 to 3) each of which represent a different level of sedation for the patient. The scale ranges as follows: 0 =awake, 1 = mild drowsiness, 2 = moderate drowsiness, easily awaken, 3 =difficult to arouse.This is assessed at 24 hours after surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient post-operative nausea and vomiting score using a 4 point scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument consists of 4 numbered points ( 0 to 3) each of which represent a different level of nausea for the patient. The scale ranges as follows: 0 = No Nausea, 1 = presence of nausea without vomiting, 2 = mild to moderate vomiting (not requiring treatment), 3 = severe vomiting (treatment required). This is assessed at 24 hours after surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient post-operative pruritis Score using a 2 point scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument consists of 3 numbered points ( 0 to 2) each of which represent a different level of pruritus for the patient. The scale ranges as follows: 0 = no pruritus, 1 = mild to moderate pruritus (not requiring treatment), 2 = severe pruritus (treatment required). This is assessed at 24 hours after surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient respiratory rate measured by counting the respiratory rate over a one minute period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The patients respiratory rate will be counted by the investigator at the time of evaluation at 24hours after surgery. The resulted will be documented as a rate per minute.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Impact of the patients pain on their activity measured using an 11 point scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument consists of 11 numbered points ( 0 to 10) each of which represent a different levels of interference with the patients activity since surgery. The scale ranges from 0= DID NOT INTERFERE up to 10= COMPLETELY INTERFERED. This is assessed at 24 hours after surgery.</description>
