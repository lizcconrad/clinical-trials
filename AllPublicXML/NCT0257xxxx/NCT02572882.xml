  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Microbiome trial is a non-randomized, open-label, crossover, multi-center study of
      p-inulin for patients with hemodialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This primary objective of this exploratory study is to characterize the safety and
      tolerability of p-inulin (PrebiotinÂ®, provided by JGI Medical) in altering the composition
      and function of the human gut microbiome, thereby reducing the generation of gut-derived
      uremic toxins, improving gut barrier function and attenuating systemic inflammation in
      patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis. The study also aims to assess the feasibility
      of conducting a full-scale trial of p-inulin. The primary efficacy parameters of the trial
      will be intra- and inter-participant variability in gut metabolites and bacterial
      composition. Secondary parameters of interest include tolerability and safety of p-inulin,
      willingness of hemodialysis patients to enroll in a study requiring repeated collection of
      stool samples, and participant adherence to agent treatment and specimen collection
      schedules.

    <description>Microbiome characterization endpoints are within-participant variability in the metabolomic profile and targeted metabolites / inflammatory markers.
Stool samples will be collected at baseline, once weekly during weeks 1-7, 10-19, and 22-28, and twice weekly during weeks 8, 9, 21 and 21. Stool samples will be compared longitudinally within individual subjects, and between groups.
Metabolomic evaluation: the relative abundance of metabolites, determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), will be quantified under each condition and compared between groups.</description>
