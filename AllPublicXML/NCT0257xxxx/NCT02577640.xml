      Dietary Soy Isoflavones in Chronic Pancreatitis: Investigating the Anti-inflammatory Effects
      of Food Innovation Science on Gastrointestinal Disease
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of pancreatic disorders imparts a major burden on healthcare costs, estimated at
      over 3 billion dollars annually. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by chronic
      inflammation and progressive scarring, leading to abdominal pain, irreversible damage to the
      pancreas and the loss of both exocrine and endocrine function. Additionally, chronic
      pancreatic inflammation is a risk factor for pancreas cancer. There are no current treatments
      to modify the natural history of this disorder. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic options
      for this disease represents a high priority, and could fill an unmet medical need to improve
      quality of life, reduce risk of malignant transformation, and limit exorbitant medical costs
      associated with patient care. The investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary research
      team to pursue an alternative, non-pharmacologic approach to limiting inflammatory cascades
      in (Chronic Pancreatitis) CP patients. They will assess compliance, toxicity and measure the
      changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression from a soy based dietary bread product using
      a classic 3+3 dose escalation study design in subjects with chronic pancreatitis.

    <description>Here a traditional 3+3 design will be used to determine the compliance, tolerability and dose limiting toxicities in this unique patient population. Dose escalation with soy bread will be continued until dose-limiting toxicities are observed in &gt;33% of the participants or the daily target dose of 4 slices of bread [132 mg soy isoflavone] is reached.</description>

    <description>After the Phase I study has been completed, an additional 10 chronic pancreatitis patients will be treated at the best tolerated dose of soy bread for 4 weeks to further verify safety and toxicity.</description>

    <description>Soy breads will be produced using a sponge-dough process. Finished dough will be formed, panned, and proofed in proofing cabinet (~95% RH) at 40ºC for 60 minutes. Proofed loaves will be baked for 50 minutes at 150ºC in a convection oven (jet air oven, model: JA14, Doyon, Liniere, Quebec, Canada). Breads will be considered done at an internal temperature of 95 ± 5ºC.</description>
