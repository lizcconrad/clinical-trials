      This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial designed to test whether
      two years treatment of preschool children aged 2-3 years of age at high risk for asthma with
      omalizumab (anti-IgE) for two years will prevent the progression to childhood asthma, as
      reflected by a reduction in the prevalence of active asthma in the Final 12 months during 2
      year observation period off study drug.
