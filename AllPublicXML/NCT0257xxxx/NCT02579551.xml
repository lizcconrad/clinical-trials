      This clinical trial studies the effectiveness of narrow margins in patients with low-risk
      basal cell carcinoma undergoing surgery to remove skin lesions on the face. A margin is the
      area of normal tissue around a tumor taken out during surgery to make sure all of the cancer
      is removed. This clinical trial studies tissue samples to determine the least amount of
      tissue that must be removed to give an acceptable cure rate. This may allow less normal
      tissue to be removed from patients and may be a less expensive surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the success rate of narrow margin excisions of low-risk facial basal cell
      carcinoma (BCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the narrowest excision margin for low-risk facial BCC that gives an
      acceptable (95%) cure rate over a 3 year follow-up period.
