  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine, wheather strict dietary intervention with the use of
      the DASH diet atop of optimal medical treatment reduces previously diagnosed coronary
      atherosclerotic lesions assessed witch coronary computed tomography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 180 patients with coronary atheroslerotc lesions confirmed in coronary computed
      tomography (CCT) will be analyzed in a 12-month observation time. Patients will be randomized
      to two groups in a 1:1 fashion. 1 - optimal medical treatment, 2 - strict dietary
      intervention with implementation of the DASH diet atop of optimal medical treatment. CCT
      scans will be performed at screening and at 12 months after randomization. Computed
      tomography imaging data describing atheroslerotic lesions will be assessed.

    <description>The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is a dietary pattern of proven effect on arterial blood pressure reduction. It is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods; includes meat, fish, poultry, nuts, and beans; and is limited in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, red meat, and added fats. Dietary counseling will be provided during each of 7 control visits within the 12-month time of observation.</description>
