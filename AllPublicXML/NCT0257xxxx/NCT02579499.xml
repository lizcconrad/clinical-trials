  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare clinical safety &amp; efficacy of fixed-high potent statin therapy (according to 2013
      ACC/AHA guideline) vs. targeted LDL-C goal statin therapy (LDL&lt;70mg/dL) for secondary
      prevention. Total 4400 patients with coronary artery disease patients requiring statin
      treatment were categorized fixed high-potent statin group and targeted LDL-C group. The
      investigators will compare primary endpoint (major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event
      (MACCE)) and secondary endpoint (1. New onset diabetes mellitus after randomization, 2.
      Hospitalization due to heart failure, 3. Deep vein thrombosis or Pulmonary thromboembolism,
      4. Percutaneous trans-luminal angioplasty on peripheral artery obstructive disease, 5. Aortic
      intervention or operation, 6. ESRD with renal replacement therapy).
