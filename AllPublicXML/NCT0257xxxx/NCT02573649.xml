  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicentre, prospective, double blinded, randomized study designed as an intrapatient
      comparison to evaluate the effects of the Biotronik Closed-loop Stimulation algorithm on
      prevalence and timing of haemodynamic variations and clinical prodromes induced by head-up
      tilt test in patients underwent pacemaker implantation for refractory cardioinhibitory
      vasovagal syncope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 patients with refractory cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope receiving a
      Biotronik pacemaker with Closed-loop Stimulation (CLS) algorithm will be enrolled in the
      study. Two head-up tilt test (HUTT), one during DDD 60/min pacing with CLS algorith turned
      off (CLS-OFF) and the other during DDD-CLS pacing (CLS-ON), will be performed one week apart;
      patients will be randomly and blindly assigned to group A (n=15, first HUTT in CLS-ON mode)
      or B (n=15, first HUTT in CLS-OFF mode). During HUTT heart rate, blood pressure, and the
      incidence of clinical prodromes and syncope wil be recorded.
