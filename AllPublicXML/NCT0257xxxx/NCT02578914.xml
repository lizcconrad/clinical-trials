  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel, single center, double masked, vehicle controlled study. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the activity and safety of NS2 in patients with grass,
      tree or ragweed-pollen induced seasonal allergic conjunctivitis . Subjects will be randomized
      1:1 to receive multiple doses of NS2 Ophthalmic Drops (0.5%) or NS2 Ophthalmic Drops Vehicle
      (0.0%).

      Free aldehydes are thought to be related to inflammatory conditions such as allergic
      conjunctivitis. NS2, a small molecule aldehyde trap, is being evaluated to determine whether
      it may decrease inflammation by lowering aldehyde levels.
