  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate thermal imaging as a technology to monitor the normal clearing of
      amniotic fluid from healthy newborns and newborns suspected of having a condition called
      transient tachypnea of the newborn, or TTN. Thermal images are taken using an imaging device
      that attaches to an iPhone. This device, commercially known as FLIR ONE, creates a
      non-identifiable image based on the heat pattern of an object. In this case, the object is a
      child's chest and back. It does not emit any radiation like an x-ray does.
