  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether regular measurement of skin foot
      temperature with a novel device (DFUPS) will prevent ulcer recurrence in diabetic patients at
      high risk of foot ulceration. It is planned to regularly measure the temperature of the feet
      of people with diabetes who have already had a foot ulcer which has subsequently healed.
      These measurements should allow the identification of hotspots on the foot and may be helpful
      when advising about ulcer risk and providing preventative treatment. It is hoped to find out
      whether the regular use of thermal images taken with the DFUPS device together with standard
      foot treatment may reduce the number of people with diabetes developing ulcers or even
      prevent foot ulcers.

          -  Has previous history of foot surgery which in the opinion of the study investigator
             could interfere with the interpreting the results of the study
