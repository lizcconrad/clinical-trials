      This study seeks to evaluate the effect of topical aqueous suppression on the anatomic and
      functional response to intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections
      in non-responders with wet age-related macular degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, including bevacizumab,
      ranibizumab, and aflibercept, have become the gold standard treatment for neovascular
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Various treatment modalities using these agents have
      been proposed, including monthly, pro re nata, and treat-and-extend philosophies. Despite
      frequent and consistent treatment with anti-VEGF therapy, there is a subset of patients who
      are incomplete or non-responders and have persistent evidence of exudation on spectral-domain
      optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), including subretinal fluid (SRF) and/or intraretinal
      edema.

      While clearance of intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs is not completely understood, some studies
      have suggested that outflow through the anterior chamber may contribute. We hypothesized that
      by decreasing aqueous production, outflow may also be reduced which could delay the clearance
      of intravitreal drugs. As a result, we chose topical dorzolamide-timolol since it is a potent
      aqueous suppressant and is readily available due to its common use in the treatment of
      glaucoma. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of topical dorzolamide-timolol on
      anatomic and visual outcomes in anti-VEGF non-responders with neovascular AMD.

      Significance: The results of this study will help delineate whether topical aqueous
      suppression may be useful as adjuvant therapy in patients receiving chronic intravitreal
      anti-VEGF injections.

    <description>On enrollment, eligible patients will have visual acuity testing, intraocular pressure, dilated fundoscopic examination, SD-OCT scan and will then receive the same intravitreal pharmacologic agent administered at prior visit.
Subsequent follow-up visits will be at an identical interval to pre-enrollment visit intervals (4, 5, or 6 week intervals) for the study duration.
Each subsequent visit will consist of visual acuity testing, intraocular pressure, dilated fundoscopic examination, SD-OCT scan, and intravitreal injection of same pharmacologic agent as prior visits
At study conclusion, mean central macular thickness, maximum subretinal fluid height, and maximum pigment epithelial detachment height will be measured over the study period for all patients</description>
