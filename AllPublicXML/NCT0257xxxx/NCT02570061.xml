      This study examined the use of the telephone for the purpose of informing expectant mothers
      about a randomized clinical trial assessing neonatal Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination.
      Expectant mothers who were contacted for participation in a vaccination trial (the Calmette
      study, NCT01694108) were randomized to receive information by telephone or at a face-to-face
      consultation. The primary outcome was a communication score, consisting of comprehension of
      information about the study and satisfaction with the information process. The outcome was
      measured using a questionnaire two weeks after the information was provided and two and a
      half months after birth.

      Informed consent is an essential element of clinical research. Obtaining consent, however,
      may be challenging. The use of the telephone for giving information and obtaining consent may
      be practical but little formal research has been done.
