    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of three different treatment methods
      which consists spinal decompression, deep friction massage and exercise. The patients were
      separated three groups Group one received non-surgical spinal decompression therapy, group
      two received non-surgical spinal decompression, lumbar stabilization exercises and manual
      therapy, group three received manual therapy and lumbar stabilization exercises. All groups
      completed 15 sessions of therapy. In each session, pain severity was assessed with numeric
      analog scale, straight leg raise test applied and the degree of the hip flexion where the
      patient reported pain were recorded, respectively. Static, dynamic muscle strength-endurance
      tests were applied before the treatment sessions started, after the treatment sessions ended,
      six weeks after and three months after the study. Oswestry Disability Scale (ODI), Back
      Performance Scale (BPS), Lanss Neuropathic pain Questionnaire, Fear-Avoidance-Beliefs
      Questionnaire (FABQ) and McGill Pain Questionnaire were applied before the treatment sessions
      started, after the treatment sessions ended and three months after the study. Gradient of
      disc height and thickness of the herniation were assessed segmentally with magnetic resonance
      imagination (MRI) before the study and three months after the study.
