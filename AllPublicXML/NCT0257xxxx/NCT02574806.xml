  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an important tool for diagnosis, risk stratification and
      prognosis in pediatric patients with heart failure1. In newborn, after delivery, the BNP
      plays an important role in cardiopulmonary hemodynamics by stimulating vasodilatation and
      diuresis. The gradual decrease in pulmonary pressure and the initiation of diuresis as
      expression of renal maturity could explain the subsequent decrease in serum values. This
      would suggest that, in healthy newborns, BNP values should be found within a given ranges.
      However, the evidence suggests an important variability in BNP values 2 - 4. In the other
      hand, in the newborn with respiratory distress BNP could have a high negative predictive
      value to rule out acute myocardial processes, as responsible for clinical deterioration, from
      infectious, metabolic or respiratory processes; with a potential of improvement in medical
      care. Even the increased use of this biomarker in clinical practice, until our knowledge, BNP
      normal values remain unknown in the healthy newborn. Therefore, the investigators performed a
      pioneer study to establish normal values in healthy newborn population. Multi-center,
      prospective and observational study was carried out. Objective: To establish normal BNP
      values in healthy newborn.
