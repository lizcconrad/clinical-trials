    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of Bilastine on patients' attention and
      reactivity levels by measuring psychophysical performance at a F1-high speed simulator
      driving test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase IV, interventional, prospective, mono-centric, single arm, uncontrolled,
      open label trial. The study included outpatient affected by Allergic Rhinitis and/or Chronic
      Urticaria, responding to inclusive criteria and able to perform a preliminary driving test on
      F1-high speed simulator (at the simulator centre) without experiencing signs or symptoms of
      intolerance towards the drive simulation (e.g., nausea, vomiting or dizziness etc). Each
      subject underwent 3 ambulatory visits at the hospital site and 3 driving test at the
      simulator centre.
