  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymerization shrinkage remains one of the primary disadvantages of composite resin
      restorative materials (tooth-colored fillings). To minimize the effects of polymerization
      shrinkage in the restorative treatment, the 3M ESPE company has developed a composite resin
      called Filtek Bulk Fill Posterior Restorative. Its decreased polymerization shrinkage and
      properties allow the material to be inserted in one single increment, expediting treatment.
      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the performance of the new bulk fill composite
      resin in Class II (two-surface posterior) fillings.
