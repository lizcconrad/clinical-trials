    <textblock>
      Prospective cohort study. All patients presenting for percutaneous abdomino-pelvic soft
      tissue ablation, biopsy, or drainage performed under the care of Dr. Issam Kably will become
      part of the study population. Based on prior imaging and/or imaging at the time of the
      procedure, patients will fall into two groups, those for whom no compression is necessary to
      complete the procedure and those for whom compression may provide benefit. These would be
      selected based on Dr. Kably's experience as a practicing academic, fellowship-trained, and
      CAQ'ed interventional radiologist. The latter group would then further subdivide into those
      who give consent for use of the compression device and those who do not consent. Results of
      each group would be measured including the following: termination versus successful
      completion of the procedure; adverse events including bleeding or damage to surrounding
      structures necessitating further medical or surgical intervention.
