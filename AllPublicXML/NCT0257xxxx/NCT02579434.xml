      The study objective is to evaluate and validate of endogenous markers for the assessment of
      CYP3A activity in Korean healthy subjects using metabolomics.

      In part 1, total 75 healthy subjects (males and females) will be enrolled. In part 2, total
      25 healthy female subject aged 20-45 years will be enrolled. In both part A and B, subjects
      will be administered midazolam I.V. 1 mg.
