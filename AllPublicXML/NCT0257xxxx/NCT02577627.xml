    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational, open label study to evaluate and prospectively
      validate in a blind manner the accuracy of predicting treatment outcomes by PrediCare in
      individual patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Small Cell Lung Cancer,
      Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Breast Cancer &amp; Colon Cancer under the treatment with
      the mono- and combination drug protocols for the 1st and 2nd line treatment, approved to the
      market as a Standard of Care

    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are assessing and validating the accuracy of the PrediCare
      predictions by comparing them to the actual patients outcome. Study population will be
      composed of patients diagnosed with advanced stage disease, and divided according to the
      indications and treatment protocols. Retrospective data collected from patients' files will
      enable Optimata to compare the PrediCare Technology predictions of the pattern of metastatic
      and primary tumor growth and dynamics of oncological markers over time with the actual
      outcomes in each individual patient.

    <description>The Training Set will be used to calibrate the Predicare models and algorithms and assess its predictive potential in a retrospective manner. Patients data will be collected according to the oncological indications (NSCLC, SCLC, Prostate cancer, Breast cancer and Colon cancer) and the applied treatment protocols, and their data will be integrated and processed by the PrediCare algorithm.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Validation Set</arm_group_label>
    <description>The Validation Set will be used to validate the prediction power of the device in a prospective manner. The files of patients assigned to Validation Set of the study will be used for the blind prediction of TTP under each specific treatment, based on the baseline individual information. This will be done by inputting into PrediCare the information of each individual patient, available prior to treatment onset (baseline; clinical data, imaging data, histology/cytology, oncomarkers, genetic screening, hematology, biochemistry) for creating a personalized mathematical models and predicting TTP of this specific patient. These predictions will be then compared to the clinically observed TTP for all the patients.</description>
