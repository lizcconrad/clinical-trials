  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Icotinib
      Hydrochloride Cream in healthy adults and patients with mild to moderate psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Icotinib Hydrochloride is a small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor, which has been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) in China in its oral form. As EGFR is implicated in the pathogenesis of
      psoriasis, icotinib hydrochloride is being developed as a cream for the treatment of mild to
      moderate psoriasis. This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study of icotinib hydrochloride cream by topical administration. The study is designed in two
      parts in healthy subjects (part 1) followed by patients with mild to moderate psoriasis (part
      2). 1% and 2% icotinib hydrochloride cream will be initially applied to healthy subjects.
      Once the study in healthy adults shows favorable safety and tolerability, a study in patients
      with mild to moderate psoriasis will be followed. Approximately 28 subjects will be enrolled,
      including 12 healthy subjects (Part 1) and 16 patients with psoriasis (Part 2).
