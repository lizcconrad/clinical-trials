      The purpose of this study is to assess whether a mobile phone intervention can be effectively
      used to improve post menstrual regulation contraceptive uptake and continuation in
      Bangladesh.

      The study will consist of two phases: Phase I: A formative phase to understand barriers to
      post-abortion contraceptive uptake and continuation and the content and modality of messages
      most appropriate for women in the study areas; and Phase II: An RCT will be conducted to test
      the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention developed during the formative phase on
      contraceptive use.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study aims to develop and evaluate a mHealth intervention to promote
      post-abortion contraceptive uptake and continuation among menstrual regulation clients in the
      Sylhet, Chittagong and Dhaka regions of Bangladesh.

      The aim of the formative phase of the study is to develop an interactive two-way messaging
      service for post-MR clients. The messaging service will deliver information relating to the
      women's contraceptive method of choice as well as information about other modern
      contraceptive methods. This part of the study will focus on determining the modality,
      content, timing, language and acceptability of messaging services for post menstrual
      regulation clients.

      The aim of the RCT phase is to measure the effect of mHealth on uptake or switching to
      long-acting reversible contraceptives at the 4 month and 12 month follow ups. The
      investigators expect mHealth to have a positive effect on uptake and a negative effect on
      discontinuation rates of contraceptive users.

    <description>A series of ten automated interactive voice messages will be delivered to the participant's mobile phone over a period of 4 months. Messages will be targeted to the method of contraception the participant is using (no-method, condoms, pills, injectable, implant, copper coil). Messages will support uptake of contraception among no-method users. Messages will support existing users to continue their method and to use it correctly and will also encourage participants who are not happy with their method to switch to a different method. All messages will end with five options: Press 1 to repeat the message, press 2 to listen to recorded information about methods of contraception, press 3 to speak to a counsellor, press 4 to tell me you're fine, press 5 to stop receiving these messages.</description>
