    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an educational web-based intervention designed to increase adolescent
      girls' motivation and skills to engage in safer sexual behavior (Project HEART: Health
      Education and Relationship Training). Half of participants will receive Project HEART and
      half of participants will receive Project Growing Minds, an attention-matched control website
      focused on growth mindsets of intelligence and self-regulation. The ultimate goal of this
      work is to help girls reduce their risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and to
      avoid unplanned pregnancies.
