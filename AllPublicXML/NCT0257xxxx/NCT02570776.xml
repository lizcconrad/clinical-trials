  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of H. pylori infection in Pakistan is unknown and investigators want to assess
      it in dyspeptic patients utilizing UBT. At the same time investigators want to validate UBT
      sensitivity and specificity in Pakistani patients

      The non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of Hp are the Urea Breath Test (UBT) and
      serological tests. The serological tests includes ELISA test in serum for Hp antibody and in
      stool for Hp antigen. Serum ELISA Hp antibody is not sensitive for showing active infection
      and the titres do not decrease even after successful eradication. Serology test cannot be
      used for those who have previously been treated for Hp, as the decline in titre of Hp
      antibodies is too slow to be of practical use. The stool Hp antigen detection test is more
      sensitive and specific as it detects bacterial antigens which will only be positive in the
      presence of Hp. However, it is cumbersome to collect stool and laboratory services are
      required. The C14 Urea Breath Test (UBT) is an office based test with sensitivity and
      specificity comparable to that of the stool antigen test. The diagnostic validity of these
      tests depends on the prevalence of H pylori infection. A higher prevalence would be
      associated with higher sensitivity and lower specificity. The safety profile of the urea
      breath test is very favourable, and no major side effects are associated with it. The aims of
      this study are to estimate H pylori prevalence in Pakistan among the adult dyspeptic
      population and to validate the sensitivity and specificity UBT in our population

        Patients getting routine upper GI Endoscopy are enrolled and as per routine histopathology
        samples are taken to assess Helicobacter pylori. This assessment will be done by two
        independent histopathologists &amp; later the results will be compared with C14 UBT taking
        histopathology as gold standard.
