    <textblock>
      Fluzoparib is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor. The objective of this
      study will be to investigate the safety and tolerability of Fluzoparib Capsule when given
      orally to Chinese patients with advanced solid malignancies. In addition, the pharmacokinetic
      profile, MTD (if possible) and efficacy of Fluzoparib will be investigated.
