  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of proven waterpipe smoking cessation interventions makes it important to explore
      interventions proven effective for cigarette smoking cessation. The investigators hypothesize
      that Varenicline (Chantix) administrated for 12 weeks is associated with higher sustained
      quit rate at 12 weeks compared to placebo. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the effect of Varenicline (Chantix),
      in two parallel groups each consisting of 76 habitual waterpipe smokers who are willing to
      quit. Potential participants will be approached in caf√©s, word-of-mouth and through media and
      will be invited to the American University of Beirut Medical Center to complete study
      procedures. Both study groups will receive the same behavioural intervention in combination
      with either Varenicline (Chantix), an FDA approved drug indicated for use as an aid to
      smoking cessation treatment, or placebo. Participants will complete study procedures in four
      visits. During visit-1 the informed consent process, baseline assessments and randomization
      will be completed and Varenicline (Chantix) or Placebo will be initiated together with the
      behavioural interventions. The behavioural intervention will be continued over the next 2
      visits. An end of treatment visit 12 weeks after quit date will be dedicated to assessing
      sustained quit rate and other outcomes.
