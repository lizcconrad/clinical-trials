      This is a Phase I Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability,
      Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of CM082 in Combination with Everolimus in Chinese
      Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the
      optimal biological dose is identified, an expansion cohort of ~10 advanced renal cell
      carcinoma patients will be enrolled to further characterize the safety and tumor response by
      CT.
