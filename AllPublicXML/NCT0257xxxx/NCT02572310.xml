    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators propose to monitor subjects who have received Triathlon total
      knee components inserted with HV cement. The primary outcome will be fixation of the tibial
      implant component as assessed with RSA and to determine the functionality of patients after
      surgery using self-reported questionnaires. This is a historical control study, comparing the
      study cohort to a previous group with Triathlon implants and the long-standing Simplex T
      cement. The secondary outcomes are inducible displacements of the implants as well as a
      qualitative evaluation of the cement handling characteristics performed by the operating room
      staff.

    <description>A qualitative methodology will be used to perform content analysis of the audio from the interviews stored in computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. The content analysis will involve the use of a deductive approach to the interviews. The coding strategies will derived from a predetermined list of important qualities of bone cement and common themes will be identified as important for the usability of the new cement.</description>
