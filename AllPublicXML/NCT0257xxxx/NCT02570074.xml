  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral dosage regimens for fosfomycin tromethamine (Monurol™) are not established for the
      treatment of cUTI. The most common and recommended adult dosage regimen in the literature is
      a single-dose sachet containing the equivalent of 3 grams of fosfomycin administered every
      other day (QOD) for a total of three doses.

      There are a myriad of different oral fosfomycin dosing regimens currently being used in
      clinical practice, including up to 3 grams orally twice daily for 7-21 days, but these
      regimens are not based on solid pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic or safety rationale. Initial
      pharmacokinetic studies performed with oral fosfomycin tromethamine primarily examined single
      dose regimens and did not use modern day bioanalytical or pharmacokinetic techniques. As the
      use of fosfomycin becomes more pervasive in concordance with the increase in multidrug
      resistant pathogens, further pharmacokinetic and safety data are needed for more intensive
      dosing regimens to support its continued use.

      The rationale of this study is that oral fosfomycin tromethamine requires a modern
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study to identify alternative oral dosage regimens that are
      appropriate and safe. This study will provide safety/tolerability and clinical pharmacology
      information regarding two oral dosing regimens that may have application to treat various
      types of infections involving resistant pathogens or when other oral antibacterial options
      are not available.

      The study is designed as a randomized, two-way crossover trial involving up to 24 randomized
      participants with an anticipated drop-out rate no higher than 25% to give a total of 18
      evaluable healthy adult participants. The study will be fully explained to each participant,
      informed consent will be obtained, and an IRB-approved informed consent form will be signed
      before any study procedures are initiated. All participants will undergo screening
      assessments within 30 days prior to the initial dosing to determine their eligibility for
      enrollment into the study. All participants must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria
      and undergo screening procedures that include a complete medical history, physical
      examination, assessment of clinical laboratory parameters (chemistry and hematology), ECG,
      and pregnancy test (females of child bearing potential only).

      Randomization will be stratified by gender, using permuted blocks. Within each gender,
      eligible participants will be randomized with equal probability to one of the 2 treatment
      sequences shown in Table 3. According to the sequence to which the participant was
      randomized, the participant will initially receive one of two oral dosage regimens of
      fosfomycin: 3 g every other day x 3 doses or 3 g once-daily x 7 doses. After completion of
      the initial dosing regimen each participant will be crossed over to receive the other dosing
      regimen. There will be a minimum 5-day, and a recommended maximum 14-day, washout period
      prior to starting the next dosing regimen. Blood and urine samples will be collected
      throughout the study as well as detailed drug administration and adverse event data for each
      participant.

      Fosfomycin tromethamine sachet (Monurol™) will be used in this study. Each participant will
      be instructed how to stir and dissolve the single-dose sachet into 3 to 4 ounces of water,
      and take each dose immediately after dissolving in water. Compliance will be assessed by
      participant interviews (every 2 days) and counting of empty of sachets.

      Participants will report to the outpatient study center on Day -30 to -1 for study criteria
      review, clinical assessment, and blood collection for screening laboratory tests prior to
      fosfomycin administration. Each participant will participate in the study up to 120 days
      (i.e., screening visit; day -1 for clinical assessment and blood collection; days 1-7 for
      fosfomycin administration and sample collection period; and day 8-10 for follow-up
      assessment; crossed over to receive the other dosing regimen and schedule of events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant is healthy as judged by the site investigator with no clinically
             significant abnormality identified on a medical evaluation including history, physical
             examination, laboratory tests, blood pressure, and heart rate.

          2. Male and female participants between 18 to 55 years old.

          3. Female participants of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized and between
             menarche and one-year post-menopause) must have a negative pregnancy test at the time
             of enrollment and must agree to use appropriate contraception for as long as they are
             taking the study drug and for 1 month afterwards. During the screening visit,
             participants will be instructed to use a second reliable method of birth control in
             accordance with the protocol during the study and for one month following. Medically
             acceptable contraceptives include:

               -  Surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or hysterectomy)

               -  Approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, implants
                  or injections)

               -  Barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or

               -  An intrauterine device (IUD). i. NOTE: Contraceptive measures such as Plan B™,
                  sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for
                  routine use.

          4. Nonsmokers defined as abstinence from cigarette smoking for the previous 6 months
             before enrollment into the study.

          5. Provide a signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study-specific
             procedures (including screening procedures).

          6. Body weight ≥50 kg

          7. Body mass index (BMI) 18.5-29.9 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of significant hypersensitivity reaction or intolerance to fosfomycin
             tromethamine that in the opinion of the site investigator, contraindicates
             participation in the study. In addition, if heparin is used during pharmacokinetic
             sampling, participants with a history of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced
             thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          2. History of significant cardiac, neurological, thyroid, muscular, or immune disorder.

          3. Any laboratory abnormality grade 2 or higher as defined according to the U.S.
             Department of Health and Human Services common terminology criteria for AEs (CTCAE).26

          4. Estimated creatinine clearance (CLCR) &lt;60 ml/minute as determined by Cockcroft-Gault
             equation

          6. Currently breast feeding.

          7. History of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within 6 months of the screening:
             History of regular alcohol consumption averaging &gt;7 drinks/week for women or &gt;14
             drinks/week for men. 1 drink is equivalent to 12g alcohol = 5 oz (150 mL) of wine or

             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless
             in the opinion of site investigator the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise participant safety.

          9. The participant has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication.
