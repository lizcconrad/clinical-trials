      Primary: Evaluation of improved vaginal moisture in postmenopausal women.

      Secondary: the improvement of symptoms resulting from the dryness Rating (VHI), evaluation of
      the decrease in vaginal pH, assessment of Sexual Function Index female (FSFI), evaluation of
      adherence to study treatment by patient diary, assessing the acceptability of the product and
      subjective assessment of the patient as the itching and stinging / burning, beyond the safety
      assessment.

      ENDPOINT:

        -  Primary: Evaluation of improved vaginal moisture in post menopausal women through
           vaginal health index (VHI);

        -  Secondaryevaluate the increase in fluid volume, vaginal elasticity and integrity of the
           epithelium by the VHI, evaluate the pH control, improvement of female sexual quality by
           applying the Sexual Function Index female (FSFI), evaluate through the patient's daily
           treatment adherence, evaluate the acceptability (welfare, run-off and satisfaction) of
           the product and the improvement of itching and stinging / burning through questionnaires
           and verify the tolerability and safety by identifying adverse events.

      STUDY DESING: Phase IV study, longitudinal, prospective, open label, non-comparative

      POPULATION: Forty-six (46) post menopausal women with vaginal dryness

      DRUG: Polimers and Sodium Lactate

      TREATMENT: Only treatment - two weekly applications (monday and thursday or tuesday and
      friday) for 12 weeks

      EVALUATION: The evaluation of the effectiveness will be held on all visits by medical
      clinical evaluation, evaluation of symptoms resulting from the dryness (VHI), pH evaluation
      (pH tape) and evaluation of female sexual quality (FSFI) and subjective evaluation as well as
      the compliance through the patient diary. The evaluation of the acceptability of the product
      will be the last visit by a questionnaire. The safety assessment will be carried out on all
      visits by identifying adverse events
