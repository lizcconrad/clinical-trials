      In the proposed study, investigators aim to investigate the role of interpersonal trust in
      the conditioned placebo analgesia process with healthy male subjects in a standardized
      experimental heat pain paradigm.

    <description>All participants will then be introduced to an analgesia expectation: &quot;This cream is a powerful pain killer&quot;, while receiving an inert cream. In this study participants will be told that they will receive a potent painkiller as well as a control cream. Making use of placebo cream is an established method to induce placebo expectations . Moreover, to increase the analgesic effect, heat pain stimuli intensity will be surreptitiously lowered for the placebo trials to a temperature corresponding to 30% of the VAS intensity and to 60% for the control trials. As the occurrence of a placebo response is highly dependent on expectations, the deceptive procedure described above is used in order to maximally enhance expectations and therefore placebo response. Participants will be debriefed after the completion of study participation.</description>
