  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will retrospectively examine the connection between resuscitation decisions
      of admitted patients at the ED of the University Hospital of Basel and several demographic
      and health related measures. Additionally there will be an examination, which patient
      characterestics may have lead to patients not having been asked about resuscitation
      decisions.
