  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if taking a birth control pill effects how
      well an emergency contraceptive pill called Ulipristal acetate (UPA) works. This type of
      emergency contraceptive is the most effective oral method available. However, this medication
      is an anti-progestin and most regular forms of birth control contain progestin (a female
      hormone). It is unknown if taking the two close together may make the emergency contraceptive
      not work well. The overall goal of this research is to improve the effectiveness of
      contraception for women and to better counsel women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency contraception (EC) provides women with an additional line of defense against
      unintended pregnancy during an act of unprotected intercourse. An antiprogestin, ulipristal
      acetate (UPA; ellaTM), has emerged as one of the most effective oral options. However, there
      is currently a lack of information regarding the practical use of UPA. Basic science studies
      have shown that UPA binds to and prevents progesterone receptor from working, leading to the
      possible concern that hormonal contraceptives, like the birth control pill, would prevent UPA
      from working. Ideally, women should start their regular method of birth control soon after EC
      use but by doing this, they may prevent the UPA EC from working. A woman could just delay
      starting her regular method of birth control but then she is still at risk for pregnancy.
      This proposal has been designed to address this gap in knowledge and will focus on the impact
      of the birth control pill on UPA's ability to delay ovulation (or the release of an egg). The
      hypothesis is that starting the birth control pill shortly after UPA adversely impacts UPA's
      ability to delay ovulation.
