      Continous infusion of nor adrenaline + albumin Continous infusion of terlipressin + albumin
      Response will assessed at every 48 hour (i) Complete response: Regression of acute kidney
      injury stage with reduction of S. Cr within 0.3 mg/dl of baseline (ii) Partial response:
      Regression of acute kidney injury stage with reduction of S. Cr to ≥0.3 mg/dl above baseline
      (iii) No response: No regression of acute kidney injury

      Treatment will be extended until reversal of HRS (decrease in creatinine below 1.5 mg/dL) or
      for a maximum of 7 days after rescue treatment will be followed.

      If intolerant to terlipressin, excluded from study and rescue treatment will be given in form
      of noradrenaline or octreotide and midodrine.

    <description>Intravenous continous infusion of terlipressin at the dose of 2 mg every 24 hours with the maximum daily cumulative dose of 12 mg/day.
In case of no response the dose of the terlipressin will be progressively increased to the maximum infusion dose of 12 mg/24 hour.
Patients will be given 1g/Kg of albumin per day, which will be discontinued if CVP is more than 18 cm H2O.</description>

    <description>Continuous IV infusion of NA starting at 0.5 mg/h with doubling of dose after every 4 hours designed to achieve an increase in MAP of at least 10 mmHg or an increase in 4-h urine output of more than 200 ml. When one of these goals was not achieved, the noradrenaline dose was increased every 4 h in steps of 0.5 mg/h, up to the maximum dose of 3 mg/h.
Patients will be given 1g/Kg of albumin per day, which will be discontinued if CVP is more than 18 cm H2O.</description>
