  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to exploit motor learning principles and adjuvant techniques in a novel
      way to enhance dysphagia rehabilitation. The proposed study will investigate the effects of
      three forms of biofeedback on training and determine whether adjuvant therapeutic techniques
      such as non-invasive neural stimulation and reward augment training outcomes has an effect of
      dysphagia rehabilitation. Outcomes from this research study may change the paradigm for
      treating swallowing and other internal functions such as speech and voice disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to exploit motor learning principles in a novel way to enhance dysphagia
      rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia due to stroke. Dysphagia is swallowing impairment
      that can lead to serious illness or death due to ingested material entering the trachea
      (aspiration). Specifically, this study will determine whether lasting behavioral
      modifications after swallowing training occur with motor learning principles versus standard
      care. Motor learning principles emphasize continual kinematic assessment through biofeedback
      during training. However, continual kinematic assessment is rare in standard dysphagia care
      because swallowing kinematics require instrumentation such as videofluoroscopy (VF) to be
      seen. Since VF involves radiation exposure and higher costs, submental electromyography
      (sEMG) is widely used as biofeedback, although it does not image swallowing kinematics or
      confirm that a therapeutic movement is being trained. This research study will compare three
      forms of biofeedback on training swallowing maneuvers or compensatory techniques (referred to
      as targeted dysphagia training throughout this document) that might reduce their swallowing
      pathophysiology. VF biofeedback training will provide kinematic information about targeted
      dysphagia training performance, incorporating motor learning principles. sEMG biofeedback
      training will provide non-kinematic information about targeted dysphagia training performance
      and, thus, does not incorporate motor learning principles. A mixed biofeedback training,
      which involves VF biofeedback early on to establish the target kinematics of the targeted
      dysphagia training maneuver, then reinforces what was learned with sEMG. Mixed biofeedback
      training is being examined because it is more clinically feasible than VF biofeedback
      training, while still incorporating motor learning principles during part of the targeted
      dysphagia training.

      The investigators hypothesize that VF training will reduce swallowing impairment more than
      mixed training, but mixed training will reduce swallowing impairment more than sEMG training.
      Additionally, this study will investigate whether adjuvant techniques known to augment motor
      training (non-invasive neural stimulation and explicit reward tested independently), will
      augment outcomes of each of the proposed training's. This innovative experimental design is
      significant because it investigates motor learning principles within an ideal training (VF
      biofeedback) as well as within a clinically feasible option (mixed biofeedback) to
      differentiate them from standard dysphagia training (sEMG), which has reported little to no
      improvements after intense motor training.

    <description>Motor learning is improvement in movement overtime, followed by retaining what was learned. To determine whether movements are improving, kinematics must be assessed over time, beginning with defining specific kinematic goals, then continually re-evaluating goals throughout rehabilitation while providing the participants with biofeedback. Biofeedback is fundamental in motor learning, because it increases guidance and motivation, supplements losses in intrinsic feedback (proprioception), and facilitates generalization and retention. Biofeedback enhances the training of novel movements and could be essential for training swallowing maneuvers. Biofeedback training will occur 3 times.</description>

    <description>Motor learning training can be enhanced by adjuvant techniques such as non-invasive neural stimulation and explicit reward. Both influence the primary motor cortex (M1), a key neural substrate of motor skill learning. Non-invasive neural stimulation reduces dysphagia after stroke as measured with subjective swallowing severity scales, however it is unknown whether it could also enhance swallowing maneuver training. Explicit reward (i.e. financial) incentivizes successful gains during motor training. Explicit reward has never been investigated in swallowing rehabilitation. However, it has been shown that increasing stress and financial penalty can reduce swallowing frequency in healthy adults.</description>

    <description>The videofluoroscopy (VF) and barium will be used to record swallowing in all participant groups. This will capture full resolution VF images of all subjects in real time in the lateral view. From the digital recording, image sequencing will be exported to an image processing computer system and archived. The image intensifier will be focused on the lips, posterior pharyngeal wall, hard palate, and just below the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), providing a full view of the oral cavity and neck. A simultaneously recorded time-code will facilitate frame-by-frame data analysis. VF is the only option for visualizing swallowing kinematics during the pharyngeal swallow.</description>
