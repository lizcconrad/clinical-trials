      This is a phase IV, double- blind, randomized, placebo controlled, moncentric study.

      Males and women over 18 y.o. with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosed applying Rome III
      criteria will be enrolled consecutively.

      The study consist of 4 periods:

        -  A screening's period of 2 weeks starting from visit 1, useful to screen potentially
           eligible patients performing diagnostic investigations necessary to confirm disgnosis.

        -  A run- in's period, starting from visit 2 and lasting 2 weeks will represent a baseline
           without specific treatments in order to characterize the severity of symptomatology and
           evaluate patients' compliance relative to daily diaries

        -  A 2 weeks- treatment's period ( active/ placebo) starting from visit 3. The 1st day of
           the period of treatment, eligible patients will be randomized following a 1:1 ratio to
           receive Proklama ( 1 sachet/ day) or placebo. Treatments will be administred daily
           during the whole 2 weeks- treatment's period.

        -  A wash out's period lasting 2 weeks starting from visit 4, to be performed the day after
           the end of the 2 weeks- treatment's period.

        -  A 2 weeks- treatment's period ( placebo/ active) starting from visit 5, to be performed
           the last day of wash out's period. During this visit patients will receive the second
           treatment, following a crossover design.
