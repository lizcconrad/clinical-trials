    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics and pivotal
      bioequivalence of Darunavir (DRV) 800 milligram (mg), Emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg, and
      tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) 10 mg when administered as a fixed-dose combination (FDC)
      (D/C/F/TAF) relative to the separate agents (DRV 800 mg tablet formulation and FTC/TAF 200/10
      mg FDC) in the presence of 150 mg Cobicistat (COBI), under fed conditions, in healthy
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in 96 healthy adult
      participants. The study consists of 2 treatment sessions. Participants will receive in one
      session a single dose of darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF)
      800/150/200/10 milligram (mg) tablets as fixed-dose combination (FDC) and in another session
      Darunavir (DRV) as 1x 800 mg tablet, Emtricitabine/ tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF) as 1x
      200/10 mg FDC tablet, and Cobicistat (COBI) 150 mg as 1x 150 mg tablet all under fed
      conditions. Treatment sessions will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. The
      duration of the study for an individual participant will be at least 12 days, Screening and
      Follow-up not included. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.

          -  Participant has a positive human immunodeficiency virus - type (HIV-1) or human
             immunodeficiency virus - type 2 (HIV-2) test at Screening

          -  Participant has hepatitis A, B, or C infection (confirmed by a positive hepatitis A
             antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM), hepatitis B surface antigen, and/or hepatitis C virus
             antibody, respectively) at Screening

          -  Participant has currently significant and active gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
             neurologic, psychiatric, metabolic, endocrinologic, genitourinary, renal, hepatic,
             respiratory, inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious disease. Currently active
             dermatological disease that would interfere with a correct assessment of possible skin
             reactions to the study drugs

          -  Participant has currently significant and active diarrhea, nausea, or constipation
             that in the Investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability
