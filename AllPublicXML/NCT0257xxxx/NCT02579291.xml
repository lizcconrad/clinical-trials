  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who had experience a stroke usually suffer from spasticity at medium and
      long-terms. The presence of spasticity in the lower extremity implies several impairments for
      standing and walking inducing high disability. A recent study has proposed the use of dry
      needling for improving spasticity in the lower extremity. No study has investigated the
      effects of deep dry needling inserted into spastic musculature in stabilometry and moto
      function in patients who had experience a stroke. A randomized controlled trial investigating
      the effects of the inclusion of deep dry needling into a Bobath interventional program on
      spasticity, motor function and balance (stabilometry) in individuals who had experience a
      stroke

    <description>Spasticity in the affected ankle joint will be evaluated with the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS). The examiner passively will move the ankle in dorsal-flexion direction, back and forth at least 5 times and will evaluate the degree of resistance to the movement on a scale from 0-4.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive a single session of Bobath therapy including techniques targeting modulation of central nervous system. In addition, this group will receive a single session of dry needling into the tibialis posterior muscle with a disposable stainless steel needle (0.3mm x 50mm)</description>

    <description>Once the most painful spot is located within a palpable spastic taut band, the overlying skin is cleaned with alcohol. The needle will be inserted, penetrating the skin about 15-20mm, until the first local twitch response is obtained. Once the first local twitch response is obtained, the needle will be moved up and down (4 to 5 mm. vertical motions with no rotation) in the muscle at approximately 1Hz for 25-30 seconds.</description>
