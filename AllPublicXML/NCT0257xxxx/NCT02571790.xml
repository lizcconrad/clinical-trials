      The purpose is threefold: Assess the anxiety reduction, the mood positive effect and the rise
      of quality of life when using methods of relaxation combined with virtual reality with
      patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder in comparison of the effect of
      traditional relaxation therapy. Observe and evaluate the effect of perceived presence in
      synthetic environments in the virtual experience of relaxation. Evaluate the therapeutic
      efficacy of stereoscopy during exposure to relaxing virtual environments for the treatment of
      generalized anxiety disorder.

      It is a comparative, randomized, two groups study (29 in each group):

        -  Relaxation optimized virtual reality

        -  Classical relaxation (without Virtual Reality). The protocol comprised for each groups 7
           relaxing sessions (with or without virtual reality epending on the group). Each session
           lasted for approximately 30 to 35 minutes, including a 5-minute pause between immersive
           trials, in order to avoid cyber sickness in the virtual reality group.

      Expected results: a measurable therapeutic improvement produced by the combination of
      relaxation and virtual and its additional effect when compared to the traditional treatment.

      Measurements of variables and therapeutic effects will be carried out with psychometric
      measures.

      The creation process of the relaxing virtual environments has already been completed. The
      virtual environments are ready for use.

      The apparatus needed and in our possession include:

        -  A laptop for generating virtual environments

        -  A stereoscopic display

        -  Apparatus for physiological measurements
