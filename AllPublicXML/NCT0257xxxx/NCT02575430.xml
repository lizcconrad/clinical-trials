      To evaluate the natural history of visual function in subjects with IRD phenotypically
      diagnosed as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) or retinitis pigmentosa (RP) caused by RPE65 or
      LRAT gene mutations.

    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, uncontrolled, multicenter, case history study to determine the
      natural history of visual function in patients with IRD phenotypically diagnosed as LCA or RP
      caused by autosomal recessive mutation in RPE65 or LRAT.

      Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled in this study at approximately 12 study centers in Canada,
      the US and Europe.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects aged 8 or older with IRD (LCA or RP) caused by inherited
             autosomal recessive mutation in either RPE65 or LRAT.

          -  Subjects who have at least 2 documented kinetic visual field assessments of the same
             isopter(s) in at least one eye performed at least 2 years apart on the same type of
             equipment when the subject was between the ages of 6 and 65 years.

          -  If applicable, subjects who provide informed consent for the study (the requirement
             for informed consent may be applicable to all sites or may be waived by the IRB and/or
             local regulations). The parent or guardian must sign an approved informed consent form
             for the study for subjects younger than the age of majority.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects, who in the Investigator's opinion, have any severe acute or chronic medical
             condition, psychiatric condition, physical examination finding or laboratory
             abnormality that may interfere with the interpretation of their visual function data.

          -  Subjects with concomitant bilateral ocular disorders that may affect visual acuity or
             visual fields (e.g., advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic
             neuropathy, advanced cataract, intraocular surgery).
