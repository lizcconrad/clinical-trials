      This is a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to study efficacy
      and safety of the Viaskin® Milk Patch for children with milk induced Eosinophilic Esophagitis
      (EoE). 20 subjects will be randomized 3:1 to Viaskin® Milk or placebo patch.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to study the efficacy and safety
      of Viaskin® Milk, an allergen extract of milk administered epicutaneously using the Viaskin®
      epicutaneous delivery system (EPIT) in subjects from 4 to 17 years old with a milk induced
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio into two different
      treatment groups, to receive EPIT with Viaskin® Milk (500 µg of milk proteins) or placebo.

      Subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period (approximately 11 months), will
      automatically rollover into an open label treatment period (additional 11 months). All
      subjects will receive the 500 µg (micrograms) Viaskin Milk patch.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in maximum esophageal eosinophil count from baseline to end of double-blind treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to month 11</time_frame>
    <description>Esophageal biopsy samples will be obtained prior to randomization and after completion of treatment. Intraepithelial eosinophils will be counted in all high powered fields (HPFs) using light microscopy. A HPF will be counted only if at least half of the field is occupied by tissue. The maximum eosinophil count per HPF will be reported for each esophageal biopsy site (at each of 2 levels).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eosinophilic Esophagitis symptom score between baseline and end of each treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of treatment at month 11 and month 22</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of Eosinophilic Esophagitis range from abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting, and difficult swallowing. The symptoms will range from none to very severe as in Spergel54. The symptoms will be in 3 categories and individual symptoms and total symptoms scores will be collected on a range of 0-4 (0-none, 1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe and 4-very severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Esophageal Endoscopy Score between baseline and end of each treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of treatment at month 11 and month 22</time_frame>
    <description>Upper endoscopies with biopsies (2 each of proximal and distal, plus any inflamed areas) will be completed before and after each treatment period. Each endoscopy will be scored using a validated standardized measure which examines 4 major esophageal features (rings, furrows, exudates and edema) and the presence of minor features of narrow caliber esophagus, feline esophagus, stricture and crepe paper esophagus. Each feature is graded: 0-none, 1 mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Eosinophilic Esophagitis Quality of Life (QOL) Score between baseline and end of each treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of treatment at month 11 and month 22</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is a measurement of a subject's overall well-being. QOL will be measured by the validated age specific PedsQL Eosinophilic Esophagitis tool. The 33-item questionnaire includes for self-rating of symptoms (chest/throat/stomach pain and nausea/vomiting, trouble swallowing), Treatment, Worry (about treatment and disease), Communication with others, Food and Eating (allergies and limitations), Food Feelings (emotions associated with food allergies). The format is a Likert response scale, with higher scores indicating better HRQOL and lower EoE symptoms and problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to development symptoms after milk reintroduction (month 9) until the end of each treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Month 9 and Month 20</time_frame>
    <description>Milk will be reintroduced to all subjects 9 months after the second endoscopy in a similar amount and duration as done during the screening period while the subject is on a proton pump inhibitor. A daily symptom diary will be completed by subjects to record dietary information, symptoms and medications or treatment taken for symptoms.</description>

             and currently following a strict milk-free diet.

          -  Upper endoscopy and biopsy at initial clinical evaluation during Visit 2 showing
             greater than 15 eosinophils/HPF isolated to the esophagus meeting the consensus
             diagnosis of Eosinophilic Esophagitis, after milk was re-introduced into the subject's
             diet (30 ml/day for 1 week to 2 months), while the subject was on proton pump
             inhibitor.

          -  Upper endoscopy and biopsy at second clinical evaluation during Visit 3 showing less
             than 5 eosinophils per HPF isolated to the esophagus after a minimum of 6 weeks under
             milk-free diet, and while the subject is on proton pump inhibitor.

          -  Negative pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential. Females of
             childbearing potential must use effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy
             and agree to continue to practice an acceptable method of contraception for the
             duration of participation in the study. Sexual abstinence will be accepted as an
