  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to provide a more complete characterization and understanding of the genetic
      causes of and tumor DNA detection potential in colorectal cancer. Ultimately findings of this
      study will be used to develop early detection tests for colorectal cancer that are minimally
      invasive (based on a blood test). It is hoped that reliable, minimally invasive, early
      detection methods will lead to improved screening rates, increased screening safety, longer
      colorectal cancer survival, and overall cost savings.

      In order to assess the test's ability to detect tumor DNA, 25 participants with known
      colorectal cancer who will be undergoing surgical resection of the colon as part of their
      clinical care will be recruited. The investigators will collect blood from participants prior
      to surgery, tumor and normal tissue removed during surgery, a series of blood samples after
      surgery for up to one year and relevant medical records. DNA variants identified in blood
      will be compared against tissue samples. Serial samples will be analyzed to assess the
      variance in amount of circulating tumor DNA across time with standard treatment.
