  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, prospective study to evaluate the prognostic significance of
      renal and bladder ultrasound with ureteral jet assessment and its utility to evaluate the
      spontaneous stone passage rate of ureteral stones.

    <description>Study ultrasound with ureteral jet assessment will be obtained after CT diagnosis of ureteral calculus is made. Ureteral jet data will be documented and patients will be followed prospectively for 42 days for spontaneous stone passage or need for surgical intervention.</description>

    <intervention_name>renal and bladder ultrasound with ureteral jet assessment</intervention_name>
    <description>The number of jets from each ureteral orifice will be tabulated over time so that ureteral jet frequency, defined as number of jets per minute, can be calculated. Patients will be categorized into three groups. Group I- no ureteral jets on the symptomatic side; Group II- continuous low-level ureteral jet on the symptomatic side; Group III- ureteral jets similar to nonsymptomatic side.</description>
