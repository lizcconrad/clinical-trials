  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose fluctuations present not only in patients with diabetes mellitus but also in subjects
      with normal glucose tolerance or impaired glucose regulation. People with Growth
      Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome are at risk of impaired glucose
      metabolism. Glycemic variability is poorly studied in the nondiabetic individuals. The aim of
      the study is to investigate the characteristics of glucose fluctuations in the newly
      diagnosed Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome individuals.

    <textblock>
      Glucose fluctuations present not only in patients with diabetes mellitus but also in subjects
      with normal glucose tolerance or impaired glucose regulation. Compared with traditional
      monitoring methods, continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS) techniques provides a much
      more detailed understanding of shifting blood glucose levels throughout the day.It is
      considered reliable to evaluate glucose variability not only in patients with diabetes but
      also in nondiabetic individuals.

      People with Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome are at risk of
      impaired glucose metabolism and developing diabetes mellitus.Some researchers have shown that
      15-30% Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma are suffering from diabetes, 15-36%
      impaired glucose regulation. The rate of Cushing Syndrome individuals is 10-30% and 40-45%
      separately.

      Glycemic variability is poorly studied in the nondiabetic individuals and has not been
      studied in the newly diagnosed Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing
      Syndrome individuals. In this study CGM was used to dynamically monitor patients being newly
      diagnosed with Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma and Cushing Syndrome.
