      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind , placebo-controlled trail to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone for treating opioid-induced constipation
      in patients with advanced illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methylnaltrexone is a quaternary derivative of the pure opioid antagonists naltrexone. It is
      fairly lipid soluble and readily cross the blood-brain barrier. This property provides
      methylnaltrexone with the potential to block the undesired side-effects of opioid pain
      medications predominantly mediated by receptors located peripherally while sparing opioid
      effects mediated at receptors in the central nervous system, most importantly analgesia.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind , placebo-controlled trail to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone for treating opioid-induced constipation
      in patients with advanced illness. The randomization schedule was used to assign patients in
      a 2:1 ratio to multicenter or an equal volume of placebo administered subcutaneously on
      alternate days for 2 weeks. The clinical trail was estimated to enroll 180 patients totally.
