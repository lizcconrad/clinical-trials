      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the superiority of the fixed triple therapy with
      BDP/FF/GB at a daily dose of 400/24/50 mcg respectively with that of Ultibro® Breezhaler®
      (DPI), fixed combination of indacaterol 85 mcg and of glycopyrronium 43 mcg in COPD patients.

      Outpatients attending the hospital clinics/study centres will be recruited. Patients with
      severe and very severe COPD airflow obstruction according to GOLD 2014 criteria. A total of
      approximately 2192 patients will need to be screened in order to obtain 1534 (767 per arm)
      randomized and evaluable patients. Approximately 200 sites will be involved worldwide.

      Each patient will perform a total of 8 clinic visits (V0 to V7) during the study.

      The Primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of CHF 5993 pMDI over Ultibro® in
      terms of moderate and severe COPD exacerbation rate over 52 weeks of treatment.

      The Secondary objectives are:

        1. To evaluate the effect of CHF 5993 pMDI on other lung function parameters, patient's
           health status and clinical outcome measures;

        2. To assess the safety and the tolerability of the study treatments.

      A 2-week open-label run-in period under Ultibro® followed by a 52-week randomised treatment
      period.

      The trial design will be optimised to measure exacerbation rates by using the Exacerbations
      of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT), developed means of collecting patient-reported
      outcome (PRO) data, which helps to capture the frequency of exacerbations.
