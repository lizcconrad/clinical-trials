  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Poor spinal anaesthesia block is common and is difficult to manage; so a
      technique to minimize its incidence is advisable. Hypotension is the commonest problem with
      spinal anesthesia. Multiple trials to prevent or combat hypotension using positional changes,
      fluid therapy and the use of vasopressors were tried. However, the drug choice and mode of
      administration as either bolus or infusion is still a matter of debate.

      Objectives: To compare the outcome of spinal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl
      separately to standard injection of mixed fentanyl with hyperbaric bupivacaine.

      Design: A randomized, controlled clinical trial.

      Setting: Single medical center from 5/2013 to 10/2014.

      Patients &amp; Methods: 124 parturient scheduled for elective cesarean section (CS) were randomly
      allocated into two groups, each 62 parturient: Group M received spinal anesthesia using 10 mg
      bupivacaine 0.5% premixed with 25 µg fentanyl in the same syringe and Group S received 25 µg
      fentanyl in one syringe and 10 mg bupivacaine 0.5% without barbotage in a second syringe.
      Intravenous fluid co-load with 15 ml/kg warm lactated ringer solution was started as fast
      drip during, and continued after spinal anesthesia.

      Patients were monitored for hemodynamic parameters, time of sensory onset and height of
      maximum sensory block, lower limb motor blockade was scored using modified Bromage scale and
      the frequency of side effects.
