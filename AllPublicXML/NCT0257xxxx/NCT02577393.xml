    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted this phase II study of EGCG therapy protection of the esophagus
      from damage induced by radiotherapy. In order to observe the effectiveness of EGCG,
      esophageal toxicity was recorded weekly using a grading scale based on symptomatology,
      following the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring system. Patient-reported pain
      related to esophagitis was measured using the numerical rating scale (NRS) every week from
      EGCG application to 2 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. The scales are translated into
      Chinese and guides in Chinese are developed instructing how to use the scales and perform the
      assessments.

    <description>EGCG (purity≥95% by high pressure liquid chromatography; from Ningbo HEP Biotech Co., Ltd) is dissolved in 0.9% saline solution three times a day. A new batch is made up each time. For esophageal application, repeated swallowing of 10 ml of the EGCG solution is indispensable to assure the prolonged presence of drug the esophageal walls. We choose a dose of 440 lmol/L as the recommended concentration for this study by referring to our previous phase I study. Immediately at the beginning of radiotherapy, the EGCG solution is given until two weeks after radiotherapy completed. Steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, local anesthetics, or other antibiotic/antifungal therapy are not given unless esophagitis progressed to grade 4.</description>
