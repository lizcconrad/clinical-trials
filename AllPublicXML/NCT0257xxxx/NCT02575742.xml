  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason chronic constipation (CC) becomes commoner with age is not fully understood. New
      studies suggest that bowel contraction patterns, dietary fibre and gut bacteria are important
      and may differ in older people. Since CC reduces quality of life and is a major reason why
      elderly are admitted to hospitals and residential care, there is a need to understand how
      these factors change with age.

      Currently, placing a pressure sensing catheter inside the large intestine (pancolonic
      manometry) is the gold standard way to measure how well it contracts. However this involves a
      camera test (colonoscopy) which is invasive with risks of bowel perforations (~80/100,000).
      The risk is higher with age (64-80yr: ~90/100,000; 80+yrs: ~120/100,000), making it unethical
      for elderly.

      A technique called the 3D-Transit System has been developed, involving a small ingestible
      capsule, containing a 'trackable' electromagnet. By tracking movements of the capsule
      swallowed by participants, it provides precise detailed information on the capsule
      progression inside the whole gut and large bowel's contractile activity in real-time. It is
      minimally-invasive and radiation-free, making it possible to assess elderly for the first
      time.

      This study aims to assess how bowel contraction patterns, dietary fibre intake and gut
      bacteria differ between young and older adults (with and without CC), to better understand
      why CC is more common in elderly.

      It is a pilot, 4 arm, single centre, observational study involving 60 women aged 18-40 years
      and 70-90 years (15 non-constipated and 15 with CC for each age group). The study lasts 3
      weeks, containing 2 weeks of run-in period and 1 week of study period.

      The four groups participants will be asked to: swallow 2 capsules to assess their large
      bowel's contractile function using the 3D-transit system; provide stool samples to analyses
      their gut bacteria; and complete questionnaires to assess their gastrointestinal symptoms.
