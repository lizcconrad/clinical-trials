  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type II Diabetes Mellitus patients having surgery who adhere to their regular scheduled
      metformin dosing and take this medication on the morning of surgery will have better glycemic
      control peri-operatively and potentially suffer less morbidity compared to individuals taking
      a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peri-operative hyperglycemia has been linked to numerous negative adverse consequences,
      including wound infection, impaired wound healing, endothelial dysfunction, neurocognitive
      dysfunction, sepsis, prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. This has been shown in
      numerous studies as outlined in our detailed research proposal. The peri-operative period
      includes a timeframe ranging from 12 to 72 hours around the time of surgery according to
      definition. Our study is examining glycemic control in the peri-operative period which we are
      defining as approximately 48 hours around the time of surgery. The majority of the patients
      with type II diabetes take oral medications, such as metformin, to control their blood sugar.
      These patients have historically held their doses on the day of the surgery to avoid possible
      low blood sugar and lactic acidosis while fasting. However, numerous recent studies have
      shown that individuals who are fasting without renal, heart and liver failure are safe to
      take metformin. The most recent guidelines from the American diabetes association suggest
      that patients should take their dose of metformin on the day of surgery. Despite these
      recommendations most anesthesiologists continue to withhold metformin on the day of surgery,
      as no studies exist to show the benefit of continuing metformin. If we are able to show that
      patients taken metformin have better glycemic control during this time we can extrapolate
      that result mean they may have a lower incidence of the consequences linked to poor glycemic
      control.
