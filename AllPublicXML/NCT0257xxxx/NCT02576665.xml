    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate changes in immune activity relative to baseline
      following treatment with Toca 511 and Toca FC in patients with solid tumors (including
      recurrent high grade glioma [rHGG]) or lymphoma. This is a multicenter, open-label study of
      Toca 511 and Toca FC. Patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma, for whom curative
      options are not available, will be enrolled into the study, subject to all entry criteria.
      Tumors must be accessible to biopsy and/or resection. Patients will be qualified based on the
      presence of specific molecular characteristics, documented by Foundation Medicine (or
      equivalent) genomic profile report, and specific tumor types.

      Toca 511 will be administered by IV injection followed by (1) intratumoral injection
      following biopsy or (2) injection into the resection cavity wall following planned resection
      in the case of rHGG or brain metastases. Toca FC will be administered orally in cycles of
      therapy.

      Patients not undergoing resection of brain tumors will undergo 2 biopsies to allow assessment
      of baseline and follow-up immune activity in the tumor. Changes in immune activity in
      peripheral blood will be measured in all patients.

                  (such as ≥ Grade 2 dyspnea, according to CTCAE 4.03).

               -  Any other disease, either metabolic or psychological, that as per Investigator
                  assessment may affect the patient's compliance or place the patient at an
                  increased risk of potential treatment complications.
