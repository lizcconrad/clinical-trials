  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of different doses of
      SBRT given before prostatectomy. Depending when participants enter the study, they will be
      treated with either 5 or 6 gray (Gy) per day of radiation. A Gy is a measure of radiation
      dose. The standard dose is 10Gy per day when SBRT is the only treatment to the prostate and
      no surgery is planned. The researchers want to see which dose of radiation will work best
      with the least amount of side effects. About 4-6 weeks after SBRT, participants will have a
      prostatectomy.

    <description>Acute dose-limiting toxicity and quality of life due to preoperative SBRT followed by robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy at 14 ± 5 days and 28 ± 5 days post-prostatectomy in high risk prostate cancer patients. In order to assess the toxicity of preoperative SBRT, the severity of specific events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4 form where a score of ≥3 is considered dose-limiting.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Assessed Changes in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) - Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Administered prior to SBRT, and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months and then every 3 months up to 18 months post-prostatectomy. The 26-item, short-form version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a validated questionnaire used to assess HRQOL in prostate cancer patients. EPIC includes 4 domains: urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal. There are summary, i.e., overall, scores and function and bother subscale scores for each of the 4 domains. The urinary domain has 2 additional subscales: incontinence and irritative/obstructive. Domains and subscales are scored using a 0-100 grading system, with a higher score indicating a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Assessed Changes in HRQOL - International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Administered prior to SBRT, and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months and then every 3 months up to 18 months post-prostatectomy. The IPSS will be used to assess changes in urinary toxicity. Scoring is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 per question, Total IPSS Score out of 35 points from 7 questions. Descriptive summaries of scores at baseline and each subsequent follow up will include means and standard deviations.</description>

    <description>Administered prior to SBRT, and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months and then every 3 months up to 18 months post-prostatectomy. The RAS will be used to assess changes in rectal toxicity. Scoring is 0, 1, 2, 3 per question, Total RAS Score out of 15 points from 5 questions. Descriptive summaries of scores at baseline and each subsequent follow up will include means and standard deviations.</description>
