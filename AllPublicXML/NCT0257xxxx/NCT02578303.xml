  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a sleep-disordered breathing characterized by the
      occurrence of repeated upper airway obstructions leading to airflow reduction (hypopnea) or
      cessation (apnea). The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the number of apneas and hypopneas per
      hour of sleep. OSA patients often report cognitive complaints.

      About 25% of the elderly population is affected by this syndrome with a drastic increase of
      this rate among dementia patients. OSAS is considered to be an important risk factor for the
      development of hypertension, heart disease and stroke.

    <textblock>
      Numerous studies pointed out the close relationship between sleep apnea and cognitive
      impairment. To the investigators' knowledge, no trials have assessed the existence of a
      relationship between the IAH index and the cerebral arterial blood flow rate
      (macrocirculation). Developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide new insights
      into the quantitative study of blood flow through phase contrast MRI also called &quot;flow MRI&quot;.
      The main hypothesis tested in this study is the existence of a relationship between OSAS and
      total cerebral arterial vascular inflow measured by PC-MRI (in mL/min) in the elderly
      population.

        -  Primary outcome: The apnea/hypopnea index (measured by nocturnal respiratory polygraphy)
           and total arterial flow rate (measured by PC-MRI)

        -  Secondary outcomes:

             1. Measurement of arrhythmia

             2. Measurement of arterial blood pressure
