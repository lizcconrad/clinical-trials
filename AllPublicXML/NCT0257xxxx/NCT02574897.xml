    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized trial will evaluate whether providing clinicians with daily
      reports from a well-validated, standardized, patient-centered electronic symptom survey tool
      (PRO-CTCAE) improves symptom burden in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. Adult
      inpatients at UNC undergoing high-dose chemotherapy for preparative chemotherapy prior to
      stem cell infusion. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms: (1) a control arm
      with standard of care daily clinician interviews or (2) standard of care plus daily
      electronic symptom surveys, the results of which will be sent to clinicians electronically.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare peak symptom burden between the two study
      arms (autologous transplant vs. allogeneic transplant). Peak symptom burden will also be
      compared between the two study arms within both subgroups of patients (myeloablative vs.
      reduced intensity conditioning). Secondary outcomes that will also be compared between the
      two arms include: changes in patient-reported quality of life, time to supportive care
      treatment changes, length of hospital stay, thirty day readmission rate after discharge, days
      alive and out of the hospital in the 100 days since admission, and overall survival.
      Additionally, measures of physical activity will be captured through physiological monitoring
      in order to explore associations with patient-reported symptom measures. Patient and
      clinician satisfaction will also be evaluated.

      In this study, the investigators will use an electronic survey to assess 16 patient-reported
      symptoms to calculate a symptom score that may range from 0-61 each day. This symptom score
      represents the symptom burden for the patient on that particular day. Symptom burden is
      anticipated to peak between days 7 and 14, so the investigators will define peak symptom
      burden as the average of the symptom scores on days 7, 10 and 14. In both arms, symptoms will
      be assessed on these days in order to compare peak burden.

    <description>Peak symptom burden is defined as the average symptom score on chemotherapy days+7, +10, and +14 (relative to transplant day 0) as measured by the PRO-CTCAE. There are 16 items on the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. Fifteen items are worth 0-4 points each and one item is worth 0-1 point. This translates to a symptom score range of 0-61 per day, which will be averaged over the three days. The outcome is the comparison of average peak symptom burden scores between the two groups.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention arm will fill out the daily PRO-CTCAE electronic symptom survey. The intervention consists of sending the results of the surveys in the intervention arm to the clinical care team. The four symptom-specific PROMIS subsets (Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, and Sleep Disturbance) will be filled out weekly while patients are admitted to the hospital. Patients will again complete the 6 minute walk distance testing, HRQoL surveys, and PASS assessment at the time of discharge. Patients in the intervention arm will complete a satisfaction survey at discharge. HRQoL (by mail) and PASS (by telephone) will be assessed for a third time 30 days after discharge.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control arm will only fill out the symptom survey at the time of admission and days 7, 10, and 14. The results of symptom surveys from the patients in the control arm will not be sent to providers, but will be used for data analysis purposes only.
