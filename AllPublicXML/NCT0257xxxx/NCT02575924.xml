      In this study the suitability of two -sequential and single step- commercially available
      culture media from the same brand was compared. The aim of such study is to verify whether is
      possible to improve the efficiency of infertility treatments in those couples who usually
      have a high cycle cancellation rate, such as poor responder patients and severe male
      infertility. The study population is composed of couples attending the fertility clinic: to
      this purpose all those couples approaching IVF treatments with a diagnosis of OAT,
      cryptozoospermia, advanced maternal age and women with a &quot;poor responder&quot; diagnosis were
      recruited. IVF treatments were randomly set to be cultured either with two-step sequential
      media or with one-step media to acquire data concerning the ongoing embryo culture
      development and clinical outcomes.

      The final goal in the field of Assisted Reproductive Technology is to obtain a single healthy
      newborn. For that purpose, a lot of factors are strictly interconnected each other's and have
      to be carefully evaluated. The choice of embryo culture system and of embryo selection
      strategy plays a crucial role in obtain and identify the embryo with the highest implantation
      potential. One really important key factor is the choice of the culture media. Currently,
      there are numerous commercially available culture media showing very different compositions.
      Essentially two strategies have been applied for the design of culture media: 1) &quot;Back to
      nature&quot; for sequential media, based on the physiology of the embryo and the measured
      concentration of substances present in its natural environment and 2) &quot;Let the embryo choose&quot;
      for single step media, where none a priori assumption of the concentration of a component is
      made. In the literature, there are a lot of studies analyzing the effect of culture media on
      human preimplantation embryos development and comparing biological and clinical outcomes
      among different media compositions. Several studies performed a comparison about the
      development of human zygotes in either a one-step or two-step culture system. Usually there
      were no significant differences between the two culture media systems regarding biological or
      clinical outcomes. Anyway, a greater number of blastocysts were generally obtained by the
      continuous single medium culture if compared with sequential culture media, even if the
      implantation and clinical pregnancy rates are comparable.
