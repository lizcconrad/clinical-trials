  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anembryonic pregnancy is a leading cause of early miscarriage. The American Pregnancy
      Association estimates that blighted ovum causes approximately 50 percent of all
      first-trimester miscarriages. About 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage.

      In general, there are 3 options for management of anembryonic pregnancy: expectant, medical,
      and surgical management. Expectant management consists of no intervention and awaiting
      natural passage of tissue. Medical management uses medication to expel uterine tissue.
      Surgical management is defined by mechanical removal of tissue from the uterus.

      Medical management allows patients to avoid surgery and anesthesia. Patients may also feel
      that medical management is more private, and under their control. Several medications have
      been studied for medical management.

      Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is a uterotonic that results in cervical softening
      and contractions that expel the products of conception. It may be administered vaginally,
      orally, buccally, or sublingually. Adverse effects vary based on route of administration.

      There is published literature on a wide range of therapeutic misoprostol regimens. Optimal
      dose and route of administration of misoprostol have not been determined by randomized
      trials. Overall, misoprostol is safe and well-tolerated.

      Patients receiving misoprostol vaginally rather than orally have decreased adverse
      gastrointestinal effects and prolonged duration of action.

      Oral misoprostol is less effective than vaginal misoprostol in emptying the uterus.
      Sublingual misoprostol is equivalent to vaginal misoprostol in inducing complete uterine
      emptying but is associated with more frequent diarrhea.

      When compared with lower dosages, a dose of 800 µg vaginal misoprostol is more effective at
      completing uterine emptying, although it results in a similar incidence of nausea. Based on
      international trials in settings with limited resources, WHO recommends a single vaginal dose
      of 800 µg misoprostol for medical management of anembryonic pregnancy. Routes of misoprostol
      administration include oral, vaginal, buccal or rectal. Vaginal misoprostol is associated
      with a greater overall exposure to the drug and greater effects on the cervix and uterus.

      Isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) is a drug used principally in the treatment of angina pectoris,
      which acts by dilating the blood vessels so as to reduce blood pressure.
