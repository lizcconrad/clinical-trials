    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 66 end-stage renal disease patients who
      underwent high-efficiency hemodiafiltration technique in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital
      between 2001-2013 to determine the survival rate as well as other long-term outcome.

      Growing evidences suggested the superiority of high-efficiency hemodiafiltration (HDF) which
      could provide both diffusion and convection in a single therapy compared with the
      conventional hemodialysis. However, the long-term, upto 10 years, outcome still limited. This
      retrospective cohort study was conducted in 66 end-stage renal disease patients who underwent
      high-efficiency hemodiafiltration technique in a single-center, King Chulalongkorn Memorial
      Hospital, between 2001-2013 to determine the survival rate as well as other long-term outcome

    <description>Survival differences between groups will be evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The comparative groups include:
Patient who start renal replacement therapy with HDF (incident cases) vs. who switched from hemodialysis (prevalence cases)
Diabetic vs. Non-diabetic patients</description>
