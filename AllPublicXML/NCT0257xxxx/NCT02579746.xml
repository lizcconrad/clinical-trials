    <textblock>
      The study examined the feasibility of the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension with Sodium
      (Na) Reduction for Chinese Canadian (DASHNa-CC) intervention and its potential effects on
      blood pressure, health-related quality of life, and health service utilization. Half of
      participants received usual care while the other half received the DASHNa-CC intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension has been identified as the most important risk factor for cardiovascular
      diseases and accounts for a large proportion of stroke, myocardial infarction and heart
      failure in the Chinese population. While unhealthy diet has been identified as a modifiable
      risk factor for hypertension, there is a lack of culturally sensitive dietary intervention
      targeting Chinese Canadians. The 8-week DASHNa-CC intervention incorporated Dietary Approach
      to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, sodium reduction with the food therapy of Traditional
      Chinese Medicine, and included an intervention manual, two sessions of classroom instruction
      delivered in Mandarin, and a 20-minute telephone follow-up.
