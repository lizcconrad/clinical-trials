  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia in pregnancy is associated with maternal anaemia, low
      birth-weight and increased perinatal mortality. Whilst continuous prophylaxis is difficult to
      implement, intermittent presumptive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) has proved to be practical
      and effective. In PNG, pregnant women currently receive IPTp using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine,
      however, this therapy has the potential to be compromised by parasite resistance.

      The aim of the present trial is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      efficacy of azithromycin (AZI) plus piperaquine (PQ) given as IPTp to pregnant Papua New
      Guinea women. The study will comprise of two sub-studies:

      (i) A safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic study of AZI-PQ in pregnancy. (ii) A safety,
      tolerability and preliminary efficacy study of AZI-PQ in pregnancy.

    <time_frame>42 days intensive follow-up, final end-point at 2 weeks post delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of azithromycin plus piperaquine for the prevention of malaria infection during pregnancy will be investigated in 120 women. Women will be randomized to receive either (i) 3 daily doses of AZI plus PQ, or, (ii) single dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine Participants will be actively followed for a period of 42 days (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after treatment). At each follow-up time point the participant will have a clinical examination, fundal height measurement and assessment of foetal lie, perform a symptoms questionnaire, blood film for malaria and other scheduled safety tests (eg. Hb, glucose, ultrasound). A single blood sample for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected at Day 4. At delivery all participants and their babies will be assessed, including blood sample for Hb, glucose, blood spot for PCR, cord blood and maternal blood. Breast milk samples will be collected for 2 weeks (Day 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14) after the establishment of lactation.</description>
