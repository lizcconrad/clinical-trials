      This study, which will be conducted at 23 sites representing the determined NUTS-1 regions in
      Turkey, in which all patients who were admitted to clinic or were hospitalized with Heart
      Failure (Acute or Chronic) diagnosis will be enrolled into the study, for a month and on a
      day of the week which will be determined by the site itself, is a national, multi-center,
      observational, epidemiological and cross-sectional study. This study is a local study which
      is planned to be conducted only in Turkey. Included patients of the study will be clinically
      evaluated by the physicians who are maintaining them and will receive the standard medical
      treatment which is determined by their physicians in normal life conditions. No experimental
      intervention or treatment will be received by patients in relation to the enrollment to this
      study. Therefore, this study does not contain a protocol or a pre-determined visit flowchart.
      However, patients with Heart Failure diagnosis should grant their consent to the
      retrospective utilization of their data and questions which will be asked to them about their
      disease history. Provided that the study's design is non-pharmacological observational,
      investigators will treat and follow the patients in accordance with their own medical
      decisions and their best clinical experiences.

      STUDY DESIGN STEPS

      1. The steps described below will be taken in accordance with ICD code for acute and chronic
      heart failure patients with a verified heart failure diagnosis:

        -  Verification of patient's heart failure diagnosis according to ICD code.

        -  In order to include the patient to the study, signing of the consent form.

        -  Documentation of patient demographics, medical history, heart failure history,
           co-morbidities and risk factors.

        -  Prospective recording of findings of physical examination.

        -  Retrospective recording of results related to diagnostic methods (biochemistry, blood
           count and others).

        -  Determination of NYHA classification.

        -  Determination of pathophysiology and etiology.

        -  Recording treatment patterns.

        -  Inspection of patient's device usage status (pacemaker, ICD, CRT, LVAD,
           transplantation).

        -  Inspection of hospitalization rates.

      SELFIE-HF study starting date is planned as month September of 2015 and it is planned that
      the physicians will execute study enrollment on an allocated day of the week for 4 weeks. It
      is also planned that the data collected on months October and November will be inspected and
      listed and patients will be contacted by phone after 1 year after enrolment date in order to
      inquire about survival status. Therefore, estimated termination date of the study, with
      patient follow-up calls, is planned to be the last quarter of 2016.

        In 23 designated sites, for a month on a day which will be determined by the site itself,
        patients who have been admitted to the clinic or hospitalized with Heart Failure (Acute and
        Chronic) diagnosis will be enrolled into the study. Target population of the study is the
        acute and chronic heart failure patients who will consult to the hospital on the related
        day of the week for a month which is determined by sites.
