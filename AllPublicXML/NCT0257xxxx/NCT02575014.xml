  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity of
      preoperative HBOT in patients undergoing a pancreaticoduodenal resection for premalignant and
      malignant tumors of the common bile duct, periampullary and duodenum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with premalignant and malignant tumors of the common bile duct,
      periampullary and duodenum will be screened for eligibility within 4 weeks of their scheduled
      surgery. Initiation of therapy is defined as the first day of HBOT for patients receiving
      HBOT therapy (Arm A) and the day of surgery for patients not receiving HBOT (Arm B). Patients
      will be considered &quot;enrolled into study&quot; once the consent form has been signed, all screening
      procedures have been undertaken and all the eligibility criteria are met. The fifty eligible
      patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio the same day of the screening process. The
      eligible subjects undergoing HBOT will be treated with up to 2.4 Atmospheres Absolute (ATA)
      of oxygen (O2), for a maximum of 90 minutes each day with or without air breaks, as deemed
      necessary by the investigator, for two days. Patients who are deemed ineligible will receive
      the same standard of care without any exceptions. The start day of the week to commence HBOT
      will be Monday through Wednesday, as the second and final day of HBOT treatment will be the
      day in which the patient undergoes pancreaticoduodenectomy. The subjects who complete the
      HBOT regimen must undergo subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy within five hours of termination
      of HBOT. If there is more than a five hour delay from completion of the HBOT to commencement
      of operation, the subject will be considered &quot;off study treatment&quot;. However, &quot;off study
      treatment&quot; patients will continue to be followed up every six months for the first thirty
      months, and annually thereafter. During the postoperative period, clinical data and
      questionnaire forms will be collected on day 1, day 3, day 5, and one month (Â± 2 weeks)
      during the first year. As for secondary objectives, the investigators will collect clinical
      data from patients during their follow up visits in the office, by contacting them on the
      phone, or by mailing them the protocol specific questionnaires every 6 months for 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients diagnosed via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine needle aspiration
             (FNA) or CT-guided biopsy with periampullary adenocarcinoma, duodenal cancer,
             premalignant lesions of the pancreas (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia,
             intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm) and cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor)
             undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, 2

          -  One or more comorbidities:

        Diabetes Mellitus Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Cardiac Disease: history of angina,
        myocardial infarction, previous percutaneous cardiac intervention, or cardiac surgery,
        dysrhythmia Peripheral Vascular Disease: history of revascularization or amputation, rest
        pain, or gangrene Neurological Disease: history of stroke with or without residual deficit,
        seizure disorder, transient ischemic attack, hemiplegia, paraplegia, or impaired sensorium
        Dyspnea Bleeding Disorder Metabolic Disease (e.g. BMI â¥ 35) Renal Insufficiency Hepatic
        Insufficiency Another comorbidity that in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient
        compromised

          -  Nutritionally depleted. Albumin level â¤ 3.5 grams/deciliter (g/dL)

          -  Adequate organ function defined as:

        Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500 / (microliter) mcL Platelets &gt;100,000 / mcL Total
        bilirubin &lt;2.5 time upper limits of normal Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / Alanine
        transaminase (ALT) &lt;2.5 times institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine within normal
        institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/ per Cockcroft-Gault equation for
        patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

        - Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of asthma. There is some evidence that the administration of some
             bronchodilators may increase the incidence of gas embolism to the brain through
             pulmonary vasodilation.

          -  Congenital spherocytosis. Increased risk of massive hemolysis.

          -  High grade fever at time of screening (more than 38.5 degree Celsius tend to lower the
             seizure threshold due to oxygen toxicity and may result in the delay of relatively
             routine therapy

          -  Optic neuritis.

          -  Upper respiratory tract infection and viral infection (relative contra-indications due
             to the difficulty such patients may have in clearing their ears and sinuses.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Emphysema with carbon dioxide retention.

          -  Viral infection. There are controversial clinical evidences whether the hyperbaric
             oxygen therapy (HBOT) can be helpful in eliminating viral infections or otherwise
             viral infections may be considerably worsened after HBOT.

          -  Cisplatin therapy (some evidence that this drug retards wound healing when combined
             with HBOT).

          -  Disulphiram therapy. Evidence suggests that this drug blocks the production of
             superoxide dismutase. This may severely affect the body's ability to neutralize oxygen
             free radicals.

          -  Doxorubicin therapy. This chemotherapeutic agent becomes increasingly toxic under
             pressure. Animal studies suggest at least a one-week break between last dose and first
             treatment of HBOT.

          -  Claustrophobia. Some degree of confinement anxiety has been reported.
