        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  NLFs assessed as moderate of severe using the WSRS

          -  Intent to undergo optimal correction of both NLFs

          -  Intent to undergo correction of at least one other wrinkle or fold in the lower face

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject who presents with a severity of wrinkles or folds that require other
             treatments, e.g. laser treatment, chemical peeling, to achieve optimal correction

          -  Subject who presents with severe midface volume loss

          -  Subject who presents with facial hair, e.g. beard, moustache, in the treatment area

          -  Woman who is pregnant or breast feeding or plans to become pregnant during the study

          -  Treatment with chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, immunomodulatory therapy (e.g.
             monoclonal antibodies), systemic or topical (facial) corticosteroids (inhaled
             corticoids are allowed) within three (3) months before study treatment

          -  Previous surgery, including aesthetic facial surgical therapy, liposuction or tattoo,
             in the treatment area

          -  Previous tissue augmenting therapy or contouring with permanent filler or
             fat-injection below the zygomatic arch

          -  Previous tissue augmenting therapy, contouring or revitalisation treatment with non-HA
             filler, e.g. Calcium Hydroxyapatite (CaHa), or Poly L-Lactic Acid (PLLA), below the
             zygomatic arch within 24 months before treatment

          -  Previous tissue augmenting therapy, contouring or revitalisation treatment with
             non-permanent filler below the zygomatic arch within 12 months before treatment

          -  Previous tissue revitalisation treatment with neurotoxin below the zygomatic arch
             within six (6) months before treatment

          -  Previous tissue revitalisation treatment with laser or light, mesotherapy, chemical
             peeling or dermabrasion below the zygomatic arch within six (6) months before
             treatment

          -  Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make
             the subject unsuitable for inclusion (e.g. a chronic, relapsing or hereditary disease
             that may interfere with the outcome of the study)
