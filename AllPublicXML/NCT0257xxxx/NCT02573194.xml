  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decades, changes in the diet and lifestyle have led to overall energy imbalance
      becoming commonplace and the emergence of an obesity epidemic with more than 1.6 billion
      adults being overweight.

      Consumption of foods that can affect appetite by increasing satiety could regulate the total
      energy intake and thus body weight. There is data suggesting that the macronutrient
      composition of the foods and especially protein content may have a potent role on satiety.
      However, the type of protein appears to play a role in satiety possibly due to the different
      balance of the amino acid profile.

      The research project is dedicated to identify the source (animal or plant) and the optimized
      protein quantity needed to accelerate satiation, suppress appetite and extend satiety until
      hunger appears again.

      It is hypothesized that the consumption of animal derived protein-enriched meals will induce
      a reduction in hunger through the impact on gut hormones and peptides that are closely
      related to the short-term regulation of food intake.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in perceived appetite and satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 30 min for 240 min and 60 min throughout the day after each of the four breakfasts which are served at least one week apart (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The appetite profile is assessed using validated Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) ratings (i.e hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective food consumption). The Questionnaires are performed electronically in personal laptops using the Adaptive Visual Analogue Scales (AVAS) software until 240min and in paper form throughout the remaining of the study day.</description>

    <measure>Voluntary energy intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Energy intake is assessed 210 min after the 4 test breakfasts, which are served one week apart.]</time_frame>
    <description>Energy intake is assessed by voluntary hot meal ('Pytt I Panna', Swedish hash) provided 210 min after the test puddings, which are given as breakfast. Subjects are instructed to eat only until they feel comfortable satisfied and are given 25min to consume the meal. The total energy consumed is monitored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetite and Satiety Hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 6 points in time over the morning of each of the 4 test days, which are separated by 1 week (4 weeks)]</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples (2 ml) are collected into edetic acid (EDTA) treated tubes at 0 min (fasted blood sample), 30, 60, 90, 150 and 205 min (i.e. total of 6 samples) over the morning on each test day (separated by 1 week) to quantify the plasma concentrations of circulating appetite regulating hormones and amino acids. Protease inhibitors are added to the samples to reduce protein degradation. All samples are centrifuged at 4 C for 10 min at 2000 g after collection and are separated and stored in cryogenic vials at -80 C.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hedonic Ratings and Palatability of the Test Breakfasts and Meals</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed immediately after consumption of the 4 test puddings and Swedish hash meal (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The palatability and hedonic ratings are assessed using validated Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) ratings (i.e appearance, taste, overall palatability). The Questionnaires are performed electronically in personal laptops using the Adaptive Visual Analogue Scales (AVAS) software.</description>

    <measure>Glucose measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 7 points in time over the morning of each of the 4 test days, which are separated by 1 week (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Capillary blood samples are collected by finger-prick at 0 min (fasted blood sample), 30, 45, 60, 90, 150 and 205 min (i.e. total of 7 samples) over the morning on each test day (separated by 1 week) to quantify the glucose concentration using HemoCue Glucose System.</description>

    <description>In this randomized, within-subject study, subjects are asked to consume 4 iso-energetic and iso-volumetric puddings as breakfast (20% of estimated energy requirements) with varying distribution of protein sources. The objective is to identify the protein source and the distribution on suppressing appetite.</description>
