      AtrioVentricular (AV) and InterVentricular (VV) delay optimization can improve ventricular
      function in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) and is usually performed by means of
      echocardiography. St Jude Medical has developed an automated algorhythm which calculates the
      optimal AV and VV delays (QuickOptTM) based on Intracardiac ElectroGrams, (IEGM), within 2
      minutes. So far, the efficacy of the algorhythm has been tested acutely with standard lead
      position at right ventricular (RV) apex. Aim of this project is to evaluate the algorhythm
      performance in the mid- and long-term with RV lead located in mid-septum.

      Primary end-point was to evaluate the relationship between the series of aortic flow Velocity
      Time Integral (aVTI) values calculated by the two methods at the PV, AV, and VV interval
      settings recommended by both the QuickOptTM and the standard ECHO optimization in CRT-D
      patients, at three index times: pre-discharge, at 6-month and at 12-month follow-ups.

      Secondary end-point was to define the correlation between the optimal AV, PV and VV intervals
      defined by ECHO, using aVTI measurements and by the QuickOptTM algorithm, IEGM-based.
