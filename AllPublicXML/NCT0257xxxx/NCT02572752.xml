        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Healthy male subjects according to the investigators assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG,
             and clinical laboratory tests.

          2. Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

             accordance with GCP and local legislation

          6. Male subjects, who are willing to use a medically acceptable method of contraception
             during the first 3 months after administration of nintedanib. Acceptable methods of
             contraception for use by male volunteers include sexual abstinence, a vasectomy
             performed at least 1 year prior to dosing and barrier contraception (condom).
             Subjects, who are not vasectomised or sexually abstinent have to ensure that an
             additional acceptable method of contraception will be used by his female partner such
             as IUD (intrauterine device), surgical sterilisation (including hysterectomy),
             hormonal contraception (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal
             contraceptives) that started at least 2 months prior to first nintedanib
             administration, or barrier method (e.g. diaphragm with spermicide).

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from

             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

             medication or its excipients)

         11. Intake of drugs with a long half-life (more than 24 h) within 30 days or less than 10
             half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication

         12. Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial

         13. Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication

         14. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

         15. Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

         16. Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day for males)

         17. Drug abuse or positive drug screening

         18. Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

         19. Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

         20. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

         21. Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a

            <groups_desc>An ANOVA model was used on the logarithmic scale in order to compare the Test treatment vs. the Reference treatment (without differentiation between R1 and R2). This model included effects for 'sequence', 'subjects within sequences', 'period' and 'treatment'. For the two 1-sided t-test procedure, the effect 'subjects within sequences' was considered to be random, whereas the other effects were considered to be fixed</groups_desc>
