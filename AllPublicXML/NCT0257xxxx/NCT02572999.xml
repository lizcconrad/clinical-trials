  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study aims to determine the incidence of hospitalization-associated
      disability and its association with risk factors at the patient level and with care and
      hospital processes. For this, patients aged 70 years or older admitted for elective valve
      surgery or elective transcatheter aortic valve implantation or as a result of symptomatic
      moderate to severe valvular heart disease will be consecutively included from 01 October 2015
      to 29 February 2016.
