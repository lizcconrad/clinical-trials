    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II dose-escalation trial of everolimus in combination with lonafarnib in
      Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and progeroid laminopathies (henceforth
      &quot;progeria&quot;). The study will be conducted at a single clinical site utilizing the Clinical and
      Translational Study Unit (CTSU) at Boston Children's Hospital. Lonafarnib will be
      administered at doses previously established in the pediatric population and in this
      population of progeria subjects. This study will first determine the dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus when administered in combination
      with lonafarnib. It will then determine the efficacy of everolimus when administered at its
      MTD in combination with lonafarnib for disease in progeria.
