      This Phase IIIb/IV, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      international, multicenter trial compares the change in disease activity (as assessed by
      Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28] erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) from
      randomization to Week 24 post-randomization, in participants with stable low disease activity
      [LDA] (DAS28 ESR score less than or equal to [&lt;=] 3.2) who receive tocilizumab, and have been
      randomized to either continue or taper prednisone in a double-blinded fashion.
