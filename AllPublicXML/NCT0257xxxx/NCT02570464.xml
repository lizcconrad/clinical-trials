    <textblock>
      Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after
      abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery. It is postulated that aortic cross-clamping during
      open AAA repair may cause ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) leading to the systemic releases of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines which damage distant organs,
      including heart, kidney, and lung.

      Ischemic preconditioning, first described in cardiac surgery, is a mechanism whereby tissues
      exposed to a brief period of nonlethal I/R develop resistance to subsequent ischemic insult.
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), is a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia
      followed by reperfusion in one organ (usually skeletal muscle) provide systemic protection
      from prolonged ischemia. The mechanisms through which RIPC confer organ protection remains
      unclear.

      The hypothesis is that limb RIPC would reduce systemic inflammatory mediators produced by
      ischemia-reperfusion and thereby protect the remote organs.

      A single-center, prospective, randomized, parallel-group controlled trial is conducted on
      patients undergoing elective open infrarenal AAA repair. Written informed consent is obtained
      from each participant. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics
      Committee of Rouen, France.

      Patients are divided in two groups : the sham-operated control group underwent surgery
      without RIPC and the RIPC group : Two cycles of intermittent crossclamping of the common
      iliac artery (right or left) with 10 minutes ischemia followed by 10 minutes reperfusion
      served as the RIPC stimulus, before prolonged ischemia.

      Blood samples are collected for analysis at the following time points: before surgery
      (baseline), 1, 3 and 24 h after cross-clamp release (reperfusion). The systemic inflammatory
      response is measured using the serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, and IL 1, 4, 6, 10.
      Cardiac, renal and pulmonary functions are evaluated with usual biological markers and
      clinical monitoring until 28 days after surgery.

      Aortic surgery is a perfect clinical model of ischemia-reperfusion which makes it possible to
      study the impact of RIPC in humans. This biological approach would help to better understand
      the mechanisms underlying this technique.
