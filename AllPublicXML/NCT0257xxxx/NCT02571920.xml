    <textblock>
      Describe the proportion of patients who underwent cardiac surgery in France and benefiting
      from a monitoring cardiac output, describe the use of positive inotropic and vasoactive
      agents for cardiac surgery patients operated (type of catecholamines, their duration),
      describe the fluid replacement and transfusions of first 24 hours, describe the incidence of
      postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The perioperative management in cardiac surgery patients has changed dramatically in the last
      fifteen years with the development of new cardiac output monitoring devices, the availability
      of new inotropic molecules, and a modern treatment for cardio-circulatory failure.

      However, few studies report the possible changes in practice. The last French national survey
      was conducted in 2001. Since then, the literature is poor on the subject, and the impact of
      new approaches has been only marginally addressed. Recently, a German postal survey was
      conducted among cardiac surgery anesthesiologists, but on purely declarative elements and
      without patient data.

      The investigators offer a type of national prospective observational study to evaluate
      professional practices, morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgical patients. This study must
      include all patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the participating centers during 7 weeks.

      The main objective of this work is to assess the proportion of patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery receiving a cardiac output monitoring.

      Secondary objectives are to describe the relationship between the use of cardiac output
      monitoring and the use of positive inotropic agents and vasoactive (type molecules,
      duration), volume expansion and transfusions the first 24 hours, and the incidence
      postoperative complications for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
