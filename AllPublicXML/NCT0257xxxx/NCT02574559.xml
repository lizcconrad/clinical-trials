    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Completion of Treatment (up to eight weeks), Follow-Up (up to three months post-participation)</time_frame>
    <description>Designed to assess behavior problems in children with developmental difficulties and it consists of 58 items grouped in five subscales (irritability, social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviors, hyperactivity, and inappropriate behavior). The irritability subscale comprises of 15 statements that have been used as an index of Autism Spectrum Disorder-specific disability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Completion of Treatment (up to eight weeks), Follow-Up (up to three months post-participation)</time_frame>
    <description>An instrument to measure non-specific appraised stress which correlates with biological markers like cortisol, immune markers, and depression. It consists of 14 items rated on a 5 point scale (from never to very often) that refer to feelings and thoughts over the past month.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Completion of Treatment (up to eight weeks), Follow-Up (up to three months post-participation)</time_frame>
    <description>A list of 10 statements rated from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) measures psychological acceptance or assent to the reality of a situation (e.g., &quot;it's okay if I remember something unpleasant&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Completion of Treatment (up to eight weeks), Follow-Up (up to three months post-participation)</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report questionnaire of 28 items answered on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;Does not describe me well&quot; to &quot;Describes me very well&quot;. It is considered a measure of empathy as a multidimensional construct that can be factored in four first-order factors, corresponding to the four subscales of the IRI: Perspective Taking, Fantasy (or tendency to transpose into the feelings and actions of fictitious characters in books and movies), Empathic Concern (interpersonal sympathy and concern), and Personal Distress (interpersonal distress).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) Score</measure>
