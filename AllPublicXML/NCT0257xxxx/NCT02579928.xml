  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability and short-term efficacy of a
      single ketamine infusion for the treatment of adolescents with 1) medication-refractory major
      depressive disorder (MDD) and/or 2) medication-refractory anxiety disorders (social anxiety
      disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and/or separation anxiety disorder).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a crossover trial in which as many as 36 adolescents (18 with MDD and 18 with
      anxiety disorders) will be given a single infusion of ketamine (study drug) or midazolam
      (active control). MDD symptoms and anxiety symptoms will be monitored over a two-week period.
      If applicable, comorbid school refusal symptoms will also be monitored over a two-week period
      for both cohorts. A 2-week washout period will be required between infusion doses. Our
      primary outcomes will be 1) improvement in MDD symptoms (measured by Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale, revised (MADRS) score) 1 day after infusion, for the cohort of
      subjects enrolled in the MDD arm of this trial and 2) improvement in the anxiety symptoms
      (measured by the Multimodal Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) acute physical symptoms
      subscale) for the cohort of subjects enrolled in the anxiety disorders arm of the trial.
