      This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the mechanical axis alignment achieved with
      the ATTUNE Single-Use Instrumentation (SUI) as compared to the mechanical axis alignment
      achieved with the ATTUNE Reusable Instrumentation (RUI) in primary cemented Total Knee
      Arthroplasty.

      This study is designed as comparative, sequential, non-randomized, multi-center
      investigation.

      Up to four sites will recruit approximately 88 subjects. Each site is expected to implant the
      ATTUNE primary cemented total knee in approximately 22 subjects. The sequential design
      requires all ATTUNE TKA with reusable instruments be completed before doing any ATTUNE TKA
      with single use instruments.

      The mechanical axis alignment will be assessed at the 3 month follow-up by independent
      radiographic review.

    <description>Mechanical alignment is the angle measured on a hip-to-ankle radiograph that is subtended by a line drawn between the hip center and knee center and a second line drawn between the knee center and the ankle center. Since angles center around &quot;0&quot;, the absolute value of the measured angle will be used for comparisons.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with severely painful and/or severely disabling Non-inflammatory Degenerative
             Joint Disease (NIDJD) resulting from osteoarthritis (OA) or post-traumatic arthritis.

          2. Subject is male or female and between the ages of 22 and 80 years old, inclusive.

          3. Subject requires a primary total knee replacement and is considered by the
             Investigator to be suitable for the specific knee prosthesis identified in the
             protocol.

          4. Subject, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, is suitable for implantation using
             either RUI or SUI instrumentation.

          5. Subject is able to speak and read English to facilitate comprehension of the Informed
             Consent Document.

          6. Subject has given voluntary, written informed consent to participate in this clinical

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The Subject has, in the opinion of the Investigator, a severe deformity that will

             compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.

          3. The Subject has, in the opinion of the Investigator, a flexion deformity that will not
             allow for 0° extension postoperatively.

             treatment outcomes.

          6. The Subject has participated in a clinical investigation with an investigational
             product in the last 3 months.

             unicompartmental, total knee arthroplasty, patellofemoral arthroplasty or ipsilateral
             UTO/HTO) of the affected knee or a previous patellectomy.

          9. The Subject presents with ankylosis of the hip joint on the side to be treated.

         10. The Subject had a contralateral TKA and that knee was previously entered into the
             study.

         11. The Subject requires simultaneous bilateral total knee replacements.

         12. Any case in which Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) or TruMatch (or any other type of
             Custom Patient Instruments) is to be used, or any additional instrumentation are to be
             used for bone resections that are not provided as part of the ATTUNE RUI or SUI
             Instrument kits.
