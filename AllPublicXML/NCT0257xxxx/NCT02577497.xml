  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to show that ventilation heterogeneity identified by
      hyperpolarized helium-3 lung MRI is prevalent children with poorly controlled asthma despite
      guidelines-based treatment with ICS. The secondary objective is to demonstrate whether or not
      eight weeks of treatment with extra-fine particle ICS (HFA-BDP) improves ventilation
      heterogeneity compared to treatment with a coarse particle ICS (fluticasone HFA or dry
      powder).

    <description>VHI = lung defect volume divided by total lung volume. This is a ratio scale that will be measured at four timepoints: enrollment (week 0), end of treatment 1(week 12), start of treatment 2 (week 16), and end of treatment 2 (week 24). The VHI will be compared at the beginning and end of phase 1 and at the beginning and end of phase two using ANOVA based on a mixed-effects model, with fixed effects of sequence, period, and treatment of a random effect of subject within sequence, and baseline covariate.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 17 years

          -  Diagnosis of asthma based on NAEPP3 criteria

          -  Poor asthma control based on one or more of the following criteria:

        an ACT ≤ 19 and/or ACQ ≥ 1.5 units at the screening and/or randomization visits despite
        continuous or intermittent treatment with ICS and/or an anti-leukotriene within six months
        before enrollment.

          -  Any airflow obstruction based on Hankinson et al reference standards: FEV1 % &lt; 80%
             predicted, an FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 90% predicted, and/or an FEF 25-75 &lt; 70% predicted at
             the screening and/or randomization visits.

          -  Frequent severe exacerbations as reflected by ≥ 2 bursts of systemic corticosteroids
             (≥ 3 days each) in the previous 12 months.

          -  Serious exacerbations reflected by at least one hospitalization, ICU stay, or
             mechanical ventilation in the previous 12 months

          -  &quot;Not well controlled&quot; by NAEPP or GINA asthma treatment guidelines

          -  For post-pubertal females, negative urine pregnancy screen and willing if sexually
             active (as counseled by a female study coordinator in private) to using a consistent
             and appropriate method of birth control for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Premature birth &lt; 35 weeks estimated gestational age

          -  Maintenance oral prednisone (defined as daily or alternate day for the past three
             months before screening) or omalizumab treatment for asthma control

          -  Any significant medical condition that might inform maldistribution of ventilation
             apart from asthma including bronchiectasis, cardiac disease, congenital anomalies of
             the respiratory system, neurodevelopmental delay with cognitive impairment, ciliary
             dyskinesia syndromes, immune deficiency, recent lower respiratory infection (within
             six weeks of screen visit). Co-morbidities associated with asthma including sleep
             apnea syndrome, obesity, GERD, and right middle lobe syndrome are not criteria for
             exclusion.

          -  Claustrophobia, inner ear implants, aneurysm or other surgical clips, metal foreign
             bodies in the eye, pacemaker, or other contraindication to MR scanning. Subjects with
             any implanted device that cannot be verified as MRI compliant will be excluded.

          -  Chest circumference greater than that of the helium coil. The circumference of the
             coil is approximately 42 inches.

          -  Inability to understand simple instructions or to hold still for 10 seconds.
