  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether daclizumab impairs the ability of children receiving a kidney
      transplant to elicit a primary immune response. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1
      day, and the target sample size is 82 individuals.

        <title>Number of Participants Who Developed a Positive Antibody Response to KLH and Positive Cellular Responses to Both KLH and TT Immunizations</title>
        <description>Positive antibody response was defined as at least a 2-fold increase in antibody concentration on either Day 43 or Day 57 compared with baseline where baseline was assigned a value of 1 if it was below the limit of quantification. Positive cellular response was defined as an increase in the 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) percent total net of at least 1.5-fold compared with baseline, where baseline was assigned a value of 0.5 if &lt;=0, on at least one time point on Days 22, 29, 43 or 57. All humoral responses were assessed by ELISA and all cellular responses were assessed by BrdU proliferation assay.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Positive Antibody Response to KLH Immunization at Month 6</title>
        <description>Positive antibody response was defined as at least a 2-fold increase in antibody concentration on Month 6 compared with baseline where baseline was assigned a value of 1 if it was below the limit of quantification. All humoral responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Due to the small number of participants enrolled in the study, percentage of participants with positive antibody response to KLH immunization at Month 6 was not reported.</description>
