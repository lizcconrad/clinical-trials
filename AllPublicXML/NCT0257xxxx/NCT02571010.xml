  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate that somatosensory rehabilitation of pain associated with
      static mechanical allodynia has superior efficacy over placebo treatment as well as over
      spontaneous changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocenter study. 45 patients will be enrolled in the study, allocated by
      randomization in 3 arms of 15 patients each.

      During the 38 week duration of the study, enrolled patients will be assessed at:

        -  initial evaluation (first week of the study),

        -  intermediary evaluation for every week and every modification of intensity of pain,

        -  final evaluation at 10 weeks,

        -  follow-up evaluation at 6 months.

          2. Patient not able to participate actively to the rehabilitation exercises for physical
             reason, cognitive reason (ability to understand instructions) or behavioural reason
             (e.g. addiction...);

          3. Patient with complex regional pain syndrome (type I);

          4. Patients for whom cares cannot avoid any touch with allodynia area;

          5. Patient previously treated by a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS);

          9. Allodynia area of the patient presenting with conditions not recommended for
             vibrotactile stimulation: wound, unhealed nerve suture, recent skin transplantation,
             fragile organ such as eye.
