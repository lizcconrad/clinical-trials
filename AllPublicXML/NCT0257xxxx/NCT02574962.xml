    <description>Measured using the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) score. The INCAT scale has upper and lower extremity components (maximum of 5 points for upper (arm disability) and maximum of 5 points for lower (leg disability) that add up to a maximum of 10-points. A score of 0 indicates no problems. A score of 10 indicates person is severely incapacitated.</description>

    <measure>Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The R-ODS is a questionnaire that rates a person's ability to perform 24 daily activities such as eating, using the toilet, taking a shower, dressing, walking, dancing, running, or standing. Scores range from 0-48 with 0 meaning they cannot perform any of the tasks and 48 meaning they can perform all of the tasks without any difficulty.</description>
