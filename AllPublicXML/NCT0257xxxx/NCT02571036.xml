      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (Escalation and Expansion Phases)

        Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible to enroll in the study:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors or hematologic malignancies.
             Eligible patients include the following:

             a) GIST patients must have a KIT and PDGFRA mutation and must have progressed on or
             had an intolerability to at least 1 line of systemic anticancer therapy: i. Patients
             with a pre-existing resistance mutation to an approved line of therapy are eligible.
             For example, imatinib resistant mutations including KIT Exon 17 and PDGFRA D842V.

             b) SM patients must have a confirmed diagnosis (confirmed by a central independent
             pathologist) of advanced SM according to 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria
             for SM and must have documented KIT mutant disease. SM patients must also have a
             normal karyotype.

             Advanced SM includes: ASM, SM-AHN, wherein the AHN does not require immediate
             alternative therapy, such as acute myeloid leukemia. AHNs that are eligible include:
             low grade myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a high SM burden who require treatment
             for SM only, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), MDS/MPN, and HES/CEL], and MCL i.
             Patients with advanced SM must present with at least 1 eligible C-Finding (organ
             damage) as outlined in Table 3 of the 2013 International Working
             Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) &amp; European
             Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) consensus response criteria (Appendix 10.5);
             please see below for MCL exception) (#iii).

             ii. Patients with imatinib-sensitive KIT mutations must have progressed on or were
             intolerant to a tryosine kinase inhibitor.

             iii. Patients with histopathologically-confirmed MCL without a C-finding are eligible.

             iv. Patients with symptomatic SSM are eligible. By definition, SSM patients must have
             at least 2 B-findings, and clinically significant symptom burden (eg, flushing,
             diarrhea, etc.) despite maximal treatment with approved agents to treat mediator
             symptoms, such as antihistamines and cromolyn sodium. Patients must have a normal
             karyotype.

             v. Patients with hematologic malignancies featuring clonal expansion of eosinophils
             driven by genomic alterations of KIT or PDGFR (eg, HES or CEL) must have a diagnosis
             confirmed by a central independent pathologist and are eligible if they have
             progressed on or are intolerant of imatinib therapy. Patients with de novo imatinib
             resistant mutations, such as but not limited to KIT D816V or PDGFRA D842V, are
             eligible without prior imatinib therapy.

             c) Malignant glioma patients with genomic alterations potentially conferring
             sensitivity to DCC-2618 including, but not limited to, amplification and/or mutations
             of PDGFRA and/or KIT.

             i. Patients must not require use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. ii. Patients
             that require steroids must be on a stable dose for 2 weeks prior to the first dose of
             study drug.

             d) Other solid tumor patients that have alterations in genes encoding kinases that are
             targets of DCC-2618. This includes KIT, PDGFR (A or B), TIE2, CSF1R, and VEGFR2.
             Patients must have received approved treatments known to provide clinical benefit
             prior to study entry.

             e) If signs or symptoms suggest CNS metastases, a brain MRI must be performed to
             confirm absence of CNS disease within 1 week prior to receiving study drug.

          2. Patients with known CNS metastases may participate provided that:

               1. they are stable (ie, without evidence of progression by magnetic resonance
                  imaging [MRI]) for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose study drug (patients
                  with active disease may be eligible following discussion between the Investigator
                  and the Sponsor),

               2. all neurologic symptoms have been stable for 2 weeks prior to the first dose of
                  study drug,

               3. patients must not require use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs,

               4. patients that require steroids must be on a stable dose for 2 weeks prior to the
                  first dose of study drug.

          3. Patients with solid tumors (with the exception of glial tumors and tumors that are
             anatomically inaccessible) must have an archival tumor biopsy sample as long as no
             anticancer therapy was administered since the sample was collected; otherwise, a
             current biopsy is required. In the case of glial tumors and anatomically inaccessible
             tumors, the most recent archival tissue is required.

          4. Male or female patients ≥18 years of age.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of ≤2.

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta‑human
             chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test within 28 days prior to the start of
             study drug. For clinical sites in the UK, pregnancy testing must occur within 7 days
             prior to the start of study drug.

          7. Patients of reproductive potential must agree to follow the contraception requirements
             outlined in Section 6.8.11.

          8. The patient is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed
             the informed consent document. A signed informed consent form must be obtained before
             any study‑specific procedures are performed. Standard procedures performed as part of
             the practice of medicine prior to consent (eg, imaging, physical exam) can be used to
             determine eligibility if completed within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study
             drug.

          9. Patients with solid tumors must have at least 1 measurable lesion according to RECIST
             Version 1.1 (non-nodal lesions must be ≥1.0 cm in the long axis or ≥double the slice
             thickness in the long axis; nodal lesions must be ≥1.5 cm in the short axis) or
             Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO).

             a) A non-brain lesion in a previously irradiated area is eligible to be considered as
             measurable disease as long as there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion
             before study enrollment.

             Investigator, the patient is suitable for the study. An adequate rationale must be
             provided to the Sponsor prior to enrollment.

             c) SM patients with one or more inadequate organ function laboratory value may be
             eligible if both the Investigator and Sponsor deem it to be disease-related and the
