  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend a combination of drugs for the maintenance of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). Simplification is considered critical to further scale-up of
      treatment, to support retention in care and to reduce costs. Dolutegravir is a once daily
      integrase inhibitor that shows very good tolerability, efficacy, and distinctive resistance
      profile. The researchers aim at investigating the feasibility of dolutegravir monotherapy in
      maintenance therapy. Briefly, 10 virologically suppressed patients for at least six months on
      conventional triple ART of dolutegravir plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs) will be switched to dolutegravir monotherapy for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is
      the number of patients completing 24 weeks of dolutegravir monotherapy without experiencing
      virological failure.
