  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial evaluating several
      decolonization strategies in patients with Staphylococcus aureus infection, their household
      contacts, and household environmental surfaces. The central hypothesis of this proposal is
      that an integrated approach of periodic personal and household environmental hygiene will
      reduce S. aureus transmission in households and subsequently decrease the incidence of skin
      and soft tissue infections (SSTI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with active or recent S. aureus SSTI will be recruited from St. Louis Children's
      Hospital and community pediatric practices affiliated with the investigators practice-based
      research network. All participants (index patients and their household contacts) will perform
      a baseline S. aureus decolonization protocol for 5 days consisting of enhanced hygiene
      measures, application of mupirocin antibiotic ointment to the anterior nares twice daily, and
      daily body washes with chlorhexidine antiseptic. Following the 5-day baseline decolonization
      regimen, households will be randomized to one of three intervention groups: 1) Periodic
      personal decolonization performed by all household members, to include chlorhexidine body
      washes twice weekly for 3 months and application of intranasal mupirocin for 5 consecutive
      days each month for 3 months; 2) Household environmental hygiene, including targeted cleaning
      of household surfaces and laundering of bed linens, weekly for 3 months; and 3) Integrated
      periodic personal decolonization and household environmental hygiene for 3 months. Households
      will be followed prospectively (1, 3, 6, and 9 months following randomization) to measure the
      prevalence of S. aureus colonization in the participants, household environmental surfaces,
      and pet dogs and cats and to document the incidence of recurrent SSTI. Molecular strain
      typing will be performed on all recovered S. aureus isolates to illuminate transmission
      dynamics and the effects of the decolonization measures on genetic epidemiology. Lastly, the
      investigators will assess resistance to the prescribed topical antimicrobials at baseline and
      longitudinal samplings.
