          -  Disease severity and total lesion count should be similar in both TAs

          -  Disease severity grade as moderate to severe according to the investigator's global
             assessment (grade 3-4)

          -  Age 18 to 35 years incl.

          -  Subjects with nodulocystic acne, acne conglobata, acne fulminans, secondary acne (e.g.
             chlor-acne, drug-induced acne)

          -  Subjects with previous history of keloid formation or post-inflammatory
             hyperpigmentation
