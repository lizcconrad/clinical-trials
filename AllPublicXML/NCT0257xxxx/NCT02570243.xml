      This is a prospective, multi-center, superiority study of parallel design. Patients are
      enrolled if they are older than 18 years old, are scheduled for 5 or 6 Fr diagnostic coronary
      angiography and the interventional cardiologist is willing to proceed with radial access.
      Patients are randomized before diagnostic catheterization to receive intravenously either
      100IU/Kg or 50 IU/Kg of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in a 1:1 ratio. Patients are discharged
      usually within 4 to 6 hours after coronary angiography.

      Radial artery in each patient is evaluated either in-hospital or during a subsequent visit by
      one physician who is blinded to the actual antithrombotic treatment given. Radial artery is
      considered occluded if it exhibits ultrasonographically no antegrade flow signal both at
      baseline and after reevaluation on a second occasion, within 30 days after the index
      procedure. Initially patent arteries will not be reexamined and are thought to remain
      permanently patent. The investigators also monitor major bleeding (defined as ≥ 5g/dL
      decrease in hemoglobin or ≥15% decrease in hematocrit or any life-threatening bleeding
      (confirmed by MRI or computed tomography) and large local hematomas of the forearm (defined
      as those extending beyond the forearm).
