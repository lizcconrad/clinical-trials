  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular inflammation, a central feature of atherosclerosis, participates in the initiation,
      perpetuation and instability of plaques. Multiple clinical trials of cholesterol lowering
      therapy with statins have demonstrated that reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) events are associated with reductions in both LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and the
      systemic inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein (CRP). The Cardiovascular Inflammation
      Reduction Trial (CIRT) investigates if an anti-inflammatory agent commonly used in rheumatoid
      arthritis (low dose methotrexate (LDM)) can reduce CV morbidity and mortality among patients
      with a prior myocardial infarction or angiographically demonstrated multivessel coronary
      artery disease (GCO#13-1467).

      In this ancillary CIRT imaging study, the investigators propose to use this well validated
      approach by non-invasive serial FDG-PET/CT imaging in a subset of patients enrolled in the
      main CIRT trial to directly visualize vascular inflammation. Once the subjects are enrolled
      in the main CIRT trial, baseline imaging will be done and follow up imaging will be done
      approximately 8 months after the baseline imaging.

      18FDG-PET imaging data will be acquired, analyzed centrally and results incorporated into the
      main CIRT database. The investigators hypothesize that LDM treatment will result in a
      significant decrease in plaque inflammation as measured by 18-FDG-PET/CT after 8 months as
      compared to placebo.

      The NHLBI funded (Ridker 5U01HL101422) Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT)
      provides a unique opportunity to investigate whether a commonly used anti-inflammatory agent
      used in rheumatoid arthritis (low dose methotrexate (LDM)) can reduce CVD morbidity and
      mortality among patients with stable coronary artery disease. CIRT, is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial among 7,000 men and women with prior
      myocardial infarction or angiographically demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease.
      Eligible participants will be randomly allocated over a three to four year period to usual
      care plus placebo or usual care plus LDM (average dose of 15-20 mg po/weekly. CIRT proposes
      that the reduction in CVD events with methotrexate derives from its effect on vascular
      inflammation, thus it is crucial to incorporate a measure of vascular inflammation imaging
      for confirmation of the primary mechanism of action underlying CIRT. As such, the direct
      evaluation of arterial inflammation would enhance the scientific value of the CIRT trial.

      The inclusion of the proposed vascular inflammation imaging substudy has widespread
      implications that will allow this imaging modality to serve as a surrogate measure of
      disease, and thereby provide an opportunity for stratification in individuals at risk for CVD
      and evaluation of other interventions with presumed anti-inflammatory effects.

    <description>The relative change at 8 months as compared to baseline in arterial inflammation as measured by the most diseased segment (MDS) of the index vessel. The MDS is defined as the 1.5 cm segment within the carotid artery (right or left carotid) that demonstrates the highest PET/CT activity, and is calculated as a mean of maximum TBR values derived from 3 contiguous axial segments. The index vessel in turn is defined as the vessel (either aorta, right, or left carotid) with the greatest mean TBR at baseline.</description>
