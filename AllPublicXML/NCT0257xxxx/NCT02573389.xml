  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether pre-operative pancreatic stenting for distal pancreatectomy will impact
      the incidence of a post-operative pancreatic fistula, as defined by postoperative. If
      pre-operative pancreatic stenting appears to reduce the formation of Postoperative Pancreatic
      Fistula (POPF) in this pilot study, this will form the basis of a larger randomized trial in
      the future. The hypothesis is that pre-operative pancreatic duct stenting can significantly
      decrease the rate of development of a post-operative pancreatic fistula after distal
      pancreatectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting is to be offered to all patients deemed a candidate for
      a distal pancreatectomy. This is a nonrandomized cohort study with a retrospective and
      prospective control group (Jan 2008 - Dec 2017 or sample size obtained) and a prospective
      endoscopic intervention group (September 2015 - Dec 2017 or until sample size obtained). We
      will then compare the rate of development of a postoperative pancreatic fistula between those
      patients who have preoperative stenting and those who do not. POPF will be defined as the
      amylase level of drain contents equaling three times or more the serum amylase on
      postoperative day 3, as defined by the International Study Group for Pancreatic Fistula
      (ISGPF) or an ICD-9 diagnosis of 577.8. The patient will have a pre-operative visit for stent
      placement and a post-operative visit for stent removal if still in place 4-6 weeks after
      distal pancreatectomy.

    <description>Rate of post-operative pancreatic fistula will be evaluated at 6 months when enrollment begins. Early stop is determined under either of below conditions:
Effect size is smaller than needed to reach statistical difference even if number of enrollment is completed in one year.
Adverse events occurring from the pancreatic duct stenting itself, which include pseudocyst, delaying surgery, pancreatitis requiring prolonged hospital admission, or death.
There is statistical significant difference between control and intervention groups.</description>
