      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Boston
      Scientific Corporation (BSC) ELUVIA Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System (ELUVIA Stent) for
      treating Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA) lesions up
      to 140 mm in length.

      Long Lesion Substudy: to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Boston Scientific
      Corporation (BSC) ELUVIA Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System (ELUVIA Stent) for treating
      Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA) lesions &gt;140 mm and ≤
      190 mm in length.

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that has become increasingly recognized in the
      expanding elderly population as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.
      Atherosclerosis in the vessels of the lower extremities can cause a variety of symptoms
      ranging from intermittent claudication to ischemic rest pain and critical ischemia with major
      tissue loss. Typically, femoropopliteal lesions have been difficult to successfully treat
      with endovascular therapy because the disease is often diffuse and located in an area of the
      body subject to significant mobility stresses such as extension, contraction, compression,
      elongation, flexion and torsion.

      The IMPERIAL trial is a global, prospective, multi-center trial. Approximately 525-535
      subjects will be enrolled at up to 75 study centers worldwide. Regions participating include
      the United States, Canada, European Union, Japan and New Zealand.

      The trial consists of a prospective, multicenter, 2:1 randomized (ELUVIA vs Zilver PTX),
      controlled, single-blind, non-inferiority trial (RCT), a concurrent, non-blinded,
      non-randomized, single-arm, pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy and a concurrent, non-blinded,
      non-randomized, Long Lesion substudy.
