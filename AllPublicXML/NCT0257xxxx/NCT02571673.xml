  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to understand how survivors of head and neck cancer think they can
      make HN-STAR (the Survivor Self-Assessment, the survivorship clinic experience, and the
      Survivorship Care Plan the best it can be. Once the investigators have your input and input
      from other survivors, they can make changes to HN-STAR, so that they can test this tool in a
      larger study. The larger study will tell them whether using HN-STAR improves the care of head
      and neck cancer survivors.

    <description>Using data from survivors in Aim 1: Part 2 (N=45), we will abstract data on health care actions from both the medical record and HN-STAR. Such data include receipt of appropriate oncologic surveillance, identification and management of symptoms, and appropriate preventive health services, as indicated by referrals, prescriptions, and recommendations in both clinic notes and the HN-STAR Survivor Self-Assessment. This Aim will determine the feasibility of data collection, establish baseline health status measures, and contribute to power calculations for the future trial.</description>

    <description>Data collection will take place in two parts. Aim 1: Part 1 will enroll 10 patients at MSK to participate in component pilot testing and usability testing of HN-STAR and the associated surveys. We will also elicit feedback from the NP. After incorporating any changes to HN-STAR or the surveys based on findings from Aim 1: Part 1, Aim 1: Part 2 will enroll 30 additional patients from MSK and 15 from HH to provide feedback on usability. We will also survey each patient's PCP in Aim 1: Part 2.</description>

    <description>Usability outcomes will come from patient surveys and interviews and a nurse practitioner interview in Aim 1: Part 1. In Aim 1: Part 2, patients and their primary care providers will complete online surveys regarding feasibility. Health outcomes and data regarding health care actions will be collected from HN-STAR and the clinic note will be collected to assess feasibility of collecting these metrics in a future trial. Directly after each clinic visit, the NP will complete one brief online survey for each participant.</description>
