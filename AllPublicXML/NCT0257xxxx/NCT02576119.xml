        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written Informed Consent

          2. Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant deviation from normal in
             medical history, physical examination findings, 12-lead ECG measurements, physical
             measurements, and clinical laboratory test results

          3. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 kg/m2 to 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening and Day 1.
             BMI = weight (kg)/[height(m)]2

             of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of
             contraception for the duration of treatment with BMS-955176 in addition to a
             post-treatment completion period

          5. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with BMS-955176 in addition
             to a post-treatment completion period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant acute or chronic medical illness

          2. Any GI disease or surgery that can affect absorption of the study drug

          3. A personal history of clinically relevant cardiac disease, long QT syndrome,
             symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmias, presyncope or syncopal episodes, or
             additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (eg, heart failure)

          4. Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in
             physical examination, vital signs, ECG or clinical laboratory determinations beyond
             what is consistent with the target population

          5. History of allergy to moxifloxacin, HIV maturation inhibitors, or related compounds
