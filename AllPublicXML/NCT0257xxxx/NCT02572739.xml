  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thermodilution cardiac output measurement is a reliable method, but it is an invasive one.
      PiCCO device requires cannulation of central vein and peripheral artery. Impedance method
      requires only attachment of special electrodes. Non-invasive methods are less accurate. Aim
      of study is to assess accuracy and reliability of impedance method ( using NICCOMO device) in
      comparison of thermodilution method ( using PiCCO device) at different PEEP levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Echocardiography is performed prior to measurement to exclude patients with heart valve
      abnormalities.

      Patients without spontaneous ventilation ( deeply unconscious, sedated or sedated and
      paralysed), ventilated with controlled mechanical ventilation mode with tidal volume 6-8
      ml/ideal body weight, resulting in EtCO2 35-45 mmHg, with PiCCO catheters implemented have
      additionally NICCOMO device attached. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set to achieve
      saturation &gt;96% at positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 cmH2O.

      Measurement of cardiac output are performed on expiration at PEEP 0, 5, 10, 15 20 cmH2O and
      at optimal PEEP (obtained from P-V curve). Simultaneously CO value from impedance device is
      noted. Other haemodynamic parameters, calculated by both devices are also noted - stroke
      volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance
      (SVR), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI).
