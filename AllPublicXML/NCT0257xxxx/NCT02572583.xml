    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled trial studies the efficacy and safety of treating
      influenza with the reconciling exterior and interior therapy. A total of 300 cases of
      seasonal flu in Beijing is to be collected, and divided into one treatment group and two
      control groups. Patients in the treatment group will receive Liugan Shuangjie Heji, while
      patients in control groups will receive Shufeng Jiedu Capsule and Oseltamivir Phosphate
      Capsule respectively, for a course of 5 days. The study assesses the efficacy and safety of
      treating influenza with the reconciling therapy based on the following outcome measures: the
      time it takes from the medicine intake to 0.5℃ drop of body temperature, and the time it
      takes for the body temperature to return to normal.
