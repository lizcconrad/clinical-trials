  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to elucidate mechanisms whereby oxidative stress induced by
      acute reflux esophagitis: 1) activates p38 to regulate proteins that control the G1/S cell
      cycle checkpoint, and 2) activates HIFs (hypoxia inducible factors) to cause autocrine VEGF
      (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling that triggers the EMT
      (epithelial-mesenchymal-transition) program in Barrett's esophagus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complication, Barrett's esophagus (BE), are
      risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma. In BE, GERD causes inflammation with oxidative
      DNA damage and genomic instability that contributes to carcinogenesis. In BE, one response to
      oxidative stress is p38 pathway activation, which might protect against cancer development by
      initiating G1 arrest and enabling repair of DNA damage. Inflammation and oxidative stress
      also might induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the process in which epithelial
      cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics including the ability to migrate. This study will
      elucidate mechanisms whereby the oxidative stress of acute reflux esophagitis in BE activates
      p38 to regulate proteins controlling the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, and activates HIFs to
      cause autocrine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling that triggers the EMT
      program.
