  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exertional angina is common symptom in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) without
      obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Although reduced myocardial flow reserve is one of
      the proposed explanations for angina, little is known about the pathophysiology.

      This study aimed that adenosine-stress cardiac magnetic resonance can be used for the
      assessment of myocardial perfusion reserve and suggest the pathophysiology of development of
      angina in patients with severe AS without obstructive CAD.

    <description>Signal intensity-time curves were generated for all segments and the maximum upslope of the LV myocardium divided by the maximum upslope of the LV cavity. MPRI [upslopestress(corrected)/upsloperest(corrected)] was calculated dividing the segmental upslope value during adenosine and rest. Whole (average of all myocardial segments) MPRI were calculated.</description>

        Subjects who had severe AS and normal LV ejection fraction (EF ≥ 50%) in transthoracic
        echocardiography were included in the investigators' prospective study. Severe AS was
        defined as aortic valve area index less than 0.6 cm2/m2 as previously published.
