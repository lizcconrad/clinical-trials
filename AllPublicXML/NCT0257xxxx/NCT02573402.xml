  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects upon the bladder of electric
      stimulation of the leg's tibial nerve in people with acute spinal cord injury with an
      intervention called transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, TTNS will be used to help neurogenic bladder in SCI. First, acute SCI subjects
      which respond to TTNS will be identified as seen on urodynamic studies (USD). Then,
      responders will be invited to participate in a randomized control trial of a 2-week protocol
      of TTNS to test for safety and efficacy during inpatient rehabilitation to evaluate bladder
      changes based upon pre- and post- urodynamic testing, as well as 2-month follow-up.

    <description>10 sessions over a 2 week period of TTNS for 30 minutes. Electrodes will be placed 2 inch by 4 inch according to anatomic landmarks, with the negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm superior to the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic flexion of the toes secondary to stimulation of the flexor digitorum and hallicus brevis. Current intensity may vary from patient to patient and will be documented and used in the analysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrollment within 6 weeks of injury

          -  Neurologic level rostral to T10 (T9 and above). This is a significant neurologic level
             because the bladder remains innervated at these levels, without damage to the nerve
             cell bodies of the bladder within the spinal cord.

          -  Location and transportation available for follow-up appointments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of peripheral neuropathy or premorbid symptoms of peripheral neuropathy

          -  Known etiologies that may cause peripheral neuropathy (i.e. diabetes mellitus,
             hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, alcoholism, hx of chemotherapy, etc.)

          -  History of genitourinary diagnoses (i.e. prostate hypertrophy, overactive bladder,
             cancer, etc.)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  History of central nervous system disorder (i.e. prior SCI, stroke, brain injury,
             Parkinson's disease, MS, etc.)

          -  Morbid obesity

          -  Ventilator dependent respiration

          -  Significant autonomic dysreflexia during baseline urodynamic study.
