    <textblock>
      Purpose: Physical exercise exerts favorable impact on functional capacity (FC) and quality of
      life (QL) in patients with heart failure (HF). It is believed that the combined aerobic and
      resistance physical training (CPT) supervised by physical educator is better than only
      prescription of unsupervised exercise. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of a
      CPT program on the FC and QL of HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) with the
      practice medical routine prescription of regular physical activity and correlate these
      findings with clinical and echocardiographic variables.

      Methods: A longitudinal prospective study included 28 consecutive HFREF patients randomly
      divided in two age- and gender- matched groups: Trained Group (TG, n = 17), patients
      undergoing 12 weeks of supervised CPT and Non Trained Group (NTG, n = 11), patients receiving
      only medical prescription to practice regular physical exercise. All patients were submitted
      to clinical evaluation, transthoracic echocardiography, Cooper walk test and QL questionnaire
      before and after the study protocol. Student t test or Mann-Whitney test were performed for
      groups comparison and correlation tests for the same group variable associations.
