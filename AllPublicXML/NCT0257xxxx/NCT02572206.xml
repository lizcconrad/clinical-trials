  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the present study is to evaluate the utility of mGluR5 binding as
      measured by PET as a biomarker of the CNTNAP2 mutation and related /mTOR kinase pathway
      dysregulation.

      The investigators will focus on mGluR5 PET binding as a surrogate measure for level of
      activity of the mTOR kinase pathway. This study is being conducted by the New York State
      Psychiatric Institute (NYPSI) and the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene Inc (RFMH) and
      will take place at Columbia University Medcial Center (CUMC) in New York City and at a
      research office in Strasburg, PA. Subjects (n=20) with the CNTNAP2 mutation with
      schizophrenia or a related condition will be recruited from the Amish and Mennonite
      communities and brought to CUMC for detailed investigation. Affected individuals will be
      compared to Old-Order Amish control patients drawn from the same families but not harboring
      CNTNAP2 mutations (n=20). The primary measure will consist of mGluR5 PET binding in DLPFC. In
      addition, secondary analyses will assess binding in other brain regions such as hippocampus
      and visual cortex. Exploratory measures, as well as relationships between PET mGluR5 binding
      and clinical symptomatology,will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients:

          -  Meets DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for psychotic disorder, including schizophrenia,
             schizoaffective disorder or psychotic disorder not elsewhere classified

          -  Aged 18-59 years

          -  Genetic confirmation that patient carries CNTNAP2 mutation

          -  All patients will be of Amish and/or Mennonite descent

          -  Has a relative willing to be part of the study and this relative will travel with the
             participant to Columbia University Medical Center in New York City and back to
             Lancaster, PA

          -  In the judgment of the participant's treating physician as well as the evaluating
             consenter, the patient is stable enough to travel and participate in the study

        Control subjects:

          -  Aged 18-59 years

          -  Genetic confirmation that subject does not carry CNTNAP2 mutation

          -  First-degree or second-degree relative of subject of Amish/Mennonite descent with
