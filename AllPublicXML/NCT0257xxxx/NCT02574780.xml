  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stage and lymphedema size can be detrimental to the quality of life and health of women,
      because the increase in circumference and member of the weight causes limitations in
      activities. Previous studies have shown that patients with lymphedema should not perform high
      intensity exercises, these exercises would cause the increase of lymphedema. Already, in
      current studies show that muscle strength exercises when properly applied, with controlled
      intensity and time, can help to reduce lymphedema. Thus, the main objective of this study is
      to compare the standard treatment of lymphedema through complex physical therapy versus the
      application of strengthening exercises for upper limbs together with complex physical
      therapy. The study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Participate in the study
      50 patients, who will be allocated into two groups, group 1 (n = 25): Complex Physical
      Therapy; Group 2 (n = 25): Complex physical therapy in an exercise protocol, which will
      receive treatment twice a week for eight weeks. All patients will receive treatment and will
      be informed of the free and informed consent form at the beginning of the research. They will
      be met: the report cards, dynamometer testing and filling out questionnaires at the beginning
      and end of the study.

      This study will be conducted in Onco Mastology clinic of the Department of Mastology the
      Department of Gynecology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) - Paulista School of
      Medicine (EPM), in which patients will be recruited, selected and informed about the study
      objectives , its relevance, activities to be developed and the possibility of improvement and
      remedy your questions and concerns about the disease.The study design is a randomized
      controlled clinical trial. To define the treatment, 50 patients are allocated to two groups,
      group 1 (n = 25) Group 2 (n = 25) that receive treatment twice a week for eight weeks.
      Physical examination will be performed, completing the consent form, evaluation form, and
      questionnaires. Group 1 standard treatment : 25 women with lymphedema , perform complex
      physical therapy with manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging and exercises
      linfomiocinéticos . Treatment was given twice a week , 8 consecutive weeks , 6 sessions.Group
      2 standard treatment + muscle strength : 25 women with lymphedema , perform complex physical
      therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging and linfomiocinéticos exercises and
      strengthening exercises with load.Treatment was given twice a week , 8 consecutive weeks , 16
      sessions.
