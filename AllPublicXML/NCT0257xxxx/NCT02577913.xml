      This study compares the risks of short- and long-term use of FC Patch Low with
      levonorgestrel-containing combined oral contraceptives (COC-LNG) in a study population
      representative of the actual users of the individual preparations. FC Patch Low is a
      transdermal contraceptive patch applied once a week for three consecutive weeks followed by a
      break of one week (21/7). One patch contains 2.1mg gestodene and 0.55mg ethinyl estradiol,
      which is equivalent of releasing 0.06mg gestodene and 0.013mg ethinyl estradiol per 24 hours.

      FC Patch Low is a transdermal contraceptive patch applied once a week for three consecutive
      weeks followed by a break of one week (21/7). One patch contains 2.1mg gestodene and 0.55mg
      ethinyl estradiol, which is equivalent of releasing 0.06mg gestodene and 0.013mg ethinyl
      estradiol per 24 hours. The most relevant adverse clinical outcome that has been linked to
      the use of COCs is venous thromboembolism (VTE). Data from randomized clinical trials did not
      show any serious health concerns for FC Patch Low. However, the statistical power to detect
      rare adverse events is limited in these studies.

      EURAS-CORA is a large, prospective, controlled, long-term active surveillance study to
      investigate the safety of FC Patch Low with regard to the outcomes of interest. This study
      follows the European Active Surveillance (EURAS) design methodology with some modifications
      due to country- and product-specific characteristics. The outcomes of interest will be
      validated via the attending physicians. A multi-faceted follow-up procedure will ensure a low
      loss to follow-up rate. This study will involve women from Europe who will be followed for up
      to 2 years. Data analysis will include multivariable techniques such as Cox regression.
