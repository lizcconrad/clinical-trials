  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to encode the speech signal is determined by ascending and descending auditory
      processing. Difficulties in processing these speech signals are well described at the
      behavioral level in a specific language disorder. However, little is known about the
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The assumption is that we should observe a
      degradation of the signal provided by the ear in the deaf subject while in case of specific
      language impairment it would be a phonemic disorder (possibly linked to a processing disorder
      auditory). The two population groups should therefore have different abnormalities of their
      central auditory process - which could be modified by the target remediation for each group.
