      Protocol B8011001 is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, dose escalation and
      expansion, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) study of PF-06801591 in
      previously treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, SCCHN,
      ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumors. This is a 2
      Part study whereby the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of intravenous (IV)
      or subcutaneous (SC) PF-06801591 was assessed in Part 1. Part 2 expansion is designed to
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy of SC PF-06801591 in patients with NSCLC or
      urothelial carcinoma as well as confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose.

      Protocol B8011001 is a Phase 1, two part, open-label, multi center, multiple-dose, safety,
      efficacy, PK, and PD study of PF-06801591 administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneous
      (SC) in previously treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma,
      squamous cell carcinoma head and neck (SCCHN), ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, non-small cell
      lung carcinoma (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumors.

      The first part of the study, Part 1 dose escalation, was designed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of increasing dose levels of IV or SC administered PF-06801591 to establish the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) design.
      Part 2 expansion is designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of 300 mg of
      PF-06801591 administered SC once every 4 weeks in patients with NSCLC or urothelial carcinoma
      as well as confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 1 enrollment has completed,
      enrollment will only be allowed for Part 2.
