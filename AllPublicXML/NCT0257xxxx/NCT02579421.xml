  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the role of progesterone (a naturally occurring
      hormone found in both men and women) on reducing marijuana use. The investigators will see if
      progesterone effects impulsivity, withdrawal, mood and stress during marijuana cessation.

      This double-blind, randomized pilot clinical trial will prescreen an estimated 250 potential
      subjects, consent and further evaluate approximately 100 potential subjects, and ultimately
      enroll 70 subjects to ensure 40 subjects will provide a primary marijuana reduction outcome
      measure at four weeks post quit date. Subjects will be stratified by sex then randomized to
      one of two treatment groups (n=20 per drug group, 50% female): progesterone (PRO; 200mg
      2x/day) or Placebo (PBO). Telephone screening and visit invitation (20 minutes) leads to the
      consent process and in-person screening including medical-psychiatric evaluation for
      inclusion/exclusion (two visits, two hours each), then randomization and medication start (7
      days), then stable medication (28 days) with medication reduction and final evaluation (7
      days).
