  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most frequent inherited disease in the world. Literature
      reports that SCD patients display intolerance to exercise, important muscle weakness and
      profound remodeling of skeletal muscle including amyotrophy and rarefied microvascular
      network.

      Because strenuous exercise induces acidosis, hemorheological alterations, endothelial
      activation and oxidative stress, it constitutes a potential triggering factor of sickling and
      vaso-occlusive crisis. As a consequence, physical activity is usually discouraged in patients
      with SCD. However, moderate and regular physical activity seems to be not only safe but also
      beneficial for SCD patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Besides, endurance training is known to induce moderate muscle hypertrophy and increase
      microvascular network. Therefore, adapted, moderate and regular physical activity appears as
      a potential strategy able to improve muscle function, decrease symptoms of the disease and
      improve autonomy and quality of life of patients with SCD. However, it remains necessary to
      define the modalities of exercise therapy in SCD and to objectively evaluate the risks,
      limitations and gains on physical ability, muscle function and quality of life in patients
      with SCD.

    <description>The blood lactate concentration curve in response to incremental exercise depends on the physical ability of patients. Endurance training is known to increase the power output (W) associated with a given blood lactate concentration. For the present study, we used the 4 mmol/L blood lactate concentration as a remarkable/singular point of the curve</description>

    <description>Each training session will last 45 min. Exercise will start by a 5-min warm-up cycling period, followed by 30 min of cycling at the power output (W) individually determined before and corresponding to the first lactate threshold corresponding approximately to 2.5 mmol/l . Then patients will cool down for 5 min. Finally, the training sessions will end by 5 min of light stretching. All training sessions will take place at the hospital and will be under the supervision of a physician. Heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood lactate concentrations will be regularly measured. Work rate will be adjusted according to the obtained results. As a safety procedure, blood lactate concentration must not exceed 4 mmol/L during the training sessions. A particular attention will be paid to the hydration of patients. Pain and fatigue will be evaluated everyday by the patients using (100 mm) visual analog scales.</description>
