  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, parallel-group, rater-blinded, randomized clinical study in subjects
      with advanced PD investigating the efficacy, PK, safety and tolerability of continuous SC
      infusion of 2 dosing regimens of ND0612H, a solution of LD/CD delivered via a pump system as
      a continuous SC infusion, compared to standard oral LD/CD. After screening, subjects will
      undergo 1 day of standard oral LD/CD inpatient dosing followed by 2 days of inpatient
      treatment with 1 of 2 randomly allocated (1:1 randomization ratio) dosing regimens of ND0612H
      continuous SC infusion. Subjects will then continue on a maintenance dose of the assigned
      ND0612H dosing regimen for the next 25 days. A safety visit will be performed 4 weeks after
      the last SC administration of the study drug for a total of about 2.5 months of participation
      for each subject enrolled into the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa randomized, controlled, parallel-group study will be conducted in 36 subjects
      with advanced PD who are treated with oral LD/CD at a stable dose and have predictable
      morning &quot;OFF&quot; periods and at least 2.5 hrs of daily &quot;OFF&quot; periods. The study will investigate
      the efficacy, PK, safety and tolerability of continuous SC infusion of 2 dosing regimens of
      ND0612H. Regimen 1 will employ continuous infusion for 24 hrs using a low infusion rate at
      night and a higher rate at daytime with supplemental administration of oral immediate release
      (IR) LD/CD in the mornings. During the inpatient period of about 3 days, the site staff will
      manage the administration and replacement of the infusions. On Day 4 subjects will be
      discharged home after they and their study partners have received training on the
      administration of the infusion. A safety visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last SC
      administration of the study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female PD subjects of any race aged 30 to 80 years who sign an Institutional
             Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC)-approved informed consent form (ICF).

          2. PD diagnosis consistent with the UK Brain Bank Criteria.

          3. Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale in &quot;ON&quot; state of stage â‰¤3.

          4. Taking at least 4 doses/day of LD (or at least 3 doses/day of Rytary) and taking, or
             have attempted to take, at least 2 other classes of anti-PD medications in a
             therapeutic dose for at least 30 consecutive days each.

          5. Subjects must be stable on their anti-PD medications for at least 30 days before Day
             1.

          6. Subjects may have had prior exposure to SC apomorphine injections/infusion but must
             have stopped administration at least 4 weeks before the screening visit. Treatment

          7. Must have a minimum of 2.5 hrs of &quot;OFF&quot; time per day with predictable early morning
             &quot;OFF&quot; periods as estimated by the subject.

          8. Must have predictable and well defined early morning &quot;OFF&quot; periods with a good
             response to LD for treatment of the early morning &quot;OFF&quot; in the judgement of the
             investigator.

          9. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &gt;26.

         10. No clinically significant medical, psychiatric or laboratory abnormalities which the

             contraceptive foams, diaphragms with contraceptive jelly], intrauterine devices,
             partner with vasectomy), 1 month before enrollment, for the duration of the study, and
             3 months after the last dose of study drug.

             reviewer, makes the subject unsuitable for study entry or potentially unable to
             complete all aspects of the study.

          4. Prior neurosurgical procedure for PD, or duodopa treatment.

          5. Subjects with a history of drug abuse or alcoholism within the past 12 months.

          6. Clinically significant ECG rhythm abnormalities.

          7. Renal or liver dysfunction that may alter drug metabolism including: serum creatinine
             &gt;1.3 mg/dL, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             &gt;2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), total serum bilirubin &gt;2.5 mg/dL.
