      Purpose of this study is to compare the ocular functional changes including pupil size,
      visual acuity, depth of focus, accommodative amplitude, visual field, contrast sensitivity,
      and stereopsis induced by multiple and single pinhole glasses, in addition, to check reading
      speed and survey for ocular discomfort after using both pinhole glasses.
