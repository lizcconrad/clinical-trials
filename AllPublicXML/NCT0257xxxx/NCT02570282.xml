  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single center, single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way
      crossover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SST-6007 in women with FSAD. A
      sufficient number of participants will be enrolled to yield 30 (approximately 15
      pre-menopausal and 15 post-menopausal) participants to complete the SST-6007/Placebo
      Double-Blind, Dosing Phase of the study (Visit 2 and Visit 3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will first complete a telephone screen (&lt; 28 days prior to Visit 1, Medical
      Screening) and will be scheduled for Visit 1 if eligible. After consent is obtained, study
      participants will undergo Visit 1 at a local gynecology clinic to determine their eligibility
      for continued study participation.

      If the participant meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria,
      they will be scheduled for Visit 2 and Visit 3 of the SST-6007/Placebo Double-Blind, Dosing
      Phase to be conducted at the Sexual Psychophysiology Laboratory at the University of Texas at
      Austin. Visit 2 must be within 5 (±2) days of Visit 1. One visit will evaluate the
      participant's response to SST-6007 and the other will evaluate the participant's response to
      placebo cream, using the VPP, the Arousometer, and neutral-erotic film presentations. The
      sequence of dosing will be randomly assigned (i.e., placebo cream then SST-6007 or SST-6007
      then placebo cream) according to a computer-generated, randomization. There will be a 4-8 day
      washout period between Visits 2 and 3.

      During each experimental session, physiological and subjective sexual arousal will be
      assessed simultaneously and continuously using the VPP and the Arousometer. Electrical
      activity of the heart will be assessed with an ECG. ECG data will be used to process the VPA
      data. Immediately following completion of each erotic film, subjective sexual arousal,
      subjective perception of genital arousal, and positive and negative affect will be evaluated
      using a self-report 7-point Likert Scale (Film Scale) and the Positive and Negative Affect
      Schedule (PANAS).

             causing angina; or congestive heart failure requiring medical intervention.

          7. Participant has retinitis pigmentosa or sickle cell anemia or related anemias, even if
             the participant feels clinically well at the time of Visit 1. Participants with
             retinitis pigmentosa will be identified by specifically asking whether they have the
             condition, if there are visual signs and symptoms of the condition (including
             questioning participants as to whether they have difficulty seeing at night or in low
             light, and if they have any visual field deficits that indicate a loss of peripheral

        minutes after the change in position from supine to standing.

        9. Participant has primary anorgasmia, vaginismus, or sexual aversion disorder.

        10. Participant has dyspareunia.

        11. Participant has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

        12. Participant has undergone major pelvic surgery that may have caused nerve damage,

        trauma, cancer treatments, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord damage.

        13. Participant has current and/or previous reported diagnoses of DSM-IV-TR axis I
        disorders including organic mental syndromes and disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar
        disorder, depression).

        14. Participant has a history of cancer, other than basal cell carcinoma.

        15. Participant has any surgical or medical condition that may interfere with the
        absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the test article in the opinion of
        the Sub-Investigator.

        16. Participant has a history of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).

        17. Participant has positive findings from the urine drug screen (e.g., amphetamines,
        barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, and opiates).

        18. Participant has positive serologic findings for sexually transmitted infection
        (syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, hepatitis
        B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.

        19. Participant has moderate to severe current vaginitis, a vaginal infection including
        bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. The diagnosis of yeast infections should be made
        by the Sub-Investigator based on the physical and gynecological exams; the objective is to
        exclude women that are symptomatic. If the woman is not complaining of symptoms but the
        Sub-Investigator observes discharge, than the vaginal wet mount test should also be
        performed to confirm a diagnosis of yeast infection.
