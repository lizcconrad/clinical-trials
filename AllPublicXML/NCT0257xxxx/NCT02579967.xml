      Background:

      Allogeneic blood or marrow transplant is when stem cells are taken from one person s blood or
      bone marrow and given to another person. Researchers think this may help people with immune
      system problems.

      Objective:

      To see if allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplant is safe and effective in treating people
      with primary immunodeficiencies.

      Eligibility:

      Donors: Healthy people ages 4 or older

      Recipients: People ages 4-75 with a primary immunodeficiency that may be treated with
      allogeneic blood or marrow transplant

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

      Participants will have urine tests, EKG, and chest x-ray.

      Donors will have:

      Bone marrow harvest: With anesthesia, marrow is taken by a needle in the hipbone.

      OR

      Blood collection: They will have several drug injections over 5-7 days. Blood is taken by IV
      in one arm, circulates through a machine to remove stem cells, and returned by IV in the
      other arm.

      Possible vein assessment or pre-anesthesia evaluation

      Recipients will have:

      Lung test, heart tests, radiology scans, CT scans, and dental exam

      Possible tissue biopsies or lumbar puncture

      Bone marrow and a small piece of bone removed by needle in the hipbone.

      Chemotherapy 1-2 weeks before transplant day

      Donor stem cell donation through a catheter put into a vein in the chest or neck

      Several-week hospital stay. They will take medications and may need blood transfusions and
      additional procedures.

      After discharge, recipients will:

      Remain near the clinic for about 3 months. They will have weekly visits and may require
      hospital readmission.

      Have multiple follow-up visits to the clinic in the first 6 months, and less frequently for
      at least 5 years.

      Background:

        -  Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are conditions associated with major
           quantitative or qualitative immunologic abnormalities that are, in most cases, due to
           defects in cells of hematopoietic origin

        -  Patients with PID can have life-threatening complications including malignancy,
           recurrent infection, and autoimmunity/immune dysregulation

        -  Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (allo BMT) has the potential to cure the
           immune defect in PID and thereby reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with
           these diseases

      Objectives:

      -To estimate the acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD)-free, graft failure-free survival at
      day +180 after allo BMT, analyzed separately by conditioning arm/cohort

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients age greater than or equal to 4 through 75 years

        -  PID deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant allo BMT, by meeting the two
           criteria below:

        -  PID as defined by monogenetic mutation or, in the absence of a mutation, patients with
           an immune defect potentially amenable to allo BMT who meet the clinical history criteria
           below may be eligible

        -  Clinical history of at least two of the following:

             -  Life-threatening, organ-threatening, or severely disfiguring infection

             -  Protracted or recurrent infections

             -  Infection with an opportunistic organism

             -  Chronic elevation in the blood of a latent virus

             -  Evidence of immune dysregulation

             -  Hypogammaglobulinemia/dysglobulinemia

             -  Hematologic malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder

             -  Virus-associated solid tumor malignancy or pre-cancerous lesion

        -  At least one 9-10/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or an HLA-haploidentical
           related donor

        -  Adequate end-organ function

        -  Consensus opinion by the investigative team that the patient has the potential to
           benefit from transplant despite existing, non-hematopoietic organ dysfunction

        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

        -  HIV negative

        -  Disease status: patients with malignancy should be referred in remission for evaluation,
           except in the case of virus-associated malignancy who may be referred at any time

      Design:

        -  The study will have four arms that vary in conditioning intensity and/or mycophenolate
           mofetil (MMF) duration. Patients age &gt; 65 will only be eligible for either the
           reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC or RIC-MMF) or immunosuppression-only (IOC) arms.
           The IOC arm will have a standard risk and high risk cohort.

        -  IOC arm: pentostatin 4 mg/m(2)/day IV on days -9 and -5, low-dose cyclophosphamide
           orally daily on days -9 through -2

        -  RIC and RIC-MMF arm: pentostatin 4 mg/m(2)/day IV on days -11 and -7, low-dose
           cyclophosphamide orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV, pharmokinetically
           dosed, on days -3 and -2.

        -  Myeloablative (MAC) arm: pentostatin 4 mg/m(2)/day IV on days -13 and -9, low-dose
           cyclophosphamide orally daily on days -13 through -6; busulfan IV, pharmokinetically
           dosed, on days -5, -4, -3, and -2.

        -  Patients will be assigned to the MAC arm if one or more of the following are present:

             -  Splenomegaly attributable to the underlying PID

             -  Evidence of a primary hematologic marrow malignancy or proliferative process,
                unless myelosuppressive therapy has been given in the 3 months prior to the start
                of conditioning

             -  PID where experience has shown that MAC is needed to fully reverse the disease
                phenotype

        -  Patients may be assigned to the standard risk cohort of the IOC arm if one or more of
           the following are present:

             -  DNA repair telomere maintenance defect, or familial cancer predisposition syndrome

             -  PID with absent or very low numbers of T-lymphocytes

             -  Severely hypocellular or aplastic bone marrow, without clonal abnormalities or
                evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome

             -  In the 3 months prior to the planned start of allo BMT conditioning, receipt of
                cytotoxic chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents, or targeted/immunomodulatory
                therapies with antiproliferative effects on the marrow

             -  PID where experience has shown that minimal conditioning is necessary for
                successful engraftment of both T- and myeloid lineages

        -  Patients may be assigned to the high risk cohort of the IOC arm if significant end-organ
           dysfunction is present and it is felt that a conditioning regimen that includes busulfan
           would likely be associated with intolerable, life-threatening toxicities for the
           patient.

        -  Patients who do not meet criteria for the MAC or IOC arm will receive RIC on the RIC or
           RIC-MMF arm. However, conditioning arm assignment may ultimately deviate from the above
           criteria based on other patient and disease factors

        -  Bone marrow is the preferred graft source. Peripheral blood stem cells are permitted

        -  GVHD prophylaxis:

             -  High-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) on days +3 and +4,
                sirolimus on days +5 through +180, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on days +5
                through +35 for all arms except the RIC-MMF arm. The RIC-MMF arm will receive MMF
                of varying durations based on a duration de-escalation schema.

             -  Patients with DNA repair/telomere defects familial cancer syndromes may receive a
                reduced dose (25mg/kg/day) PTCy on days +3 and +4, in addition to sirolimus and
                MMF.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:

          -  Patients age greater than or equal to 4 through 75 years

          -  PID deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant allo BMT, by meeting the two
             criteria below:

               1. PID as defined by monogenetic mutation or, in the absence of a PID-associated
                  genetic mutation, patients with an immune defect potentially amenable to allo BMT
                  who meet the clinical history criteria below may be eligible upon discussion with
                  the PI

                    -  Mutations should be confirmed in a CLIA-certified laboratory, if such
                       testing is available.

                    -  Patients without a mutation must be deemed eligible and appropriate for allo
                       BMT by the PI. Some patients may meet the clinical history criteria listed
                       below, but will not be eligible if it is thought that their clinical history
                       is due to a condition apart from an immune defect. In addition, patients
                       with a PID of mild severity, such as those with selective IgA deficiency,
                       may meet at least two of the clinical history criteria, but may be deemed
                       inappropriate for allo BMT by the PI if it is felt that the risks of the
                       procedure outweigh the severity of the disease.

                    -  All mutation testing will be performed on NIAID protocols (such as 07-I-0033
                       -Detection and Characterization of Infections and Infection Susceptibility;
                       PI: Steve Holland), with genetic counseling and education through these
                       established protocols.

               2. Clinical history of at least two of the following:

                    -  Life-threatening, organ-threatening, or severely disfiguring infection

                    -  Protracted or recurrent infections requiring unusually long or repeated
                       courses of antibiotics

                    -  Infection with an opportunistic organism

                    -  Chronic elevation in the blood (greater than or equal to 2 documented
                       elevations over a period of 6 months or longer) of a latent virus (EBV, CMV,
                       HHV6, HHV8, etc.)

                    -  Evidence of immune dysregulation, as manifested by autoimmune disease,
                       atopy, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome,
                       granulomas, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy

                    -  Patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation
                       syndrome related to an underlying lymphoma with no other clinical history
                       suggestive of a primary immunodeficiency will not be eligible

                    -  Hypogammaglobulinemia, dysglobulinemia, or impaired response to vaccination

                    -  Hematologic malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder

                    -  Tissue diagnosis should be confirmed by NCI Department of Pathology, if
                       prior biopsies are available

                    -  Virus-associated solid tumor malignancy or pre-cancerous lesion

                    -  Tissue diagnosis should be confirmed by NCI Departmentof Pathology, if prior
                       biopsies are available

          -  Availability of at least one 9-10/10 HLA-matched related (excluding an identical twin)
             or unrelated donor, or an HLA-haploidentical related donor

          -  Consensus among the PI, key AIs, and consultants (as necessary) that correction of the
             patient s immune system through BMT has the potential to improve the patient s health,
             quality of life, and/or life expectancy, after taking into consideration the patient s
             existing non-hematopoietic, potentially irreversible organ dysfunction

          -  Adequate end-organ function, as measured by:

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 40% by 2D
                  echocardiogram (ECHO) or MUGA, or left ventricular shortening fraction greater
                  than or equal to 20% by ECHO for patients receiving MAC, RIC, or RIC-MMF, or LVEF
                  greater than or equal to 30% if the patient has radiologic evidence of aortic,
                  renal, or coronary artery vasculitis. LVEF greater than or equal to 30% for
                  patients receiving IOC.

               -  Pulmonary function tests: DL(co) (corrected for hemoglobin) and FEV(1) greater
                  than or equal to 50% of predicted for the MAC arm, greater than or equal to 40%
                  of predicted for the RIC and RIC-MMF arms, and greater than or equal to 30%
                  predicted for the IOC arm; or in pediatric patients, if unable to perform
                  pulmonary function tests, there should be no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no
                  requirement for supplemental oxygen, and oxygen saturation &gt;92% on room air.
                  Calculations will be based on the USA-ITS-NIH reference.

               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert s syndrome or
                  hemolysis) for patients receiving MAC, RIC or RIC-MMF and bilirubin less than or
                  equal to 5.0 mg/dL for patients receiving IOC (unless due to Gilbert s syndrome
                  or hemolysis). ALT and AST less than or equal to 5 times ULN for patients
                  receiving MAC or ALT and AST less than or equal to 10 times ULN for patients
                  receiving RIC, RIC-MMFor IOC. Patients who are above these bilirubin, ALT, or AST
                  thresholds may be eligible for the RIC, RIC-MMF or IOC arms if evaluated by a
                  hepatologist who deems the liver function test abnormalities to be potentially
                  reversible with bone marrow transplant.

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 40 mL/min/1.73 m(2),
                  calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for adults and Schwartz formula for
                  pediatric patients, for patients with creatinine levels above the institutional
                  upper limit of normal

          -  Adequate central venous access potential

          -  Karnofsky or Lansky performance status of greater than or equal to 60% or ECOG
             performance status of 2 or less

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document

          -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding. As therapeutic agents used in this trial may be harmful
             to a fetus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for at least one year post-allo BMT. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in the study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Disease status: Patients with malignancy are to be referred in remission for
             evaluation, except in cases of virus-associated malignancy who may be referred at any
             time. Should a patient have progressive disease or a donor becomes unavailable after
             enrollment, the patient will be referred back to his/her primary
             hematologist-oncologist for treatment. If this course of action is not in the best
             interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI, then the patient
             may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease under the current study,
             although this should only occur as a bridge to transplant. If under either of these
             settings, it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to
             transplant, then he/she must come off the study. Patients receiving standard therapy
             will be told about the therapy, associated risks, potential benefits, alternatives to
             the proposed therapy, and the availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere,
             outside of a research protocol.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, with the exception of
             virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation
             prior to allo BMT.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to agents (cyclophosphamide, busulfan, pentostatin, sirolimus, MMF, G-CSF)
             used in the study

          -  Active psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with the transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy, except in cases of
             virus-associated malignancies with CNS involvement in which case the patient may
             benefit from the transplant to control the malignancy.

          -  HIV positive or other acquired immunodeficiency that, as determined by the PI,
             interferes with the assessment of PID severity and/or the attribution of clinical
             manifestations of immunodeficiency to a PID.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - DONOR:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 4 and weight of greater than or equal to 15 kg.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of 90-100% (adults) or Lansky Play Performance Status of
             100% (children).

          -  Related donors with at least a haplotype at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci that is
             shared with the recipient by high resolution typing, excluding an identical twin or
             unrelated donors matched 9-10/10 at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution
             typing

          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative to understand and the
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document; medically fit and willing to
             donate

          -  Related donors for recipients who have monogenetic mutations must be unaffected. For
             recipients with de novo mutations, testing of related donors is largely not required,
             but is recommended in all cases and is required when the donor is the child of the
             recipient. Mutation testing needs to be performed by a CLIA-certified lab, if such
             testing is available. For donors who carry one mutated allele of a PID which is
             inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked fashion, the donor must have no
             discernable symptomatology or penetrance of the mutation suggesting that they are
             affected carriers. This should be verified through disease-appropriate quantitative
             and functional assays to assess the function of the potential donor s immune system
             (e.g. whole blood EBV DNA qPCR, NKG2D activity, TBNK panel, and quantitative
             immunoglobulin levels for a female carrier of the MAGT1 mutation that causes X-linked
             immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia
             (XMEN)). Furthermore, the X-chromosome inactivation pattern should be assessed for
             female carriers of X-linked diseases if they are considered as potential donors to
             confirm favorable and complete lyonization of hematopoietic cells. For PIDs inherited
             in an autosomal dominant fashion, donors who have one mutated allele for the recipient
             s disease will be considered ineligible to donate, regardless of the donor s
             phenotype. Additional blood tests may be required to assess for quantitative and/or
             qualitative defects in the donor s immune system, particularly in cases where PID
             mutation testing is not available or the PID mutation is not identified.

             --A NIAID protocol (07-I-0033, Detection and Characterization of Infections and
             Infection Susceptibility, PI: Steve Holland) is already in place and will handle all
             the genetic/genomic analysis for recipients and potential donors on this protocol,
             including the management of results, genetic counseling, and education.

          -  Related donors: No history of opportunistic infections, autoimmunity,
             hemoglobinopathy, red cell enzymopathy, or malignancy, apart from nonmelanomatous skin
             cancer or healed cervical cancer in situ.

          -  HIV negative, hepatitis B virus surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C virus
             antibody negative.

          -  Related donors undergoing bone marrow harvest should be deemed fit for the operative
             procedure and related donors undergoing apheresis should be deemed fit for the
             collection procedure.

          -  Related donors will undergo the Donor Health History Screen by skilled staff in the
             Blood Services Section for adult donors and age-appropriate questioning when indicated
             for pediatric donors to determine donor eligibility using standard DTM criteria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - DONOR:

          -  Donors must not be pregnant. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective
             method of contraception, including one or more of the following: intrauterine device,
             hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy,
             partner s vasectomy, barrier methods (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or
             abstinence from the day of signing consent through day +60 of the recipient s
             allo-BMT.

          -  History of a psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise
             compliance with the transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate
             informed consent.

          -  Other medical constraints that in the opinion of the PI constitute exclusion.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - UNRELATED DONOR:

        -Unrelated donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies and
        Procedures, available at:
        http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Global-transplant-network/Standards/, except for the
        additional requirement of EBV serostatus testing. Note that participation in this study is
        offered to all unrelated donors but not required for clinical donation, so it is possible
        that not all unrelated donors will enroll on this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - UNRELATED DONOR:

        -Unrelated donors: failure to qualify as a National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) donor per
        current NMDP Standards, available at:
        http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Global-transplant-network/Standards/.
