  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to confirm the efficacy of Holoclar at one year after the first
      treatment in patients suffering from moderate to severe LSCD (Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency)
      secondary to ocular burns. In case of failure of the treatment and upon clinical indication
      of the Principal Investigator, a second transplant with Holoclar will be offered if
      eligibility will be confirmed. The efficacy of two treatments with Holoclar at one year after
      the last treatment will be also evaluated. All patients will be followed-up for 12 months
      after each implant to determine the treatment efficacy by an Independent Assessor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicentre, prospective, open label, uncontrolled clinical trial.

      Patients will be screened according to the Study Inclusion and Exclusion criteria and will be
      candidates for the ACLSCT if all eligibility criteria are met.

      Patients then will undergo limbal biopsy for the collection of limbal stem cells for product
      manufacturing. The confirmation of the eligibility criteria is followed by a roll-in phase of
      approximately 6 months. At the end of the roll-in period, Holoclar will be implanted through
      a specific surgical procedure.

      After ACLSCT, efficacy assessments will be performed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for both
      first and second treatment (the latter only when applicable). One year after the
      transplantation, efficacy will be adjudicated by two independent assessors (primary and key
      secondary endpoints) and the study completion will be reached when 1 year of follow-up after
      the last transplant in the last patient will be accomplished.
