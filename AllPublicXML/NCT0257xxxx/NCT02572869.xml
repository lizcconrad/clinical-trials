  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the functional and esthetic outcomes in patients who
      had removal of a part of the lower jaw bone due to mouth cancer and reconstruction of the jaw
      bone with a bone ( fibula) from the leg at MSKCC between the years 1987 to 2014.

    <description>Patients will be examined by the treating physician or his/her designee (Fellow). The examining physician will complete an 11-item clinical examination form about the patient's clinical function. This examination assesses lip competence, tongue movement, oral mucosa, dental state, mouth opening, speech, drooling, diet, appearance, oral sensation, and shoulder movement. Where appropriate, the physician will ask the patient questions regarding items on the questionnaire to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the outcome assessment.</description>

    <description>The participating patients will be asked to complete three questionnaires:
(1) The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Head and Neck questionnaire (EORTC H&amp;N 35) to assess their quality of life as it relates to their mandible function and aesthetic appearance (2) The EORTC QLQ-C30, which assesses overall health-related quality of life (3) The FACE-Q Oncology Module: Mandibulectomy, which contains questions regarding both functional and aesthetic outcomes.</description>
