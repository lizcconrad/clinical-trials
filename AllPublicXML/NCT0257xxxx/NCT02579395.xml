  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a 6-week experimental design, up to 90 adult couples in which one partner has Type 2
      Diabetes (T2D) will be randomly assigned to either the collaborative implementation
      intentions (Collaborative IIs), the Individual Implementation Intentions (Individual IIs)
      condition, or the control condition. As this is a pilot study, randomization for the
      experimental groups vs the control groups will occur at a 2:1 ratio. Thus, the experimental
      conditions will contain up to 36 participants and the control condition will contain up to 18
      participants. Adults with T2D who are living with a romantic partner, not meeting current
      physical activity guidelines but able and willing to begin a new physical activity (PA)
      routine and their partners will be assessed at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks after the
      experimental manipulation. Partners will report on their own investment in the patient's goal
      and patients will report on their own PA self-efficacy. Patient's PA will be measured through
      self-report, partner report and accelerometers for a week prior to each survey assessment.
      These specific aims are planned:

      AIM 1: Determine whether collaborative IIs for patient's PA lead to a greater increase in
      partner investment in partners of adults with T2D than do individual IIs or control.

      AIM 2: Determine whether collaborative IIs for patient's PA lead to a greater increase in
      patient PA self-efficacy in adults with T2D than do individual IIs or control.

      AIM 3: Determine whether collaborative IIs for patient's PA lead to a greater increase in
      patient PA in adults with T2D than do individual IIs or control.

    <measure>Physical Activity Self-Efficacy via a self efficacy scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity self-efficacy will be measured using the self-efficacy for exercise scale (SEE; Resnick &amp; Jenkins, 2000). This 9-item, self-report scale assesses participant's confidence that they could exercise three times per week for 20 minutes under various circumstances (e.g. &quot;you had to exercise alone&quot;; &quot;you felt tired&quot;). Respondents are asked to rate items on a scale from 1, (not at all confident), to 10 (extremely confident).</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Partner Investment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Partner Investment Scale assesses the degree to which the partner in a couple defines the patient engaging in regular physical activity as a shared responsibility as well as the degree to which they are taking action to address barriers to the patient engaging in physical activity . The 9 items selected were modified to be specific to engaging in regular physical activity. Participants are asked to rate their agreement each item on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Example items include &quot;If/when my partner decides to engage in regular physical activity , the responsibility will be his or hers alone.&quot;, &quot;My partner and I are able to have useful discussions about how to engage in regular physical activity .&quot; and &quot;In the long run, my partner and I are able to work together toward helping one or both of us maintain a regular physical activity routine&quot;.</description>
