  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a non-communicable chronic disease of multifactorial, involving biological,
      historical, ecological, economic, social, cultural and political. Currently, bariatric
      surgery is considered an effective method of refractory obesity treatment, and only severe
      obesity effective treatment that leads to reduced long-term weight. It is well documented in
      the literature regarding the association of abdominal surgery and the incidence of
      respiratory complications and its main characteristics are: atelectasis, pneumonia,
      respiratory dysfunction and pleural effusion. All these respiratory complications can be
      minimized or avoided with the use of a respiratory therapy care protocol, since the pulmonary
      atelectasis is considered the main cause of complications. An arsenal of resources to
      physical therapy lung expansion, among these, the application of positive pressure through a
      valve EPAP (Expiratory positive airway Pressure) and the use of noninvasive ventilation, and
      aims to prevent and / or improve the complications resulting from postoperative. The
      electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an alternate to allow assessment of the respiratory
      system, without suffering the same interference conditions of patients, such as pain and bed
      rest. TIE consists of a method that measures passively regional lung ventilation. The aim of
      this study is to compare the effects of the application of EPAP and NIV on pulmonary
      ventilation we post bariatric surgery. This is a randomized controlled trial where patients
      will be divided into two groups: EPAP and NIV and assessed by spirometry, manometer and TIE.
      The techniques will be applied in the 1st and 2nd postoperative day where they will be
      evaluated before, during and after the application of the techniques.
