    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a documented diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease, as documented by
             deficient glucocerebrosidase (GCB) activity in leukocytes (whole blood only) or
             cultured skin fibroblasts. Diagnosis by only dry blood spot test is insufficient.
             Diagnosis may be based on results obtained prior to Screening if documented in the
             patient's medical history.

          2. Patients must have a lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score &lt; -1 or BMD
             T-score of &lt; -1 as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) during the
             screening phase.

          3. Patient is treatment-naïve: should not have received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
             or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) in the 12 months prior to enrollment.

          4. The patient is greater than or equal to (≥) 18 and less than or equal to (≤)70 years
             of age.

          5. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable
             method of contraception at all times during the study.

          6. The patient, or patient's legally authorized representative(s), if applicable,
             understands the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study and has provided
             written informed consent that has been approved by the Institutional Review
             Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).

          7. The patient must be sufficiently cooperative to participate in this clinical study as
             judged by the investigator.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Neurological symptoms indicating that the patient may have type 3 Gaucher disease.

          2. A significant comorbidity, which, as determined by the investigator, might compromise
             study assessment, affect study data or confound the study results (eg, malignancies,
             primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune liver disease, etc).

          3. Any osteoporosis-specific treatment (eg, bisphosphonates) or treatment with
             erythropoietin (or erythropoietin-like substances) during the past year.

          4. Structural, joint-associated bone damage of such extent and severity that the
             investigator deems it could impact participation in the study and assessment of
             relevant study endpoints (eg, pain).

          5. The patient is pregnant or lactating.

          6. The patient has had a splenectomy.

          7. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical
             investigations or use of any investigational product (drug or device) within 30 days
             prior to study enrollment or at any time during the study.

          8. Severe vitamin D deficiency to the level that would be expected to result in
             osteomalacia [vitamin D &lt; 10 nanogram per mililitre (ng/mL) (25 nanomoles per litre
             (nmol/L)]. If there is mild vitamin D insufficiency at screening [vitamin D &gt; 10 and &lt;
             30 ng/mL] treat with 4000 International Unit (IU) vitamin D per day for 1 month and
             rescreen.

          9. The patient has previously interrupted ERT for safety reasons.

         10. The patient has had hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the
             excipients.
