      Introduction:

      Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by deficits in three functional domains: language
      and communication, social reciprocity, and the presence of restricted interests/repetitive
      behaviors. There's also deficits in social cognition. When having a face-to-face
      conversation, a listener not only hears what a speaker is saying, but also sees the
      articulatory gestures that accompany those sounds. Speech signals needs then a multisensory
      processing. Impairments in multisensory perceptual binding may be particularly relevant in
      ASD, given that hallmark features of the disorder include difficulties in speech,
      communication, and social interactions.

      Objectives:

      The investigator suggest that atypical multisensory processing in ASD may have an impact on
      speech perception and social processing.

      Aims:

      Methods:

      This pilot study measures free recall scores in 3 lists of words presentation after 30
      minutes. In the first condition (CI) words are only listening. In the second condition (CII)
      words are associated with a picture of a mans face. In the third condition (CIII) words are
      associated with a video of a man speaking. Three lists are homogeneous form words
      characteristics (lexical frequency, emotional valence norm, imageability). Participants were
      7- to 13-year-olds typically developing children (TD) (N = 19) and ASD children (N = 19).

      The investigator would create some new tools for exploring the treatment of a social
      information. These tools should be the closest of a ecological social interaction.
