      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of on-demand therapy with
      CDFR0812-15/25mg and CDFR0812-15/50mg compared to on-demand therapy with single-drug
      administration of Clomipramine HCl 15mg in Korean Male Patients Diagnosed with Premature
      Ejaculation

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clomipramine is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and is a potent
      inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Clomipramine may be used in a variety of
      indications. Condencia Tab contains low dose of 15mg of clomipramine HCl as an active
      ingredient, which is newly approved to market for the treatment of premature ejaculation.
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, active-control, 3-treatment arm,
      parallel, multi-center clinical trial. Approximately a total of 297 male patients diagnosed
      with premature ejaculation will be enrolled and randomized into 3 groups (99 subjects per a
      group).

      The efficacy of oral administration of Clomipramine HCl will be investigated closely compared
      to the effects after oral administration of CDFR0812-15/25mg and CDFR0812-15/50mg.

      The secondary object is to investigate general safety of oral administration of
      CDFR0812-15/25mg and CDFR0812-15/50mg.
