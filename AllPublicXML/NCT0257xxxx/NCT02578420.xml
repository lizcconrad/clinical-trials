  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, very little is known about the mechanisms of open-label placebo treatment and there
      is a lack in highly controlled experimental designs. Therefore, the planned project will test
      well-established explanatory models of (deceptive) placebo, i.e., (1) expectancy, (2) meaning
      response, in an open-label placebo design, investigating their influence on placebo
      analgesia.

      The current project will consist of one experimental study and one qualitative study:

        1. the effects of open-label, and deceptive placebo administration on placebo analgesia
           will be directly compared when both groups have a comparable expectancy-inducing
           scientific rationale;

        2. subjective meaning models will be assessed by comparing subjective narratives of the
           placebo effect in open-label and deceptive placebo groups in a nested qualitative study.

      The experimental study will be a randomized experiment with healthy subjects (N=120), and
      pain will be induced using a standardized heat pain paradigm (Medoc, Ramatishai, Israel;
      thermo-sensory analyzer (TSA)-II). Effects of the experimental conditions will be assessed
      both objectively (i.e. heat pain threshold and tolerance) and subjectively (i.e. subjective
      pain ratings, pain intensity and unpleasantness). Furthermore, investigators will randomly
      select 30 participants to take part in a nested qualitative study in order to qualitatively
      assess the meaning response by comparing subjective narratives of the placebo effect in the
      open-label and deceptive placebo groups, as well as in the control group.

    <description>Participants (N=40) will have the information that they are receiving an inert cream (i.e. &quot;placebo&quot;). Placebo will be described as an inert or inactive cream, with no medication in it. Additionally, participants will be told that &quot;placebo has been shown in rigorous clinical testing to produce significant mind-body self-healing processes.&quot; The placebo administration will be combined with the following scientific rationale/verbal suggestion: (a) placebos are effective analgesics, (b) classical conditioning as a possible mechanism of this effect, (c) compliance is important for outcome and (d) positive expectations increase placebo effects, but are not necessary.</description>
