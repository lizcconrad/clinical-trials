      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of selinexor when give together
      with standard chemotherapy, high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, in treating
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Selinexor may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving selinexor together with standard chemotherapy may be a better
      treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor to combine with high dose
      cytarabine (HiDAC)+mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete remission (CR) rate following the induction chemotherapy regimen
      of combination of selinexor with HiDAC and mitoxantrone.

      II. To determine the toxicities of the combination regimen during induction, consolidation
      and maintenance.

      III. To determine recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival rates during
      consolidation and maintenance treatment.

      IV. Allogeneic (Allo)-stem cell transplant (SCT) success rate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor clearance of minimal residual disease (MRD) by Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) after induction, consolidation, 6 and 12 months on maintenance
      treatment.

      II. To monitor leukemia initiating cells clearance during the treatment and to characterize
      the leukemia initiating cells at disease relapse.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of selinexor followed by a dose expansion
      study.

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      per standard of care on days 1 and 5, and selinexor orally (PO) on days 2, 4, 9, and 11.
      Induction treatment continues for up to 56 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving remission may undergo allogeneic stem cell
      transplant or proceed to consolidation chemotherapy.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine per standard of care on
      days 1, 3, and 5, and selinexor PO on days 2, 4, 9, and 11. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients achieving at least stable disease after consolidation
      chemotherapy may receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at the discretion of principal
      investigator. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then up to 1
      year.
