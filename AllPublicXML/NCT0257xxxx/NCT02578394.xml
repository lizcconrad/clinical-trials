      The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of running a phase III double-blind,
      double-dummy randomised controlled trial comparing Depo-Medrone 120mg intramuscular injection
      vs. Anakinra 100mg subcutaneous injection for 5 days for the treatment of acute gout attacks
      in patients with chronic kidney disease as defined by a eGFR &lt; 60mls/min/1.73m2 and ≥
      30mls/min/1.73m2.

    <textblock>
      Gout is a common condition that affects 1 in 40 people in the UK. It causes painful &quot;attacks&quot;
      of joint swelling, redness and tenderness, mostly affecting the foot, ankle, knee, hand and
      wrist. It is common in people with kidney disease, who also tend to be older people with
      other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes. The
      investigators do not know the safest and best way to treat gout attacks in this increasing
      cohort of people. A lot of people are given treatment that can worsen their kidney disease,
      along with their other medical conditions.

      The investigators want to compare the safest treatment currently available, steroids, with a
      new treatment called Anakinra. This treatment stops the action of a chemical called
      interleukin-1 which has been discovered to play an important role in gout attacks. This
      treatment has already been used to treat gout attacks in a handful of patients with kidney
      disease. The investigators feel it may be a better alternative to steroid treatment which can
      sometime worsen diabetes, heart disease and blood pressure. Participants will predominantly
      be followed-up for one week and a final 8 week follow-up, and be recruited from hospitals in
      the East of England.

      A definitive scientific study comparing these two treatments would involve a big expensive
      study requiring large numbers of patients and large amounts of information to be collected.
      Before the investigators do a big study like this, the investigators want to perform a small
      study using a smaller number of patients (32 patients) over a period of 22 months in total.
      It will then give us information to plan a larger study to answer the question of which
      treatment may be better, safer and provides the most value for money for the NHS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects capable of giving informed consent.

          2. Male or non-pregnant, non-nursing female

          3. ≥ 18 years of age

          4. eGFR &lt; 60mls/min/1.73m2 and ≥ 30mls/min/1.73m2 as calculated using serum creatinine
             and modified MDRD formula as per renal association guidelines.

          5. Diagnosis of gout arthritis as defined by the American College of Rheumatology 1977
             preliminary criteria (this criteria is currently endorsed by NICE guidelines).

          6. Gout flare less ≤ 36 hours

          7. Baseline pain intensity &gt; or equal to 50mm on the 0-100 mm VAS. In the case of
             multiple joints (≤ 3), the most affected joint will be assessed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with NSAIDS in last 48 hours, systemic steroids in last 4 weeks or
             colchicine within 7 days.

          2. Polyarticular gout, i.e. affecting four or more 4 joints

          3. Rheumatoid arthritis, evidence/suspicion of infectious/septic arthritis, or other
             acute inflammatory arthritis such as systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective
             tissue disease, scleroderma, polymyositis, or significant systemic involvement
             secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.

             arthritis (RA), reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, seronegative
             spondyloarthropathy, Lyme disease). Concurrent medication for RA like methotrexate and

         12. Known positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C (HCV) antibody
             or HIV.

               -  Sexual abstinence

         14. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (highly
             sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test after a confirmed menstrual period) within 7
             days prior to treatment initiation. Subjects are considered not of child bearing
             potential if they are surgically sterile (i.e. they have undergone a hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal.

         15. Females must not be breastfeeding.

         16. Patients who have had treatment as part of this trial cannot have repeat treatment for
             another flare as part of the trial.

         17. Patient with allergies to excipients of IMPs: citric acid, anhydrous, sodium chloride,
             disodium edetate dehydrate, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide. Hypersensitivity to E.
             Coli derived proteins, egg proteins and soy proteins. Patients with a latex allergy
             are also not eligible as the inner needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry
             natural rubber (a derivative of latex).
