  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation is effective in
      the treatment of clinical signs, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress due to
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

    <textblock>
      This randomized double blind clinical trial will be performed on 90 patients (45 in
      intervention and 45 in control group) diagnosed with IBS. The intervention group will receive
      50000 IU vitamin D3 and the control group will receive placebo contains edible paraffin once
      every 2 weeks for six months. Variables including biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative
      stress, serum levels of calcium and vitamin D, anthropometric indicators and blood pressure
      will be measured at baseline and end of the study. The investigators will use Rome III
      questionnaire for evaluating the clinical signs of the disease. The questionnaires will be
      filled out at baseline and every 2 weeks by the patients for six months.
