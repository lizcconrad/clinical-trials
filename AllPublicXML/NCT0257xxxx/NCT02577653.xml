    <textblock>
      Determine the posturographic characteristics of eccentric, isometric and concentric movements
      in healthy subjects as well as in subjects with chronic, orthopedic conditions / pain not
      involving the lower extremities. The squatting movement (going down from a stand up position,
      bending the ankle, knee and hip joints, and then returning to the stand up position, while
      not lifting the feet from the supporting ground surface) is a simple motion that involves all
      three types of movements: eccentric (the going down), isometric (holding the down position
      for a couple of seconds) and concentric (the coming up). It is hypothesized that non-healthy
      subjects will not have &quot;smooth&quot; movements, and posturography could be used to separate
      between healthy and non-healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) testing using the modified
      Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in Balance (mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects will be
      required to stand on a hard or compliant surface (a 4&quot; tall foam cushion of known mechanical
      properties) in a comfortable posture, feet shoulder width, with eyes open or closed, head
      straight and arms to the side and free to move, gazing forward, and breathing normally.
      Subsequently, subjects will be asked to stand first on the right leg and then on the left
      leg, raising the other leg (flexing the hip about 45 degrees), bending (flexing) the knee 90
      degrees, keeping the arms extended and moving them laterally (abduct shoulders to 45 degrees
      and extend both elbows) to help maintaining balance with eyes open. Finally, subjects will be
      asked to perform 10 repetition of the squatting movement, with the operator pacing them
      (telling them when to start and when to stop the movements). The results of the mCTSIB,
      combined with an initial physical and neurological examination will be used to classify the
      subjects into the healthy and non healthy group.
