  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 2-part study. PART 1 is an open-label, randomized, food effect study of
      AG-120. Subjects will be enrolled to a fed/fasted or fasted/fed treatment sequence in a
      2-period crossover design. PART 2 is an open-label study to determine the safety and PK
      parameters of a single 1000-mg oral dose of AG-120.

             history, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs

          4. fasted clinical laboratory values within the normal reference range for the test
             laboratory, unless deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator. (Calcium,
             magnesium, and potassium levels within normal ranges)

          5. negative test for selected drugs of abuse and cotinine at Screening (does not include
             alcohol) and at Check-in of Period 1 (Parts 1 and 2) and Period 2 (Part 1) (does
             include alcohol via breathalyzer)

          6. negative hepatitis panel (including hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus
             antibody) and negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody screens

          7. female subjects with reproductive potential must agree to undergo medically supervised
             pregnancy test prior to study drug administration. Pregnancy tests will be performed
             at Screening and confirmed negative at each Check-in

          8. females of reproductive potential must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse or to

             consent, during the study, and for 90 days following the last dose of AG-120.

          9. males must either be sterile or agree to use 2 of the following approved methods of
             contraception from time of giving informed consent until 90 days following the last
             dose administration. Subjects will refrain from sperm donation from time of giving
             informed consent until 90 days following the last dose administration

             begin a new exercise program nor participate in any unusually strenuous physical
             exertion)

         12. poor peripheral venous access

         13. donation of blood or plasma within 8 weeks before first dose administration through
             Study Completion

         14. receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to initial Check-in and for at least
