  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancer and their caregivers face many challenges. These include
      learning about cancer and its treatment, coping with symptoms from illness and treatment side
      effects, making adjustments to usual activities, and managing the emotional effects of having
      a serious illness. This study tests whether different forms of education and support can help
      family caregivers feel better prepared. To find out if education about caregiving and
      different kinds of support are effective, this study wants to compare approaches.One group
      includes caregivers who will receive an education and support program throughout radiation
      treatment in addition to usual care by their doctors and nurses. The other group receives an
      educational booklet about caregiving in addition to usual care by their doctors and nurses.
      The caregiver also completes surveys about his or her emotions, distress, confidence as a
      care giver, and quality of life. In addition, the study asks the caregiver questions about
      his or her age, race, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, education, annual
      household income, and current living arrangements. This pilot study will only be offered at
      the Case Medical Center, University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive
      Cancer Center Main Campus.

      Aim 1: Conduct a pilot test of the effects of a novel caregiver intervention, as compared to
      a control group, on family caregiver self-efficacy for caregiving, anxiety, depression, and
      health-related quality of life.

      Aim 2: Explore the acceptability of a caregiver intervention that utilizes simulation.

      Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of the intervention. Aim 4: Describe the incidence of patient
      events that may be impacted by caregiver self-efficacy, such as acute care visits, admissions
      to the hospital, visits to the emergency department, need for fluids in the radiation
      oncology department, and interrupted treatment course.
