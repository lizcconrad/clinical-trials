    <textblock>
      Batefenterol inhalation powder is currently under development as a fixed-dose combination
      with fluticasone furoate (FF) for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD).

      The present study will administer batefenterol/FF (300/100 micrograms [mcg]) for the first
      time to subjects with COPD, to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination
      compared with placebo, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles of
      the individual components when administered in combination.

      This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel
      group study. Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to one of the following double-blind treatment
      groups:

      Batefenterol/FF 300/100 mcg inhalation powder once daily, or matching placebo inhalation
      powder once daily.

      Subjects will self-administer the study treatments once daily (QD) in the morning for 42 days
      via a multi-dose dry powder inhaler (DPI) which contains two blister strips. Additionally, an
      inhaled short acting beta2-receptor agonist, albuterol will be provided from screening to the
      end of the treatment period for all subjects to use as needed to relieve COPD symptoms. At
      the end of the treatment period, subjects can resume conventional therapy.

      The study will randomize approximately 60 subjects. The total duration of subject
      participation (from screening to follow-up) will be approximately 8 weeks.

    <description>ECG measurements were taken in supine position after obtaining vital signs. Weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under the curve (AUC), and then dividing by the relevant time interval. Baseline was the pre-dose measurement on Day 1. Change from Baseline in 0 to 4 hours post-dose weighted mean heart rate was measured on Days 1, 28 and 42 and was analyzed using a mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) model. Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population: all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication.</description>

        male is the sole partner for that subject These allowed methods of contraception are only
        effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The
        investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these
        methods of contraception.

          -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): An established clinical history of COPD
             in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European

             smoking of &gt;= 10 pack-years at Visit 1. Former smokers are defined as those who have
             stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.

        Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (for
        example, 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years both
        equal 10 pack-years).

        Note: Pipe and cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD).

             in remission for &lt;5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has
             been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the

          -  Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT): Oxygen therapy prescribed for greater than 12
             hours a day. As-needed oxygen use (that is, =&lt;12 hours per day) is not exclusionary.

          -  Nebulized Therapy: Regular use (prescribed for use every day, not for as-needed use)
             of short-acting bronchodilators (for example, albuterol) via nebulized therapy.

          -  Lung Resection: Lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Visit 1.

             polymerase chain reaction test is obtained.

          -  Abnormal and clinically significant findings from 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
             performed at Visit 1. Site investigators will be provided with ECG over-read conducted
             by a centralized independent cardiologist, to assist in evaluation of subject
             eligibility. For this study, an abnormal and clinically significant ECG that would
             preclude a subject from entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is
             interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following:

        height of the corresponding R wave, providing the R wave was &gt;0.5 mV [5 mm with 10 mm/mV
        setting], appearing in at least two contiguous leads (Note: prior evidence [that is, ECG
        obtained at least 12 months prior) of pathological Q waves that are unchanged are not
        exclusionary; and the investigator will determine if the subject is precluded from entering
        the study) Evidence of ventricular ectopic couplets, bigeminy, trigeminy or multifocal
        premature ventricular complexes.

        Fridericia's method (QTc[F]) &gt;=450 msec or an ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements
        (for example, poor defined termination of the T wave) For subjects with complete right
        bundle branch block: QTc(F) &gt;=480msec or an ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (for
        example, poor defined termination of the T wave) (Note: All potentially exclusionary QT
        measurements should be confirmed by two additional readings at least 5 minutes apart) ST-T
        wave abnormalities (excluding non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities) (Note: prior evidence
        (that is, ECG obtained at least 12 months prior) of ST-T waves that are unchanged are not
        exclusionary and the investigator will determine if the subject is precluded from entering
        the study) Clinically significant conduction abnormalities (for example,

      <recruitment_details>This study consisted of 1-week run-in period, 6-week (42-day) treatment period and 1-week follow-up period. Eligible participants (par.) were randomized (2:1) to either batefenterol (BAT)/fluticasone furoate (FF) 300/100 micrograms (µg) or a placebo in double blinded treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 62 participants withn an established clinical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug (forming the Intent-to-Treat Population), out of which 7 participants were withdrawn from the study.</pre_assignment_details>
