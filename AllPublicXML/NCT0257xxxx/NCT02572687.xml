      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of ramucirumab plus MEDI4736 in
      participants with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal or
      thoracic malignancies including gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma,
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
