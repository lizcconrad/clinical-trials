  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess normal values of the cross-sectional area of
      peripheral nerves and nerve roots in children and adolescents between 2 and 18 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective clinical trial to determine standard values of the
      cross-sectional area of the median, ulnar, radial, peroneal, tibial, sural and vagus nerve as
      well as C5, C6 and C7 cervical roots in a cohort of neuromuscular unaffected children and
      adolescents between 2 and 18 years.
