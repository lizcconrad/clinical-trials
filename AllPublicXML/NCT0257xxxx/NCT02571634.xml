      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and safety of
      intranasal fentanyl (Lazanda) as an alternative to the current gold standard (diazepam) to
      produce anxiolysis and improve patient comfort during and after radiofrequency ablations of
      the lumbar facet joints. If this pilot study shows a positive effect and Lazanda is found to
      be feasible and safe for use during procedures, future larger scale studies can be done.

      The morning of the procedure/procedures the medication will be obtained from the omnicel by
      one of the qualified pain clinic study staff for the volunteers that have consented for that
      day. . It will be signed out on the designated form created for tracking and accountability
      purposes Patient consent for study participation will be confirmed.

      Once in the procedure room a DVPRS (Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale) baseline pain
      score and POSS (Pasero Opioid-induced Sedation Scale) score will be assessed by a member of
      the research team. Baseline non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation
      will be documented and continuous monitoring of these vital signs will commence by a provider
      credentialed by WAMC (Womack Army Medical Center) to perform anxiolysis with documentation
      every 15 minutes until discharge. A qualified RN (Registered Nurse), or physician will
      administer 100 mcg of Lazanda ten-fifteen minutes prior to the procedure The administration
      will be witnessed and confirmed on Appendix D. The unused 7 mcg will be wasted in a charcoal
      filled bag provided by the manufacturer and that bag will be disposed of per hospital policy.
      The waste will also be witnessed and noted. The Pasero Opioid-Induced Sedation Scale and a
      DVPRS pain score will be assessed every 15 minutes through the conclusion of the procedure
      and every 15 minutes up until discharge or for 1 hour post procedure whichever comes first.
      If naloxone is required during the procedure this will be noted as well. Any adverse or
      serious adverse events will be reported per regulatory regulations.

    <description>DVPRS pain scores will be recorded baseline and at 15 minutes post dosing, 30 minutes, 45 minutes and discharge. The DVPRS is a pain scale utilizing color coding descriptive terms and faces to describe pain levels from 0 meaning no pain and 10 the most excruciating pain ever.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>At 24 hour after the procedure a call was made asking the volunteer to provide a number on a scale to describe their satisfaction with their pain control and their overall satisfaction. A 5 point likert scale was used 1 = very satisfied, 2 satisfied, 3 neither satisfied nor dis-satisfied, 4 not satisfied and 5 very unsatisfied.</description>

    <description>At baseline, 15 minutes post medication receipt, 30 minutes , 45 minutes and at discharge a Pasero-Opioid Sedation Scale Score was obtained. This scale is to measure alertness and amount of sedation. POSS was the abbreviated term used for this scale. The guidelines for that scale include: S= sleeping easily aroused 1= alert and awake; 2= slightly drowsy easily aroused; 3= frequently drowsy, drifts off to sleep during conversation; 4= somnolent, minimal or no response</description>
