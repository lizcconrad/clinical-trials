      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new sport concept of the Swiss Armed
      Forces influences the physical and psychological fitness of the recruits.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physical and psychological demands in the Swiss Army basic military service are high.
      Injury incidences in Swiss Army training schools are higher than in armed forces of other
      countries.There is evidence that progressive loading of physical demands at the beginning of
      basic military service and specific physical training can reduce injury incidences and
      attrition rates. A new sport concept by the Swiss Army takes into account these results of
      previous studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the influences of this
      new sport concept on the physical and psychological fitness as well as on the injury and
      attrition rates of the recruits.

    <measure>Physical Fitness Measured With the Swiss Physical Fitness Test Battery (SPFTB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 10 and 16 of the basic military training</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Fitness is measured with the Swiss physical fitness test battery (SPFTB).
The SPFTB contains a progressive endurance run, a trunk muscle strength test, a standing long jump, a seated shot put, and a one-leg standing test. From the results of those performance tests (0 to 25 points each), a total fitness score is calculated (sum of all points). The minimum total score (worst result) is 0 points, the maximum total score (best result) is 125 points. A detailed description of the SPFTB can be found in the publication of Wyss, Marti, Rossi, Kohler and Mäder (2007).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 10 and 16 of the basic military training</time_frame>
    <description>2 questionaires concerning resilience were used: The Resilience Scale 11 (Schumacher, Leppert, Gunzelmann, Strauss &amp; Brähler, 2005) and the Brief Resilience Scale (Smith, Dalen, Wiggings, Tooley, Christopher &amp; Bernard, 2008). A mean was calculated for each time point. The total score ranges from 1 (worst result) to 7 (best result).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Military Performance According to Military Marks</measure>
    <time_frame>During the basic military training (18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Military marks are given by superior Army personnel. The total score ranges from 1 (insufficient) to 5 (excellent). In total, three marks are given during the whole basic military training (after 7, 11 and 16 weeks). Data from those three time points are combined in a single value (mean).</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire About Sport Lessons</measure>
    <time_frame>During the whole basic military training (18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of each sport session was registered in a questionnaire by the military personnel. The minimum would be 0 minutes of sport per week, for the maximum the scale is open-ended. Data of sport lessons during the whole basic military are combined and presented as a mean value for each group.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Energy Expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2 - 9 of the basic military training</time_frame>
    <description>Daily energy expenditure was measured using two accelerometers and one heart rate sensor. Data from weeks 2-9 of the basic military were combined and a single value (mean) was calculated for each group.</description>

        <title>Physical Fitness Measured With the Swiss Physical Fitness Test Battery (SPFTB)</title>
        <description>Physical Fitness is measured with the Swiss physical fitness test battery (SPFTB).
The SPFTB contains a progressive endurance run, a trunk muscle strength test, a standing long jump, a seated shot put, and a one-leg standing test. From the results of those performance tests (0 to 25 points each), a total fitness score is calculated (sum of all points). The minimum total score (worst result) is 0 points, the maximum total score (best result) is 125 points. A detailed description of the SPFTB can be found in the publication of Wyss, Marti, Rossi, Kohler and Mäder (2007).</description>
