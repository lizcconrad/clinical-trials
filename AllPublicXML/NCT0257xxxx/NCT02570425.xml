  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to assess the ease of device mastery of a placebo SYMBICORT
      TURBOHALER vs a placebo Budesonide/Formoterol SPIROMAX device among healthcare professionals
      in-training (HCP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify how intuitive devices are to use and what level of
      training is required to ensure that HCPs are able to demonstrate the correct technique. The
      two devices examined will be the SYMBICORT TURBOHALER and placebo Budesonide/Formoterol
      SPIROMAX device among healthcare professionals (HCP).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Maintaining Correct Inhaler Technique for Spiromax Compared With Turbohaler 4 Weeks After Training as Assessed by Expert Assessor</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Examine if recall of device mastery is superior for the SPIROMAX inhaler as compared to the TURBOHALER after training to device mastery on both devices.
The proportion of subjects achieving mastery of inhaler technique between the two inhaler devices was compared using McNemar's test of equality of paired proportions with a 0.050 two- sided significance level. A Conditional Logistic Regression Model was used to quantify the difference between the two inhalers by calculating the odds ratio for achieving mastery for Spiromax® (with Turbohaler® as the reference device) along with a 95% confidence interval for quantifying the precision of the odds ratio estimate.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Maintaining Correct Inhaler Technique for Spiromax Compared With Turbohaler 4 Weeks After Training as Assessed by Expert Assessor</title>
        <description>Examine if recall of device mastery is superior for the SPIROMAX inhaler as compared to the TURBOHALER after training to device mastery on both devices.
The proportion of subjects achieving mastery of inhaler technique between the two inhaler devices was compared using McNemar’s test of equality of paired proportions with a 0.050 two- sided significance level. A Conditional Logistic Regression Model was used to quantify the difference between the two inhalers by calculating the odds ratio for achieving mastery for Spiromax® (with Turbohaler® as the reference device) along with a 95% confidence interval for quantifying the precision of the odds ratio estimate.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Device Mastery at the End of Level 2 Out of a 6 Level Training Process as Assessed by Expert Assessor</title>
        <description>Examined for both at the end of level 2 (out of 6 level training process). This will be compared using McNemar’s test of equality of paired proportions with a 0.050 two- sided significance level. A Conditional Logistic Regression Model was used to quantify the difference between the two inhalers by calculating the odds ratio for achieving mastery for Spiromax® (with Turbohaler® as the reference device) along with a 95% confidence interval for quantifying the precision of the odds ratio estimate.</description>
