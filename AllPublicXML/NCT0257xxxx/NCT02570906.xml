    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the performance of the Zephyr BioPatch in measuring heart rate,
      respiration rate, posture, and activity level compared to reference devices in healthy adult
      subjects during a variety of situations including hospital room movements, talking, and a
      short bout of exercise.
