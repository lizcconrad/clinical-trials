      Primary aim: Evaluating the effect of Asthmatuner on patients´ self-reported asthma control
      test (ACT/C-ACT)compared with conventional asthma management.

      Secondary aim: Evaluating patients´ health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) medical adherence
      by using Asthmatuner compared with conventional management.

      Total sample size: Stratified study population consisting of 43 females and males with
      diagnosed asthma at the age of at least 6 years pediatric specialist care and 43
      females/males in primary care.

      Study design: This is a multi-centre, blinded, randomized controlled, cross-over trial over
      to at least 16 weeks.

      Subjects: Two stratified groups of participants with uncontrolled asthma will be recruited;
      (1) children and adolescents from Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital, Karolinska
      University Hospital, and (2) adolescents and adults from the primary health care sector in
      Stockholm, Sweden. The asthma control test (ACT/C-ACT) will be applied for evaluation of
      asthma control, a score less than 20 will be required for inclusion.

      Intervention: Asthmatuner is an app supporting self-management evaluating symptoms and lung
      function with external spirometry. The app gathers the information to define patients´ asthma
      control. Subsequently, Asthmatuner provides the patient with a treatment recommendation based
      on the individual treatment plan.

      Procedures: Participants are randomized (1:1) into the one of two-arms of asthma
      self-management with Asthmatuner - conventional or conventional - Asthmatuner. Questionnaires
      will collect information about asthma control, HR-QoL, Medicine adherence report scale (MARS)
      and history of medical health concerning health care utilization and personal costs and
      income.

      Analysis: The study hypothesis will be tested by examining difference in patients´ change in
      asthma control (ACT/C-ACT) and HR-QoL (PAQLQ/Mini-AQLQ). Results will be summarized at each
      management period as mean scores and analysed by paired t-tests.

      2. Background Clinical gaps hamper proper asthma management, and leads to delayed or
      undiagnosed disease, poor adherence to treatment, inadequate self-care abilities, inadequate
      understanding of disease severity, poor patient education, inadequate measurement of lung
      function, and inconsistent evaluation of symptoms. To improve the patient's ability to
      self-manage and to overcome clinical gaps, evidence emphasizes clinics to offer comprehensive
      patient education. The national Finish asthma programme (1994-2004) focused on applying
      effective strategies of asthma management, as a result, patient's self-management was
      improved, and cost-effective through limited demands on the health-care and social security
      system.

      Novel applications embodied in smartphones are straightforward alternative to facilitate
      health care and support patients with hands-on guidance for self-management of asthma.
      Asthmatuner is a smartphone app that enables evaluation of lung function and symptoms. The
      app provides patients with a daily treatment plan adjusted for symptoms and lung function.
      Additionally, information is accessible and can be assessed by health care providers through
      a back-end system. Future versions of Asthmatuner will be enabled through patient's own
      medical record. Self-management apps with hands-on guidance for self-management of asthma
      present a promising future for closing clinical gaps, but the overall benefits of using the
      service in the treatment of asthma need comprehensive evaluation that answers scientific
      questions and end-user opinions.

      3. Aims The primary aim is to evaluate Asthmatuner and the clinical effect on patients´
      self-reported asthma control test (scores of ACT/C-ACT).

      The secondary aim is to evaluate the effect on patients´ and HR-QoL and medical adherence.

      Primary outcomes The primary outcome will be scores of ACT/C-ACT and Paediatric asthma
      quality of life questionnaire (PAQLQ) or Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire
      (Mini-AQLQ).

      Secondary outcomes The secondary outcomes are scores of Medicine adherence report scale
      (MARS) and costs of prescribed dose and type of control medication and total amount of direct
      and indirect costs for patient/caregiver.

      4. Material and methods 4.1 Data collection

      Questionnaires:

        -  A health questionnaire completed at the first visit will provide information regarding
           asthma medical history, health utilization, annual income and employment status.

        -  ACT will be used to assess asthma control in patients 12 years or older, and C-ACT in
           children of age 6 to 11 years. A mean score equal or below 19 indicates uncontrolled
           asthma. Scores above 19 defines asthma to be controlled in both tests.

        -  HR-QoL will be applied in patients from 6 to 11 years of age using the validated Swedish
           translated Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ), and the mini Asthma
           Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-AQLQ) in patients from 12 years of age.

        -  Self-reported medication adherence will be measured with five-item MARS, developed to
           assess adherence with asthma medication. The MARS comprises statements about medication
           use behaviors. The patient is asked to answer each behavior with a score between 1-5
           based on of following alternatives; &quot;always&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot;.
           A mean MARS score will then be calculated, and a score of 4.5 or greater indicates good
           adherence.

        -  Time consume, utility and satisfaction using Asthmatuner will be asked
           patient/caregiver, nurses and physicians in relation to applied management.

      4.2 Subjects Two stratified groups with diagnosed asthma (male and female) will be invited to
      the study; children and adolescents (6-17 years) from the lung and allergy department of
      Astrid Lindgren children's Hospital and adolescents (&gt; 12 years) and adults from the primary
      care sector of Stockholm.

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Consent to participate is voluntary.

        -  Age &gt; 6 years

        -  Diagnosed asthma

        -  Asthma control score (ACT/C-ACT) less than 20 Exclusion criteria

        -  Ongoing comorbidity affecting the health status of asthma

        -  Asthma control score (ACT/C-ACT) equal or more than 20

        -  Participation in other drug trial

      4.3 Power analysis The power analysis is based on our previous analysis of ACT/C-ACT and
      HR-QoL scores in schoolchildren with uncontrolled severe asthma [21]. The scores for severe
      uncontrolled asthma were on average for ACT 17 (SD 3.3) and for PAQLQ 5.4 (SD 0.77). Thus, an
      estimated improvement of ACT from 17 to 19 (two points) or PAQLQ from 5.4 to 5.9 (0.5 points)
      requires 38-43 patients in each group (Asthmatuner vs. conventional management) to attain an
      80 % power at 5% significance level.

      4.4 Study design The study is designed as a randomized, multi-centre, blinded-controlled,
      crossover trail.

      Patients are enrolled randomized 1:1 at visit 1. Computer-generated random number sequence
      will be used for randomization of patients into one of the two-arms of 8 + 8 weeks of asthma
      management; Asthmatuner - conventional or conventional - Asthmatuner. The randomization will
      keep blinded for the study team but not for study nurse or physician. A washout period of
      minimum 2 weeks will be applied between management periods. Management period 2 is initiated
      at visit 3 and finalized at visit 4.

      The clinical setting with nurse-based asthma clinic is currently regarded as state-of-the-art
      for conventional asthma treatment in primary health care in Sweden. The study will therefore
      be conducted in a primary care setting with integrated asthma nurse that follows established
      national and international guidelines.

      4.5 Intervention procedures Study nurses and physicians will consecutively recruit
      participants in the asthma clinic. At enrollment of Asthmatuner, the physician will prescribe
      a three level treatment plan, which is adjusted for the patients´ status of asthma if
      controlled, partly controlled or uncontrolled. Study nurse will insert the plan in the
      back-end system of Asthmatuner. Before enrolment of conventional management, a separate
      written treatment plan adjusted for patients asthma will be applied to each participant and
      in the medical journal.

      Visit 1: Eligibility of participants will be checked. The patient will be given information
      about the study procedures and must sign the informed consent form. At the visit the
      following procedures will be conducted and documented:

        -  Demographic data

        -  Body height and weight

        -  Medical history about allergy and asthma will be obtained with health questionnaire

        -  Asthma control will be assessed with ACT or C-ACT

        -  MARS

        -  Lung function, dynamic spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and FEF50)

        -  Revise treatment plan if necessary (Asthmatuner or Conventional)

        -  Revision of adverse events.

      At visit 3, the following procedures will be conducted and documented:

        -  ACT/C-ACT

        -  HR-QoL; Mini-AQLQ/PAQLQ

        -  MARS

        -  Lung function, dynamic spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and FEF50)

        -  Prescribe and apply treatment plan (Asthmatuner or Conventional)

        -  Control of inhalation technique

        -  Revision of adverse events.

      At visit 4, the following procedures will be conducted and documented:

        -  ACT/C-ACT

        -  HR-QoL; Mini-AQLQ or PAQLQ

        -  MARS

        -  Lung function, dynamic spirometry including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
           expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, forced expiratory flow after 50% of
           vital capacity (FEF50)

        -  Revision of adverse events

      4.5 Statistical analysis The study hypothesis will be tested by examining patients´ change
      from baseline in asthma control (ACT/C-ACT), HR-QoL (PAQLQ/Mini-AQLQ), and in MARS scores
      between asthma management groups. Results will be summarized between each group as mean
      scores and analysed by paired t-tests.

      4.8 Withdrawal A patient should be withdrawn from the trial if, in the opinion of the
      investigator, it is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient. In any
      circumstances the reasons for withdrawal should be documented in the Study termination
      report. Participants who discontinue from the study for any reason will be replaced.

      4.9 Safety

      An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in participants using or not using
      Asthmatuner. AE include the following:

        -  All suspect adverse reaction

        -  All reactions from medical overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity

        -  Apparently unrelated illness, including the worsening of a preexisting illness

        -  Injury or accident

        -  Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination

        -  Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation
           unless they are associated with an already reported clinical event.

      Preexisting conditions In this trial, a preexisting condition i.e. asthma, should not be
      reported as an adverse event unless the condition worsens or episodes increases (i.e.
      exacerbations) in the frequency during the adverse event reporting period.

      Procedures Diagnostics and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery,
      should not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical condition for which the
      procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. The AE
      reporting period begins upon starting the use of Asthmatuner or conventional management
      (visit 1).

      Each participant will be questioned about AE for each visit 2 and 3. All AE that occur in the
      trial should be reported to investigator and specified in the participants´ medical journal
      and in a separate AE form with following information:

        -  Type of AE

        -  Date and time of AE

        -  Association with Asthmatuner (No/Yes/Unknown)

        -  Gravity (Serious or Non-serious)

        -  Reporting time

        -  Follow-up (resolved or unresolved)

      Gravity

      Each AE is to be classified by the investigator as serious or non-serious. This
      classification of the gravity of the event determines the reporting procedure to be followed.
      An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria is classified as serious:

        -  Death

        -  Life-threatening

        -  Hospitalization

        -  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity

        -  Congenital anomaly/birth defect All serious AE should directly be reported to
           investigator.

      5.0 Ethics The trial will be performed in accordance with the World Medical Assembly Helsinki
      recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical research involving human subjects [26]. It
      is the responsibility of the investigators to obtain approval of the trial from regional
      ethic committee´.

      It is the responsibility of the investigators to give each patient prior to inclusion in the
      trial, full adequate information regarding the trial and the procedures. The patient must be
      informed about their right to withdraw from the trial at any time. Written patient
      information must be given to each patient before enrollment. In addition, it is the
      responsibility of the investigator to obtain signed informed consent from all participants.
