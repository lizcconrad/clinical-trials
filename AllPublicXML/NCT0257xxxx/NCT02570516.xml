      This study compares two colonoscopy techniques (with Narrow Band Imaging versus with indigo
      carmine chromoendoscopy) in patients having Lynch Syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chromoendoscopy using indigo carmine dye is recommended every 1 to 2 years in patients having
      Lynch Syndrome (LS). However, it is a time-consuming procedure, requiring a prior learning
      and has an additional cost, the reason why it is not yet systematically practiced in all
      endoscopy centers. The &quot;Narrow Band Imaging&quot; (NBI) is a recent virtual chromoendoscopy
      technique using optical filters at the light source of the endoscope to highlight the
      vascular structures of the mucosa by pressing a button. NBI is currently used to better
      characterize dysplasia lesions in the esophageal, gastric, and colon mucosa. A new generation
      (3rd generation) of NBI is currently available on some endoscopes, it can deliver more
      brightness and contrast, and could allow for better detection of flat lesions. Until today,
      no study has directly compared colonic chromoendoscopy with Indigo carmine to virtual
      chromoendoscopy with NBI (3rd generation) in LS patients. The hypothesis that this research
      aims to verify is that the new generation NBI system might do at least as well as indigo
      carmine in colonic adenoma detection in LS. This study aims to compare colonoscopy with
      virtual chromoendoscopy using 3rd generation NBI system to chromoendoscopy with indigo
      carmine in LS patients, in a back-to-back, prospective non inferiority design, in which all
      patients will have both techniques in the following order: NBI first followed by Indigo
      carmine.
