    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label study in participants with unresectable BTC and
      disease progression or failure following one prior gemcitabine-based doublet chemotherapy
      regimen (combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, or gemcitabine and other platinum
      agent/fluoropyrimidine agent). This study contains 3 phases: a Pre-treatment phase that will
      last within 21 days; a Treatment phase that will consist of study treatment cycles and tumor
      assessment conducted every 6-8 weeks; and a Follow-up phase that will begin immediately after
      the Off-Treatment Visit and will continue as long as the participant is alive, unless the
      participant withdraws consent, or until the End of Study.
