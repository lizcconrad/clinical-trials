  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of CSJ137 in chronic hemodialysis
      patients. It is hypothesized that treatment with CSJ137 may improve the level of hemoglobin
      in patients on chronic hemodialysis with iron-restricted anemia while reducing the need for
      dosing with erythropoietin and intravenous iron in these patients.

      This posting discloses information about Part 1 of CCSJ137X2201. Another part, Part 2, of
      this trial is planned for conduct subsequent to the initiation of Part 1 and will have a
      different design than Part 1. The details of the design for this additional part are planned
      for disclosure in advance of conduct of Part 2.
