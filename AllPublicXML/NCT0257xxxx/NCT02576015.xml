  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interaction of analgesia and sedation ot their effect on the prognosis of surgical
      patients still need to be elucidated.Currently, how to optimize intra-operative Analgesia and
      sedation to improve the prognosis of surgical patients is still a mystery.Intra-operative
      nerve block provided regional analgesia of the operated knee, which reduced the dosages of
      sedatives and analgesics.Based on a pilot study,the investigators found a decrease of
      post-operative adverse composite outcomes with the use of continuous femoral nerve block (2%
      versus 7%) ,therefore, the investigators postulate that general analgesia with lighter
      sedation in combination with peripheral nerve block could reduce the post-operative morbidity
      compared with deeper sedation.This randomized controlled trial is designed to test this
      hypothesis in patients receiving unilateral knee arthroplasty.

      This study was approved by the institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital of
      Chongqing Medical University. The protocol design is in accordance with Consolidated
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.This study is designed as a randomized
      controlled trial to compare intra-operative continuous femoral nerve block combined with
      lighter anesthetic depth (group L) with deeper anesthetic depth (group D) monitored by
      bispectral index (BIS). All potentially eligible participants will be asked to give written
      informed consent before they are enrolled in this study.The following outcomes will be
      assessed:post-operative major complications (post-operative pulmonary infection,need of
      mechanical respiratory support,myocardio-infarction,deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
      embolism, stroke, poor wound healing,all-cause post-operative death within 30 days).Secondary
      Outcomes included :acute post-operative pain assessed by visual analogue scale and dosages of
      rescue medications;Dosages of intra-operative vasopressors,anesthetics and analgesics;Life
      quality measured by EQ-5D questionnaire 3 months post-operatively;adverse events associated
      with the femoral catheter (displacement, infection, hematoma,drop-out of catheter).

    <description>Participants in group L will receive a single injection for femoral nerve block combined with continuous femoral nerve block intra-operatively. The femoral nerve block will be performed before the induction of anesthesia on the leg to be operated. Then the patients were given the 2% lidocaine 10 ml and 1% ropivacaine 10 ml as initial dose,then,the patients will receive a continuous infusion of 0.15% ropivacaine at 15 ml/h.Intra-operatively, bispectral index score (BIS) was titrated with the adjusting of desflurane to maintain the index between 50-60.After the surgery,these patients will receive continuous femoral nerve analgesia till 3 days post-operatively( the loading dose was set at 5 ml of 0.15% ropivacaine followed by an infusion of 0.15% ropivacaine at 5 ml/h, with bolus of 5 ml and the lock time of 30 min).</description>

    <description>this technique will be administered to participants in group L .The puncture site was identified using ultrasound guidance (2 cm distal to the inguinal ligament, and 1 ～2 cm lateral to the femoral artery).2% lidocaine was used for topical anesthesia, then an insulated needle (Contiplex B Braun, Melsungen, Germany) (20 G*45 mm，short bevel，30°) was connected to the nerve stimulator（Innervator，Fisher &amp;Paykel，New Zealand）.The parameters were as follows: stimulating intensity of 1 mA at a rate of 2 Hz. The needle was advanced at 30°～45° angle to the skin, until quadriceps femoral muscle twitches were elicited. Its position was accepted if contractions were still elicited when an output equal to 0.3 mA.The participants will receive continuous femoral nerve block intra-operatively and post-operatively till 3 days post-operatively.The depth of anesthesia will modulated at 50-60 with BIS monitoring</description>
