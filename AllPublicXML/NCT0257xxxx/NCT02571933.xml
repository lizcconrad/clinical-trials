    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the face validity and cultural acceptability of the Faces Pain Scale -
      Revised in pediatric patients treated at Mbingo Baptist Hospital, Northwest Province,
      Cameroon. Participants from the four major language/cultural groups evaluated at the hospital
      with a complaint of pain will trial the Faces Pain Scale - Revised and then undergo cognitive
      interviewing to assess comprehension and clinical accuracy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve to fifteen pediatric patients complaining of pain from each of the four primary
      language groups treated at Mbingo Baptist Hospital (Grammar English, Pidgin English, French,
      and Fulfulde) will be enrolled in the study. Each patient enrolled will trial the Faces Pain
      Scale - Revised (FPS-R) in his or her native tongue, before receiving standard analgesic
      treatment as ordered by the provider caring for the patient. One to two hours post analgesia,
      the patient will be reassessed and the FPS-R will be repeated. After completion of the second
      FPS-R, an audio-recorded cognitive interview will be performed by trained study personnel.
      These recordings will be transcribed into English and analyzed on a question-by-question
      basis to evaluate for themes pertaining to comprehension and understanding, ease of use, and
      reliability, within the different language groups. Enrollment in the study does not alter the
      routine pain management offered or received by patients. Rather, the FPS-R will be utilized
      on patients who are complaining of pain and who will be allocated to receive analgesia
      regardless of study enrollment.
