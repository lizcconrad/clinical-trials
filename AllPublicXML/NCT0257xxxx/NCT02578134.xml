    <textblock>
      Scientific evidence of conservative management of individuals with plantar fasciosis is
      sometimes conflicting. There is evidence that regular exercise programs are effective for
      this pain condition. The inclusion of other therapeutic modalities is still controversial.
      Some authors have suggested that the use of US-guided percutaneous electrolysis (EPE®) maybe
      useful for the management of chronic tendinopathies; however, no study has investigated the
      potential placebo effect of this intervention. The objective of this randomized clinical
      trial is to determine the effectiveness of US-guided percutaneous electrolysis (EPE®) versus
      sham US-guided percutaneous electrolysis for the management of patients with plantar
      fasciosis for pain, function, and disability.

    <description>Patients will receive one weekly session for 5 weeks for 5 weeks of US-guided percutaneous electrolysis. This intervention consists of the application of a galvanic electrical current with an acupuncture needle in the soft tissue, in this case the plantar fascia insertion. In addition, patients will be asked for conducting a best-evidence low-load exercise programs for the intrinsic foot musculature. The exercise program will be asked to be performed on an individual basis twice every day.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive one weekly session for 5 weeks for 5 weeks of sham US-guided percutaneous electrolysis. In this case, the acupuncture needle will be inserted in the soft tissue, in this case the plantar fascia insertion without the application of the galvanic electrical current. In addition, patients will be asked for conducting a best-evidence low-load exercise programs for the intrinsic foot musculature. The exercise program will be asked to be performed on an individual basis twice every day.</description>
