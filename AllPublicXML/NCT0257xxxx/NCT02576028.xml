      Background. Post-surgical physiotherapy programs following to total hip arthroplasty (THA)
      show important differences between types and numbers of treatment sessions. Objectives are to
      investigate effectiveness of Fascial Manipulation when associated to a standard protocol of
      care.

      Methods. Fifty-one subjects operated with THA were randomized into two groups, both followed
      a standard protocol of care where two sessions were replaced with Fascial Manipulation in the
      study group. Functional outcomes measures collected before and after treatment and at the end
      of the rehabilitation program included Harris Hip Score, Time Up and Go test, articular range
      of motion and verbal numerical scale.

    <description>Fascial Manipulation® (FM) is a manual therapy that focus on the deep muscular fascia. This technique considers the fascia as a three-dimensional continuum. The mainstay of this manual technique lies in the identification of specific localised areas of the fascia, defined Center of Coordination (CC), where the gliding of the subcutis should be preserved to avoid biomechanical in-coordination of the surrounding muscles. The method is performed by applying a deep friction over the CCs that result more altered at the clinical palpation</description>
