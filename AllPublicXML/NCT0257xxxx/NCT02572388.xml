  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be administered one or two
      experimental malaria vaccines. The vaccine R21 will either be administered alone or in
      combination with the adjuvant vaccine Matrix-M1.

      All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. Each volunteer will receive three
      vaccinations in total.

      There are three different vaccine schedules:

      Group 1 will receive 10µg of R21 mixed with 50µg of Matrix-M1 on days 0, 28, and 56.

      Group 2 will receive 50µg of R21 on days 0, 28, and 56. .

      Group 3 will receive 50µg of R21 mixed with 50µg of Matrix-M1 on days 0, 28, and 56.

      The study will assess the safety of the vaccines, and the immune responses to the
      vaccinations. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples.

      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in Oxford and London, England.

             their General Practitioner

          -  For females only, willingness to practice continuous effective contraception (see
