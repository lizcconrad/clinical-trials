      The major hypothesis to be tested is that there was no difference in the clinical outcome
      between 7(short-course) and 14(traditional-course) days of antibiotic treatment for
      asymptomatic bacteriuria early after kidney transplantation.

      Introduction: Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common practice in renal transplant
      centers leading to prolong exposure of antimicrobial agents with long hospital length of
      stay. The duration of antibiotics treatment in this condition have never been proposed.

      Objective: To evaluate the proper duration of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic
      bacteriuria early (less than 1 month) after kidney transplantation

      Method: This is a prospective, randomized, open labeled, single center study using intention
      to treat analysis. Patients will be identified and after informed consent is obtained, will
      be randomized to receive 7 or 14 days course of antibiotics.
