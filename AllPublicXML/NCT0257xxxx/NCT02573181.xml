        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Good health; any underlying chronic illness must be documented to be in stable
             condition

          -  Have documented proof of receipt of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine one
             year or longer prior to study entry.

          -  Male, or postmenopausal female

        Exclusion Criteria:

             polysaccharide vaccine

          -  History of invasive pneumococcal disease or known history of other culture-positive
             pneumococcal disease

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any vaccine component

          -  Known or suspected impairment of immune function

          -  Received systemic corticosteroids for &gt;=14 consecutive days and has not completed
             treatment &lt;=30 days prior to study entry, or received systemic corticosteroids
             exceeding physiologic replacement doses within 14 days prior to study vaccination

          -  Coagulation disorder contraindicating intramuscular vaccination

          -  Receives immunosuppressive therapy, including chemotherapeutic agents used to treat

             transplantation, or autoimmune disease

          -  Received a blood transfusion or blood products, including immunoglobulins within the 6
             months before receipt of study vaccine or is scheduled to receive a blood transfusion
             or blood product within 30 days of receipt of study vaccine. Autologous blood
             transfusions are not considered an exclusion criterion

          -  Participated in another clinical study of an investigational product within 2 months
             before the beginning of or any time during the duration of the current clinical study

          -  User of recreational or illicit drugs or has had a recent history (within the last
             year) of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence.
