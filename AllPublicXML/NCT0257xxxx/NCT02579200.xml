      The purpose of this study is to determine whether inspiratory muscle training is effective to
      improve breathless and exercise intolerance in symptomatic patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) plus chronic heart failure (HF).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure with reduced left ventricular
      ejection fraction (HF) are leading causes of disability and death worldwide. Unfortunately,
      COPD and HF coexist in up to a third of elderly patients making the so-called COPD-HF overlap
      (CHO) a major challenge to Health Care Systems. In addition, population ageing anticipates
      that CHO prevalence will further increase in the next decades.

      Intolerance to exertion due to disabling breathlessness is the hallmark of COPD and HF and
      these abnormalities are notoriously potentiated by diseases coexistence.

      The inspiratory muscles are centrally related to the pathophysiology of exertional dyspnea in
      COPD and HF. In both populations a higher central motor command output is required to
      maintain adequate force generation in the face of weaker inspiratory muscles. This
      information is interpreted as &quot;shortness of breath&quot;.

      There is well established evidence gained from recent meta-analyses indicating that
      inspiratory muscle training (IMT), as a standalone therapy, significantly improves
      inspiratory muscle function (strength and endurance), dyspnea during daily activities, and
      functional exercise capacity in COPD and HF. Previous findings indicate that reduced
      pressure-generating capacity reflecting inspiratory muscle weakness is frequently observed in
      patients with COPD-HF and related to a clinically-relevant outcome: exertional dyspnea. These
      findings set the scene for a randomized controlled trial to investigate the potential role of
      IMT in dyspnea palliation in CHO patients.

      Objectives

      To determine the effects of IMT on:

        1. Dyspnea on daily life

        2. Inspiratory muscle strength and endurance

        3. Dyspnea on exertion and time to exercise intolerance
