  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) alone is able to induce a clinically significant effect with a variable
      pathologic response (a pathological complete remission, pCR, defined as ≥ 95%, or ≤ 5%
      remaining visible tumour cells) in only about 10% of cases. A prior phase I study (PASART-1;
      NCT01985295) suggested that 25 x 2 Gy preoperative RT in combination with once daily 800mg
      oral pazopanib is feasible, while inducing tissue replacing tumor that can consist of
      fibrosis and necrosis in 40% of thus treated patients.
