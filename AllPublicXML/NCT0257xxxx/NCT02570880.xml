      This study evaluates the impact of dough fermentation times on the glycaemic index of the
      ensuing breads.

    <textblock>
      The worldwide prevalence for non-communicable diseases (NCD) is increasing, nutrition is
      considered to be one of the main modifiable risk factors. An unhealthy diet leads to obesity,
      which is a further risk factor for NCDs. Excessive carbohydrates but also the nutritional
      quality of carbohydrates, can be elements defining &quot;unhealthy diets&quot;. The nutritional quality
      of carbohydrates can be expressed as the glycaemic index.

      Fermentation time of bread dough could affect the ensuing bread quality to such an extent
      that it influences ist glycaemic index. If this hypothesis is confirmed, the process of
      breadmaking could be optimized in order to offer healthier bread varieties on the market.
