      The purpose of this clinical trial study is to assess, among young and sexually active women
      presenting recurrent urinary tract infection (UTIs), efficacy of an optimal dose of cranberry
      extract quantified and standardized to 37 mg/day of Proanthocyanidins (PACs), compared to a
      control dose quantified and standardized to 2 mg/day of PACs on mean number of new UTIs
      during a 6-month follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cranberry juice, fruit (fresh and dried), functional foods, and cranberry dietary supplements
      are promoted for prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) on the basis of their content
      of cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs) with &quot;A-type&quot; interflavan bonds. Several clinical
      trials have assessed efficacy of cranberry-derived products, essentially with cranberry
      juices, but discordant results have been found. Lack of compliance but mostly lack of
      standardization in product concentrations can account for the variability among results.
      Indeed, most clinical trials do not report quantity of PACs. According to most recent
      studies, quantification of PACs requiring standardized and reproducible methods should be at
      least 37 mg/day. It can be hypothesized that efficacy of cranberry extract in UTIs prevention
      among young women can be strongly increased using optimal dosage (standardized to 37 mg/day
      of PACs). The purpose of this clinical trial study is to assess, among young and sexually
      active women presenting recurrent UTIs, efficacy of an optimal dose of cranberry extract
      quantified and standardized to 37 mg/day of PACs, compared to a control dose quantified and
      standardized to 2 mg/day of PACs on mean number of new UTIs during a 6-month follow-up
      period.

    <description>The aim of this clinical trial is to assess efficacy of an optimal dose of cranberry extract compared to a control dose on mean number of new UTIs for a 6-month period follow-up in women. Participants will be randomly assigned to the optimal dose or control dose treatment at their first visit at the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods. This intervention includes three visits at 0, 12 and 24 weeks. At the first visit, women will have to complete questionnaires to provide sociodemographic, medication and natural health products, health antecedents and quality of life information and to document risk factors related to UTIs. A 24-hour recall questionnaire about consumption of PACs will also be completed. A urinary sample analysis and culture as well as a pregnant test will also be performed. Compliance regarding capsules' intake and potential side effects will be documented. The completion of questionnaires and urinary measurements will be repeated at weeks 12 and 24.</description>
