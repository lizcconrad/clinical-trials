        A total of 1,200 women aged 18 to 29 will be consecutively included in this study as they
        present at private gynecology clinics. Subjects must have been using the Jaydess
        intrauterine delivery system as their contraceptive of choice for a period of 6 (±1)
        months.

        The study population may be stratified into subsets to assess and identify differences in
        the subjects' quality of life, social and demographic characteristics, contraception
        characteristics, satisfaction, perceived benefits of Jaydess and bleeding pattern features.
