    <textblock>
      The present study was designed to study the impact of empirical treatment with colistin
      empirical monotherapy and combined treatment with tigecycline and vancomycin on mortality of
      bacteremia Multiresistant Acinetobacter Baumannii . The main objective was to evaluate the
      efficacy of empirical treatment with colistin and combined targeted therapy. The different
      therapeutical interventions were administered following the routine clinical practice in the
      medical centre and the investigator did not assign specific interventions to the subjects of
      the study.
