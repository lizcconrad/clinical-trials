  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maxillary expansion was performed for adult female patients suffering from maxillary
      constriction with bilateral posterior cross-bite using fixed Quad-helix appliance, for about
      8 months. The appliance was delivered and activated at the day of corticotomy and bone graft.
      The activation was made half-molar unit each side. The patient was scheduled each month to
      activate the appliance or reactivate if needed. Corticotomy was performed at area of
      maxillary 1st premolar, 2nd premolar and first molar. Cone beam computed tomography was
      performed, before appliance activation and corticotomy, at the end of expansion (8 months)
      and after finishing orthodontic treatment (average 2.5 years from start of treatment).

    <textblock>
      Maxillary expansion was performed for adult female patients suffering from maxillary
      constriction with bilateral posterior cross-bite &amp; dental arch discrepancy average 12 mm
      using fixed Quad-helix appliance, for about 8 months. The appliance was delivered and
      activated at the day of corticotomy and bone graft (demineralized freeze-dried bone
      allograft). The activation was made half-molar unit each side. The patient was scheduled each
      month to activate the appliance or reactivate if needed. Corticotomy was performed at area of
      maxillary 1st premolar, 2nd premolar and first molar. Cone beam computed tomography was
      performed at three stages.

      T1 (baseline) Before appliance activation and corticotomy. T2 At the end of expansion. (about
      8 months of expansion). T3 At the finishing stage of orthodontic treatment (average 2.5 years
      from start of treatment).

    <description>A maxillary expansion with quad helix appliance was placed on the posterior teeth with cross bite. A Luebke buccal flap was opened in the area of maxillary 1st premolar, 2nd premolar and first molar with a no. 15 scalpel. Corticotomy procedure was performed using low speed round bur size 3, holes to create a 0.5 mm deep hole penetrating the cortical bone. Multiple holes were performed leaving 1.5 mm distance in between. The defects were covered with demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft and the flap was sutured in its original position with 3-0 black silk suture.</description>
