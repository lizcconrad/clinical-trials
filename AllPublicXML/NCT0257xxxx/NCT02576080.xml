  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the ACOSOG Z9001trial, imatinib received market authorization in Europe for
      patients with GIST at significant risk of relapse in the adjuvant setting, according to the
      classifications of Miettinen and Joensuu. Thereafter, the SSG XVIII / AI trial proved the
      need to revise the recommendations of the European Society for Medical Oncology regarding the
      optimal duration of treatment, which is currently three years. Patients at low risk of
      recurrence should not receive adjuvant treatment with imatinib and recommendations cannot be
      made from the literature data as to the indication of adjuvant treatment for patients with an
      intermediate risk of relapse. The provision of prognostic molecular markers in this group of
      so-called intermediate-risk subjects would facilitate the identification of responders to
      imatinib and avoid overtreating some patients and undertreating others who would benefit from
      Imatinib. Recently, Lagarde et al. have shown that the Genomic Index (GI = A ² / C, where A
      is the total number of alterations gains or losses and C is the number of chromosomes
      involved in these alterations in Comparative Genomic Hybridization array(CGH array)) could
      have prognostic value in GIST, particularly in intermediate risk GISTs. More recent work by
      the same author in 100 cases of GISTs with intermediate prognosis according to the
      classification of Miettinem identified two prognostic groups based on GI. The rate of
      metastatic relapse at 2 years was 30.6% in the group with GI greater than 10 versus 5.4% in
      the group with GI less than 10 (manuscript under preparation). Thus, it is legitimate to set
      up a randomized trial to study the effectiveness of adjuvant treatment with imatinib in the
      GIST population at intermediate risk of relapse and with a high GI. This study is a
      prospective randomized clinical trial: a phase III, open-label, 2 parallel groups,
      multicenter study. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of adjuvant
      Imatinib on rate of metastatic relapse at 2 years in patients with intermediate-risk
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting a high Genomic Grade Index. The second objectives
      of this study are to compare the two therapeutic approaches in terms of metastasis-free
      survival at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, overall survival, clinical and biological tolerance,
      safety and Quality of life of patients and caregivers. The eligible subjects must meet all of
      the following criteria : subject with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, intermediary risk
      from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology classification [Miettenen 2006], subject with
      Genomic Grade Index higher than 10 determined by CGH array, subject with surgery for primary
      tumor performed from 2 weeks to 2 months before starting adjuvant Imatinib mesylate, subject
      with no evidence of residual macroscopic disease after surgery and with a medical decision to
      prescribe imatinib. Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled :
      subject who have experienced spontaneous tumor rupture before surgery, subject whose tumor
      has a PDGFRA D842V mutation evidenced by sequencing from tumor Block and subject whose
      mutational status meets the wild phenotype definition as evidenced by sequencing from tumor
      Block.

      The Standard Group will receive adjuvant imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per day for a period of
      3 years. Patients will be assessed for metastases every three months for three years with
      thoraco-abdominal and pelvic CT scan. The Experimental Group will receive the same
      thoraco-abdominal and pelvic CT scan. The estimated proportion of subjects relapsing at 2
      years will be 30% in the experimental group and 2.5% in the standard group: alpha risk, 5%,
      power 80%. A total of 80 subjects (40 in each arm) will be included. This is a trial
      combining two learned societies that already are taking part in many clinical trials in
      France (French Sarcoma Group and French Digestive Cancer Federation). The expected benefits
      for patients are : not treat subjects for whom this treatment would offer too little benefit
      weighed against the disadvantages and treat subjects in whom this treatment would provide a
      real benefit and reduce the cost of treatment in patients who would not benefit from being
      treated by imatinib. The originality of this study is that it will include molecular data in
      the therapeutic decision and demonstrate the concept of individualized treatment in this
      patient population. This could ultimately change the current recommendations.
