      The purpose of this study is to assess the 2012 bioequivalence statistical criteria for
      warfarin, a narrow therapeutic index drug, set forth in the draft guidance issued by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA).

    <textblock>
      This study is a reasonable starting point to assess the appropriateness of the 2012 FDA
      bioequivalence (BE) statistical criteria for narrow therapeutic index drugs (NTIDs). The idea
      stems from an earlier study conducted in Dr. Benet's lab with the drug furosemide. The
      furosemide study yielded triplicate data that were unable to purely meet the BE statistical
      criteria set forth by the FDA due to the inherent study design. Furosemide is not an NTID to
      be considered by the FDA for BE studies, however. Hence, the investigators have proposed a
      new study to assess the BE statistical criteria with warfarin, an NTID with a draft guidance
      issued by the FDA. By providing the reference product (brand name warfarin) three times to
      each study participant and recording the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters for BE (AUC and
      Cmax), the investigators can make three comparisons between the data (R1 and R2 vs. R2 and
      R3; R1 and R2 vs. R1 and RÂ¬3; R2 and R3 vs. R1 and R3).

      The investigators have three concerns that can be tested here.

        1. Will normal within subject variability potentially lead to inequivalence of the
           reference product using the new NTID BE regulations?

        2. Is it possible that the BE interval could be less than the United States Pharmacopeia
           (USP) content uniformity limits for warfarin?

        3. Provide a comparison of the within-subject variance for the 2.5 ratio comparison.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be warfarin area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC) values from zero to seventy-two (0-72) hours. Values from the Experimental Arm (warfarin) of each the 3 study periods will be compared against each other and analyzed for intra-individual variability and tested for bioequivalence using the new narrow therapeutic index drug (NTID) regulations. Blood collection at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours after warfarin dosing.</description>

    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be warfarin area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC) values from zero to infinite time (0-inf) where infinite time represents the duration of the study (8 weeks). Values from the Experimental Arm (warfarin) of each the 3 study periods will be compared against each other and analyzed for intra-individual variability and tested for bioequivalence using the new narrow therapeutic index drug (NTID) regulations. Analysis of all concentration-time data; blood collection at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours after warfarin dosing.</description>

    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be maximum plasma concentration (Cmax).
