    <textblock>
      A phase 2, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label trial in patients with MDR-TB. Only patients
      who completed Trial 204 were eligible. The trial was performed globally at 14 sites qualified
      to treat MDR-TB. All 434 patients who completed Trial 204 were eligible for this trial if
      there was still potential clinical benefit to them and all inclusion criteria and no
      exclusion criteria were met.

             creatinine levels â‰¥265 mol/L or hepatic impairment characterized by ALT and/or

             range from the screening lab results.

          -  Current clinically relevant changes in the ECG (between Trial 204 day 56 assessment
             and baseline) such as any atrioventricular (AV) block, prolongation of the QRS complex

             in male patients and 470 msec in female patients.

          -  Current clinically relevant cardiovascular disorder such as heart failure, coronary
             artery disease, uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, arrhythmia,
             tachyarrhythmia or status after myocardial infarction.

             nitro-imidazole derivates is contra-indicated.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological,
             psychiatric or endocrine diseases, malignancy, or other abnormalities (other than the
             indication being studied).

          -  Administered an IMP within 1 month prior to Visit 1 other than OPC-67683 given as IMP
