      The main purpose of this study is to examine if pain levels treated with intrathecal (IT)
      preservative-free morphine (PFM) after a cesarean section improve with the additional use of
      continuous subfascial wound infiltration with ropivacaine using the OnQ® elastomeric pump
      system.

      The main purpose of this study is to examine if pain levels treated with intrathecal (IT)
      preservative-free morphine (PFM) after a cesarean section improve with the additional use of
      continuous subfascial wound infiltration with ropivacaine using the OnQ® elastomeric pump
      system. As a double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled study, women undergoing first,
      second or third cesarean section will be randomly assigned to one of 3 different groups.
      Group 1 will receive saline, group 2 will be given ropivacaine 0.1%, group 3 will be given
      ropivacaine 0.2%, all at a rate of 8ml/hr via the OnQ® pump system. Each group will also
      receive an 8mL bolus of the previously assigned infusate. The investigator will assess pain
      at rest and with movement at different time periods during the recovery process through 3
      months post operatively. The investigator will also assess if the use of this system
      decreases the need for other pain medications and reduces the potential side-effects of pain
      treatment.

    <description>Pain with movement will be assessed using the self-report McGill pain questionnaire.This is composed of 78 words, of which subjects will choose those that best describe their experience of pain. Seven words are selected from the following categories: dimension 1 to 10 (pain descriptors); dimensions 11 to 15 (affective components of pain), dimension 16 (evaluation of pain), and dimension 17 to 20 (miscellaneous). Scores are calculated by summing values associated with each word. Scores range from 0 (no pain) to 78 (severe pain). Participants will respond to the McGill pain questionnaire at the week 6 and 3 month time points through a telephone call.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to first dose of rescue medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (At zero time, the time of the first dosing using the On-Q catheter), 72 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The time to dosing with the first rescue medications like, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and morphine, for breakthrough pain will be noted. A shorter time to dosing indicates an increased intensity of pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breastfeeding success</measure>
    <time_frame>In the post-anesthesia care unit (up to 2 hours post-operatively), 72 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Breastfeeding success will be measured using LATCH scores. The LATCH system assigns a numerical score, 0, 1, or 2, to five key components of breastfeeding: &quot;L&quot; is for how well the infant latches onto the breast, &quot;A&quot; is for the amount of audible swallowing noted, &quot;T&quot; is for the mother's nipple type, &quot;C&quot; is for the mother's level of comfort and &quot;H&quot; is for the amount of help the mother needs to hold her infant to the breast. Higher scores indicate higher success with breastfeeding.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The cesarean section incision and the catheter insertion site will be evaluated. Any catheter or infiltrate-related issues like wound infection and seroma formation will be noted. Wounds will be assessed for infection or dehiscence. Clean wound lines with no evidence of infection indicate better healing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in post-operative wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the 4-6 week and 3-month follow-up phone calls the participant will be asked about the presence of wound dysesthesia (numbness, tingling, burning, pricking, allodynia, or hyperesthesia), occurrence of infection, dehiscence, and keloid formation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain scores at rest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (At zero time, the time of the first dosing using the On-Q catheter), 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of pain at rest will be measured using a visual analogue pain scale (VAPS). Subjects will be instructed to indicate the intensity of the pain by marking on a 100-mm vertical lines with terms describing the extremes of pain intensity. The lines are anchored with &quot;no pain&quot; at the bottom and &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; at the top. Higher scores indicate higher intensities of pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of hospital discharge (average of 3 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A cost analysis will occur for the inpatient stay. Costs to be assessed include cost for preparation of the drugs and devices, monitoring/supervision costs based on nursing and physician interventions and cost of days spent in the hospital.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be assessed by using the visual analog scale (VAS). The visual analog scale (VAS) for satisfaction is a horizontal line 100mm long. At the beginning and the end, there are two descriptors representing extremes of satisfaction. The subjects will be asked to rate their satisfaction by making a vertical mark on the 100mm line, where, 0= least satisfied and 100=most satisfied. Higher scores indicate higher levels of satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dosing amount of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>24 post-operatively, 72 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The total dose of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in mg will be recorded for each of the first three post-operative days and after discharge as indicated, along with a cumulative total. Higher doses of NSAIDs usage indicate higher intensities of pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of opioid side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (At zero time, the time of the first dosing using the On-Q catheter), 72 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of opioid central and/or systemic side effects like pruritus, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and respiratory depression will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of opioid use</measure>
    <time_frame>24 post-operatively, 72 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of opioid use will be quantified in terms of morphine equivalents given in mg both by post
-operative day and with a cumulative total. Higher amounts of opioid use indicates higher degrees of pain.</description>
