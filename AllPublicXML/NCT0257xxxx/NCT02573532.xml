    <textblock>
      This observational study includes patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery, and screens
      them for the occurence of perioperative myocardial injuries (PMI). Incidence, patient
      characteristics, pathophysiology, and 1-year outcomes of PMI will be described.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Worldwide more than 230 million surgical operations are performed each year.
      Despite advances in all fields of medicine, there is still a significant risk of death
      related to major non-cardiac surgical procedures. The observed 30-day mortality depends on
      patient- as well as procedural factors and ranges between 1% and 10%. Cardiovascular
      complications, particularly perioperative myocardial injury/infarction (PMI) seem to be major
      contributors to about a third of all deaths. PMI may differ from spontaneous acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI). The vast majority of patients experiencing PMI do NOT have acute chest pain
      or other symptoms typical for AMI likely because they are narcotized or sedated and random
      ECGs are often not informative. Accordingly, most patients with PMI are currently not
      detected in routine clinical practice. Missed diagnosis is invariably associated with missed
      opportunity for the initiation of treatment. As most patients with PMI are missed in routine
      clinical care, the true incidence of and outcome after PMI are largely unknown. Prior studies
      have often not obtained a baseline sample and thus have suggested that all cTn elevations are
      likely due to AMI which may exaggerate the numbers. In addition, usually conventional less
      sensitive assays have been used. Further, the predominant pathophysiology of PMI is currently
      unknown. It has been suggested that type II MI characterized by coronary perfusion pressure
      mismatch and not type I MI characterized by acute thrombotic coronary occlusion is the
      predominate mechanism. However, autopsy data suggest that plaque rupture is more common.
      Thus, it may be that type 2 AMI is more common but that the modest incidence of type 1 AMI is
      not dangerous prognostically.

      Aim: To explore the incidence, patient characteristics, pathophysiology, and long-term
      outcome of PMI after major non-cardiac surgery

      Methodology: 2000 consecutive high-risk patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery will be
      included and followed for one year for the occurrence of all-cause death and other major
      adverse cardiac events. Patients receive a standardized assessment of cardiovascular status
      and systematic perioperative screening for PMI using high sensitivity cardiac troponin T
      (hs-cTnT) at baseline prior to surgery, as well as on day 1 and day 2 after surgery Acute
      cardiac injury will be defined as an absolute increase (+Δ) of hs-cardiac troponin (cTnT) of
      ≥14ng/L compared to baseline. A search for possible alternative causes for hs-cTnT elevations
      will be aggressively sought if a rising pattern of values is detected. Two independent
      experts will adjudicate the most likely cause of PMI using all clinical information
      pertaining to the individual patient including the 12-lead ECG, peak hs-cTnT blood
      concentrations, coronary angiography and myocardial perfusion scanning. Influence of PMI on
      occurrence of all-cause death will be assessed using multivariate Cox- proportional hazards
      analysis. Further, pre-operative and post-operative prediction models for death, major
      adverse cardiac events, and PMI shall be derived using a derivation-validation design.

      Potential Significance: This study will generate scientific data that have major scientific
      implications by contributing to closing current knowledge gaps concerning the influence of
      PMI on long-term mortality as well as the incidence, patient characteristics, and
      pathophysiology of PMI after non-cardiac surgery. This knowledge will have immediate clinical
      implications as it could e.g. lead to major changes in perioperative management with
      reconsiderations of the necessary target blood pressure to avoid coronary perfusion mismatch
      and consecutive cardiac injury.

        Consecutive patients that underwent a systematic approach to PMI detection at University
        Hospital Basel, a tertiary care center, will be included.

        The screening consists of a pre-operative &quot;baseline&quot; measurement of hs-cTnT within 30 days
        prior to surgery, and two post-operative measurements taken on the first and second day
        after surgery. Screening is done in patients requiring hospitalization &gt;24 hours after
        surgery AND (aged ≥ 65 years OR history of coronary artery disease OR peripheral artery
        occlusive disease OR cerebrovascular disease). Patients are seen by a cardiologist in case
        of detection of a PMI.
