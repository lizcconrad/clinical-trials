        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 6 to 17 years inclusive at the time of consent/assent. The date of signature of
             the informed consent/assent is defined as the beginning of the Screening Period. This
             inclusion criterion will only be assessed at the first screening visit.

          2. Male, or non-pregnant, non-lactating female who agrees to comply with any applicable
             contraceptive requirements of the protocol or females of non-childbearing potential.

          3. Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
             (DSM-V) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD based on an accepted ADHD diagnostic
             instrument and documented in the subject's medical record. Subject's ADHD is currently
             adequately controlled with an amphetamine-based product.

          4. Subject is functioning at an age appropriate level intellectually, as determined by
             the investigator.

          5. Must be considered &quot;healthy&quot;. Healthy status is defined by absence of evidence of any
             active or chronic disease other than their ADHD following a detailed medical and
             surgical history, a complete physical examination including vital signs, 12-lead ECG,
             hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis.

          6. Ability to swallow a capsule of investigational product whole.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current use of any ADHD medication other than an amphetamine-based product.

          2. History of any hematological, hepatic, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal,
             neurological or psychiatric disease, gall bladder removal, or current or recurrent
             disease other than their ADHD

          3. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder
             that may require treatment

             mass index (BMI)- for-age sex-specific values

          8. Subject is significantly overweight based on CDC BMI-for-age sex specific values

          9. Subject has a known history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, advanced
             arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
             abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems

         14. Subject has a known family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia.

             abnormality

         16. Subject has abnormal thyroid function

         17. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational product(s),
             closely-related compounds, or any ingredients.

         18. History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year. Subjects with a
             lifetime history of amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant abuse and/or dependence
             will be excluded.

         19. Use Within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational product:

               -  have used an investigational product

               -  have been enrolled in a clinical study (including vaccine)

               -  have had any substantial changes in eating habits

         20. A positive screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse. A positive hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg); hepatitis C virus (HCV); or HIV antibody screen.

         21. Use of tobacco in any form in the last 30 days
