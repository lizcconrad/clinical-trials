      This is a 2 part study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion).

      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      DS-3032b that can be given to patients with multiple myeloma (MM) that is relapsed (has come
      back) and/or refractory (has not responded to treatment).

      The goal of Part 2 of this clinical research study is to continue to study the safety of the
      highest tolerable dose found in Part 1 of the study.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of up to 6 participants each will be
      enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up to 10 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of DS-3032b you receive will depend on when you join
      this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of DS-3032b.
      Each new group will receive a higher dose of DS-3032b than the group before it, if no
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of
      DS-3032b is found.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive DS-3032b at the highest dose that was
      tolerated in Part 1.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take DS-3032b capsules by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-21 of each 28-day study
      cycle. On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, you will take your morning dose of study drug at the
      clinic.

      You should take each dose of DS-3032b with at least 4 ounces of water about 2 hours before or
      1 hour after a meal. If you miss or vomit a dose of study drug at home, you should not retake
      the missed or vomited dose. Wait and take the next scheduled dose.

      You should bring any empty bottles and unused study drug to the clinic at each visit. You
      will be given a diary to record when you take your study drug each day.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker testing before your dose of study
           drug.

      If you have had some of these tests performed recently, you may not need to have them
      repeated.

      On Day 8 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) and biomarker testing
           before your dose of study drug. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body
           at different time points.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease and for
           biomarker testing. You may have this procedure performed at anytime between Day 24 of
           Cycle 1 and Day 5 of Cycle 2.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 2, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease. If you can become pregnant, this routine blood or urine
           collection will include a pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 4 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone survey.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate to
           check the status of the disease and for biomarker and cytogenetic testing.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after you have completed follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           the status of the disease. If you can become pregnant, this routine collection will
           include a pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, you will be contacted either by phone or
      during a clinic visit to find out what drugs you are taking and how you are doing. If you are
      called, it should take about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. DS-3032b is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 28 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

          1. Subjects must have relapsed and/or refractory myeloma with measurable disease, as
             defined by at least one of the following: *Serum M-protein level &gt;/=0.5 g/dL for
             Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin A (IgA), or Immunoglobulin M (IgM) disease; *
             M-protein or total serum Immunoglobulin D (IgD) &gt;/=0.5 g/dL for IgD disease; * Urinary
             Myeloma (M)-protein excretion of &gt;/= 200 mg over a 24-hour period; * Involved free

             definition, treatment with induction therapy, followed by high dose chemotherapy and
             autologous stem cell transplantation, and finally by maintenance therapy, would
             constitute one line, provided that multiple myeloma did not meet criteria for
             progression at any time during this period.

          3. Subjects must have disease that has relapsed and/or refractory after their most recent
             therapy, with progressive disease (PD) being defined as an increase of 25% from the
             lowest response value in any one or more of the following: *Serum M-protein (the

             increase must be &gt;/=200 mg/24 hours) and/or; * Only in subjects without a measurable
             serum and urine M protein level: the difference between involved and uninvolved free
             light chain (FLC) levels (absolute increase) must be &gt;10 mg/dL; * Definite development
             of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of
             existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; * Development of hypercalcemia

             Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version
             4.0

         14. Subjects who have received radiation therapy targeting &gt; 10% of the bone marrow space
             must have completed this at least 2 weeks prior to starting therapy with DS3032b.

         15. Subjects who have undergone any recent major surgery must have done so at least 4
             weeks prior to starting therapy with DS3032b, with the following exceptions:
             Vertebroplasty and/or kyphoplasty, which must have been performed at least 1 week
             prior to starting DS3032b; Planned elective surgery unrelated to the subject's
             diagnosis of multiple myeloma, such as hernia repair, may be allowed, at the
             discretion of the Principle Investigator, as long as it was performed at least 2 weeks
             prior to starting DS3032b, and subjects have recovered fully from this procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are receiving any concurrent investigational or conventional agent with
             known or suspected activity against multiple myeloma, or those whose adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier have not recovered to a severity
             of grade 0 or grade 1. Subjects with chronic Grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per
             discretion of the Investigator and MDACC investigational new drug (IND) Office (eg,
             Grade 2 chemotherapy-induced neuropathy).

          2. Subject who received any therapies intended to treat malignancy within 21 days of
             first receipt of DS-3032b

          3. Subjects with a malignancy that contains a non-synonymous mutation, insertion, or
             deletion in the TP53 gene determined previously or at screening.

          4. Subjects with known central nervous system involvement with multiple myeloma will be
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events.

          5. Subjects with a known history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to DS3032b.

          6. Subjects with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator.

          7. Subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          8. Subjects with an uncontrolled infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, antivirals,
             or antifungals, known human immunodeficiency virus infection, or active hepatitis A, B
             or C infection.

          9. Subjects with gastrointestinal conditions that could affect the absorption of DS-3032b
             in the opinion of the Investigator.

         10. Subjects with prolongation of corrected QT interval by Fridericia's method (QTcF) at
             rest, where the mean QTcF interval is &gt;450 milliseconds (ms) for males and &gt; 470 ms
             for females based on electrocardiogram (ECG).

         11. Subjects who have required plasmapheresis and exchange less than 2 weeks prior to
             initiation of therapy with DS3032b.

         12. Subjects with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, should not be enrolled. Subjects are not
             considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy for
             a prior malignancy, are disease free from prior malignancies for &gt;5 years, and are
             considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse. In addition,
             subjects with basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial carcinoma of
             the bladder, carcinoma of the prostate with a current prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
             value of &lt;0.5 ng/mL, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia will be eligible. Finally,
             subjects who are on hormonal therapy for a history of either prostate cancer or breast
             cancer may enroll, provided that there has been no evidence of disease progression
             during the previous three years.

         13. Substance abuse or medical, psychological, or social conditions that, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, may interfere with the subject's participation in the clinical
             study or evaluation of the clinical study results.

         14. Subjects with prior treatment with an MDM2 inhibitor.

         15. Nonclinical studies indicate that DS-3032b is metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Drugs that are
             strong inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes may alter the PK of DS-3032b and should
             therefore be avoided. St. John's wort (hypericin) therefore will not be permitted for
             30 days before and during participation in the study. Because DS-3032b is a substrate
             for CYP3A4/5 and grapefruit juice is a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, foods or beverages
             containing grapefruit should not be taken within 48 hours before initial dose of study
             drug and throughout the duration of the study.
