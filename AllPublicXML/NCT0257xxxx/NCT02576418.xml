      To calculate sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative
      predictive value (NPV) of PartoSure TTD test in predicting delivery within 7 or 14 days from
      testing and to compare it with cervical length (CL) measurement by transvaginal ultrasound
      (15 mm cut-off)

      -  This trial is a prospective observational study.

        -  Pregnancies after ART between 20 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks with symptoms of preterm labor,
           clinically intact membranes, cervical dilatation of ≤ 2 cm will be invited to
           participate to the study. Signed consent form is required to be able to participate to
           the study.

        -  PartoSure and CL will be performed on all patients and the test-to-spontaneous-delivery
           interval will be calculated.

        -  Trial Population:Pregnancies after ART between 20 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks with symptoms of
           preterm labor are hospitalized at My Duc hospital from October 2015 to April 2016. The
           sample size for this trial of 100 subjects.
