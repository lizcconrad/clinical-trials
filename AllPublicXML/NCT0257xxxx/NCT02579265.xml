    <textblock>
      To show the superiority in safety of Smoflipid over Intralipid® as measured by the number of
      study patients in each treatment group with conjugated bilirubin exceeding 2 mg/dL during the
      first 28 days of study treatment, confirmed by a second sample collected 7 days after the
      first sample.
