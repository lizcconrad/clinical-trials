  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a web-based Guided
      Self-Determination program among adults with type 2 diabetes in general practice in order to
      improve diabetes self-management behaviours and HbA1c through enhanced patient activation,
      self-care competence, and autonomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Web-based self-management programs have the potential to support adults with type 2 diabetes
      in managing their disease condition. However, improving health care outcomes through
      self-management interventions have shown somewhat ambiguous results. Therefore, it is
      suggested that interventions should be theory-based and incorporate well-defined counselling
      methods and techniques for behavioural change. To meet these challenges, the overall aim of
      this study is to assess the effectiveness of a theory-driven web-based Guided
      Self-Determination intervention among adults with type 2 diabetes in general practice in
      order to enable adults with diabetes to use their individual resources to self-manage their
      condition and reach treatment goals.

      A complex intervention design based on the framework of UK Medical Research Council is
      employed as a guide for developing and evaluating the intervention.

      This study consists of three phases:

        1. the modelling phase adapting the original Guided Self-Determination program to adults
           with type 2 diabetes, using a qualitative design

        2. feasibility assessment of the adapted intervention on the web, employing qualitative and
           quantitative methods and

        3. evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention on diabetes self-management behaviours
           and HbA1c, using a quasi-experimental design.

      The two first phases will provide important information about the development of the
      intervention and its acceptability, whereas the third phase will assess the effect on health
      care outcomes of this systematically developed intervention.

    <description>The GSD intervention consist of four e-consultations with structured reflection sheets. Reflection sheets are intended to increase patients' ability to express their views and prepare them for active participation in the care process. Through the web-based platform, the subsequent four e-consultations will allow for communication between patients and nurses. The platform allows the participants to fill in the reflection sheets using their own words and drawings to express their own experiences with self-management as well as to formulate behavioral goals and plans to achieve their goals. It also permits feedback from the nurses on these reflections sheets via secure emails. Each person will be able to access the web-based program from his or her own computers or other electronic devices.</description>
