      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of HSV529 vaccine in healthy volunteers
      with HSV infection and to determine if administration of the HSV529 vaccine increases the
      immune response in genital skin.

      The investigators will enroll a cohort of 8-10 HIV-1 seronegative, HSV-2 seropositive persons
      with recurrent genital HSV-2 lesions in an area amenable to genital biopsy. Participants will
      enroll when they have a genital lesion. They will undergo a lesion biopsy and a non-lesion
      biopsy. They will start suppressive valacyclovir 500 mg po daily for 4 weeks. Three days
      after completion of the 4 week valacyclovir course, participants will initiate vaccination
      with HSV529 on a 0, 1, and 6 month dose schedule. At each vaccination visits and at the 10
      days post vaccination visits, genital biopsies will be performed. Genital biopsies will be
      performed at the site of genital lesion and at a non-lesional genital site. PBMC will also be
      drawn. Two days after the second vaccination, an optional biopsy will be offered. Overall, a
      minimum of 14 genital biopsies will be performed for each participant: 7 at the genital
      lesion site, and 7 at the genital non-lesion site. Four control biopsies from the upper arm
      will also be performed. For participants who undergo the optional biopsy two days after Dose
      2, two additional genital biopsies will be performed. Participants will also collect daily
      genital swabs for HSV PCR for 30 days after each vaccination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HSV-2 seropositive by UW Western blot with a history of recurrent genital herpes, with
             lesions in an area amenable to biopsy.

          2. Aged 18 to 55 years on the day of enrollment.

          3. In good general health with absence of significant health problems as determined by
             medical history, physical examination, and laboratory screening performed during
             screening visits.

          4. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count, serum creatinine, and
             liver function (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) screening laboratory
             results do not fall into the range of values that are Grade 1 or greater as per the
             toxicity grading scale.

          5. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential i.e. surgically sterilized
             (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy) or, if of child-bearing potential and
             sexually active with a male partner, she must be willing to use a highly effective
             method of contraception (e.g., intrauterine device (IUD); oral contraceptives,
             diaphragm or condom in combination with contraceptive foam, jelly or cream; Norplant,
             DepoProvera, contraceptive skin patch or cervical ring) for at least 30 days prior to
             vaccination and until 30 days after final vaccination or be in a monogamous
             relationship with a male partner who has undergone a vasectomy at least 6 months prior
             to first dose of HSV529.

          6. Willingness to attend all scheduled visits and able to comply with all trial

             participation during the study period up to 6 months after the last dose of vaccine.
             The non-interventional follow-up for an earlier study (e.g., long-term surveillance)
             will be allowed.

          6. Severe active infection or serious HSV-2 related or unrelated medical conditions that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent study completion.

             year prior to Day 0.

          8. A history of HSV infection of the eye (e.g., herpes simplex interstitial keratitis or
