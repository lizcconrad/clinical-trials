  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lungs are made up of individual lobes. When a lung cancer tumour is detected in one of these
      lobes, surgeons typically perform a Lobectomy. A Lobectomy is the surgery most commonly done
      to treat early-stage lung cancer and requires removal of an entire lobe of the lung, which
      removes a large amount of lung tissue For patients with small tumours saving as much healthy
      lung tissue as possible is important. Each lobe of the lung has smaller sections called
      segments. When a lung cancer is in one of these segments, it is possible to remove that
      segment, without removing the entire lobe. This surgery is called a segmentectomy. Compared
      to a lobectomy, a segmentectomy saves a larger amount of healthy lung tissue.

      With the advances in screening technology for lung cancer tumours, an increasing amount of
      very small lung cancer tumours are being found, and the demand for segmentectomy is
      increasing. A segmentectomy is a hard surgery to perform robotically because it is difficult
      to view the tissue lines that separate each segment within the lobe. As a result, it is
      difficult for the surgeon to see exactly which pieces of tissue should be removed. Because of
      these challenges, many patients having robotic surgery will have a lobectomy, even if a full
      lobectomy is not needed.

      Near-Infrared Fluorescence (NIF) using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent dye is a recent
      advancement in the robotic platform of robotic surgery. The surgeon will view the CT scan to
      determine which segment the tumour is located in. Once identified, the surgeon will isolate
      the segment by cutting off the blood supply to that segment. Then ICG will be injected into a
      vein. It is expected that the entire lung, except the isolated segment, which will remain
      'dark' as it was isolated from blood supply, will fluoresce, giving off a green hue when
      viewed with the da Vinci Firefly camera. The surgeon will identify 'dark' segment, and will
      remove it. A pathologist will examine the excised tissue to ensure that the tumour was
      removed in its entirety. Once confirmed, the surgeon will end the procedure. If the
      pathologist determines that the segment removed did not contain the entire tumour, then the
      surgeon will perform a routine lobectomy. This ensures patient safety and confirms that all
      participants will have the entire tumour removed from their lung.

    <description>ICG will be prepared as a sterile solution (2.5 mg/10mL) for injection. After vascular ligation, a 6 to 8mL bolus of ICG solution will be injected into the peripheral vein catheter, followed by a 10mL saline solution bolus. The Firefly camera will then be used for the NIF imaging. It is expected that the entire lung, except the segment which was previously isolated from blood supply, will fluoresce within 30-40 seconds, exhibiting a green hue. The surgeon will perform the pulmonary resection and the resected 'dark' lung segment will be immediately evaluated by a pathologist, depending on the pathologist findings the operation may be concluded or the patient will receive a pulmonary lobectomy.</description>
