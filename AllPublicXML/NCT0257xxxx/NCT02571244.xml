      The study is a preliminary research aimed to compare the effectiveness of motivational
      interview (MI), Personalized text messages (TM) and usual care for outpatients, with focus on
      smoking cessation as the main outcome. Smokers patients receive brief interventions and
      nicotine replacement therapy during the hospitalization. After hospitalization discharge
      smokers will be allocated in a intervention or control arm. In the first and third months,
      after randomization, the patients will be contact to smoke abstinence assessment.

      Background: Research suggests that smokers who receive treatment inside the hospital and
      post-discharge follow up for at least a month has most likely to quit smoking than those who
      didn't receive any intervention. The current challenge is to know the best way to support
      these patients post-discharge for Brazilian context. Objective: The aim of this study is
      compare the effectiveness of motivational interview (MI) plus Personalized text messages (TM)
      and usual care for outpatients, with focus on smoking cessation as the main outcome. Methods:
      All patients admitted to the University Hospital of Juiz de Fora (HU/UFJF), between 06/2015
      to 01/2016, will be asked about the cigarettes consumption in the last 30 days. Smokers
      patients receive brief interventions and nicotine replacement therapy during the
      hospitalization. After hospitalization discharge smokers are allocated in a intervention or
      control arm. The intervention group receives a MI session by telephone and mobile phone TM
      twice a day during eight or fifteen days. The control group receives only usual care
      available inside the hospital. Results: At the first and third months, after randomization,
      the patients will be contacted for smoke abstinence assessment.

    <description>Inside the hospital: All participants will receive the written materials. Patients with high tobacco dependence (Fagerstrom screening test score 5 or higher) will receive also Nicotine replacement therapy. The written materials provide information on, benefits of quitting smoking, and strategies for a successful quit plan, including information on relapse prevention.
Post discharge extended treatment: Participants in this arm will receive a telephone counseling session using a motivational interviewing approach and fifteen or eight days of text messages. The timing, duration, and content of the counseling session will be consistent with guideline-based recommendations.</description>

    <description>After discharge the experimental group will receive extended care including a counseling session and text messages. The session will provide basic information about smoking and successful quitting. The counselor will use motivational interview techniques to build coping skills, with the goal of helping the participant build and implement a quit plan. The focus will then shift to increasing motivation to make quit attempt, including confidence building, medication use, and cessation planning.The session will last approximately 30 minutes. Participants in the experimental arm will be offered up to 30 text messages to help the patient implement the quit plan discussed during the phone call. Patients motivated to quit in the next 30 days or that had already quit will receive 30 messages (2 per day) and patients unwilling to quit 16 (2 per day). The messages follows the self efficacy theory.</description>
