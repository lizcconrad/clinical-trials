    <textblock>
      Axitinib is a drug which is approved by the FDA for patients with advanced kidney cancer who
      have already received some treatment. It works by reducing blood flow to a tumor. Axitinib is
      normally give at 5mg twice per day and sometimes this dose is increased if patients tolerate
      it. The purpose of this study is to figure out a different way to decide which dose of
      axitinib each patient should receive based on the side effects they experience.

      Primary objective To determine whether axitinib given on an individualized dose/schedule for
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma following immunotherapy with PD-1 and PD-L1 Inhibitors leads
      to improved PFS.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To characterize the objective response rates in patients given axitinib on an
           individualized dose/schedule.

        2. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of an alternative method of axitinib titration.

        3. To characterize the anti-tumor effect, as measured by change in tumor burden per RECIST
           1.1, of axitinib titration performed after initial RECIST PD on axitinib.

    <description>Tumor Response, defined as overall confirmed objective response, is confirmed complete response (CR) according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1: Partial response (PR) is defined as a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.</description>

    <description>All subjects will be given axitinib on an individualized dosing schedule. Axitinib will be administered orally beginning with 5mg twice a day and can be escalated or reduced if specific grade 2 or greater toxicity develops. Axitinib will continue until progression. At progressive disease, dose escalation above current dose is allowed based on investigator discretion of clinical benefit. However, axitinib should be discontinued if a subject experiences a second RECIST progressive disease following dose escalation, patient intolerability, or at provider discretion.</description>
