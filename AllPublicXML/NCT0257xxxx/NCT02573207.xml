  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect clinical, echocardiographic, nuclear imaging and hemodynamic data in
      a group of patients with end stage ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing left ventricular assist
      device (LVAD) implantation to investigate the incidence of recovery of myocardial function
      when supported with LVADs, and to study the association between hibernating myocardium and
      myocardial recovery in this population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical, echocardiographic and hemodynamic data will be obtained from the patients' medical
      records. Assessment of viability will be performed using a Tl-201 Rest-Redistribution
      Scintigraphy protocol within 2 weeks before LVAD implantation and 2 months after LVAD
      implant. Recovery of myocardial function will be assessed using available 2D transthoracic
      echocardiographic images and with the novel imaging modality, Speckle Tracking
      Echocardiography (STE), in order to provide a regional quantification of the myocardium, in
      the context of TL-201 results. Transthoracic echocardiograms will be performed 2 weeks prior
      to the LVAD implant and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after implantation.

      <textblock>
        Adult patients (&gt;= 18 years old) with end stage ischemic cardiomyopathy receiving a LVAD at
        the U.T.A.H. Cardiac Transplant Program. We will exclude subjects with acute forms of heart
        failure and patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% and
        non-obstructive coronary artery disease.

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female &gt;= 18 years of age.

          2. End stage chronic and dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy requiring LVAD support.

          3. Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained
             prior to initiation of any study procedures.

        Ischemic cardiomyopathy is defined by a LVEF &lt; 40% and any of the following:

          -  History of myocardial infarction or revascularization.

          -  History of angina or chest pain and evidence of scarring in non-invasive imaging
             studies corresponding to previous myocardial infarction.

          -  Presence of ≥ 75% stenosis of the left main or proximal left anterior descending
             artery, or ≥ 75% stenosis of 2 or more epicardial vessels in a patient with
             unexplained cardiomyopathy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant and/or lactating women and women of child bearing potential who are not using
             acceptable means of contraception. Women of childbearing potential must be using
             adequate measures of contraception (as determined by the Investigator) to avoid
             pregnancy and should be highly unlikely to conceive during the study period. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screen.

          -  Patients with acute forms of HF: acute onset of symptoms &lt; 3 months, no left and right
             ventricular dilation.

          -  Other conditions that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator may increase risk
             to the subject and/or compromise the quality of the clinical trial.
