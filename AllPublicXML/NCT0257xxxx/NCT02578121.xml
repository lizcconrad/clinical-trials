      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of Ixazomib when combined with
      Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone, in terms of overall response rate in subjects with relapsed
      Multiple Myeloma

      This single arm, Phase II study will examine the efficacy and safety of the novel
      Proteasome/IMiD combination of Ixazomib 4mg days 1, 8, 15, Pomalidomide 4 mg days 1-21,
      Dexamethasone 20 mg days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28 day cycle, in relapse patients. The long
      term aim being to develop a backbone regimen to which future novel targeted treatments may be
      added as part of a personalized medicine approach.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the
             study:

               -  Male or female patients 18 years or older.

               -  Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related
                  procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent
                  may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical
                  care.

               -  Female patients who:

        Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically
        sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of
        contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent form through
        90 days after the last dose of study drug, AND Agree to practice true abstinence when this
        is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg,
        calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not
        acceptable methods of contraception.)

          -  Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status post-vasectomy), must agree
             to one of the following: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the
             entire study treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug,
             OR Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.)

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma and must
             have received at least one line of prior therapy. Patients must be at least 14 days
             beyond the last multiple myeloma therapy and have recovered from acute toxicities of
             prior therapies measured by CTCAE (Version 4.0)

          -  Patients must have life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and/or other performance

          -  Patients must meet the following clinical laboratory criteria:

        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,000/mm3 and platelet count&gt; 50,000/mm3. Platelet
        transfusions to help patients meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days
        before study enrollment. Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN).

             of prior chemotherapy.

          -  Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field is small, 7 days
             will be considered a sufficient interval.

          -  Central nervous system involvement.

          -  Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14
             days before study enrollment.

          -  Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including uncontrolled

             unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.

          -  Ongoing or active systemic infection, active hepatitis B or C virus infection, or
             known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,

             tolerance of oral medications including difficulty swallowing.

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before study enrollment or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are
             not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.

          -  Patient has &gt; Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, or Grade 2 with pain on clinical
             examination during the screening period.

          -  Participation in other clinical trials, including those with other investigational
