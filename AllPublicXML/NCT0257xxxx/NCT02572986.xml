  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scabies is an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei). Diagnosis
      of scabies is made based on clinical symptoms, such as nocturnal itching, and appearance and
      distribution of the rash. Definitive diagnosis includes the microscopic identification of the
      mite, mite eggs, or mite fecal matter in the skin. Topical permethrin is considered the drug
      of choice for the treatment of scabies. It is a synthetic pyrethroid that is safe for use in
      adults and children 2 months and older.

      This study will evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of a generic permethrin cream 5% to
      Elimite® in the Treatment of Scabies.
