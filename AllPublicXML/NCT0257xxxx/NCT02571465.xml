  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To overcome the limited accuracy of functional hemodynamic parameters such as stroke volume
      and pulse pressure variation (SVV and PPV) during spontaneous breathing, a Passive Leg
      Raising (PLR) manoeuvre has been suggested as a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness.

      Aim of this study was to evaluate fluid responsiveness using SVV, PPV and PLR during the
      transition from controlled to spontaneous breathing in cardiac surgery patients

      In patients after elective off-pump CABG are enrolled hemodynamic measurements are performed
      in the postoperative period upon arrival in the ICU using a PiCCO2 system (Pulsion Medical
      Systems, Munich, Germany).

      Controlled fluid challenges (500 ml) are done at 3 time-points:

      A) during controlled mechanical ventilation B) during pressure support ventilation with
      spontaneous breathing and C) after extubation.

      Stroke volume (SV), SVV and PPV as well as standard hemodynamic parameters (MAP = mean
      arterial pressure, HR = heart rate) are assessed.

      A PLR is performed before fluid administration at all 3 time points. A positive response is
      defined as an increase in SV&gt;15 %.

      Prediction of fluid responsiveness will be tested by AUC (area under the receiver operating
      characteristic - ROC - curve).
