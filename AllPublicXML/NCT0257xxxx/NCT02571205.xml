      &quot;Observational study of clinical outcomes for testosterone treatment of pubertal delay in
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy&quot; is a single centre observational study that aims to follow the
      progress of 20 adolescents with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and delayed puberty who are
      treated by the Newcastle muscle team, as they are treated with testosterone to induce
      puberty. The participants will all be treated with the standard stepwise regimen of
      testosterone injections every 4 weeks and data will be collected to help determine the
      effectiveness and tolerability of the current treatment regimen. The investigators will use
      the data to explore the effect of testosterone on pubertal development, growth, muscle
      strength and function, bone mineral density and body composition and characterise any side
      effects. Semi-structured interviews will also be carried out to learn the boys' views on the
      tolerability of the regimen. The study will last up to a maximum of 27 months in total for
      each participant, but may be less if they are happy with pubertal development before this
      time. It is important to do this study because from the investigator's limited experience in
      this group, testosterone treatment seems to be well liked and tolerated but the best
      treatment regimen to use remains unknown and there is no current consensus. It is not
      currently part of the standard of care in DMD but it would be important to include it if this
      study can show that it is an effective treatment for pubertal delay.

        This is a single-centre, prospective, observational, study on clinical outcomes of
        testosterone replacement therapy in adolescents with DMD and delayed puberty. Being an
        observational study of routine care, there will be no specified end point. We will aim to
        recruit any adolescent with DMD and delayed puberty who is reviewed by the muscle team at
        the John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre from the study approval date.
