  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if applying parafilm as an external barrier on the
      central line in children having a bone marrow transplant helps to prevent central line
      associated bloodstream infection(s) and also to assess the ease of use of parafilm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) result in significant morbidity and
      mortality, particularly in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). HCT
      patients are at high risk for CLABSI due to multiple factors, including prolonged immune
      suppression and the need for long-term central venous access. The investigators want to
      assess the feasibility of the use of a parafilm central line barrier (parafilm) as standard
      of care in pediatric HCT patients. The investigators will also assess the effectiveness of
      the parafilm to reduce the incidence of CLABSI in these patients.

    <measure>Feasibility of the use of parafilm in inpatients, assessed by subject compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>At discharge (an expected average of 6 weeks from admission)</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of using parafilm as a protective barrier will be assessed by the number of catheter days that the subjects had parafilm correctly applied and intact. Compliance will be noted at patient care rounds and by daily recording of the nurse in the electronic medical record (EMR) (by lumen). The parafilm status will be recorded as &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;yes-inc,&quot; (if parafilm was incorrectly applied or applied but not intact)</description>

    <time_frame>Time between initial BMT discharge and either CVL removal or transfer back to primary MD (an expected average of 2-3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of using parafilm as a protective barrier will be assessed by reviewing outpatient logs and clinic documentation to determine if the patient's parafilm was correctly applied/intact (yes), not applied (no), or incorrectly applied/not intact (yes-inc).</description>

    <measure>Change in the rate of central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (at the time of placement of the CVC); 3 months (average time till removal of CVC)</time_frame>
    <description>Central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) is the identification of a bacterial infection from a blood culture drawn from a central venous catheter (CVC) in the absence of a primary source of infection from another body site. Catheter-days start at the time of enrollment or line placement, whichever occurs later. The CLABSI rate is the total number of CLABSI/1000 catheter-days.</description>

    <description>Pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) with central venous catheters (CVCs) will have pre-cut, single-use sections of parafilm applied over the CVC hub (if not connected) or around the CVC hub connection (if connected). Parafilm will be maintained on the CVC and routine CVC care will be continued, per institutional standard of practice, until the CVC is removed.</description>
