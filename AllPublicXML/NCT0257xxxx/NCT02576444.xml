  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase II trial is to determine tumor overall response rate
      (ORR) in molecularly selected patients with measurable disease as assessed by the Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), before versus after 16 weeks of treatment
      across tumor types in each arm of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II signal-searching study in a range of tumor types with the potential to
      identify novel tumor indications for combination therapy with olaparib that can subsequently
      be explored in dedicated studies. Patients will be enrolled in this study based on molecular
      markers from genetic profiling performed on their tumors prior to study entry (outside of
      protocol). The trial will also identify genetic determinants of response and resistance.

      Patients with tumors harboring mutations in DNA damage repair genes will be treated with
      olaparib. Patients with tumors harboring either TP53 or KRAS mutations or mutations in KRAS
      and TP53 will be treated with AZD1775 plus olaparib. Patients with tumors harboring PIK3CA,
      AKT, or ARID1A mutations or other molecular aberrations leading to dysregulation of the
      PI3K/AKT pathway will be treated with AZD5363 plus olaparib. Patients with tumors harboring
      mutations such as TORC1/2 or TSC1/2 or LKB1 mutations or are PTEN-deficient (determined
      either by genetic mutation or by IHC) will be treated with AZD2014 plus olaparib.
