  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational, prospective, non-interventional study will include cancer patients who
      need a treatment for hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH. Patients will be prescribed
      treatment(s) according with the clinical practice regardless of the patient participation in
      the study. The purpose of this NIS is to collect additional scientific and clinical
      information that can help in describing the characteristics of cancer patients with
      hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH, the current management of hyponatremia, the therapies to
      keep under control serum [Na+] and the guidelines for the management of this population in
      Italy.
