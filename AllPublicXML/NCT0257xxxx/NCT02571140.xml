      This study will have one stage consisting of multiple treatment visits. The study is designed
      to assess the safety and bioavailability of Entera's oral PTH(1 - 34) in adult male healthy
      volunteers in various formulation. The study is also designed to assess the reproducibility
      of pharmacokinetic profiles with various formulations.
