  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of all elderly (65 and older) patients hospitalized at the
      Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke. The patients who present a
      pharmacotherapeutic problem will be randomly allocated between intervention and control
      groups. Practically, the relevant data will be extracted from the Electronic Medical Record
      (EMR) on a daily basis and analysed by a Computerized Alert System (CAS) to identify
      pharmacotherapeutic problems. These problems will be analysed a pharmacist specialised in
      geriatrics to determine their clinical relevance and the modifications that can be made.
      Clinically relevant pharmacotherapeutic problems will be discussed by the pharmacist and
      treating physician to establish the changes needed to optimize drug therapy. A geriatrician
      will also be available to assist the pharmacist in his initial assessment for particularly
      complex cases. For control patients, a CAS analysis will be conducted to identify patients
      with a pharmacotherapeutic problem but there will not be a formal discussion amongst the
      health care providers (usual care) and the physicians of the control group will provide usual
      care to their patients. The investigators believe that it is ethical to provide usual care to
      the control group since the beneficial impact on patients outcomes of the investigators'
      intervention has not been demonstrated.

      Pharmacotherapeutic problems were prioritized by the CHUS Elderly Adapted Care-medication
      committee and are based on the Beers criteria with an emphasis on drugs involved in the
      development of delirium. Selected pharmacotherapeutic problems are: 1) For patients 75 and
      older: i) taking a PIM; ii) concomitant use of 4 or more drugs from a list of drugs active at
      the CNS; iii) positive test for delirium with a PIM; 2) For patients 65 years and older: i)
      taking levodopa (Parkinson indicator) with a PIM; ii) taking cholinesterase inhibitor or
      memantine (indicators of dementia) with a PIM. The use of levodopa, a cholinesterase
      inhibitor or memantine are frailty indicators.
