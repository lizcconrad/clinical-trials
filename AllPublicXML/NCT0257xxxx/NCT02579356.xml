    <textblock>
      The study design was composed of 2 parts, 2-way crossover and multiple-dose. There are having
      2 groups in each part that have divided period 1 and period 2, and wash-out period is 16 days
      between periods. Each group is taking Telmisartan (80mg) and/or Atorvastatin (80mg) once a
      day for 6 days.

             examination results within 3 years

          -  Healthy Subjects (no clinically relevant findings in any of the investigations of the
             pre-examination) as judged by the investigator

          -  Subjects who signed and dated in informed consent form indicating that the subject has
             decided to participate in the study after being informed of all pertinent aspects of
             the study

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of
             dosing)

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
             excretion (e.g. gastrectomy)

          -  Twofold or more than upper limit of normal range in laboratory test for ALT or AST

          -  Participating in other clinical trial study within 2 month preceding the first dose of
             investigational product

          -  History of significant alcohol abuse or drug abuse within one year prior to the

             month prior to dosing

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the lifestyle guidelines described in this protocol
