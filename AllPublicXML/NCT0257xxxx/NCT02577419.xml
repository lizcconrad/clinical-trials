  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast milk is the reference normative standard for infant feeding. When an infant is
      diagnosed with chylothorax, provision of breast milk must be temporarily discontinued due to
      the presence of long chain triglycerides (LCT) that contribute to persistent chylous
      drainage. In its place, the infant is prescribed a therapeutic formula high in medium chain
      triglycerides (MCT) as treatment for chylothorax. Families and health care providers are
      interested in using breast milk, in a modified fat form, as treatment for chylothorax
      instead. This study will assess growth in infants receiving one of two nutrient enriched
      modified fat breast milk (MFBM) treatments for chylothorax. If either of the proposed
      nutrient enrichment methods support growth, MFBM will become a standard chylothorax treatment
      option for infants at SickKids.
