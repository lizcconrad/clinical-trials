  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to determine whether a hand-held confocal microscopy probe may
      perform better than standard methods in detecting cancer or pre-cancerous abnormalities of
      the cervix. The confocal probe will provide invivo histopathology-like images of cell
      morphology and three-dimensional tissue architecture non-invasively in real time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will undergo standard management (colposcopy) for their cervical lesion as
      scheduled. For cervical sites suspicious of dysplasia, acriflavine hydrochloride 0.05%
      solution will be applied topically, then rinsed with saline prior to in vivo confocal imaging
      with the hand-held probe. Following that, a biopsy of the suspicious site will be performed
      irrespective of the confocal microscopy finding. A biopsy of the normal site will be taken
      for research purposes. The confocal probe imaging will not alter where and how the biopsies
      will be taken (no change to size of biopsy or location on cervix).

      The procedure will add approximately 15 minutes to the duration of the standard outpatient
      procedure. During each examination, the anatomical location of all tissue areas in question
      will be recorded using the clock-position nomenclature system. Some normal areas will be also
      localized and recorded as control. Digital images will be recorded in the computer.
