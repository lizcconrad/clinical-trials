  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of
      rosuvastatin when given alone (Reference treatment, R) compared to when given together with
      one of the three different doses of metformin (10 mg, Test treatment 1 (T1); 50 mg (T2); 500
      mg (T3)) or one of the two doses of furosemide (1 mg (T4); 5 mg (T5)).

      <recruitment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the study. No run-in or wash-out period was conducted, since the trial was conducted in healthy subjects, that were not expected to take medications regularly. Actual number of subjects enrolled in fact represents randomized subjects due to the study set up.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Subjects attended specialist sites which would then ensure that they (the subjects) met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be randomised to trial treatment if any one of the specific entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>
