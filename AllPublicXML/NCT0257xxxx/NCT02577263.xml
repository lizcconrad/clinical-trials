      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the impact of the FOLFOX regimen on
      quality of life and the incidence of chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity.

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the main cancer-related causes of death in the world. There is more
      than one standard treatment for non-metastatic advanced disease. Among the therapeutic
      alternatives there is high level of evidence to recommend surgery followed by
      chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy and for perioperative chemotherapy. These strategies have
      not been compared in adequate powered trials, so there are important regional differences in
      their use. Postoperative chemotherapy with oxaliplatin based chemotherapy may offer some
      advantages in limited resource settings, because of its lower logistic requirements and it
      could be specially useful in centers with high quality surgery. On the other hand one of its
      most important downsides could be a higher impact on quality of life particularly related to
      oxaliplatin induced neuropathy which can last long after the end of treatment. This is a
      prospective observational trial in which after consent subjects are going to be evaluated
      with the EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) questionnaires
      C30 and CIPN20 during FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with oxaliplatin) adjuvant treatment.
