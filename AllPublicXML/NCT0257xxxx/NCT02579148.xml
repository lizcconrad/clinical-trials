  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) is the proposed treatment
      feasible; 2) is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      diagnosed diabetic erectile dysfunction.

      Intracavernous transplantation of stem cells has been shown to improve erectile function in
      some preclinical studies. However, inadequate cell homing to damaged sites limited its
      functions. The investigators explore the effect of HUCMSC on improving erectile function of
      diabetic men, and whether collagen scaffolds contribute to long-term cell retention in the
      corpus cavernous and improves erectile function of diabetic men.
