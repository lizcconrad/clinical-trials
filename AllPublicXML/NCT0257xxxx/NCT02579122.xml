  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the fact that little is known about the pre- and post-interventional coagulation
      management of phenprocoumon patients with reviparin at general practices in Germany, an
      observational study is being initiated to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of
      reviparin in the area of outpatient, general practice-based care in the context of bridging
      therapy. Patients for whom bridging therapy with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was
      specified and for whom the LMWH reviparin was chosen for this purpose shall be investigated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt; 18 years old

          -  Requiring prophylaxis/bridging treatment with reviparin, e.g. for the prevention of
             venous thromboembolism in general and orthopaedic surgery, due to the decision of the
             treating physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hypersensitivity to reviparin or one of the excipients of ClivarinÂ® or other
             low-molecular-weight heparin preparations and/or heparin, e.g. confirmed or suspected
             immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (type 2)

          -  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min)

          -  Bleeding: like other anticoagulants, reviparin should not be used in conditions
             associated with an increased risk of bleeding, e.g. acute bleeding, haemorrhagic
             diathesis, coagulation factor deficiencies, severe thrombocytopenia, untreated
             arterial hypertension, bacterial endocarditis and subacute endocarditis, acute-onset
             gastrointestinal ulcers or haemorrhages, brain haemorrhage, spinal or ear or eye
             surgery, intraocular bleeding or corresponding injuries within the past 6 months

          -  Severe hepatic or pancreatic impairment

          -  Children

          -  Patients with a body weight &lt; 45kg

          -  Life expectancy of less than 3 months

          -  Pregnant women (due to the generally very long duration of treatment with LMWH in
             female patients who are already on anticoagulation therapy)
