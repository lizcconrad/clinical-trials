  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this post market study is to assess the impact of sleep-disordered breathing on
      the well-being of patients according to the treatment chosen, i.e. with or without
      implantation of the remedē® system to treat sleep-disordered breathing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor of this study, LivaNova, has a partnership with Respicardia, Inc who has
      developed a battery-powered implantable device that treats central sleep apnea. The device is
      used with a lead that delivers the stimulation therapy which causes the patient to breathe
      with a regular rhythm and an optional lead that senses breathing. This combination is called
      the remedē® system.

      The aim of this study is

        1. to collect data in order to get a better understanding of the characteristics and/or
           symptoms related to central sleep apnea

        2. to collect safety information of all patients diagnosed with central sleep apnea

        3. to obtain additional short and lang term information on the safety and performance of
           the remedē® system, including an evaluation if there's an impact on the quality of life
           of patients treated with the the remedē® system in daily practice.

      The information obtained from this study may provide better insight on the symptoms related
      to central sleep apnea, risk factors related to central sleep apnea therapy and use of the
      remedē® system which may help to treat other patients with potential sleep disordered
      breathing more appropriately.

      Approximately 300 patients (to be) implanted with the remedē® system will participate in this
      study at approximately 40 sites in Europe. For this purpose the investigators aim to screen
      approximately 1500 patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Also patients diagnosed with
      central sleep apnea, but not receiving the device will be followed through phone calls for 2
      years.

    <description>For all patients diagnosed with CSA who will not move forward with remedē® system therapy, the intention is to obtain information on their alternate therapy, if any, and safety information, including all cause mortality and all cause hospitalizations during phone calls at 6, 12 and 24 months after enrollment.</description>

    <arm_group_label>CSA patients with remedē system</arm_group_label>
    <description>For all patients diagnosed with CSA and referred for implant / or have already been implanted with remedē system, information from the implant procedure will be collected.
Patients will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline and during follow-up visits.
Patients will be evaluated at the time of therapy activation which may be followed by one or more titration visits. Patient follow-ups will be programmed at 6 and 12 months, and yearly, up to 5 years post-implant, until the last patients reach their 2-year follow-up.
Echocardiogram for patients with reduced ejection fraction (≤ 45%) and follow-up respiratory polygraphy are considered standard of care, however, to ensure sufficient data, related to the study objectives, are being collected, baseline and 12-months echocardiogram for a subgroup of patients and respiratory polygraphy at 12-month follow-up for all patients must be done when participating in this study:</description>
