      This study is designed to evaluate the performance of VCE in the assessment of mucosal
      inflammation 6 months after the first VCE procedure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center (up to 15 sites) study which aims to assess the ability
      of VCE (Video capsule endoscopy) to detect change in the severity of the small bowel mucosal
      disease activity in CD subjects after 6 months .

      Up to 75 subjects will participate in this study. An interim analysis will be done after
      study completion with 20 subjects. All subjects to be enrolled in this study will be
      pediatric and\or adult subjects with known Crohn's disease
