  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously it has been demonstrated that exposing the heart to electromagnetic field during
      exercise stress test improves the recovery following the stress test. This is explained by
      the effect of the electromagnetic field on the sympathetic activity of the heart. In the
      present study we would like to further investigate the effects of electromagnetic field on
      autonomic nervous system function in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain that usually
      have high sympathetic activity. Each patient will be exposed to 20 minutes of electromagnetic
      field during which the autonomic nervous system function will be measured. In addition,
      patient tolerability to the exposed magnetic field will be investigated. We assume that short
      exposure to electromagnetic field would result in decreased sympathetic activity and
      therefore, on the long run, could be suggested as a therapeutic tool for such patients.

      Adult patients suffering from chronic muscoloskeletal pain will be recruited to this study
      during their weekly visits to the Department for Complementary Medicine at Sheba Medical
      Center. Patient will be exposed to 20 minutes of weak intensity and low frequency
      electromagnetic field while seated, during which heart rate variability measures will be
      recorded. In addition, patient tolerability to the exposed electromagnetic field will be
      investigated, including VAS score (pain score). This is a double blind placebo-control study
      by which neither the patients nor the physicians know which treatment is given to the
      patients. The study code will be open only at the end of the trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduced heart rate variability measures associated with sympathetic activity</measure>
    <time_frame>By the end of the experiment: following 20 minutes of PEMF exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability will be measured at baseline, prior to exposure to PEMF, and continuously for 20 minutes during exposure to PEMF, and 5 minute thereafter, after removal of the PEMF. Changes in heart rate variability (increase in high frequency and decrease in low frequency spectra) between exposure to PEMF and baseline will be evaluated. We hypothesize that heart rate variability measures reflecting sympathetic activity (low frequency spectra) will be reduced during exposure to PEMF with consequence increase in parasympathetic autonomic activity (high frequency spectra).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduced VAS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately at the end of the experiment: following 20 minutes of PEMF exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Since VAS is visual analogue scale pain score that reflects sympathetic activity we expect to monitor a reduced score following exposure to PEMF, which should be in correlation with increased parasympathetic activity (as measured by heart rate variability measures).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>No change in patients tolerability to the electromagnetic field</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately at the end of the exposure: following 20 minutes of PEMF exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>As a secondary outcome we would like to assess patients tolerability to 20 minutes exposure to PEMF. We do not expect any change in tolerability score due to the exposure to PEMF.</description>
