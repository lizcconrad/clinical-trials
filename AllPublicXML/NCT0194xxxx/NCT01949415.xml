  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      House Dust Mites (HDM) are arachnids that infest bedding, carpet, upholstered furniture and
      fabric. Like many other allergens, exposure to HDMA in sensitised patients is associated with
      poorer lung function, greater medication requirements and more asthma symptoms as well as
      chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In contrast to other allergens, there is evidence that HDMA
      leads to the development of asthma, in addition to exacerbating pre-existing asthma in
      HDM-sensitised patients.

      ToleroMune House Dust Mite (TM-HDM) is being developed for the treatment of HDM allergy.

      Study TH002 evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of TM-HDM. This study will
      identify cellular, proteomic or genetic biomarkers of efficacy to TM-HDM treatment in TH002
      study participants
