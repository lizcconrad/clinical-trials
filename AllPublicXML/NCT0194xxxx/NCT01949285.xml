  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if non-invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can be
      used to: 1) assess spared function following a spinal cord injury; and 2) be use for
      rehabilitation.

      This study is to determine if non-invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can be
      used to: 1) assess spared function following a spinal cord injury; and 2) be use for
      rehabilitation.

      The investigators hypothesize that this type of stimulation can be used to locate and
      determine if any spinal (nerve) pathways or connections were spared following a spinal cord
      injury. We also hypothesize the same stimulation can help revive or recover function to
      muscles connected to these spared spinal (nerve) pathways in individuals who are clinically
      paralyzed. Our research has demonstrated that modifying the activation state of the spinal
      cord after an injury, or awakening the spinal cord, can benefit people with paralysis years
      after a spinal cord injury. This method and device have not yet been approved by the FDA for
      the treatment of paralysis and are under investigation. This study if successful will help
      provide further evidence that could be use to one day to gain FDA approval.

American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring system, Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Ashworth Spasticity Scale, Penn Spasm Frequency, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Spasticity, Electromyographic (EMG) recordings, Joint angle (goniometer) measures, kinematic analysis.</description>
