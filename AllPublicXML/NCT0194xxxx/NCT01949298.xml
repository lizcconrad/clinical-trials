  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Edentulous patients have to wait after extractions and again after surgical implant placement
      for healing to occur before the implants can be restored and patients can go back to normal
      function. This delay in loading of implants can be handicapping for the patient, esthetically
      and functionally. Hence this project was undertaken with the purpose of reducing this wait
      period and achieving early rehabilitation in these patients. The aim of the project is to
      compare immediate loading versus delayed loading of implant supported mandibular dentures.

             completion of study participation.

          -  Conditions requiring chronic routine use of antibiotics or requiring prolonged use of
             steroids.
