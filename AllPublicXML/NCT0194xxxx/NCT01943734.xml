      Objective: To verify the influence of information passed during anthropometric assessment
      would have in physical exercise (PhE) and eating habits of 14 participants (female=11;
      51,07+-8,17 years) from the Stretch Break Program of Federal University of Paraíba (SBP of
      FUPb). Methods: The research was a descriptive cross-sectional quantitative and qualitative

    <description>Height (cm) was measured with a stadiometer (Sanny), body weight (kg) was measured using a digital scale (TechLine), circumference (cm) was measured (Sanny) at the midpoint between lower costal margin and the superior iliac crest and blood pressure (mmHg) was measured with a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope (Premium). Direct measurement assessed body mass index, waist-to-height-ratio and blood pressure classification (determined by highest blood pressure category - systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure).</description>
