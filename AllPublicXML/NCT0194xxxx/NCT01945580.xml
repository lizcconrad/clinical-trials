  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare transvaginal repair with a biologic graft to traditional native tissue repair in
      women surgically treated for anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate clinical effectiveness of transvaginal repair with
      Xenform against traditional native tissue repair in women surgically treated for anterior
      and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse. Secondary objectives are to evaluate Xenform-related
      complications and subject reported outcomes.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non-inferiority of transvaginal repair with
      Xenform over native tissue repair at 36 months as compared to baseline. Success will be based
      on a composite of objective and subjective measures.

      Additionally, a co-primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non-inferiority of
      transvaginal repair with Xenform to native tissue repair for safety by comparing rates of
      serious device or serious procedure related complications between baseline and the 36 month
      time point.

      The secondary endpoints of the study include assessments of complications and subject
      reported outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is female

          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age

          -  Subject has pelvic organ prolapse with the leading edge at or beyond the hymen. At or
             beyond the hymen is defined as POP-Q scores of Ba≥0 (for prolapse of the anterior
             compartment alone) or C≥0 (for prolapse of the apical compartment alone) or C≥-1/2 TVL
             and Ba≥0 (for a multi-compartment prolapse that includes the anterior and apical
             compartments).

          -  Subject reports a bothersome bulge they can see or feel per PFDI-20, question 3,
             response of 2 or higher (i.e., responses of &quot;somewhat&quot;, &quot;moderately&quot;, or &quot;quite a
             bit&quot;)

          -  Subject or subject's legally authorized representative is willing to provide written
             informed consent
