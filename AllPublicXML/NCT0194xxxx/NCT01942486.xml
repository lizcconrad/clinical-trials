  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a special coating, applied to the surface of
      glasses can reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches in children and
      adolescents. This study is being conducted by researchers at Primary Children's Medical
      Center, The John Moran Eye Center, and the University of Utah Department of Electrical
      Engineering. The investigators have determined that a specific frequency of light is
      particularly bothersome to migraine patients. The coating they've developed is designed to
      block this frequency of light. Very few treatments are approved for the treatment of
      childhood migraine. The investigators hope that these glasses will provide a safe way to
      improve headaches in children.
