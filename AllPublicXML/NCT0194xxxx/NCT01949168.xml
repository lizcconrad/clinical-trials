  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of Boceprevir-based therapy
      for the treatment of genotype 6 chronic hepatitis C infection.

      Boceprevir has recently been approved for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C
      infection. Recent in vitro studies suggest similar efficacy against genotype 6 chronic
      hepatitis C infection.

      The investigators therefore hypothesise that:

      i) Boceprevir is a potent inhibitor of genotype 6 hepatitis C replication in vivo.

      ii) Boceprevir in combination with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin for 24 weeks will
      cure a high proportion of patients chronically infected with genotype 6 chronic hepatitis C
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genotype 6 HCV (HCV-6) is common in parts of South-East Asia, in particular Vietnam. There is
      a small but growing population of immigrant patients with chronic HCV-6 in Australia. The
      current standard-of-care treatment (SOC) for chronic HCV-6 infection is peg-interferon-α
      (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy for 48 weeks. The available data evaluating treatment
      outcome suggests that SVR rates are intermediate between those of HCV-1 and HCV-2/3. There is
      a medical need for novel therapies that might increase SVR rates and/or allow shortened
      treatment duration.

      Boceprevir is a novel HCV NS3 protease inhibitor, and boceprevir-based triple therapy has
      recently been approved for the treatment of HCV-1. Boceprevir also appears to have some
      antiviral effect against HCV-2 and HCV-3 in vivo. Boceprevir has not been used to treat
      patients with chronic HCV-6 infection. Recent in vitro data have demonstrated that boceprevir
      has an antiviral effect against HCV-6.

      The investigators are therefore undertaking an investigator-initiated proof-of-concept pilot
      study of boceprevir-based therapy for the treatment of patients chronically infected with
      HCV-6.

      The study population will consist of a representative group of 30 adult patients who are
      chronically infected with genotype 6 HCV. All patients will be of Asian background, will be
      non-cirrhotic, and will carry a &quot;good response&quot; IL28B genotype (C/C for rs12979860). The
      patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of 4 Hepatology units in Melbourne,
      Australia, represented by the principal and associate investigators.
