  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PROSper is a prospective cohort study of 100 women 35-50 years of age with BRCA 1/2 mutations
      who have elected to either undergo risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) or nonsurgical
      management. The investigators will compare the change in cardiovascular health, bone health,
      sexual function, quality of life, and menopausal symptoms over 3 years of follow-up between
      women who undergo RRSO (baseline just prior to surgery) and age-matched controls that do not
      undergo RRSO.

      The investigators hypothesis is that women who undergo a premature surgical menopause induced
      by RRSO have worse cardiovascular health and bone health compared with women who do not
      undergo RRSO.
