      This is a European multinational, multicenter, non-interventional (observational) and
      prospective study. It is carried on to confirm in real life conditions the benefit/risk of
      vandetanib (CAPRELSA™) 300 mg, both in RET negative and RET positive patients with
      symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic MTC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, non-interventional (observational) and prospective
      study. European countries where vandetanib is on the market will participate in the study.

      This study is being conducted to fulfil the specific obligation post-authorisation measure
      for the conditional marketing authorisation. It is carried on to confirm in real life
      conditions the benefit/risk of vandetanib (CAPRELSA™) 300 mg, both in RET negative and RET
      positive patients with symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally
      advanced/metastatic MTC. The clinical benefit of vandetanib (CAPRELSA™) 300 mg has previously
      been established in a clinical trial (Study 58) on the basis of a clinically and
      statistically significant advantage in progression free survival (PFS) which was supported by
      a high response rate and substantial duration of response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Signed informed consent 2. Male or female aged 18 years or above 3. Histological
        diagnosis of MTC 4. Patients with symptomatic and aggressive sporadic MTC, who have
        unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic disease. (The factors considered by the
        investigator to determine a patient's disease to be symptomatic and aggressive will be
        recorded in the CRF). 5. Measurable disease:

          -  assessment confirmed within the 12 weeks previous to start of treatment, and

          -  defined according to RECIST 1.1: at least one lesion, not irradiated, that can be
             accurately measured as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must
             have short axis ≥15 mm) with CT or MRI and which is suitable for accurate repeated
             measurements. Measurable lesions with calcifications should not be assessed as target
             lesions unless no other measurable lesion is available. 6. Known definite RET mutation
             status (definition according to section 3.2). The status should be:

          -  for patients prescribed with vandetanib: positive or negative

          -  for patients not prescribed with vandetanib: negative RET mutation status must be
             determined from a tumour sample obtained within 18 months prior to enrollment. It is
             strongly recommended that a tissue sample obtained within 6 months prior to enrolment
             is used. 7. For patients newly prescribed vandetanib 300 mg, the prescription should
             be issued according to marketing authorisation and following the vandetanib Summary of
             Product Characteristics (SmPC) (Appendix B). The starting dose could be reduced to 200
             mg in patients with moderate renal impairment

               -  Exclusion criteria

                    1. Current or planned inclusion/participation in a clinical trial

                    2. Patients already receiving vandetanib or who have received vandetanib for
                       their MTC before the study first visit

                    3. Contraindications according to the vandetanib SmPC (not applicable for
                       patients who do not receive vandetanib): (a) Patients with a QT interval
                       corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval over 480 msec: (i) Congenital long
                       QT syndrome (ii) Concomitant use of vandetanib with the following medicinal
                       products known to also prolong the QT interval and / or induce Torsades de
                       pointes: Arsenic, cisapride, erythromycin intravenous (IV), toremifene,
                       mizolastine, moxifloxacin, Class I A and III antiarrhythmics (b) Currently
                       pregnant or breast feeding (c) Hypersensitivity to the active substance or
                       to any of the excipients (d) Severe renal impairment: creatinine clearance &lt;
                       30 ml/minute calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula. (See Appendix D). (e)
                       Serum bilirubin greater than 1.5 x the upper limit of reference range (ULRR)
