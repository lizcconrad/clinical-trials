  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To augment the MAHI Exo-II, a physical human exoskeleton, with a non-invasive brain
           machine interface (BMI) to actively include patient in the control loop and thereby
           making the therapy 'active'.

        2. To determine appropriate robotic (kinematic data acquired through sensors on robotic
           device ) and electrophysiological ( electroencephalography- EEG based) measures of arm
           motor impairment and recovery after stroke.

        3. To demonstrate that the BMI controlled MAHI Exo-II robotic arm training is feasible and
           effective in improving arm motor functions in sub-acute and chronic stroke population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide an adjunct to accelerate neurorehabilitation for stroke patients.
      The MAHI EXO-II, a physical human-robot interface, will be combined with a non-invasive
      brain-machine interface (BMI) to actively include the patient in the training of upper
      extremity motor functions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Fugl-Meyer Arm (FMA)Motor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FMA is a stroke-specific, performance based impairment index. It quantitatively measures impairment, based on Twitchell and Brunnstrom's concept of sequential stages of motor return in hemiplegic stroke patients. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 33 items for the upper limb component of the F-M scale; (0:can not perform; 1:can perform partially; 2:can perform fully). Total range is 0-66, 0 being poor and 66 normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cortical dynamics measured by Electroencephalography (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EEG activity in the low-frequency delta band will be used to train the neural interface for MAHI-EXO II. This outcome measure will quantify the change in brain activity occurring as a result of the training session with the neural interface and the robot. It is hypothesized that delta band power will increase (i.e., activity will become &quot;stronger&quot;) and more synchronized with movement of the MAHI-EXO II, with training.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in robotic motor coordination measure: trajectory error (TE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trajectory error measure is defined as a normalized difference between the desired and the participant's trajectory from one point in the workspace to another. Lower values reflect better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in robotic motor coordination measure: Smoothness of Movement (SM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Smoothness of movement (SM) measure is a correlation coefficient that express the correlation between the participant's speed profile and a speed profile of an ideal trajectory utilizing the minimum jerk principle. It takes values between 0-1, where 1 optimal movement smoothness and 0 indicating poorest movement quality i.e., jerky movement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The JTHFT is a motor performance test and measures the time needed to perform 7 everyday activities (e.g., writing, feeding). Lower times represent better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT is used to assess subject's ability to manipulate-lift-release objects horizontally and vertically, which differs in size, weight and shape. The test consists of 19 items divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, gross arm movement) and each item is rated on a 4-point scale. The possible total score ranges between 0-57. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in brain volume of activation and signal intensity using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in brain networks, both structural and functional activation patterns associated with movement before and after training with the neural interface and robot will be assessed in this outcome measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in pain and fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain and Fatigue will be measured on a visual analogue scale. After each training session as well as at baseline, post-treatment and on follow up assessment, participants will be asked to rate their current pain and fatigue on a scale ranging from 0 = none to 100 = worst possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in grip and pinch strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A grip dynamometer or pinch gauge will be used to measure maximum gross grasp force and pinch force, respectively.</description>
