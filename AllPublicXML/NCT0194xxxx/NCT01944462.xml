  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals of this program are to measure the impact of a pharmacist pneumococcal
      vaccine education program (PPVP) using a senior center model of care and provide the
      pneumococcal vaccine to eligible participants.

      Hypotheses

        1. PPVP will result in improved knowledge and awareness in older minorities in the senior
           center setting (primary hypothesis);

        2. Participants who are vaccinated through the project will experienced increased trust in
           receiving vaccines from a pharmacist;

        3. Participants will be satisfied with and trust the PV information provided by pharmacists
           in the PPVP;

        4. PPVP is an efficient approach to educating patients in the senior center based on its
           costs;

        5. Participating pharmacists will be activated to implement PPVP learnings in their
           practice.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge and Awareness of Pneumococcal Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-test, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in knowledge and awareness of pneumococcal disease over time were assessed for the following domains: susceptibility to infection, symptoms of disease, severity of illness, and vaccination with an emphasis on vaccine efficacy, safety, and eligibility. Assessments at baseline, post-test (immediately following intervention), and 3 months using the Pneumonia Knowledge Questionnaire, an instrument developed by investigators to assess participants' knowledge and awareness in the domains of interest. Instrument consists of 5 &quot;mark all that apply&quot; items and one &quot;mark the best response&quot; item. Scores range from 0 (no correct responses) to 28 (all responses correct), with a higher score value corresponding to better knowledge and awareness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trust in Pharmacists as Vaccine Providers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-test (immediately following intervention), 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Trust in pharmacists as vaccine providers were measured by comparing responses to the trust items in the baseline, post-test (immediately following intervention), and 3-month assessments. Trust items were coded on a 4-level Likert scale, with lower values corresponding to higher agreement with the trust statements (therefore a lower mean response indicates greater trust). Minimum possible score was 1 (indicating complete trust in pharmacists as vaccine providers) and maximum possible score was 4 (indicating complete lack of trust in pharmacists as vaccine providers).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Activation was measured as number of participants having taken action at 3 months or planning action at baseline, post-test, and 3 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction With PPPP</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with PPPP was measured as participants' overall satisfaction with the content of PPPP, extent to which the participant felt engaged, and belief that the program helped them learn about pneumonia and the vaccination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Cost</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures PPPP intervention costs per participant. Consists of total program costs divided by number of participants. Value reported is the per-participant cost with measure type &quot;number&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacist Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacists who participated in the intervention were surveyed to determine their satisfaction with the program, including: 1) satisfaction with live action skit, 2) belief that PPPP was successful in educating participants, 3) belief that PPPP was successful in building trust in pharmacists among participants, 4) belief that PPPP was successful in increasing acceptance of pharmacists as immunizers, and 5) belief that PPPP will decrease barriers to vaccination among participants.</description>

        <title>Knowledge and Awareness of Pneumococcal Disease</title>
        <description>Change in knowledge and awareness of pneumococcal disease over time were assessed for the following domains: susceptibility to infection, symptoms of disease, severity of illness, and vaccination with an emphasis on vaccine efficacy, safety, and eligibility. Assessments at baseline, post-test (immediately following intervention), and 3 months using the Pneumonia Knowledge Questionnaire, an instrument developed by investigators to assess participants' knowledge and awareness in the domains of interest. Instrument consists of 5 &quot;mark all that apply&quot; items and one &quot;mark the best response&quot; item. Scores range from 0 (no correct responses) to 28 (all responses correct), with a higher score value corresponding to better knowledge and awareness.</description>

        <title>Trust in Pharmacists as Vaccine Providers</title>
        <description>Trust in pharmacists as vaccine providers were measured by comparing responses to the trust items in the baseline, post-test (immediately following intervention), and 3-month assessments. Trust items were coded on a 4-level Likert scale, with lower values corresponding to higher agreement with the trust statements (therefore a lower mean response indicates greater trust). Minimum possible score was 1 (indicating complete trust in pharmacists as vaccine providers) and maximum possible score was 4 (indicating complete lack of trust in pharmacists as vaccine providers).</description>
