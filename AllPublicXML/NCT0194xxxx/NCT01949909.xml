      P27A study is designed as a randomized phase Ia/Ib trial to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of the blood stage candidate vaccine P27A against P. falciparum - P27A antigen
      and associated adjuvant (Alhydrogel or GLA-SE) - in malaria non exposed European
      volunteers(Switzerland; phase Ia) and malaria exposed African volunteers (Tanzania; phase
      Ib).
