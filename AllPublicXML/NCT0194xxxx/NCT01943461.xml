    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial of avelumab (antibody targeting
      programmed death ligand 1 [anti PD-L1]) in Japanese subjects with metastatic or locally
      advanced solid tumors, followed by a consecutive expansion part in Asian subjects with
      gastric cancer.

          -  For dose escalation part: Histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally
             advanced solid tumors, for which no standard therapy exists or standard therapy has
             failed

          -  For expansion part:

               -  Availability of fresh and archive tumor in formalin fixed paraffin embedded

               -  With histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or refractory
                  unresectable Stage IV gastric or gastro-esophageal junctional adenocarcinoma
                  (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union Internationale Contre le
                  Cancer [UICC] 7th edition) and whose disease progressed after one or two prior
                  chemotherapy regimen(s) involving both fluoropyrimidines and platinum

               -  Presence of at least 1 measurable lesion according to RECIST version 1.1

               -  Subjects should not have severe peritoneal metastases. The following criteria
                  were applied:

                    -  No moderate-to-severe ascites (subjects with ascites restricted to the
                       perihepatic space or pelvic cavity)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 at the trial
             entry and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol

          -  All subjects must agree to use effective means of contraception with their partner

          -  Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug

          -  Prior therapy with any antibody/drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins (immune
             checkpoints)

          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment or concurrent systemic therapy with steroids or other
             immunosuppressive agents, or use of any investigational drug within 30 days before the
             start of trial treatment. Short-term administration of steroids (that is, for allergic
             reactions or the management of immune-related adverse events [irAE]) is allowed

          -  Previous malignant disease within the last 5 years with the exception of adequately
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer

          -  Non-oncology vaccine therapies for prevention of infection disease (e.g. seasonal flu
             vaccine, human papilloma virus vaccine) within 4 weeks of study drug administration.
             Vaccination while on study is also prohibited except for administration of the
             inactivated influenza vaccine.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation period

          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Clinically significant (that is, active) cardiovascular disease

          -  All other significant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease), which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, might impair the subject's tolerance of trial
             treatment

          -  Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of
