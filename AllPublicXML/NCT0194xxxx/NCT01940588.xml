    <textblock>
      Opioid Dependent Patients who have failed back surgery syndrome are detoxified and treated
      with a neuropsychoanalytic paradigm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were detoxified from opioid analgesics and treated with NSAIDs and other non-opioid
      analgesics, received neuropsychoanalytic therapy and low dose naltrexone. Patients kept a
      daily diary of: 0 - 10 pain, 0 - 10 function, hours worked, amount of alcohol drunk, illicit
      and licit drug use, number of health care provider appointments attended, number of self-help
      groups meetings attended across each of the six months of study. Six month outcomes of this
      approach with primary outcomes being sobriety, pain scores and function scores.
