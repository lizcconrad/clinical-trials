  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a CCTG sponsored project to determine if those recently screened for HIV would accept
      assistance to be linked into appropriate health services. After receiving their HIV results,
      high-risk individuals who test negative will have an option to be linked into a study that
      offers them Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), and individuals who test positive will have an
      option to be linked into care.

      If they accept, tested individuals will be in contact with an ALERT specialist that will help
      facilitate their linkage. The study's primary analysis will analyze how many HIV screened
      individuals accept the ALERT specialist assistance.

      Design: CCTG 593 is a project to evaluate the uptake and effectiveness of an ALERT specialist
      serving to

        1. link newly diagnosed, HIV infected persons from HIV testing sites to HIV specialist
           providers, and

        2. link confirmed HIV antibody negative persons with continued high risk behaviors to PrEP
           centers

      Duration: Each subject who agrees to linkage will receive ALERT follow-up until successful
      linkage or 60 days following enrollment for linkage to care or 90 days following enrollment
      for linkage to PrEP, whichever comes first. The duration of the 593 project will be for 3.5
      years or until all subjects have been enrolled and successfully linked, or 60 days pass for
      linkage to care or 90 days for linkage to PrEP.

      Sample Size: Up to 600 subjects will be tested and offered linkage across all CCTG sites: LA
      County-USC Medical Center, Harbor-UCLA/City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human
      Services, UCSD/San Diego Health and Human Services Agency.

      Study Population: Eligible subjects will include any persons 18 years of age or older who
      have been tested for HIV at one of the CCTG testing sites (LA County + USC, Long Beach
      Department of Health and Human Services, and San Diego Health and Human Services Agency).

    <description>Subjects screened for HIV at any CCTG consortium site will be offered Linkage to PrEP or Care, depending on HIV status. After results are received, HIV testers will obtain verbal consent from the subject to connect with the ALERT Specialist, or otherwise offer the subject the ALERT Specialist contact information. When contacted, the ALERT Specialist will coordinate with the subject the scheduling of the PrEP or Care visit, and remain in contact to ensure linkage.</description>
