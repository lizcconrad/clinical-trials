  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcutaneous sacral nerve stimulation
      (TENS SNS) versus percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is a more effective
      therapeutic option for subjects with idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) who have failed
      conventional therapy. Our primary hypothesis is that TENS therapy is a more effective
      treatment option due to ease of use and improved subject compliance with this form of
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the long-term efficacy, subject compliance, and subject satisfaction of
      percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) therapy versus transcutaneous electrical sacral
      nerve stimulation (TENS) for the treatment of subjects with idiopathic overactive bladder.
      Previous short-term studies suggest that these therapies have equal efficacy in improving OAB
      symptoms, but we hypothesize that long-term efficacy and success is actually higher in the
      TENS group due to ease of use, since subjects can self-administer this therapy. Secondary
      goals are to evaluate subject quality of life improvement scores, bladder diary scores
      (change in the frequency of urination), and changes in urodynamic studies while undergoing
      these therapies.

    <description>The primary response variable is 'success' at 1 year, defined as a 50% or more reduction in the total number of incontinence episodes, or a 25% or more reduction in number of daily or nightly voids AND that the patient continues to use the therapy at one year. Therefore primary response is: 50% reduction in incontinence, OR 25% reduction in nightly voids AND continued use of therapy at one year.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to the PTNS arm will undergo PTNS treatment once weekly for 30 minutes for 12 weeks total. If at 12 weeks they are considered to have a positive response to therapy, they will continue maintenance therapy in a tapered fashion: subjects will come in every 2 weeks for the next 8 weeks for 30 minute treatments (4 visits total), then every 3-4 weeks for 30 minute treatments for the remaining 32 weeks of the year (8-10 visits).</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to the TENS arm of the study will begin therapy after their baseline evaluation is complete. They will be issued a home TENS device (EMPI TENS Select) and will administer self-treatment daily for 2 hours per day (1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening) for a total of 12 weeks. If they are considered to have a positive response with TENS treatment, subjects will continue by weaning use over a three-month time period. They will begin with 3 x per week for 1 month, then 2 x per week for 1 month, then 1 x per week for 1 month, all at 2 hours per day.</description>

    <description>PTNS therapy is performed as follows; the subject sits in a frog leg position in a chair. The area where the needle will be placed is cleaned with an alcohol swab. A 34 gauge needle (equivalent to an acupuncture needle) is inserted percutaneously approximately 5 cm cephalad to the medial malleolus of the right or left ankle (subject choice) at a 60 degree angle. A surface electrode is placed on the medial aspect of the ipsilateral calcaneous. The needle and electrode are connected to a low voltage (9 V) electrical stimulator (Urgent PC). Stimulation current with a fixed frequency of 20 Hz and a pulse width of 200 msec is increased until flexion of the big toe or fanning of all toes becomes visible, or until the subject reports a tingling sensation across the heel or bottom of the foot. The current is then set to the highest level tolerable to the subject (0-10 mA) and the subject undergoes therapy for 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>TENS therapy will be administered as follows:
Surface electrodes, 2&quot; x 2&quot; in diameter, will be placed over sacral foramen S2-4, bilaterally, using 2 channels (4 electrodes total) - Approximate locations are over posterior superior iliac spine and inferior lateral angle of sacrum. Sticker electrodes for the duration of the study will be issued to subjects. They are adhesive and can be re-used for up to 3-4 weeks with proper skin care and electrode care.
The electrodes will be connected to the TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) device and the following settings will be pre-set:
Mode: Burst
Cycle: 10 seconds
Frequency: 10 Hz
Pulse Width: 250 µs
Intensity: to subject comfort level</description>
