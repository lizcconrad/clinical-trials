    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in KSQ Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Kellner Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ) is a patient-rated scale designed to assess distress using symptoms of depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, and somatization. The KSQ consists of 92 items which form the basis for the four subscales: depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, and somatic; of which 68 items indicate symptoms (symptom subscales) and 24 items are antonyms of some of the symptoms and indicate well-being (well-being subscales). A &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;true&quot; response on the symptom subscales scores 1, and a &quot;no&quot; or &quot;false&quot; on the well-being subscales scores 1. The maximum score for each symptom subscale is 17, and the maximum score for each well-being subscale is 6. The score of each subscale ranges from 0 to 23 (the sum of the symptom subscale and the well-being subscale). A higher score indicates more distress. The total score ranges from 0 to 92. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Delay Discounting - Log-transformed EDT DPDT Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>DPDT consists of approximately 110 choices between an immediate reward or a higher delayed reward, and between an immediate reward or a higher reward that only comes with a certain probability. The tasks are scored independently of each other and do not yield a total score. There will be two derived variables from this task; a delayed discounting rate and a probability discounting rate. The delay discounting value takes values from 0 and up, a higher delay discounting value indicates greater impulsivity. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 6 and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Irritability Scale (SIS) is a patient-rated scale designed to measure irritability. The SIS consists of 7 subscales assessing irritability, frustration, edginess/impatience/overreaction, moodiness, anger with self, anger with others, and temper. The patient rates the extent to which they have suffered from these symptoms. Each subscale has verbal descriptors (not at all, mildly, moderately, markedly, and extremely) as well as numerical scores from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) that provide more precise levels of the verbal descriptors. One additional question assesses number of days impaired by irritability over the period. The subscales are summarised to give the total score which ranges from 0 to 70, with higher values indicating worse outcome. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Delay Discounting - Log-transformed MCQ Scores</title>
        <description>The Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) is a patient-completed questionnaire designed to measure delay discounting, an index of impulsive behaviour. The MCQ consists of 27 choices between immediate and delayed rewards. The patients choose repeatedly between two hypothetical sums of money: a smaller amount now or a larger amount in the future (for example, ‘‘Would you prefer $27 today or $50 in 21 days?”). The answers provide an estimate of the patient’s discounting rate. The discounting rate parameter takes values between 0 and 1 and higher discounting rates indicate impulsivity. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

          <title>Shift From Baseline to Week 6 in Anger Attacks (AAQ)</title>
          <description>The Anger Attacks Questionnaire (AAQ) is a patient-rated scale designed to assess the presence of anger attacks over a period of time. The AAQ consists of 7 items. Patients are classified as having anger attacks when exhibiting the following 4 criteria: 1) irritability, 2) overreaction to minor annoyances, 3) occurrence of anger attacks (at least one of which occurred within the period), and 4) experienced 4 or more specific symptoms during at least one of the attacks. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>
          <population>Full-analysis set (FAS) and OC. Only patients who have both baseline and Week 6 data observed were included; the number of participants analysed is therefore smaller than the defined FAS.</population>

        <description>The 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Clinician-Rated (IDS-C30) is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The IDS-C30 consists of 30 items assessing the symptoms of depression, as well as commonly associated symptoms (for example, anxiety, irritability), and topics relevant to melancholic or atypical features; the patient rates only one of the 2 items assessing appetite (decreased or increased), and only one of the 2 items assessing weight (loss or gain). Each of the items is rated on a 4-point anchored scale from 0 (least severe) to 3 (most severe). The total score is the sum of the 28 scored items, and ranges from 0 to 84, with higher values indicating worse outcome. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

        <description>The Kellner Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ) is a patient-rated scale designed to assess distress using symptoms of depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, and somatization. The KSQ consists of 92 items which form the basis for the four subscales: depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, and somatic; of which 68 items indicate symptoms (symptom subscales) and 24 items are antonyms of some of the symptoms and indicate well-being (well-being subscales). A “yes” or “true” response on the symptom subscales scores 1, and a “no” or “false” on the well-being subscales scores 1. The maximum score for each symptom subscale is 17, and the maximum score for each well-being subscale is 6. The score of each subscale ranges from 0 to 23 (the sum of the symptom subscale and the well-being subscale). A higher score indicates more distress. The total score ranges from 0 to 92. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

        <description>DPDT consists of approximately 110 choices between an immediate reward or a higher delayed reward, and between an immediate reward or a higher reward that only comes with a certain probability. The tasks are scored independently of each other and do not yield a total score. There will be two derived variables from this task; a delayed discounting rate and a probability discounting rate. The delay discounting value takes values from 0 and up, a higher delay discounting value indicates greater impulsivity.

        <description>The Sheehan Irritability Scale (SIS) is a patient-rated scale designed to measure irritability. The SIS consists of 7 subscales assessing irritability, frustration, edginess/impatience/overreaction, moodiness, anger with self, anger with others, and temper. The patient rates the extent to which they have suffered from these symptoms. Each subscale has verbal descriptors (not at all, mildly, moderately, markedly, and extremely) as well as numerical scores from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) that provide more precise levels of the verbal descriptors. One additional question assesses number of days impaired by irritability over the period. The subscales are summarised to give the total score which ranges from 0 to 70, with higher values indicating worse outcome. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

        <description>The Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) is a patient-completed questionnaire designed to measure delay discounting, an index of impulsive behaviour. The MCQ consists of 27 choices between immediate and delayed rewards. The patients choose repeatedly between two hypothetical sums of money: a smaller amount now or a larger amount in the future (for example, ‘‘Would you prefer $27 today or $50 in 21 days?”). The answers provide an estimate of the patient’s discounting rate. The discounting rate parameter takes values between 0 and 1 and higher discounting rates indicate impulsivity. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

The scores provide information to assess 6 first-order factors (attention, motor, self-control, cognitive complexity, perseverance, and cognitive instability impulsiveness) and 3 second-order factors (motor impulsiveness, non-planning impulsiveness, and attentional impulsiveness). The total score ranges from 30 to 120 with higher values indicating worse outcome.

        <description>The Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome. Subgroup analyses were performed for the change from Baseline to Week 6 in MADRS total score based on the patients’ BIS-11 total score at Baseline. The subgroups denoted BIS-11_HIGH had a BIS-11 total score at Baseline ≥median at baseline and the subgroups denoted BIS-11_LOW had a BIS-11 total score &lt;median at baseline. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>
