    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the safety and tolerability of the partial A1 agonist
      BAY1067197 in patients with chronic heart failure. BAY1067197 will be applied as a single
      dose of 30 mg in addition to standard therapy including a beta-blocker. The aim of the study
      is to assess if a single oral dose of 30 mg BAY1067197 is well tolerated when given on top of
      standard therapy for heart failure, particularly ß-blocker treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable systolic heart failure (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, heart
             failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]; New York Heart Association [NYHA]
             I-III) in sinus rhythm with a documented ejection fraction (EF) ≤45% within the last 3
             months

          -  Stable standard heart failure (HF) therapy including intermediate to high dose
             β-blocker with either ≥ 95 mg metoprolol succinate (controlled release tablet), ≥ 5mg
             Bisoprolol (immediate release [IR] -tablet) or ≥5mg Nebivolol (IR tablet) for at least
             4 weeks. Additional intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or
             angiotensin receptor blockers and optional aldosterone-receptor antagonists, diuretics
             or digitalis is allowed

             treatment such as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral ovarectomy, or hysterectomy

          -  Dependency on pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) device with
             pacemaker dependency (a paced ventricular rhythm &gt; 5% of heart activity)

          -  A history of relevant diseases of vital organs other than the heart, of the central
             nervous system or other organs

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study preparations (active substances or excipients of
             the preparations) or to any other β-blocker

          -  Current or history of AV-Block &gt; I°

          -  Unstable condition, indicated by requirement of IV drug (diuretic, inotrope, etc.) or
             NYHA IV

          -  Acute Coronary Syndrome (defined as unstable angina [UA], non-ST elevation myocardial
             infarction [NSTEMI], ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) within 3 months prior
             to first study drug administration

          -  History of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ≥ global initiative
             for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) II and/or allergic asthma
