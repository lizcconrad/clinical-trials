  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will help determine if the Better Choices Better Health Diabetes program
      (community-based or online, also known as the Diabetes Self-Management Program) improves the
      hbA1C of people with Type-II diabetes. The investigators will also examine 1) symptoms
      (fatigue, sleep, low blood sugar symptoms, depression, shortness of breath), 2) healthy
      behaviors (blood sugar monitoring; taking medications as prescribed; getting eye, foot,
      kidney and cholesterol exams; and activity), 3) the use of health care services. This project
      is a translational study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention in the context
      of a major insurer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-report questionnaires and hbA1c capillary blood collection kits will be administered at
      baseline (prior to the intervention), six-months and twelve-months. Differences between
      baseline and followup scores will be used to determine if participants have benefited from
      the intervention, using intent-to-treat methodology. Subgroups and delivery method
      (small-group or on-line) will be compared using repeated measures and analyses of covariance.
