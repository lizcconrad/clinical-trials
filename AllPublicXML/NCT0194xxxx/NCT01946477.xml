      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of pomalidomide (POM) and
      low-dose dexamethasone (LD-Dex) (Cohort A) or the combination of pomalidomide (POM) ,
      daratumumab (DARA) and low-dose dexamethasone (LD-Dex) (Cohort B) in subjects with relapsed
      or refractory multiple myeloma who have received a first or second line treatment of
      lenalidomide-based therapy.

      This trial will test the hypothesis for Cohort A that the proportion of patients will have an
      Overall Response Rate (ORR) of &gt; 30 % to reveal that Pomalidomide is efficacious in
      pretreated patients who are refractory to lenalidomide.

      This trial will test the hypothesis for Cohort B that the proportion of patients will have an
      Overall Response Rate (ORR) of &gt; 70 % to reveal that POM+DARA+LD-Dex is efficacious in
      pretreated patients who are refractory to lenalidomide.
