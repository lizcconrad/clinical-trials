    <textblock>
      The Essure System is indicated for women who desire non-incisional permanent birth control
      (female sterilization) by occlusion of the fallopian tubes. The objective of the study is to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Essure System (Model ESS505) for permanent birth
      control in preventing pregnancy. The Essure ESS505 System includes a design modification that
      will be studied to determine if it provides immediate birth control, thereby removing the
      three months waiting period required for the commercially available Essure System Model 305
      to be effective.
