    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD), which means that it is important to find out risk factors of CVD in
      order to prevent or treat it. In recent years, there has been more and more recognition of a
      very high prevalence of CV calcification in the ESRD population. Many observational cohort
      studies have shown that CV calcification in these patients can predict mortality, CV
      mortality and morbidity. Electrolyte imbalance is easily found in the ESRD patients which may
      result in vessel calcification. Calcification leads to arterial stenosis and increasing
      arterial stiffness and then heart afterload, both contribute to the development of CVD.
      Besides, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia pave the way for a chronic,
      immune-mediated vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease. These factors are prevalent
      in ESRD patients, which would also cause arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness and stenosis
      would increase the risk of CV events and mortality. Aortic pulse wave velocity is strongly
      associated with the presence and extent of atherosclerosis and constitutes a forceful marker
      and predictor of cardiovascular risk. At the same time, high prevalence of peripheral artery
      occlusion disease (PAOD) should also be found while arterial stiffness and stenosis, which
      would increase the condition of infection and gangrene. Thus, life safety and quality would
      be influenced severely and early detection might prevent future amputation. As compared with
      HD or pre-dialysis patients, uremic patients treated with PD have a higher risk for metabolic
      syndrome. Therefore, more studies to evaluate the condition of arterial stiffness and PAOD,
      especially in PD patients, are needed for future management and preventions of CV related
      morbidity and mortality.
