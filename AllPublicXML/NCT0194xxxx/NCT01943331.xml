      The objectives are as followings:

        1. Obtain incidence of three major nosocomial infection in ICU, catheter related blood
           stream infection(CRBSI), catheter related urinary tract infection (CRUTI), and
           ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP).

        2. Determine the epidemic of etiology and condition of management of three major nosocomial
           infection in ICU in China.
