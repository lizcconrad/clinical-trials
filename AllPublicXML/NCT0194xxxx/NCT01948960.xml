      A study to determine whether everolimus pharmacokinetics in elderly and obese patients is
      different compared to control patients.

      Furthermore the investigators will investigate the relation between metabolic response
      assessed with [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and everolimus
      exposure and clinical benefit.

      The investigators will explore whether dose escalation in patients who are hypothetically
      underexposed will result in an increase in metabolic response.
