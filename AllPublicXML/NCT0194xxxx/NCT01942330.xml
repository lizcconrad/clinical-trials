  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to prospectively evaluate a laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal approach for
      colonic resection in adult women that eliminates the need for an abdominal incision to remove
      surgical specimens. It is hypothesized that this LANOS technique will improve patient
      outcomes such as postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) rates, thereby improving patient
      satisfaction and also reducing hospital length-of-stay and cost.

    <description>1. Pain score assessments: The investigator's staff will provide a rating scale to the patients to self-rate and record their pain at baseline (prior to surgery), at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours following the procedure end time (or discharge if earlier), and at 14 ± 7 days, 30 ± 7 days, 60 ± 14 days, and 12 months ± 14 days postoperatively using a 10 point visual analogue and pain faces scale where 0 is for no pain and 10 is for the worst pain imaginable. . These data will be recorded using the Pain Assessment Form. In addition, the amount of narcotic pain medication administered through postoperative day 7 (or discharge if earlier) will be recorded and analyzed as morphine equivalents.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females ≥ 18 years of age

          2. Diagnosed with one of the following benign or malignant conditions for which they
             require colonic resection with a specimen that may be removed transvaginally if
             randomized to that group:

               -  Adenomatous polyposis

               -  Chronic GI bleeding

               -  Chronic obstruction

               -  Colon cancer

               -  Colonic inertia

               -  Diverticular disease

               -  Rectal cancer

               -  Colorectal Polyps

               -  Rectal prolapse

               -  Slow transit constipation / colonic inertia

          3. Require one of the following elective operations that may be safely performed by
             current laparoscopic-assisted techniques:

               -  Right hemicolectomy

               -  Left hemicolectomy

               -  Subtotal colectomy

               -  Total abdominal colectomy

               -  Sigmoid colectomy

               -  Rectosigmoid resection

               -  Low anterior resection

          4. Willingness and ability to comply with the requirements of the study protocol
             including follow-up

          5. Willingness and ability to sign the study specific informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current pregnancy or considering becoming pregnant during the follow-up period or
             within 6 months of surgery

          2. Any anatomical consideration that in the Investigator's opinion would make the
             traditional laparoscopic or transvaginal approach to resection excessively risky or
             impossible. Patients with bulky tumors that would require open operations are not
             candidates for this study.

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35

          4. Vaginal stenosis

          5. Prior reconstructive surgery of the vagina not including hysterectomy

          6. ASA classes 4 and 5

          7. Advanced renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2)

          8. Any history of pelvic radiation

          9. Anticipated need for an ostomy at the time of operation

         10. Patients requiring urgent or emergent surgery

         11. Patients with prior or suspected diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease such as
             Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis.
