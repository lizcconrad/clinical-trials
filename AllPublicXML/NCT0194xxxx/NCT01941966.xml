  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anal canal is an uncommon neoplasia which
      corresponds to 1-5% of intestinal tumors. However the risk of SCC of the anal canal has been
      growing recently. The standard treatment of anal cancer stage II-III is multimodal and
      consists of combined chemotherapy (infusional 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin) and radiotherapy.
      This scheme currently used was proposed in 1974, and since then no other effective treatment
      has been developed.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of
      capecitabine and mitomycin with radiotherapy in patients with carcinoma of the anal canal.
      For this will be selected 51 patients to be treated with chemo-radiotherapy.

      The primary endpoint will be local control rate after 6 months of the end of radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy, defined by the rate of radiological and clinical neoplasia.
