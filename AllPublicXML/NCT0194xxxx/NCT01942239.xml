    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia is frequent in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates and compromises their
      neurological outcome. The aim of this study was to compare real-time continuous glucose
      monitoring system (RT-CGMS) to standard method by intermittent capillary blood glucose
      testing in detecting and managing hypoglycemia. The investigators calculated a number of 48
      neonates to be randomized between 2 ways of glucose level monitoring for their 3 first days
      of life : either by RT-CGMS (CGM-group), or by intermittent capillary glucose testing
      (IGM-group) associated with a blind-CGMS to detect retrospectively missed hypoglycemia. The
      investigators' hypothesis is that in the CGM group number and duration of hypoglycemia will
      be lower.
