  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastic tumors are childhood neoplasms that possess amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)
      activity and Meta-iodobenzylguanidine(MIBG), they can theoretically be imaged by
      (18)F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) and
      (123)I-Meta-iodobenzylguanidine((123)I-MIBG) PET, they are new and specific diagnostic and
      follow-up tools for neuroendocrine tumors. In this study, we explored the accuracy and
      clinical role of (18)F-FDOPA and (123)I-MIBG PET in neuroblastic tumors.

      METHODS:

      Patients with tissue-proven neuroblastic tumors receiving (18)F-FDOPA PET or (123)I-MIBG at
      initial diagnosis or during follow-ups were enrolled. The sensitivity and specificity of
      (18)F-FDOPA or (123)I-MIBG PET were compared to each other and compared to(18)F-FDG PET,
      using tumor histology as the standard.
