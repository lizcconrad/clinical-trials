    <textblock>
      Primary end point of the study is the clinical and non-invasive instrumental evaluation of
      the activity of P-3075 cream on subjects with acne: 20 subjects with a mild/moderate grade
      and 20 subjects with a moderately severe/severe grade, according to Cunliffe' classification.

      Secondary end-points are the cosmetic acceptability and efficacy evaluation by the volunteers
      and the local tolerability assessed by the investigator and the subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open controlled clinical trial. The product will be applied for a period of 4
      weeks and 3 visits will be performed: a baseline visit (T0), an intermediate visit after 2
      weeks (T2) and a final visit after 4 week-treatment (T4).

      The subjects will be enrolled and divided in 2 groups according to their acne grade (20
      subjects with mild/moderate grade and 20 subjects with moderately severe/severe), a
      concomitant therapy is allowed only for volunteers with acne moderately severe/severe.

      Each volunteer, fulfilling the inclusion criteria, will perform a cosmetic treatment with the
      study product on all the face, for 4 weeks.

      A fixed quantity of the medical device will be applied on the face twice a day, in the
      morning and in the evening (always at the same hour), with a mild massage according to the
      instructions received by the investigator during the baseline visit (T0). Group 2 will
      continue also the standardised treatment with topical or systemic retinoids, benzoyl
      peroxide, clindamycin or AHA until the end of the study.
