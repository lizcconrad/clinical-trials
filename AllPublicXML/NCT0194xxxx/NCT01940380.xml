  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal Osteoporosis is characterized by a decrease in bone mass as well as a
      deterioration of the bone architecture resulting in an increased risk of fracture,which is
      directly related to the lack of estrogen and also associated with a variety of genetic and
      acquired factors. Previous studies have found that POP molecular regulation mechanism of
      kidney Yang deficiency syndrome may be associated with LTBP1 gene expression.

      This topic using RT-PCR and Western Blot detection POP of kidney Yang deficiency group and
      healthy group LTBP1 mRNA and proteion's expression level,validate LTBP1 relevance to POP the
      kidney Yang deficiency syndrome.To provide a scientific basis for clinical treatment.
