  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pre-randomized study in primary health care was designed to investigate health education in
      a subpopulation extracted from general practitioners (GPs) in one Danish county in the
      treatment arm of the ADDITION (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with
      Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care) study, DK. The overall objective of the 'Ready to
      Act' health education programme was to support the participants' competences in daily life
      and act appropriately with respect to their dysglycaemic condition. The achievement of action
      competence involved four learning objectives: intrinsic motivation, informed decision-making,
      action experience and social involvement. The programme was delivered in primary care
      settings (health centre or GP surgeries) by nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists and GPs.
