      To gather preliminary safety and outcome data for the multimodality treatment of lung

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) continues to represent a
      poorly understood clinical entity. A frequent clinical dilemma in lung cancer care is the
      management of a documented or suspected invasive adenocarcinoma in the setting of multifocal
      ground glass opacity (GGO) consistent with multifocal AIS. These patients are typically
      classified as stage IV disease, and treated with palliative chemotherapy. No existing
      pathologic or molecular test is currently capable of making the distinction between
      independent primary versus metastatic tumors, a distinction for which substantial treatment
      impact exists. Many treating physicians suspect that outcomes for this specific patient
      subgroup are better than norms for stage IV disease, as such patients are frequently
      node-negative and without distant metastases despite multiple lesions present. To address
      this issue, we will evaluate a multimodality treatment protocol using aggressive local and
      targeted systemic therapy for multifocal lung adenocarcinoma, incorporating information from
      tumor genome sequencing for individualized treatment planning. The results will have
      significant impact in advancing the biologic understanding and treatment approach for lung
      adenocarcinoma in the setting of multifocal AIS.
