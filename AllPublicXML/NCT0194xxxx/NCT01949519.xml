  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is the standard, first-line chemotherapeutic agent for castrate resistant prostate
      cancer. While it has clinically useful activity, there is a strong need for substantial
      improvement in its efficacy. Possible ways for improving docetaxel monotherapy would be to
      combine it with an agent that either minimized toxicity (thus allowing higher doses) or
      improves efficacy (by targeting synergistic pathways). Lycopene is an attractive agent for
      combination with docetaxel because of its known accumulation in prostate tissue, its low
      toxicity, and its ability to inhibit signaling through the IGF-1 axis, and to reduce IL6
      levels. Lycopene is highly synergistic with docetaxel at inhibiting the growth of prostate
      cancer in mice. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      lycopene given in combination with docetaxel. This dose can then be used for subsequent phase
      II or phase III studies.

      New findings from the ECOG E3805 study presented at ASCO 2014, showed that concurrent
      chemotherapy with first-line ADT for newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer markedly
      improved overall survival compared with delayed or no chemotherapy. These subjects could also
      benefit from intervention to increase docetaxel effectiveness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate and 2
             increasing pre-study PSA values, the last of which must be ≥1 ng/ml, at least 1 week
             apart.

          -  Patients must have current or prior evidence of metastatic prostate cancer. Patients
             with radiographic evidence of disease progression but without PSA progression may also
             be eligible.

          -  Subjects may have received prior chemotherapy except for a combination of docetaxel
             and lycopene. Prior chemotherapy must have been completed at least 1 year prior to
             start of treatment under this protocol. Prior biologic therapy, or any investigational
             drug must have been completed at least 28 days prior to start of therapy, and the
             patient must have recovered from toxicities of prior therapy to grade 1 or less.

          -  Patients may or may not be surgically or medically castrated. If surgically or
             medically castrated, it would be documented by a testosterone level less than 50ng/mL.
             If the patient is being treated with medical castration, he must be willing to
             continue this treatment for the duration of the study. ADT should not be initiated,
             terminated, or dose-adjusted during the study.

          -  Prior external beam radiation therapy (to less than 30% of the bone marrow only) is
             allowed. At least 28 days must have elapsed since the completion of radiation therapy
             and the patient must have recovered from side effects. Prior treatment with
             samarium-153, radium-223, or strontium-86 is allowed if at least eight weeks have
             elapsed since dosing, and all toxicities have resolved to grade 1. Soft tissue disease
             which has been radiated in the prior 2 months is not assessable as measurable disease.

          -  Patients may have received prior surgery. However, at least 21 days must have elapsed
             since completion of surgery and the patient must have recovered from all side effects.

          -  Patient must have adequate hepatic function as defined by 1) a serum bilirubin ≤the
             institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), and 2) SGOT or SGPT ≤2.5 x the
             institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 14 days prior to start of therapy.
             Liver function tests should be evaluated prior to each treatment.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤1.5 x the
             institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 14 days prior to start of therapy.

          -  Men of child bearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Patient must have an ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Patients must meet the following hematological criteria (minimal values):

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL

          -  Hemoglobin of &gt; 8.0gm/dL,

          -  White blood cell count &gt;2,500/mcL,

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Patients with lower values may participate if, in the opinion
             of the investigator, the cytopenias are the result of bone marrow involvement with
             active prostate cancer.

          -  Patients must be able to take oral medications.

          -  All patients must be informed and must sign and give written informed consent in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Patients who are unable to
             comply with study and/or follow-up procedures are ineligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled brain or spinal cord metastases

          -  History of congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within the previous six
             months.

          -  Evidence or history of a bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, including therapy-induced
             coagulopathy.

          -  Presence of chronic diarrhea (&gt; grade 1 by CTC criteria), short bowel
             syndrome,pancreatic insufficiency, or malabsorption.

          -  Presence of any severe or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would increase the risk of serious toxicity from the
             study drugs.

          -  Concurrent use of any vitamin, herb, or mineral supplements containing lycopene for at
             least 14 days prior to start of therapy

          -  Evidence of Grade 2 neuropathy at time of screening.
