  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aerobic fitness is important for mountain bikers, but riders should also be able to
      generate maximal and supramaximal efforts in some crucial phases of the competition. Although
      there is an increase interest in high-intensity aerobic training, to investigators knowledge,
      there are no studies examining the effects of interval (INTV) or intermittent training (INTM)
      in mountain bikers. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of INTV and INTM on
      aerobic fitness variables (peak power output, Wmax, lactate threshold, and onset of blood
      lactate accumulation) but more importantly on performance as measured using a controlled
      mountain bike race, i.e. simulation. The investigators hypothesized that INTV and INTM
      training were equally effective in improving Wmax, Lactate threshold and onset of blood
      lactate accumulation, but INTV was superior in enhancing performance in mountai bike race
      simulation.This hypothesis is due to studies that have shown higher gains in performance with
      long duration of aerobic high intensity interval training in comparison to the shorter
      training at a higher intensity.

    <description>The aim of this study was to compare the effects of interval (INTV) and intermittent training (INTM) on aerobic fitness variables (peak power output, Wmax, lactate threshold, and onset of blood lactate accumulation) and performance as measured using a controlled MTB race, i.e. simulation. Pre to post differences were examined using two-way ANOVA, with a factor time on two levels (pre, post), and a factor group on two levels (INTV and INTM). Differences between groups post-training were also analyzed with ANCOVA using the pre-training values as covariate. These differences were calculated after log transforming the dependent variables. The difference between groups in the primary outcome (performance) was also analyzed using a magnitude-based inferences approach. The smallest worthwhile difference for the performance was considered to be 1%.</description>
