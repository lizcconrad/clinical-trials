  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (allergic inflammation of the nose) is a common medical condition which is
      known to seriously decrease quality of life, aggravate preexisting conditions particularly
      asthma, carry significant medical treatment costs and be responsible for reduced work
      productivity and lost school days. A significant symptom of the condition, nasal blockage,
      remains difficult to treat even when using nasal corticosteroids. Decongestant medications
      act on the blood vessels in the nose and have an immediate effect in clearing a blocked nose
      but if used for more than seven days a more severe rebound congestion of the nose develops.

      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the effects of doxazosin, a drug which is
      currently used to treat high blood pressure and symptoms of prostate enlargement, to find out
      if it has an effect on nasal blockage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female 18-70 years

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

          -  Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis

          -  Peak nasal inspiratory flow which is reversible to &gt;20 l/min with oxymetazoline

          -  Positive skin prick test to at least one common aeroallergen

          -  Ability to withhold antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids for duration of the
             study

          -  Agreement for their GP to be made aware of study participation and to receive feedback
             as relevant to the participant's well being

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, planned pregnancy or lactation

          -  Respiratory tract infection in the previous 2 months

          -  Nasal polyps of more than Grade I on nasal endoscopy

             significant hypotension in combination with alpha antagonists.

             alpha-blockers given in combination with these.

          -  Methyldopa and levodopa - potential enhanced hypotensive effect with alpha
             antagonists.

          -  Nasal corticosteroid spray - would confound study outcomes

          -  Oxymetazoline - this is used as an outcome of response in the study.

          -  Antihistamines - the participants will be undergoing a histamine nasal challenge.

          -  Sympathomimetics i.e. dopamine, ephedrine, epinephrine, metaraminol, methoxamine,
             phenylephrine- may reduce the effect of doxazosin.

          -  Any other medication, which in the opinion of the Investigator may put the participant
             at risk.
