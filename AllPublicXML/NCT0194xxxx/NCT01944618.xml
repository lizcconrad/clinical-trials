      Observational Model: Other: A post-marketing evaluation of the safety of Forxiga through an
      observational prescription adverse event monitoring program (registry-based monitoring
      program) is warranted to assess real-world incidence of adverse events in routine clinical
      practice

    <description>FORXIGA is a prescription medicine used with diet, exercise and sometimes other medicines (which may include metformin; insulin; a sulfonylurea medicine such as gliclazide, glimepiride and glibenclamide; or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor [DPP 4 inhibitor] such as sitagliptin or saxagliptin) to control the levels of blood sugar (glucose) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</description>
