  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 clinical trial is a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter
      investigation of rBV A/B in male and female healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or pre-exposure prophylactic medical
      countermeasures available to provide protection against botulism. The rBV A/B is under
      development to provide protection of adults 18 to 55 years of age from fatal botulism caused
      by inhalational intoxication with botulinum neurotoxin complex (BoNT) serotype A, subtype A1
      (BoNT/A1) and botulinum neurotoxin complex serotype B, subtype B1 (BoNT/B1). Volunteers will
      not be exposed to botulism. Protective antibody titers will be measured in serum after
      vaccination.

    <measure>The primary safety objective is to demonstrate the safety of rBV A/B through Day 365.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after first dose [Dose 1] / 6 months after the last dose [Dose 3]</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoints are the incidence, severity and relationship to treatment of solicited local, systemic and neuromuscular adverse events (AEs) with onset on the day of and for 7 days after each administration of study product; treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) with onset within 28 days after each administration of study product; and medically-attended AEs (MAEs), neuromuscular AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) from the time of first dose (Day 0) through 6 months after the last dose (Day 365).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary immunogenicity objectives are to demonstrate lot consistency for three lots of rBV A/B and to infer clinical benefit of rBV A/B.</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 210, approximately 28 days after the last dose [Dose 3]</time_frame>
    <description>The criterion to demonstrate lot consistency will be based on the geometric mean ratios of neutrailzing antibodies concentrations (NAC) to vaccine antigens BoNT/A1 and BoNT/B1.
The criterion to demonstrate clinical benefit is the proportion of volunteers with NAC values at or above the putative protective levels for anti-BoNT/A1 and anti-BoNT/B1 simultaneously.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary safety objective is to demonstrate the safety of rBV A/B from Day 365 through Day 547.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after last dose [Dose 3] in a subset of volunteers</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary safety endpoints are the incidence, severity and relationship to treatment of MAEs, neuromuscular AEs and SAEs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary immunogenicity endpoints is duration of protection through Day 547.</measure>
    <time_frame>Evalution through Study Days 365 and 547 (6 months and 1 year after last dose [Dose 3])</time_frame>
    <description>The criterion to demonstrate duration of protection is the proportion of volunteers with NAC values at or above the putative protective levels for anti-BoNT/A1 and anti-BoNT/B1 simultaneously.</description>
