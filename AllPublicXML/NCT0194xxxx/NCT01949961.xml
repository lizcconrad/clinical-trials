  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic drugs may dissolve blood vessel clots in acute ischemic stroke. The
      overall benefit of intravenous thrombolysis is substantial, but up to 2/3 of patients with
      large clots may not achieve re-opening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients may remain
      severely disabled or die. Ultrasound accelerates clot break-up (lysis) when combined with
      thrombolysis (sonothrombolysis) and increases the likelihood of functional independence at 3
      months. Adding intravenous ultrasound contrast (gaseous microspheres) further enhances the
      thrombolytic effect (contrast enhanced sonothrombolysis = CEST). Contrast enhanced ultrasound
      may also accelerate clot break-up in the absence of thrombolytic drugs (contrast enhanced
      sonolysis = CES).

      HYPOTHESIS: Contrast enhanced ultrasound treatment administered within 4 1/2 hours after
      symptom onset may be given safely to patients with acute ischemic stroke, both to those
      receiving intravenous thrombolysis and those not receiving intravenous thrombolysis, and will
      improve clinical outcome.

      AIMS: To compare efficacy and safety of contrast enhanced ultrasound treatment vs. no
      ultrasound treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving or not receiving
      intravenous thrombolysis.

      STUDY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoints are 1) neurological improvement at 24 hours (proof of
      concept) and 2) excellent clinical outcome at 3 months (effect). Secondary endpoints are
      bleeding complications (safety), brain damage (infarct size/location) and early clinical
      improvement (effect).

      NOR-SASS aims at testing contrast enhanced sonothrombolysis in all patients with acute
      ischemic stroke. Patients eligible for thrombolysis (randomized tenecteplase or alteplase)
      are included in the NOR-SASS A sub-study, patients receiving standard (non-trial)
      thrombolysis with alteplase are included in the NOR-SASS B sub-study, and patients not
      eligible for thrombolysis are included in the NOR-SASS C sub-study.

      DESIGN: NOR-SASS is a PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint) trial,
      designed to establish the superiority of contrast-enhanced ultrasound treatment given within
      4½ hours after stroke onset in consecutively admitted patients with acute ischaemic stroke,
      as compared with 1) standard iv thrombolysis with tenecteplase (TNK) or alteplase (tPA) in
      patients eligible for thrombolytic treatment, and 2) no specific treatment in patients not
      eligible for thrombolytic treatment.

      HYPOTHESIS: 1.) In patients eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, contrast enhanced
      sonothrombolysis (CEST) has superior effect as compared with standard intravenous
      thrombolysis and may be given safely. 2.) In patients not eligible for thrombolysis, contrast
      enhanced sonolysis (CES) has superior effect as compared with no specific treatment and may
      be given safely.

      RANDOMISATION: In NOR-SASS-A (two step randomisation), 1st randomisation is 1:1 to either
      tenecteplase (TNK) or alteplase (tPA); 2nd randomisation is 1:1 to either CEST or no CEST. In
      NOR-SASS-B, randomisation is 1:1 to either CEST or no CEST. In NOR-SASS-C, randomisation is
      1:1 to either CES or no CES.
