  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is now overwhelming evidence documenting the efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment
      of depression in the general population. Surprisingly, however, given the high prevalence of
      depression in cancer patients, there are very few studies on the efficacy of psychotherapy in
      this population. Published studies of psychotherapy in cancer patients generally include
      patients with high heterogeneity of psychiatric diagnosis and frequently include patients
      without a psychiatric diagnosis, with the aim of preventing the appearance of a psychiatric
      disorder. This heterogeneity complicates the interpretation of the efficacy and specificity
      of these interventions. Specifically, the efficacy of psychotherapy for major depression in
      patients with cancer is unknown.

      Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a brief, manualized therapy that has shown efficacy in
      the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in several controlled trials. This study
      will test the efficacy of IPT in a group of prostate, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer
      patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.

      We will test the efficacy of IPT using a variety of outcome measures at different time points
      of the treatment. Those scales will evaluate the patient's depressive symptoms, psychosocial
      functioning and quality of life. Patients that are deemed eligible for the study will have
      IPT for twelve weeks. Patients will receive twelve 50-minute sessions over 16 weeks. To
      facilitate access to treatment, sessions 1,2,3,4, 8 and 12 will be in person, while all
      others will in be person or over the telephone according to the patient's choice. Sessions
      will be audiotaped and periodically reviewed by experienced supervisors to assess therapist's
      adherence to IPT technique. This taping will be optional and is covered in a separate consent
      form. This pilot study is to prove feasibility and acceptability of IPT in this population
      and to show preliminary efficacy.
