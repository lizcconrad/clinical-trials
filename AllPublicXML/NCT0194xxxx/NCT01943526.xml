  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the long-term safety and impact on disease
      activity and progression of natalizumab (Tysabri) in participants with relapsing remitting
      multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in a clinical practice setting.

    <textblock>
      iTOP is a retrospective and prospective Irish observational study of participants receiving
      natalizumab, with each participant to be followed for 3 years. This study is designed to
      address the long-term safety profile and the long-term impact on disease activity and
      progression of natalizumab with marketed use. Collection of efficacy and safety data at 6-
      monthly intervals to coincide with regular clinic visits and routine clinical practice will
      therefore be undertaken during the iTOP observational period.

    <measure>Disability progression as determined by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disability progression is defined as at least a 1.0 point increase on the EDSS from Baseline that is sustained over 6 months. The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MS disease activity as determined by annualized relapse rate (ARR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical relapse is defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms, not associated with fever, lasting for at least 24 hours, and followed by a period of 30 days of stability or improvement. New or recurrent neurological symptoms that occur less than 30 days following the onset of a protocol-defined relapse should be considered part of the same relapse.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Prognostic factors for disability progression and MS disease activity will be assessed in different participant cohorts stratified according to their baseline characteristics: Participant demographics including age, gender; Disease History, including diagnosis and duration at baseline; Baseline EDSS; Number of relapses within 1 and 2 years before baseline; MRI parameters at baseline; Prior use of disease modifying therapy, anti-neoplastic, immunosuppressant or immunomodulator therapy</description>
