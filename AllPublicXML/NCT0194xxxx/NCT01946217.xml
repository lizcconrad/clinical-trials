      This pilot research trial studies factors affecting patient participation in Acquired Immune
      Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Malignancy Clinical Trials Consortium clinical trials. Determining
      how patients makes decisions about participating in a clinical trial may help doctors plan
      clinical trials in which more patients are willing to participate and are satisfied with
      their decision to participate.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify participant-level factors affecting recruitment of potentially eligible
      participants in AIDS Malignancy Clinical Trials Consortium (AMC) studies at core and
      affiliated sites.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the socio-demographic characteristics for participation and non-participation
      in AMC clinical trials among all approached volunteers across AMC sites.

      II. To characterize socio-demographic characteristics with motivation and decision making
      among those who consented to participate in an AMC trial.

      III. To identify the perceived barriers associated with clinical trial participation among
      those who did not consent to participate in an AMC clinical trial.

      IV. To better understand how potential study volunteers learn about AMC clinical trials and
      by what means are they referred to a particular study.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete the Improving Participation in AMC Clinical Trials (IMPACTS) survey
      comprising questions about socio-demographic information and clinical trial participation.

    <description>For each study participant who did not enroll in a trial, the number of barriers in each category (views and attitudes, views of other people around them, financial burden and travel) will be computed. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], median and interquartile range) will be used to estimate number of barriers in each category. Analyses of variance will be used to assess the associations of sociodemographic characteristics, sexual orientation, disease-type and design-type with the number of barriers in each category.</description>
