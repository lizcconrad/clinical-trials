      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Evaluate the clinical performance of a newly available highly-sensitive rapid influenza
           test, Xpert Flu.

        2. Derive and validate an adult clinical decision guideline to guide clinical testing of
           influenza patients who meed CDC criteria for antiviral treatment.

        3. Evaluate impact of rapid influenza testing for antiviral treatment.

        4. Determine cost effectiveness of influenza testing and treatment strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four strategically selected medical centers across the US (representing the West Coast,
      Southwest, Midwest; and East Coast) will enroll adult subjects presenting to the ED with an
      acute respiratory illness who fulfill CDC recommended criteria for receiving antiviral
      therapy. At each of the 4 sites, dedicated research coordinators will approach all adult (age
      &gt; 18 years old) ED patients with broadly defined respiratory related complaints and screen
      for those who meet CDC recommended criteria for antiviral therapy (i.e. those at 'high-risk
      for complications' or those with 'potential influenza-related complications).

      Consenting subjects will have a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab collected for both Xpert Flu testing
      and gold standard reverse transcription-PCR (rt-PCR) testing under a research protocol. The
      investigators will compare the test results from the rapid flu testing to that of the gold
      standard rt-PCR testing in order to assess the clinical performance characteristics of the
      new rapid test (Objective 1). The investigators will also collect demographics and medical
      historical information using a brief structured data form, which will be used in combination
      with rt-PCR test results to derive and validate a clinical decision guideline (Objective 2).

      The investigators will simultaneously randomize 2 of the 4 hospitals to the Rapid Testing
      Group (which will have systematic rapid flu testing performed with results provided to the
      clinicians), or the Control Group (which will follow standard of care practice with testing
      left to the discretion of individual clinicians). This will permit comparison of rates of ED
      antiviral administration or prescription between the two groups to assess the clinical impact
      of influenza testing (Objective 3). Finally, cost data from the ED visits and subsequent
      hospitalization will be collected from subjects in both the rapid testing group and the
      control group to inform a cost-utility analysis of rapid influenza testing compared to
      current standard of care (Objective 4).

    <measure>Clinical Utility of Xpert Flu</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical utility is defined here as the proportion of high-risk subjects with confirmed influenza receiving antiviral or antiviral prescriptions in the ED in the Rapid Testing Group compared to the Control Group.</description>
