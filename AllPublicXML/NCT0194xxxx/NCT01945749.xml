  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a very common chronic joint disorder associated pain and
      disability. As no cure exists, management aims to reduce pain, improve function, and enhance
      quality of life. The recommended hierarchy of management should consist of exercise in first
      line, then the add-on of drugs if necessary, and ultimately, if necessary, surgery.

      The effect size of exercise therapy is of the same magnitude as most pharmacological
      treatments but is often without adverse effects. Local pharmacological treatment of the
      afflicted knee joint is recommended by means of intra-articular injections of
      corticosteroids, which is considered as a standard medical treatment of knee OA and are
      included in established guidelines for management of knee OA. While the two treatment
      approaches have been investigated separately in numerous clinical trials, the efficacy of a
      combined pharmacological and non-pharmacological approach is not known, despite the high rank
      of such combined treatment approach on the recommended hierarchy of management.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of exercise therapy in combination with
      intra-articular corticosteroid injections on patient reported pain and function in patients
      with knee OA.

      The hypothesis is that the combined treatment approach (exercise therapy preceded by
      intra-articular injection of corticosteroid) enhances the clinical outcome compared to
      exercise therapy preceded by a placebo injection.

    <description>Knee OA pain is associated with movement of the afflicted knee. Therefore we assess pain intensity and movement tolerance during repeated squatting. The test has 3 outcomes: 1) The number of pain free squatting movements that can be done in 30 seconds; 2) the number of painful squatting movements that can be done in 30 seconds; and 3) the average pain intensity during the squatting movements assessed on a 0-10 numeric rating scale.</description>
