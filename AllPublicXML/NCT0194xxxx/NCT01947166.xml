  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Whipple procedure is associated with increased readmission rates for infection,
      pancreatic leak, and failure to thrive/malnutrition. The purpose of this study is to develop
      an evidence based perioperative nutrition plan to improve patient outcomes. The study has two
      specific aims including evaluation of feasibility of implementing an evidence based
      perioperative nutritional plan for patients undergoing Whipple and evaluation of impact of a
      standard perioperative nutritional plan on primary outcome of readmission rate and secondary
      outcomes of readmission cause, length of stay for initial hospitalization and/or readmission,
      post surgical complications (surgical site infections, pancreatic leak, sepsis, delayed
      gastric emptying), and nutritional status (PG-Subject Generated Assessment scores, BMI,
      albumin, pre-albumin, and method of oral intake). Categorical variables including readmission
      rate, readmission cause, post-surgical complications and nutritional status will be compared
      by chi-square test between intervention and control group. Length of stay for initial
      hospitalization and readmission will be compared by non parametric Wilcoxon test between two
      groups. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample. There are no risks to the
      study participants.
