    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies anal human papillomavirus (HPV) tests in screening for cell
      changes in the anus in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening tests may
      help doctors find cancer cells early and plan better treatment for anal cancer. Completing
      multiple screening tests may help find the best method for detecting cell changes in the
      anus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of HPV testing using different methods of
      detection, including HPV Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), HPV messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) assays
      (APTIMA) and OncoHealth HPV E6/E7 oncoprotein assay and whether they improve the screening
      performance of routine anal cytology for the detection of anal high-grade squamous
      intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) when measured against the gold standard, biopsy-proven HSIL.

      II. To determine the prevalence and risk factors for prevalent HSIL in HIV-infected women.

      III. To determine incidence and risk factors associated with anal HSIL and HPV over 2 years
      among HIV infected women undergoing semi-annual anal evaluations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the acceptability of anal cancer screening among HIV-infected women.

      II. To collect data on quality of life and health care costs (including non-direct health
      care costs and time costs) for an economic evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of anal
      cancer screening strategies in HIV-positive women.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo screening for the detection of HSIL using anal cytology, HPV hybrid capture
      2, HPV mRNA assays, and OncoHealth HPVE6/E7 oncoprotein at baseline, at 12 and 24 months.

    <description>The binomial proportion and its 95% confidence interval will be used. Among patients who are high resolution anoscopy (HRA) positive for HSIL, McNemar's test will be used to compare routine anal cytology with each of the other methods of detection to determine if sensitivity in the diagnosis of HSIL is improved with the other methods. Positive and negative predictive values will be estimated for each method of detection.</description>

    <measure>Prevalence of HSIL</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The prevalence of HSIL will be estimated as the proportion of women who are HRA positive for HSIL at entry and its 95% confidence interval. Logistic regression analysis will be used to evaluate the association of potential risk factors with diagnosis of HSIL.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Poisson rate and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated from the number of HSIL cases detected divided by the cumulative years of follow-up across these cases. Behavioral risk factors will be assessed by research staff administered surveys at each study visit. Logistic regression will be used to evaluate potential risk factors for incidence of HSIL.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of anal cancer screening among HIV-infected women based on survey responses regarding patient satisfaction and phone call surveys</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize subjects' acceptability of undergoing anal screening with cytology/HPV and HRA throughout the study to evaluate changes in perceptions. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used to assess acceptability over time adjusting for intrapatient variability. Acceptability will be correlated with clinical and behavioral risk factors, e.g., history of sexual assault, depression, anxiety, medication compliance, sexual behaviors using GEE methods.</description>
