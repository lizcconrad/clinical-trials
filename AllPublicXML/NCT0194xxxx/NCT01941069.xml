      The overall purpose of this project is to determine whether school personnel implementing a
      two-tier School-wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS, an evidence based intervention)
      program for typically developing children as well as children with, or at risk for,
      externalizing or anxiety disorders can implement the components of the program with the same
      level of fidelity, integrity and clinical effectiveness when they receive a low level of
      support (consultation) from their coaches and supervisors as they can with a high level of
      support (consultation and coaching).

      Demonstrating that school personnel can implement evidence based interventions (EBIs) for
      externalizing and anxiety problems with a high degree of fidelity, integrity and clinical
      effectiveness could spur more initiatives toward the adoption of EBIs in urban schools, thus
      further lowering health disparities in these settings. The overall purpose of this project is
      to determine whether school personnel implementing a two-tier School-wide Positive Behavior
      Support (SWPBS, an evidence based intervention) program for typically developing children as
      well as children with, or at risk for, externalizing or anxiety disorders can implement the
      components of the program with the same level of fidelity, integrity and clinical
      effectiveness when they receive a low level of support (consultation) from their coaches and
      supervisors as they can with a high level of support (consultation and coaching). This study
      will target six schools within the Philadelphia School District (PSD). Within those 6
      schools, research participants will consist of students (grades 4-8) and school staff
      members. The investigators will evaluate 1) the effectiveness of SWPBS with consultation and
      coaching, as compared to the baseline and to SWPBS with consultation only; in reducing office
      discipline referrals (ODRs) and improving school climate, and children's grades, diagnostic
      status, symptom severity and impairment; 2) the effectiveness of the SWPBS with consultation
      and coaching, as compared to SWPBS with consultation only, in increasing program fidelity and
      integrity.

    <description>Students identified as being at-risk for or meeting criteria for Externalizing Disorders will be assigned to this intervention arm. They will receive the Coping Power Program (CPP) intervention. CPP is a cognitive-behavioral, multi-component group intervention for elementary and middle school students at risk for externalizing behavior disorders. In addition to anger management, the CPP includes units on goal setting, emotional awareness, relaxation training, social skills training, problem solving, and handling peer pressure.</description>
