  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of transvenous vagus nerve stimulation
      (tVNS) on the immune response.

      In the human endotoxemia model, intravenously administered endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide
      [LPS]) elicits a systemic immune response with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
      TNF α. This trial will determine if an anti-inflammatory effect can be produced by acute VNS
      using a minimally invasive delivery method.
