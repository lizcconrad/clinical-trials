        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject age ≥18 and ≤80 with a diagnosis of ruptured or unruptured intracranial
             aneurysm judged suitable for selective endovascular treatment by coil occlusion during
             single procedure

          -  Investigator intends to use DeltaMaxx Microcoil system during coiling procedure

          -  Investigator intends to use only Codman Neuro microcoils during coiling procedure

          -  Aneurysm size [largest measurement from the cross sectional images to determine
             overall aneurysm size, not just the lumen] ≥6 mm

          -  If ruptured aneurysm: Hunt and Hess 1, 2, or 3

          -  If unruptured aneurysm: Subject grade Modified Rankin Scale 0 - 2

          -  The subject or his/her Legally Authorized Representative must voluntarily provide
             Informed Consent for participation in this study and agree to return for all study
             visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment (surgical or endovascular) of the target aneurysm

          -  Subjects with more than one aneurysm (&gt;2 mm) that have been treated with endovascular
             or clipping techniques in the past 30 days.

          -  Subject with social, medical or psychological conditions that interfere with treatment
             and follow-up evaluation

          -  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the study

          -  Life expectancy less than 12 months.
