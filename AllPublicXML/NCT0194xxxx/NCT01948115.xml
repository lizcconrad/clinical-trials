  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The variety of breech presentation at term is about 3-4% of all births. Our study aims to
      assess the value of using an equimolar mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. Indeed, in some
      patients algic or relaxed, the success rate seems more important.

      It's a single blind prospective randomized controlled study, comparing success rate of ECV
      after an equimolar mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide or placebo (medical air).

      We need to include 150 patients (75 in each arm), for a period of 2 years. After ECV, we will
      give the patient a satisfaction questionnaire. We compare the success rate of ECV as primary
      outcome.

    <description>We need to include 150 patients for a period of 2 years. Patients will be randomized: 75 patients in each arm: 75 patients in group &quot;placebo&quot; (medical air), 75 patients in group &quot;treatment&quot; (equimolar mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide).
Patients will be single-blind. The ECV be started at least 3 minutes after the start of administration. The maximum time of administration of the gas will be 15 minutes. Just after ECV, we compare success rate of intervention.</description>
