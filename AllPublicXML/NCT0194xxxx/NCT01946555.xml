    <textblock>
      The BTP (Breakthrough pain)was defined as &quot;a transient exacerbation of pain that occurs
      either spontaneously, or in relation to a specific predictable or unpredictable trigger,
      despite relatively stable and adequately controlled background pain&quot;.

      The BTP is a common clinical features in patients with cancer pain (BTcP: breakthrough cancer
      pain). The prevalence of BTcP is equal to 56%.

      Currently, the investigators tend to recognize the idiopathic/spontaneous or accident BTcP in
      the three sub-types: voluntary, non- voluntary and procedural.

      The diagnosis of BTCP is not always easy because in the cancer patient is normal to observe
      changes in the intensity of pain during the day, so it is necessary to differentiate slight
      fluctuations from the presence of real episodes of BTCP, for which is necessary to use a
      rescue treatment adjusted. In the study will be proposed the use of a diagnostic algorithm,
      present in the literature, to perform the diagnosis of BTCP.

      In the presence of BTCP, is important both a correct controlled background pain with major
      opioids, which can reduce the number and the intensity of the painful episodes, both
      implement an adjunctive therapy, called &quot;rescue&quot;, to be administered at the time which takes
      over the painful episode using, in this case, an opioid greater.

        This study involves a longitudinal evaluation of BTCP in cancer patients with pain, through
        a follow-up of 4 weeks, which will examine in a dynamic clinical aspects (variation over
        time of the number and duration of episodes, painful intensity, changes in ATC and rescue
        therapy).
