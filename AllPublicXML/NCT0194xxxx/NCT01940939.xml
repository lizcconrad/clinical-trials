      1. Exploration of rTMS on working memory and cognitive impairment symptoms of schizophrenia
           treatment and mechanism.

        2. Analysis of rTMS high-frequency stimulation to the improvement of negative symptoms and

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Active rTMS</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Active treatment will be delivered at an intensity that is 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT). Stimulation will be delivered at 20 Hz with 100 stimulation trains of 20 stimuli each (i.e., 2000 stimuli) and an intertrain interval of 9 sec. Treatment will be applied in sequential order to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Intervention: Device: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Sham rTMS</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Sham stimulation will be delivered using the same stimulation parameters and at the site of active treatment, but the coil will be reversed. This method produces sound and some somatic sensation (e.g., contraction of scalp muscles) similar to those of active stimulation, but with minimal direct brain effects.</description>
