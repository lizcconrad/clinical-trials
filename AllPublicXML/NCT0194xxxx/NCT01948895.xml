    <textblock>
      This multi-centred study will be conducted at two centres. The design will be an open label,
      flexible-dose study. This investigation will evaluate the efficacy of Desvenlafaxine
      monotherapy for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for dysthymia.

      Primary objective: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of open-label
      desvenlafaxine monotherapy in dysthymic subjects.

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of desvenlafaxine on clinical measures
      relating to improvement of depressive symptoms, quality of life and occupational functioning.

      It is hypothesized that Dysthymic subjects will show significant improvement in depressive
      symptoms after 8 weeks of treatment with desvenlafaxine. There will be significant
      improvement in measures of quality of life and stress coping at end of treatment, compared to
      Baseline. There will also be significant improvement in measures of occupational functioning
      at end of treatment, compared to Baseline.

    <description>Patients will be initiated on 50 mg/day of Desvenlafaxine. No dose changes will be allowed for the first four weeks. If there is partial or no response after four weeks, dosage will then be increased to 100mg/day, based on tolerability and the Investigator's judgment.</description>
