    <textblock>
      A prospective long-term follow up of hemodialysis (HD) patients' outcome correlates with
      nutritional status and body composition. We will evaluate the body composition change among
      HD patients every three months with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The change of
      body composition will correlated with other clinical data including nutritional, inflammatory
      parameters and survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wasting and malnutrition are common and serious complications in patients on hemodialysis and
      are strongly associated with adverse outcomes. Techniques for assessing nutrition have
      limitations and, due to metabolic effects and confounding effects of altered hydration and
      other body composition abnormalities, these limitations are greater in the context of renal
      failure. Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a promising method for the objective assessment
      and monitoring of body composition. Body composition techniques subdivide the body into
      compartments on the basis of differing physical properties. The different compartments
      reflect hydration, nutrition/wasting, body fat, and bone mineral content, which are all of
      great importance in patients on hemodialysis. We will conduct a prospective long-term follow
      up of HD patients' outcome correlates with nutritional status and body compositions. The
      patients will receive BIA every three months, and other routine clinical data such as
      dialysis adequacy and monthly biochemical data are collected to analyze. An additional blood
      sample of 8 ml will be collected every 3 months during the BIA survey for other inflammatory
      cytokines and nutritional markers such as adiponectin, leptin, ghrelin, prealbumin, fetuin A,
      fructosamine, IL-1, IL-6 and transferrin. The follow up period will be as long as possible
      and the last recruited into this study is in the Dec. 2016. These data will be used for the
      morbidity and mortality analysis to see if body compositions will be more useful and timely
      than the other nutritional parameters.
