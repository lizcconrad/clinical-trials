      1. Summary

           Growing evidence suggests that a significant proportion of in-hospital patient deaths
           occur after serious adverse events (SAE's). Concerns have been raised that too often
           patients' acute deteriorations, particularly on surgical and medical wards outside
           critical care settings, are identified too late and corrective actions taken too slowly.
           Many initiatives have been taken to prevent unexpected death by timely recognition,
           intervention and resuscitation efforts such as Rapid Response Systems (RRS's). RRS's
           have been introduced with the intention to prevent SAE's and to improve patient outcome
           by facilitating early detection of warning signs for clinical deterioration. These
           systems have four components (1) an afferent limb for detection and response triggering,
           (2) an efferent limb with medical or nursing response to prevent deterioration (3) a
           process improvement limb and (4) a governance and administrative structure. It remains
           uncertain which elements of RRS's contribute most to patient outcomes such as unplanned
           (re-) admission to the intensive care unit, shock, cardiac arrest and unexpected death.
           In addition, previous studies found that nurse observation, assessment and communication
           (afferent limb) are crucial to achieve better patient outcomes, but how to achieve
           afferent limb sustainability in hospitals is not clear.

           A previous study investigated 23 hospitals in Flanders (Belgium) about how nurses
           observe, assess, detect and communicate deteriorating and critical patients in surgical,
           medical and geriatric wards. Wide variation between hospitals was identified about
           critical patient intervention procedures, strategies and Do Not Attempt Resuscitation
           (DNAR) orders as well as between nurses about the use and knowledge of critical vital
           signs and call criteria for physician clinical advice and support. Nurses of hospitals
           with structured observation and communication protocols were better informed and
           perceived their communication and collaboration with physicians more favorable in
           compared to other hospitals. Based on these results conclusions and recommendations for
           further initiatives were formulated. The proposed Afferent Limb and Response Method
           intervention study will implement these recommendations guided by a robust scientific
           research approach to offer evidence to the nursing and medical practice community.

           The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Afferent Limb Ascertainment and
           Response Method intervention or ALARM intervention in medical and surgical nursing wards
           of acute care hospitals on the prevention of SAE's such as in-hospital unexpected death,
           unplanned ICU-admission and cardiac arrest.

        2. Study hypothesis

      Optimizing and supporting the process of observation, use and interpretation of vital signs,
      detection, assessment, escalation and communication with a higher level of care in
      deteriorating patients can prevent serious adverse events (in-hospital unexpected death,
      unplanned ICU admission and cardiac arrest) in acute care hospitals.

      - What does the study involve?

      The study is based on the application of training and tools: the training of nursing and
      medical staff about the observation, detection, assessment and communication of deteriorating
      and critically ill patients and the introduction of a standardized observation and
      communication protocol on medical and surgical wards (tools). A training team will offer
      standardized training sessions.

      - When does the study take place?

      From October 1st 2013 till September 30th 2015.

      - Where does the study take place?

      Belgium.

      - What are the risks to participants?

      Patients will not be exposed to complementary risks if they partake in this study. No
      additional investigations will be performed for the purpose of this study since the aim of
      the intervention is to optimize existing processes that are already used in a hospital.
