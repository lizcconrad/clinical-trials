      To determine the safety and tolerability of single escalating doses of Sulforadex® in healthy
      male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with
      single ascending doses of Sulforadex® administered to healthy male subjects between 18 to 45
      years of age. Each healthy subject will receive verbal and written information followed by
      signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

      Subjects will be screened within 21 days prior to admission. At this visit a medical
      examination will be performed to assess eligibility of the healthy subject. Screening will be
      conducted over 1 day or may be divided into more than 1 day. The first cohort of the study
      will commence with one sentinel group. The subsequent groups may be dosed together without
      sentinel dosing. The study is expected to have 5 cohorts with a total of 29 healthy male
      subjects:

          3. Any history of clinically significant abnormal laboratory, vital signs or other safety
             findings as determined by medical history, physical examination or other evaluations
             conducted at screening or on admission.

          4. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities in the standard 12-lead ECG (at screening and
             Day -1) and 24-hour 5-lead Holter ECG (at screening) which in the opinion of the
             Investigator interfered with the ECG analysis.

          5. Any history or current evidence of clinically relevant cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, haematological, endocrinological, metabolic,
