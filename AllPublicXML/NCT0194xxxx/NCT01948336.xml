      Background: Contrast-induced nephropathy is the third most common cause of acute renal
      failure in hospitalized patients in all age groups. In this study we aimed to investigate the
      effects of dexmedetomidine on early stage renal function in pediatric patients undergoing
      cardiac angiography.

      Methods: 60 pediatric patients between 6 and 72 months of age undergoing cardiac angiography
      were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups. The patients in both
      groups were administered 1mgkg-1 ketamine, 1mgkg-1 propofol as bolus and followed by 1
      mgkg-1hour-1 ketamine and 50 µgkg-1min-1 propofol infusion. Additionally, a loading dose of 1
      µgkg-1 dexmedetomidine given over 10 minutes followed by 0.5 µgkg-1hour-1 dexmedetomidine
      infusion to patients in group D. The patients were evaluated for NGAL, creatinine, renin,
      endothelin-1, TAS and TOS blood levels before the procedure and 6th and 24th hours after the
      procedure. pRIFLE criteria were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study.
