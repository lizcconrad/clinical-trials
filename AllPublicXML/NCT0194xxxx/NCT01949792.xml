  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the
      pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamics (the
      effect of the investigated drug on the body) of rFVIIa (activated coagulation factor VII)
      following one single injection of 270 microg/kg compared to three injections of 90 microg/kg
      rFVIIa in patients with haemophilia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities. Trial-related
             activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the trial, including
             activities to determine suitability for the trial

          -  Male patients with confirmed diagnosis of severe congenital haemophilia A or B (higher
             than 1% FVIII or FIX) with or without inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII or IX,
             based on medical records

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Congenital or acquired coagulation disorder other than congenital haemophilia A or B

          -  Any clinical signs or known history of arterial thrombotic events or previous deep
             vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (as defined by available medical records)

          -  Use of any anticoagulant (e.g. un-fractionated or low molecular weight heparin,
             vitamin-K antagonists, direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors)

          -  Bleeding prophylactic treatment or FVIII or FIX immune tolerance induction (ITI)
