    <textblock>
      Normally, higher levels of preoperational stress or anxiety affect behavior and recovery
      after the operation. Moreover, patients undergoing mastectomy are usually young women, and
      this demographic is known to experience higher levels of stress and anxiety than any other.
      Anesthetizing patients involves more than just anesthesia in operation; it also includes all
      of the preoperative treatments for optimizing a patient's condition and promoting quick
      postoperative recovery. Pharmacological premedication for anxiolysis or amnesia before
      anesthesia has been a common means of sedation that many studies have investigated. However,
      such studies have focused on alleviating patients' anxiety and on how far patients can obey
      induction for sedation; there has been no research on post-operational prognoses, the
      ultimate purpose of reducing anxiety.

      The well-known effect of pharmacological premedication is to reduce the capacity of the
      anesthetic. However, it is not confirmed whether this effect leads to better recovery after
      anesthesia, as this question has not been researched. Furthermore, recently some have argued
      strongly that premedication actually prolongs recovery and that it does not need to be
      applied to every patient. Recently, therefore, the use of pharmacological premedication has
      been left to the discretion of institutes or doctors in many cases.

      Among types of premedication, midazolam belongs to the class of short-acting benzodiazepines
      and is frequently used, as it induces meaningful anterograde amnesia and causes fewer
      aftereffects such as respiratory problems. In addition, its effects have already been
      demonstrated. However, research on the improvement of functional health after
      anesthesia—i.e., patients' quick return to normal life—is still poor and needs to be
      advanced.

      When measuring the degree of recovery, recent studies tend to focus on measuring how quickly
      patients are able to return to normal life rather than the recovery of specific symptoms. To
      this end, the most widely used method is the Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) survey. It has a
      total of 40 items, which are classified into five categories: emotional state, physical
      comfort, psychological support, physical independence, and pain. Questions are answered using
      a 5-point scale, with 1 being worst and 5 being best. It takes 6.3 minutes on average to
      complete, and its test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and split-half coefficient
      have led it to be recognized as the most effective survey method. Moreover, it has been used
      in many studies investigating how the type of operation, method of anesthesia, additional
      medication, and gender affect anesthesia and the operation. Its validity for such research
      has been verified.

      Therefore, investigators can investigate the degree of postoperational functional recovery
      through the QoR-40 by comparing cases in which an operation is performed with or without
      midazolam.

    <description>The researchers unaware of patients' group assignment will come to visit each patient before the operation and on the first and second days after the operation and administer the QoR-40 survey. They will evaluate the quality of recovery after general anesthesia by considering the global score (200 points in total) of QoR-40 surveys, which is obtained by summing the subtotal scores for emotional status, physical comfort, psychological support, physical independence, and pain. The QoR-40 administered 24 hours after the operation is the primary endpoint of this research. If there is a difference of 10 points or more between those two groups, we will consider that there is a significant difference between them.</description>

    <description>On the day when patients are scheduled for operation, one researcher will use a computer to randomly select and allocate patients. By randomization, patients will be divided into two groups, receiving an injection of either 0.02 mg/kg of midazolam(midazolam group) or saline (control group). The researcher who randomly allocated patients will prepare the medicines but not just medicine. Investigators must mix it with normal saline to obtain a total volume of 5 mL and label two of them all &quot;prepared medicine,&quot; never letting the doctors and subjects know which is midazolam and which is saline.
Use the QoR-40 survey form to investigate the functional recovery of the patient. This survey will be administered before the operation and on the first and second days after the operation; it will be administered three times in total.</description>
