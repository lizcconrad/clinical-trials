      The EVEREST II HRR is a single-arm prospective, multicenter clinical trial enrolling high
      surgical risk patients of the EVEREST II study (NCT00209274).

      Patients were considered high surgical risk if either their Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS)
      predicted operative mortality risk was ≥ 12%, or the surgeon investigator determined the
      patient to be high risk (≥ 12% predicted operative mortality risk) due to the presence of, at
      a minimum, one of the following pre-specified risk factors:

        -  Porcelain aorta or mobile ascending aortic atheroma

        -  Post-radiation mediastinum

        -  Previous mediastinitis

        -  Functional MR with ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 40%

        -  Over 75 years old with EF &lt; 40%

        -  Prior re-operation with patent grafts

        -  Two or more prior chest surgeries

        -  Hepatic cirrhosis

        -  Three or more of the following STS high risk factors:

           i. Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL ii. Prior chest surgery iii. Age over 75 iv. EF &lt; 35%

      Upon completion of enrollment in the HRR, a process was initiated to ensure patient consent
      to participate in a Concurrent Control (CC) group was in place. Patients were identified to
      determine survival through 12 months with current standard of care treatment.CC patients were
      derived from a cohort of patients screened for enrollment in the HRR,yet did not enroll. All
      patients had moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR based on transthoracic
      echocardiography (TTE). To be considered eligible for inclusion in the CC group, the patient
      had to be classified as high surgical risk using the same criteria used for the HRR. Upon
      follow-up with the clinical sites, it was determined that some of the initially identified
      patients with moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR met the criteria for high surgical
      risk. Of these patients, some were not included due to; lack of Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) approval at the site, lack of informed consent and unable to be contacted. The
      remaining patients make up the CC group.

    <description>Defined as all causes of death for the primary safety Major Adverse Event (MAE) Endpoint. Death is further divided into 2 categories:
A. Cardiac death is defined as death due to any of the following:
Acute myocardial infarction.
Cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade.
Arrhythmia or conduction abnormality.
Stroke within 30 days of the procedure or stroke suspected of being related to the procedure.
Death due to any complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery.
Any death for which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded.
B. Non-cardiac death is defined as a death not due to cardiac causes (as defined above).</description>

    <description>The major effectiveness endpoint is an assessment of multiple functional and structural measures of benefit including New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class.
Class I: Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of physical activity.
Class II: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Patients are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Measures of Benefit-Quality of Life (QOL) as Measured by Short Form (SF) 36</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Standardized quality of life surveys allow physicians to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment methods and the physical and psychological benefits a patient is likely to receive from a particular treatment.In the EVEREST II HRR,the patients were asked to complete the SF-36 QOL survey at baseline, 30 days and 12 months. The physical &amp; mental function were assessed by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score &amp; Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. The PCS &amp; MCS norms for 65-75 year olds are 44 and 52 respectively; and 31 &amp; 46 for congestive heart failure (CHF) patients respectively. Each scale from the SF-36 is an algebraic sum of responses for all items in that scale.For ease of analysis each scale is then transformed to a 0-100 scale using a formula that converts the lowest &amp; highest possible scores to 0 &amp; 100 respectively.The scoring of the SF-36 indicates that 0% in a domain represents the poorest possible QoL &amp; 100% indicates full QoL.</description>

             of 3 weeks prior to treatment.

          -  Intravenous drug abuse or suspected inability to adhere to follow-up.

          -  Patients in whom transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is contraindicated.

          -  A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to study or

          -  In the judgment of the Investigator, patients in whom the presence of a permanent
             pacemaker or pacing leads would interfere with placement of the test device or the
             placement of the test device would disrupt the leads.

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints. [Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were
             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials].

          <title>Predicted Surgical Mortality</title>
          <description>The Society of Thoracic Surgeons' risk models predict the risk of operative mortality &amp; morbidity after adult cardiac surgery.
Risk models were developed for nine specific endpoints, including operative mortality.Operative mortality includes both (1) all deaths occurring during the hospitalization, even if after 30 days (2) deaths occurring after discharge, but within 30 days of the procedure.
Therefore, a patient’s mortality risk score is defined as the patient’s predicted risk of operative mortality as calculated by the specific operative mortality statistical model.</description>

        <description>The major effectiveness endpoint is an assessment of multiple functional and structural measures of benefit including New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class.
Class I: Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of physical activity.
Class II: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Patients are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>

        <population>71 out of 78 patients (at baseline) were analyzed at 30 days. There were 6 deaths prior to 30 days. So, NYHA at 30 days is missing due to death in 6 patients, and missing due to other reasons in 1 patient.</population>

        <title>Clinical Measures of Benefit-Quality of Life (QOL) as Measured by Short Form (SF) 36</title>
        <description>Standardized quality of life surveys allow physicians to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment methods and the physical and psychological benefits a patient is likely to receive from a particular treatment.In the EVEREST II HRR,the patients were asked to complete the SF-36 QOL survey at baseline, 30 days and 12 months. The physical &amp; mental function were assessed by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score &amp; Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. The PCS &amp; MCS norms for 65-75 year olds are 44 and 52 respectively; and 31 &amp; 46 for congestive heart failure (CHF) patients respectively. Each scale from the SF-36 is an algebraic sum of responses for all items in that scale.For ease of analysis each scale is then transformed to a 0-100 scale using a formula that converts the lowest &amp; highest possible scores to 0 &amp; 100 respectively.The scoring of the SF-36 indicates that 0% in a domain represents the poorest possible QoL &amp; 100% indicates full QoL.</description>

Pathological criteria: Endocarditis is confirmed if microorganisms are identified by culture or histology in a vegetation, embolized vegetation, or an intracardiac abscess; or if pathological lesions are observed &amp; histologically confirmed showing active endocarditis.
Clinical criteria: Endocarditis is confirmed by the presence of 2 major criteria, 1 major plus 3 minor criteria, or 5 minor criteria. Major criteria include persistently +ve blood cultures with the presence of typical organisms for endocarditis; persistent bacteremia; evidence of endocardial involvement with positive echocardiogram with signs of oscillating vegetation, abscesses, valve perforation, new partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve or new valvular regurgitation. Minor criteria include predisposing heart condition, fever, vascular phenomena, immunologic phenomena, &amp; positive blood culture or echocardiogram not meeting major criteria.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class</title>
          <description>Class I: Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of physical activity.
Class II: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Patients are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>
