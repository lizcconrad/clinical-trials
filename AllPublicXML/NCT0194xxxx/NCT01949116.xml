  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with HIV infection who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) could be at risk for
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), which can be caused by inflammation. Methotrexate (MTX) is a
      medication used to treat inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis. This study
      evaluated the safety and effectiveness of low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX) at reducing
      inflammation in HIV-infected adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected people taking ART have a higher than expected risk of premature CVD. Many
      factors likely contribute to this risk, including chronic inflammation. Strategies to reduce
      inflammation in HIV-infected people may be beneficial in reducing CVD risk, as well as other
      conditions, including kidney disease, bone disease, and neurologic complications. MTX is an
      anti-inflammatory medication used to treat people with rheumatoid arthritis. This study
      evaluated the safety and effectiveness of LDMTX at treating inflammation and on endothelial
      function in virologically suppressed HIV-infected adults who had CVD or were at increased
      risk of CVD.

      The total study duration was 36 weeks. Prior to enrolling in the study, participants had a
      chest X-ray. Participants were randomly assigned to receive LDMTX or placebo for 24 weeks.
      Participants continued taking their antiretroviral (ARV) medications as usual; ARVs were not
      provided by the study. At study entry, participants underwent a medical and medication
      history, physical examination, blood collection, and adherence assessments. From study entry
      through Week 1, participants received either 5 mg of LDMTX or placebo once a week. For
      participants who were clinically stable at the Week 1 study visit, the dose of LDMTX or
      placebo was increased to 10 mg once a week through Week 12. For participants who were
      clinically stable at the Week 12 study visit, the dose of LDMTX or placebo was increased to
      15 mg once a week through Week 24. Participants who did not meet the criteria for dose
      escalation were re-evaluated at the following study visit. In addition to LDMTX or placebo,
      all participants also received 1 mg of folic acid once a day from study entry throughout Week
      24. After taking the final dose of LDMTX or placebo, all participants continued taking folic
      acid for an additional 4 weeks.

      Post-entry visits occurred at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, and 36. These included a physical
      examination, blood collection, and adherence assessments; an arm ultrasound test was
      performed at Weeks 12 and 24. At Week 2, some participants took part in a pharmacokinetic
      (PK) assessment, which involved undergoing a blood collection several times over a 6-hour
      period.

             of the site investigator, places the candidate at increased risk of lung toxicity
             (e.g., history of pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary
             lymphoproliferative disease)

          -  Use of immunomodulators (e.g., interleukins, interferons, cyclosporine), HIV vaccine,
             systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, or investigational therapy within 30 days prior to
             study entry

          -  Change in the ART regimen in the 12 weeks prior to study entry or intended
             modification of ART during the study. NOTE: Modifications of ART doses during the 12
             weeks prior to study entry were permitted. In addition, the change in formulation
             (e.g., from standard formulation to fixed-dose combination) was allowed within 12
             weeks prior to study entry. A within class single drug substitution (e.g., switch from
             nevirapine to efavirenz or from atazanavir to darunavir) is allowed within 12 weeks
             prior to study entry, with the exception of a switch from any other nucleoside reverse
             transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) to abacavir. No other changes in ART in the 12 weeks
             prior to study entry were permitted.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drug(s) or
             their formulation

          -  Average daily consumption of three or more alcoholic beverages for 4 weeks prior to
             study entry or intention to consume an average of two or more alcoholic beverages a
             day during the study. NOTE: An alcohol-containing beverage is defined as 12 ounces of
             beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of spirits.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements

          -  Changes in lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medication within 90 days prior to study
             entry or expected need to modify these medications during the study. NOTE:
             Lipid-lowering medication includes: statins, fibrates, niacin (dose greater than or
             equal to 250 mg daily), and fish-oil/omega 3 fatty acids (dose greater than 1000 mg of
             marine oils daily).

          -  Vaccination (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide) within 14 days prior to
             study entry

          -  Anticipated need to receive vaccination (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide)
             within 1 week prior to Week 4, 12, 24, or 36 study visits

          -  Excess extracompartmental fluids including ascites, pericardial fluid, and pleural
             effusions which, in the opinion of the study investigators, would result in difficulty
             in monitoring the dose of MTX

          -  Use of drugs that alter folic acid metabolism such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or
             reduce tubular excretion such as probenecid within 14 days prior to study entry

          -  New York Heart Association Class IV congestive heart failure

          -  Diabetes mellitus with HbA1C greater than 8.0% within the past 90 days prior to study
             entry

        <description>CX3CR1+ is a cellular marker of immune activation. The outcome measured is the percentages of CX3CR1+ expressions in both parent CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Absolute change from baseline (Week 24 - baseline) was analyzed on the measured scale, which is the percent of parent cells (either CD4+ or CD8+) that express CX3CR1+ cells.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>Adequately-dosed (AD) population included 129 participants who initiated study treatment with 24-week continuous dosing to at least 8 or more 15 mg doses of LDMTX/Placebo (59 in LDMTX, 70 in Placebo). 3 of these participants were not identified at the time of the specimen request for biomarker testing, other missing data are due to missed visits.</population>

For participants who were clinically stable at the Week 1 study visit, the dose of LDMTX was increased to 10 mg once a week through Week 12.

Participants who did not meet the criteria for dose escalation was re-evaluated at the following study visit. In addition to LDMTX, all participants also received 1 mg of folic acid once a day from study entry throughout Week 24. After taking the final dose of LDMTX, all participants continued taking folic acid for an additional 4 weeks.
