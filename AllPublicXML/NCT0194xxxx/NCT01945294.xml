    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the difference in the efficacy between a 16-week
      treatment regimen of boceprevir (BOC) in combination with peg-intron alpha 2b (P) plus
      ribavirin (R) (BOC + PR) and a 28-week treatment regimen of BOC + PR in previously untreated
      participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 in Asia who achieve undetectable
      hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA).

    <time_frame>From TW1 through TW48</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
