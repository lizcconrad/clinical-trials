      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lapatinib ditosylate when given
      together with dabrafenib in treating patients with thyroid cancer that cannot be removed by
      surgery and has not responded to previous treatment. Dabrafenib and lapatinib ditosylate may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) that can be
      used in combination of dabrafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate potential mechanisms of primary
      resistance of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutant thyroid cancer to
      dabrafenib by performing pathway profiling of tumor biopsies before and while on therapy.

      III. Obtain preliminary data on the activity of the combination of lapatinib and dabrafenib
      in BRAF mutant thyroid cancer through imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lapatinib ditosylate.

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and lapatinib
      ditosylate PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: Patients also receive dabrafenib PO for 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment with
      lapatinib ditosylate.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then annually
      thereafter.
