  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, an existing mobile health intervention to improve diabetes self-management
      will be combined with a social support module and tested for feasibility. The investigators
      hypothesize that this combination will be feasible and acceptable to both patients and their
      loved ones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first ever evaluation of a highly scalable and low-cost social support
      intervention for patients with diabetes delivered entirely via mobile phones. TExT-MED FANS
      will unite the benefits of mHealth (scalability, ease of access) and social support
      interventions (personalized motivation, emotional support). The Diabetes FANS text message
      based curriculum will make it easier for friends and family to become supporters.
      Additionally, augmenting TExT-MED with the FANS social support module will be more effective
      than TExT-MED alone. The personalized support of TExT-MED FANS will also be more effective
      than providing TExT-MED in combination with a community health worker supporter who lacks a
      pre-existing relationship with the patient. Through this innovative combination, I can create
      a more cost-effective and diffusible mHealth solution that maintains the personal connection
      of social support interventions. To date there has only been one study evaluating social
      support interventions for patients with diabetes using mHealth, but in this study
      participants were paired with other subjects with diabetes (not friends or family) and it
      required intensive face-to-face support group time. TExT-MED FANS will provide key insights
      into the utility of combining social support interventions delivered solely via mHealth in
      low-income Latino patients. These insights will help future interventions achieve maximal
      impact on diabetes and other chronic disease management.
