  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of orally administered MEK inhibitor trametinib as the second line in subjects with
      advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancers (BTC) in Japanese population. The primary
      endpoint of this study is 12 week non-progressive disease (PD) rate defined as the percentage
      of subjects without progression at Week 12. As a sub-study, pharmacokinetics (PK) of four
      tablets of 0.5 milligram (mg) tablet, or one tablet of 2 mg tablet to achieve 2 mg daily
      regimen will be assessed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of trametinib in Japanese
      population.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive trametinib at the recommended Phase II dose
      of 2 mg every day as one 2 mg tablet or four 0.5 mg tablets on Day 1. From Day 2 until
      disease progression or withdrawal from the study treatment, all subjects will receive one
      tablet of 2 mg trametinib . Disease assessment will be performed every 8 week. Translational
      research is also planned to evaluate the potential blood or tumor tissue-derived biomarkers
      for biological activity, and sensitivity or resistance to treatment with trametinib .

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Clinical Chemistry Grade Shifts From Baseline</title>
        <description>Shift from baseline was calculated as the post baseline value minus the baseline value for albumin, alkalaine phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, and phosphate. A Worst Post Baseline (WPB) grade shift is defined as the worst change that occurred at any measured timepoint during the treatment period. Grading was determined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE). Participants with missing baseline grade were designated a baseline grade of 0.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: all participants randomized to treatment who received at least one dose of randomized study medication in the treatment period. Only those participants with analyzable data at the indicated time point were assessed (represented by n=x).</population>

            <description>Participants received GSK1120212 at 2 milligram (mg), either as four tablets of 0.5 mg or one tablet of 2 mg at Day 1. At Day 2 and for the remaining study period, participants received continuous daily dosing of one tablet of 2 mg GSK1120212 once-daily until disease progression or death or until study treatment stopping criteria was met.</description>

        <description>Shift from baseline was calculated as the post baseline value minus the baseline value for activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT). A Worst Post Baseline (WPB) grade shift is defined as the worst change that occurred at any measured timepoint during the treatment period. Grading was determined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE). Participants with missing baseline grade were designated a baseline grade of 0.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Hematology Grade Shifts From Baseline</title>
          <description>Shift from baseline was calculated as the post baseline value minus the baseline value for hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets, and leukocytes. A Worst Post Baseline (WPB) grade shift is defined as the worst change that occurred at any measured timepoint during the treatment period. Grading was determined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE). Participants with missing baseline grade were designated a baseline grade of 0.</description>

Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was categorized as Grade 0 (&lt;80), Grade 1 (&gt;=80-&lt;90), Grade 2 (&gt;=90-&lt;100), and Grade 3 (&gt;=100). Change from baseline was calculated as the post baseline value minus the baseline value. A Worst Post Baseline (WPB) change is defined as the worst change that occurred at any measured timepoint during the treatment period. Participants with missing baseline measurements or visit measurements were considered to be missing.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Progression-Free Survival as Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the interval of time (in weeks) between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression and the date of death due to any cause. Disease progression was based on the assessments by the Investigator. If a participant received subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS in the participant was censored at the last adequate assessment prior the initiation of the new anti-cancer therapy. Otherwise, if a participant did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS in the participant was censored at the last adequate assessment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Progression-Free Survival as Assessed by Independent Radiologist</title>
        <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the interval of time (in weeks) between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression and the date of death due to any cause. Disease progression was based on the assessments by the independent radiologist. If a participant received subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS in the participant was censored at the last adequate assessment prior the initiation of the new anti-cancer therapy. Otherwise, if a participant did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS in the participant was censored at the last adequate assessment.</description>

        <description>Time to response (TTR) event was defined as achievement of a confirmed CR or PR, as the time from date of randomization until date of first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first).
