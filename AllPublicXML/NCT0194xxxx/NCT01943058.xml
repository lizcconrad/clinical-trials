    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well megestrol acetate or levonorgestrel-releasing
      intrauterine system works in treating patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia or
      endometrial cancer. Progesterone can cause the growth of endometrial cancer cells. Hormone
      therapy using megestrol acetate or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system may fight
      endometrial cancer by lowering the amount of progesterone the body makes. It is not yet known
      whether megestrol acetate is more effective than levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system
      in treating atypical endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) results in
      histologic regression of the endometrial lesion (complex atypical hyperplasia [CAH] and grade
      1 endometrial cancer [EC]) comparable to that achieved with oral megestrol (megestrol
      acetate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare both the side effect profiles, such as weight gain and mood changes as well as
      compliance with assigned treatment between the 2 treatment arms.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe fertility-related outcomes, ovulation, menstrual pattern and fertility
      abnormalities determined during usual workup (e.g., semen analysis), pregnancy and delivery
      within 18-months of treatment.

      II. To characterize the incidence of endocrine comorbidities (e.g., hypothyroidism,
      polycystic ovarian syndrome, and diabetes).

      III. To characterize the association of levels of endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress and
      protein kinase B (Akt)-activation in endometrial samples with clinicopathologic-response to
      Progestin (therapeutic progesterone) therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive megestrol acetate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 18 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive levonorgestrel-releasing IUS with continuous release for up to 18
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

    <description>Histologic regression will be dichotomized as a binary outcome variable, yes if patients have a confirmed histologic regression at the time of the scheduled biopsy, and no if the histologic regression is not observed regardless of compliance, lost-to-follow-up, or other issues. A contingency table and a bar plot will be used to show the histologic regression rate between the 2 arms. Two-group test of equivalence in proportions will be used to detect whether the histologic regression rate in Arm B is not significantly lower than that in Arm A.</description>
