      The DIDo study is an open-label, randomised, multicentre study with 2 parallel groups in
      incident CAPD patients aged of 65 at minimum :

        -  One group in which patients will receive 2 bags of icodextrin/day and 1 bag of glucose

        -  One group in which patients will receive 1 bag of icodextrin/day and 2 bags of glucose.

      The DiDo study evaluates efficacy and safety of a Double Icodextrin Dose in elderly incident
      CAPD patients on incremental Peritoneal Dialysis therapy.

      The objective is to demonstrate the superiority and safety of using 2, as compared to 1,
      icodextrin bags / day, in a cohort of elderly incident continuous ambulatory peritoneal
      dialysis (CAPD) patients using incremental peritoneal dialysis (PD) (3 bags / day), with the
      aim of prolonging the period of time for which incremental PD can be used.

      This is a phase IV open-label, randomised, multicentre study with 2 parallel groups, which
      will take place in up to 30 hospital out-patient clinics un Europe.

      It is planned to include 160 patients on the run-in period in order to obtain 100 randomised
      patients and 90 patients evaluable at the primary endpoint (45 in each group). The duration
      of patient recruitment is estimated at 1 year but this may be extended until all 160 patients
      are recruited.

      There are 2 periods: a run-in period of 2 months and a treatment period of 18 months.
