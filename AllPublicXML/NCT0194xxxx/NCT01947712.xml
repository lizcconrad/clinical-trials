  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a clinical setting characterized by an exceptionally
      high risk for cardiovascular events. Oxidative stress seems to play a role in impairing
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and contributing to atherosclerosis in patients with PAD. Cocoa
      seems to exert artery dilatation via oxidative stress inhibition.

      OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether in PAD patients, dark chocolate elicits artery dilatation
      via down-regulation of NOX2, the catalytic core of NADPH oxidase.

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis represents the major cause of worldwide death; it is a complex phenomenon
      that encompasses the intricate interplay of classic cardiovascular risk factors, oxidative
      stress and inflammation.

      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a clinical setting that well represents the model of
      widespread atherosclerosis. PAD affects 20% of patients over the age of 75. Furthermore, PAD
      patients are at an exceptionally high risk for cardiovascular events and the majority will
      eventually die of a cardiac or cerebrovascular etiology.

      Polyphenol could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to counteract atherosclerosis. During
      the last decades, a growing interest in polyphenols resulted from prospective and
      epidemiological studies that showed the beneficial effects of these substances on human
      health. In particular, polyphenols exert their beneficial effect by inhibition of NADPH
      oxidase (NOX2), an enzyme directly involved in atherosclerosis; thus, the activation of this
      enzyme leads to an enhanced production of oxidative stress and inflammatory processes.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of polyphenols on oxidative stress and
      inflammation and on surrogate markers of atherosclerosis in PAD patients. Polyphenols,
      inhibiting NOX2-mediated oxidative stress and immune-mediated process, could represent a
      novel therapy to reduce the high risk of cardiovascular events in PAD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Every PAD patient to be enrolled in the study had:

          1. claudication (defined as leg pain on walking, disappearing within 10 minutes of
             standing, of presumed atherosclerotic origin) and

          2. ankle/brachial index (ABI), that was assessed as ankle/arm systolic blood pressure
             ratio by Doppler ultrasonography &lt;0.90 on the worst leg at rest.

        Patients had to be in stable conditions without abrupt changes of ABI (&gt;20%) in the last
        month before the enrolment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        disorders (serum creatinine&gt;2.8 mg/dL), acute stroke, acute myocardial infarction, deep
        venous thrombosis or if they were current smokers or were taking antioxidants.
