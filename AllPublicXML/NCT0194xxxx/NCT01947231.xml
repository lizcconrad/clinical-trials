  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective treatment for nonspecific chronic neck pain is a clinical challenge. Patients will
      be randomized into two groups to compare the outcomes of Global Postural Re-education (GPR)
      with standard manual physical therapy on with respect to pain, function, kinesiophobia, range
      of motion, perceived effect, and satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These study will use two groups: one to receive GPR which is a systematic method of
      addressing musculoskeletal pain and related functional deficits and the other to receive
      &quot;usual care&quot; manual PT which will be individualized to the patient's condition. Usual care
      will include techniques commonly used in clinical practice selected by the physical therapist
      after initial examination. After nine weeks of treatment, baseline measures will be
      re-evaluated. After conclusion of the first phase of the study, patients who were randomized
      to the &quot;usual care&quot; group will cross-over and receive GPR.
