  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate stool consistency and stool frequency during and
      up to 8 weeks following a 7 day antibiotic treatment with Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid 875mg
      BID.

      It is hypothesized that the proportion of subjects having a diarrhea-like defecation, defined
      as a stool frequency ≥ 3 per day and/or stool consistency ≥ 5 (Bristol Stool Score) for at
      least 2 days will be lower in the group receiving Lacidofil® STRONG compared to the group
      receiving placebo and therefore mean Bristol Stool Scores will be lower in subjects receiving
      Lacidofil® STRONG compared to those receiving placebo.
