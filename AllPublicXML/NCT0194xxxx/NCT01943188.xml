  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give stereotactic body
      radiation therapy and T-cell infusion in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.
      Giving total body irradiation before a T-cell infusion stops the growth of cancer cells by
      stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from
      the patient's blood and stored. Chemotherapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem
      cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming
      cells that were destroyed by the radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Conduct a safety and feasibility study of stereotactic radiotherapy with autologous T-cell
      infusion for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression free survival at one year. II. Determine the overall survival at
      one year.

      OUTLINE:

      STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY (SBRT): Patients undergo standard of care SBRT over 1-2
      weeks according to tumor volume and location.

      LYMPHODEPLETION: Beginning 3 weeks later, patients receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) for 3 days.

      REINFUSION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMC): Within 3-14 days of completing
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide, patients undergo autologous PBMC infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week, 4 weeks, and monthly
      thereafter.

    <description>The correlations of CTCs and changes in signaling as measured by nano-immunoassay (NIA) to clinical response will be assessed. NIA measurements for 20 protein isoforms will be analyzed. Measurements will be analyzed as continuous variables for each sample. The distribution of each isoform will be summarized with medians and interquartile ranges. Quantile plot and box-Cox models will be used to determine whether to transform the data prior to analysis. A protein isoform signature predictive of clinical response will be constructed using the Lasso R glmnet package.</description>
