  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether overweight but not obese pregnant African
      women having unlimited access to a health education-information technology (IT) based
      intervention package gain weight within the acceptable range of 8-12 kg during the pregnancy
      period.

      Therefore, we hypothesize that unlimited access to health education via an IT-based
      intervention package has the potential to reduce the onset of obesity in African pregnant
      women.

      To date (Aug 2015), 95% of patients have been recruited, 1320 potential subjects have been
      screened and 150 enrolled into the study

    <description>The HEDUAfrica IT package website aims to target disadvantaged gravid women representing the core aspect of the intervention. The website is available on a touch screen panel at the two intervention clinics, (Cape Town and Soweto, SA). A healthcare worker will assist women with the touchscreen tablet at the follow up sessions. The website content includes a number of short videos and health messages related to a pregnancy-specific-disease outcomes. Patients participating in the IT package also receive std car info
Participants are also asked to complete 2 questionnaires (24 hour dietary recall assessment and short messaging service technology driven) in conjunction to engaging with the HEDUAfrica website. The intervention is standardized across all participants in the intervention group.</description>

    <description>Participants in the non-intervention group at another clinic in Soweto, will receive an enhanced form of standard care. This will include, in conjunction with the normal form of care at each clinic,a health awareness brochure that will focus specifically on health information relating to obesity, diabetes, diet, exercise and breastfeeding at each follow-up sessions. These participants will also be asked to fill out the 24 hour dietary recall assessment and short messaging service technology questionnaire (exactly the same as the intervention group) with help from a healthcare worker.</description>
