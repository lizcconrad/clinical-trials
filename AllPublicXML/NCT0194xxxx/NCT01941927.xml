  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase II clinical study of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 in
      patients with BRAF wild-type mutation melanoma. All patients will receive continuous dosing
      of trametinib (2 mg) in combination with GSK2141795 (25 mg) oral daily until progression of
      disease, withdrawal of consent, or the development of intolerable treatment associated
      toxicity. Imaging (CT or MRI) will be performed within 7 days prior to day 1 of Odd Cycles,
      starting with Cycle 3.

      Patients may continue treatment with trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 on trial until
      disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity that does not improve with
      maximal supportive care or dose reduction per protocol.

      Treatment-associated adverse events will be assessed based on clinical and laboratory
      findings using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Adverse event
      assessments will be performed every week through cycle 3 day 1, and on day 1 for every cycle
      thereafter. AEs and SAEs will be monitored by UCSF's Data Safety Monitoring Committee.

      Safety assessments will include medical history, physical examination, CBC with differential,
      chemistries panel, thyroid function and pregnancy tests, ECGs, and ophthalmology evaluations.
      Screening assessments will also include a transthoracic echocardiogram or MUGA scan, and
      brain imaging.

      It is estimated that 48 patients will complete the study.

    <description>GSK 2141795 is an ATP competitive subnanomolar pan-AKT inhibitor. In order to measure the true potency of GSK 2141795, potency (Ki*) values were determined in a filter binding assay using lower enzyme concentrations (0.1, 0.7, and 0.2 nM for human AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3, respectively). Using a sandwich ELISA, GSK 2141795 inhibited phosphorylation of GSK-3β in BT474 and LNCaP cell lines with EC50 values of 143 and 34 nM, respectively. Sincephosphorylation of GSK-3β can be modulated by other enzymes (PKA, PKC, and RSK),cellular activity of GSK 2141795 was evaluated using a phospho-PRAS40 ELISA.GSK 2141795 inhibited the phosphorylation of PRAS40 with EC50 values of 39 and 55 nM for BT474 and LNCaP cells, respectively.</description>
