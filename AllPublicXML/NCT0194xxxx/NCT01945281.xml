  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of caspofungin as compared
      with amphotericin B deoxycholate in the treatment of invasive candidiasis in neonates and
      infants. The primary hypothesis to be tested in the study is that caspofungin will be
      superior to amphotericin B deoxycholate with regard to the proportion of participants with
      fungal-free survival at the 2-week posttherapy follow-up visit.
