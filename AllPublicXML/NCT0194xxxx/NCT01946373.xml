      The purpose of this study is to learn if dendritic cell vaccine will increase the effect of
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes given with chemotherapy and interleukin-2 in patients with
      melanoma.

      The MAT02 clinical trial is a phase 1 clinical trial with the objective to assess the safety,
      feasibility and immunological efficacy of the combined application of two immunological
      treatment modalities in patients with metastatic melanoma:

        1. Cohort A: After a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, 5 patients will receive one
           bulk infusion of T cells. T cells will be expanded ex vivo from autologous tumor
           infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). In vivo persistence of the infused cells will be
           supported by administration of IL-2, a T cell survival factor.

        2. Cohort B: This adoptive cell transfer (ACT) step will in additional 5 patients be
           followed by a vaccination with autologous, in vitro-generated, dendritic cells (DC),
           loaded with autologous tumor lysate and a synthetically produced peptide derived from
           the tumor associated antigen NY-ESO 1.
