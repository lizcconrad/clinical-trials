  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical evidence for effects of plant anthocyanins on vision, and particularly night vision
      is controversial. Two clinical trials were conducted to investigate whether blueberry juice
      consumption affected visual dark adaptation, functional night vision, and recovery after
      photo-bleaching of the retina. One trial (S2) employed a 3 week intervention and washout
      period, and two doses of blueberries plus a placebo. The other trial (L1) employed a 12 week
      intervention plus an 8 week washout and tested one blueberry juice dose against a juice
      placebo.
