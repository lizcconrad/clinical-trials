  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand whether trichuris suis ova (TSO)
      ingested orally may be safe and effective in the treatment of psoriasis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of 16 weeks of treatment with
      7500 trichuris suis ova (TSO 7500) given every 2 weeks (a total of 8 doses) for the treatment
      of moderate-to-severe, chronic, plaque-type psoriasis.

    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72 based on the body surface area of involvement and the severity of disease (induration, erythema and scale). A PASI-50 response is defined as ≥50% improvement in PASI score from baseline; PASI-75 and PASI-90 are similarly defined.</description>
