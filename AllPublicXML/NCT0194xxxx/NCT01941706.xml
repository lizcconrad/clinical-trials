  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project UPLIFT, a home-based treatment for depression in people with epilepsy, was designed
      to be delivered to groups by telephone or Web. The Project UPLIFT intervention materials were
      demonstrated to be effective in treating depression among people with epilepsy in Georgia.
      This project will assess whether the materials are also effective for preventing depression
      among people with epilepsy, and will extend the project beyond Georgia to Michigan, Texas,
      and Washington.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot test of Project UPLIFT for depression prevention during which the
      acceptability and estimates of effectiveness of the intervention, presented in the Web and
      telephone modes, are assessed.

    <description>Developed for home-based treatment of depression in people with epilepsy, Project UPLIFT is based upon Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for depression. It includes 8 modules, group-delivered by either telephone or Web. Trainees and people with epilepsy co-facilitate the groups, supervised by a licensed mental health professional.The co-facilitators are trained and supervised by the Principal Investigator, a Georgia-licensed clinical psychologist and Associate Professor of Behavioral Science and of Epidemiology in public health. Activities are designed to increase knowledge about depression; monitoring, challenging, and changing thoughts; coping and relaxing; attention and mindfulness; focusing on pleasure; the importance of reinforcement, and preventing relapse.</description>
