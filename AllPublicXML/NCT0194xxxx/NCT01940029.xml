  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurosurgical ICU patients often receive hyperosmotic diuretics or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      drainage to decrease their intracranial pressure. It is also common to keep them under
      normovolemia or mild hypervolemia status for stable cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). These
      patients have large urine output on average, and can decrease the reabsorption of specific
      medicines by renal tubules. Besides, hypervolemia status might increase the volume of
      distribution for hydrophilic medicines, and lower their serum concentration. Therefore, the
      pharmacokinetic characteristics in this population may be different from general population,
      which impacts the efficacy and toxicity of medicines with narrow therapeutic index.

      Vancomycin is used mainly for MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) infection, and possesses
      a significant place of therapy in treatment of neurosurgical patients' post-operation
      infection. The serum concentration of vancomycin exhibits a clear relevance to its efficacy
      and toxicity. From the investigators' preliminary research of the disposition of vancomycin
      in neurosurgical ICU patients, the investigators found that their vancomycin serum
      concentrations were lower than expected, which can be attributed to their 40% higher mean
      vancomycin clearances than that of neurosurgical general ward patients. However, no definite
      mechanism leading to this phenomenon was confirmed.

      In this study, the investigators prospectively recruit a cohort of adult neurosurgical ICU
      patients to validate the investigators' preliminary pharmacokinetic parameter models for
      vancomycin. Furthermore, the investigators will also demonstrate the contribution of
      different vancomycin elimination routes, renal and CSF drainage eliminating routs, to its
      total clearance, and the relationship between vancomycin renal clearance and creatinine
      clearance. Exclusion criteria include renal failure, unstable renal function, obesity, shock
      status, third space fluid accumulation, burn and pregnancy. The models to validate are used
      for empirical vancomycin dosage calculation. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is conducted
      after vancomycin serum concentration achieves steady state, and the predicted and observed
      serum concentration of vancomycin are compared to evaluate the consistency. On the other
      hand, vancomycin excreted from urine and CSF drainage fluid would be calculated to see their
      independent contribution for total vancomycin clearance. Meanwhile, the investigators try to
      investigate the mechanism for renal elimination of vancomycin by its association to
      creatinine clearance values calculated from urine creatinine concentration data.

      Bringing all the information together, the investigators hope to provide helpful information
      for the clinical pharmacokinetics of vancomycin therapy in neurosurgical patients, and to
      optimize empirical vancomycin dosing and improve treatment success. Through this study, the
      investigators also wish to understand the possible pharmacokinetic change of other medicines
      in this population, and provide an important source of reference for clinical treatments.
