  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma is poor and current available treatments
      are limited. Identification of a number of melanoma-specific tumor antigens that are shared
      by tumors from different patients, provides attractive targets for immune-based therapies
      (http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/hptaa/). Different approaches like DNA-/RNA-vaccines, peptide
      vaccines and dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are under investigation to induce peptide-specific
      immune responses. In various animal models and in clinical trials it was shown that the most
      potent induction of anti tumor-specific killer cells was achieved with DC vaccination. DCs
      are professional antigen presenting cells (APC) that are critical in the initiation of
      cellular responses in na√Øve T lymphocytes, in vivo. They are armed with all the molecules
      needed for the induction of immune responses and have the capacity to migrate into secondary
      lymphatic organs. In vitro generated dendritic cells are loaded with tumor derived peptides
      and injected subcutaneously. The concept is to induce or to propagate already existing tumor
      specific killer T cells.
