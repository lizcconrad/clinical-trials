      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of three different
      doses of aripiprazole (2 mg/day, 6-12 mg/day, 24-30 mg/day) orally administered over a period
      of 6 weeks in pediatric patients (aged 13-17 years) with schizophrenia

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at Final Assessment in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a 30-item scale where each symptom is rated on a severity scale ranging from 1-7: 1 =Absent, 2 =Minimal, 3 =Mild, 4 =Moderate, 5 =Moderate severe, 6 =Severe, 7= Extreme. PANSS total score is calculated by adding score of 30 items, which ranges from 30-210. Higher scores indicate worse condition.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at Final Assessment in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Positive Subscale Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale score is the sum of the 7 positive item scores (ie, delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution and hostility) and ranges from 7 to 49, with higher values indicating worse condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at Final Assessment in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day43</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score is a clinician rated scale which assesses how mentally ill the patient is at the time. Scores range from 0 to 7: 0 = Not assessed, 1= Normal, not at all ill, 2 =Borderline mentally ill, 3= Mildly ill, 4= Moderately ill, 5= Markedly ill, 6= Severely ill, 7= Among the most extremely ill patients. Higher scores indicate worse condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at Final Assessment in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and day43</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Score is a clinician rated scale which assesses the total improvement of the patient's condition compared to that at baseline. Scores range from 0 to 7: 0 = Not assessed, 1= Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3= Minimally improved, 4= No change, 5= Minimally worse, 6= Much worse, 7= Very much worse. Higher scores indicate worse condition.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at Final Assessment in Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS) is a rating scale which measures psychological, social and school functioning for children aged 6-17. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better condition.</description>
