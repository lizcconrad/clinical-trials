  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate and compare the effects of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation when applied in
      the agonist and antagonist muscles of spastic hemiparetic patients.

      The specific objectives are:

        -  Evaluate the resistance movement, strength and muscle electrical activity before and
           after application of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation in spastic muscle
           (gastrocnemius).

        -  Evaluate the resistance movement, strength and muscle electrical activity before and
           after application of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation in the spastic antagonist
           muscle (tibialis anterior).

        -  Compare the risk of falls after application of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation in
           both muscles studied.

      Most hemiparetic patients can develop spasticity, characterized by neuronal
      hyperexcitability, increased resistance to passive stretch, Babinski sign, clonus, reflexes
      and involuntary spasms skin.

      As a consequence, there may be contractures and muscle shortening, generating functional
      limitations. Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation feature that can control the spasticity
      through reciprocal inhibition, muscle relaxation and sensory stimulation. The goal will be to
      evaluate and compare the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation when applied in the
      agonist and antagonist muscles of spastic hemiparetic patients.
