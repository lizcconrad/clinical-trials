  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional, open study will evaluate clinical data in relation to biomarkers in
      patients 12 to 75 years of age with severe oral corticosteroid (OCS) - dependent asthma.
      Patients with uncontrolled asthma will be offered an additional escalation of OCS at a dose
      of 0.5 mg/kg for 7 days. Patients enrolled in this study would be eligible to be enrolled in
      a future placebo-controlled intervention study designed to measure the steroid-sparing effect
      of lebrikizumab.

             detailed systematic assessment (the BTS UK Difficult Asthma Network assessment model
             [Heaney et al 2010] or equivalent) and follow-up by an asthma specialist for at least
             six months

          -  History of asthma treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS ) (&gt;/=1500
             mcg beclomethasone dipropionate daily, or equivalent) and long-acting beta-2 agonists
