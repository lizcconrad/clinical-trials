      The objective of the PLATFORM Study is to compare clinical outcomes, resource utilization,
      and quality of life (QOL) of FFRCT-guided evaluation versus standard practice evaluation in
      patients with suspected CAD in order to further inform patients, health care providers, and
      other stakeholders about which technologies are most effective and efficient in the diagnosis
      of CAD

      The OVERALL OBJECTVE of this post-market, multicenter, longitudinal, prospective, consecutive
      cohort study is to compare clinical outcomes, resource utilization, and quality of life (QOL)
      in subjects receiving standard practice evaluation and treatment versus subjects receiving
      FFRCT-guided evaluation and treatment in subjects with suspected CAD in order to further
      inform patients, health care providers, and other stakeholders about which technologies are
      most effective and efficient in the diagnosis of CAD. Cohort 1 of this study will assess
      outcomes incorporating standard practice evaluation and Cohort 2 will assess outcomes
      incorporating FFRCT-guided evaluation. Each Cohort will be further delineated based upon
      initial presentation, whereas subjects presenting for initial non-invasive testing will be
      designated as Cohorts 1A and 2A; and subjects already referred for ICA will be designated as
      Cohorts 1B and 2B.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES for sequential cohort comparisons:

        1. To compare the rate of ICA documenting non-obstructive coronary artery disease, clinical
           outcomes, and QOL following standard practice for diagnostic and treatment planning
           modalities in Cohort 1 versus incorporating FFRCT as the preferred test to guide further
           invasive management and medical treatment in Cohort 2;

        2. To compare resource utilization following standard practice for diagnostic and treatment
           pathways in Cohort 1 versus incorporating FFRCT as the preferred test to guide further
           invasive management and medical treatment in Cohort 2;

        3. To provide supporting data for generating new guidelines for diagnosis and prognosis of
           CAD with comparative analysis of the risk stratification with the Updated
           Diamond-Forrester risk model (UDF);

        4. To provide society including patients, health care providers and other stakeholders with
           information about which diagnostic technologies are most effective and efficient in
           managing patients with CAD.

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 1 - Standard of Care</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects will be referred for non-invasive and/or invasive testing and evaluation. Prior to treatment of each subject considered for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and/or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the investigator and the institution's heart team will review clinical data and results of the diagnostic tests to recommend a treatment strategy, according to the institution's standard practice. Cohort 1 of the study is an observational evaluation of resource utilization and outcomes based on standard practice for diagnosis and treatment of subjects with symptomatic suspected CAD and intermediate likelihood of obstructive CAD. Subjects will be followed for one year after enrollment.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Cohort 2 - FFRCT-guided</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects will be referred for non-invasive and/or invasive testing and evaluation. Prior to treatment of subjects considered for PCI and/or CABG, the investigator and the institution's heart team will review the results of all available diagnostic tests, including cCTA and FFRCT, and will recommend a treatment strategy accordingly. FFRCT is a non-invasive method to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions. FFRCT calculates FFR from subject-specific cCTA data using computational fluid dynamics under rest and simulated maximal coronary hyperemic conditions. FFRCT values range between 0 and 1, and values ≤0.80 are considered hemodynamically (HD)-significant.</description>
