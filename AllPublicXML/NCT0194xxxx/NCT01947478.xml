    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of MDT-2113 for the
      interventional treatment of de novo and non-stented restenotic lesions in the superficial
      femoral artery (SFA) and the proximal popliteal artery (PPA) as compared to treatment with
      standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).

          -  Target lesion is in the SFA and/or PPA above the knee

          -  Target lesion consists of a single de novo or non-stented restenotic lesion (or tandem

               1. ≥ 70% and &lt; 100% occluded with total lesion length ≥ 40 mm and ≤ 200 mm

               2. 100% occluded with total lesion length ≤100 mm

               3. Combination lesions must have total lesion length ≥40 mm and ≤200 mm with an
                  occluded segment that is ≤ 100 mm in length (by visual estimates)

          -  Reference vessel diameter ≥ 4 mm and ≤7 mm (by visual estimate)

          -  Angiographic evidence of adequate distal run-off through the foot

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stroke or STEMI within the 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  Either local or systemic thrombolytic therapy within the 48 hours prior to the index
             procedure

          -  Inability to tolerate oral anticoagulation therapy (blood thinners such as warfarin)
             while on concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)

          -  Known allergies or sensitivities to heparin, aspirin (ASA), other
             anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies or to paclitaxel, or an allergy to contrast media
             that cannot be adequately pre-treated prior to the index procedure

          -  Chronic renal insufficiency

          -  Subject is enrolled in another investigational device, drug, or biologic study

          -  Any major surgical procedure or intervention performed within the 30-day period prior
             to or post index procedure

          -  Contralateral SFA/PPA disease requiring treatment in the same setting as index
             procedure
