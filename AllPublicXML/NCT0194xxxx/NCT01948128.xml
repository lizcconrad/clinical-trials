    <textblock>
      This protocol is a randomized, phase 2 &quot;window of opportunity&quot; trial assessing the biological
      effects of short term oral vitamin D administration on breast cancer clinical and
      translational markers in patients awaiting surgery at the Ottawa Hospital. It takes advantage
      of the current wait times (2-8 weeks) for breast cancer surgery as a &quot;window of opportunity&quot;
      to rapidly assess biological changes with vitamin D intake.
