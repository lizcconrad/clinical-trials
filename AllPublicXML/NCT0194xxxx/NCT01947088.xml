      Participation in music therapy will result in improvement in cognitive functioning, as
      measured by neuropsychological testing 9-12 months following surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Music therapy could have a significant impact on clinical outcomes for patients with
      epilepsy. One study found that epilepsy patients who received music therapy for six months or
      greater had a significant reduction in number of seizures and could potentially aid in
      decreasing medication dosage. The investigators would like to contribute to this sort of
      research, but focus on what effect music therapy has on a patient's cognitive recovery after
      undergoing epilepsy surgery. Although research exists regarding music therapy on memory and
      communication, its overall effect on this patient population is unclear.

      The Dell Children's Epilepsy program hopes that this research project on memory and
      communication will have a positive effect on their patients with epilepsy.

    <description>All brain surgery candidates receive a neuropsychological assessment before and after surgery (9-12 months after surgery). This is the standard of care for all brain surgery patients. The results of this assessment and will be used in this research study. In addition, patients who agree to participate in the study will receive cognitive screening and a music therapy evaluation prior to surgery (Baseline 1). These evaluations will also be given within 3 days of epilepsy surgery (Baseline 2), 8 weeks after surgery (Baseline 3), and 9-12 months after surgery (Baseline 4.)</description>

These evaluations will also be given within 3 days of epilepsy surgery (Baseline 2), 8 weeks after surgery (Baseline 3), and 9-12 months after surgery (Baseline 4.) Pre-study and post-study scores from the neuropsychological assessments will be compared to determine if music therapy has a significant effect on the child's cognitive recovery. Will consist of meeting with the music therapists, Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS), or Child Life Assistants (CLA) for music therapy (treatment group) for about 45 minutes, twice per week, for Weeks 1-8. CThe Music Therapy group will partake in interventions such as singing and playing musical instruments.</description>
