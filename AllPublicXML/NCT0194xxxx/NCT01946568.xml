      A phase one study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin in pediatric patients
      aged 3 months to 11 years (inclusive) following the intravenous administration of a single
      dose of dalbavancin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a open label, multi center study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of a single dose of intravenous dalbavancin in hospitalized pediatric patients
      with known or suspected bacterial infection. Patients will be enrolled and results will be
      evaluated in 3 age cohorts as follows:

      Cohort 1: Patients 6 years to 11 years of age, inclusive; Cohort 2: Patients 2 years to &lt;6
      years of age; Cohort 3: Patients 3 months to &lt;2 years of age.

      All patients in each cohort will be administered a single dose of dalbavancin in addition to
      background anti infective treatment to be chosen by the investigator according to standard of
      care. Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained at various timepoints. Dalbavancin can be
      administered at any time (before, during or after) the standard of care therapy.

             in hearing deficits, or significant noise exposure.

          -  Significant exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics or chemotherapy currently or within
             a week prior to enrollment into the study or current use of loop diuretics.

          -  Patients continuing on vancomycin treatment or are anticipated to begin vancomycin or
             other glycopeptide treatment during the 7 day period after dalbavancin administration.

             their underlying disease. Aminotransferases (AST, ALT) &gt;5 x ULN; total bilirubin and
             alkaline phosphatase) &gt;2 x ULN.

          -  Albumin &lt; half lower limit of normal or physical exam evidence of malnutrition.

             than 32 weeks.

          -  Positive urine (or serum) pregnancy test at screening (post menarchal females only) or

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
