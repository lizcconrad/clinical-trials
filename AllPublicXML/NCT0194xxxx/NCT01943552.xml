      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre
      trial.The trial aims to evaluate efficacy of nebulized ipratropium bromide in Chinese

    <measure>Change of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) From Pre-bronchodilator at Baseline to Post-nebulization One Day Before the Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Treatment day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Change of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from pre-bronchodilator at baseline to post-nebulization one day before the surgery (Treatment day 3). Measurements of FEV1 were performed using calibrated electronic spirometers. Equipment and techniques should conform to American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (P05-12782). At screening visit, pulmonary function testing (PFT) was performed at baseline and repeated 30 minutes following inhalation of 4 puffs of salbutamol hydrofluoroalkanes metered-dose inhaler (HFA MDI). At treatment day 3, pulmonary function testing was performed 60 minutes following the inhalation of investigational drug. Spirometry was conducted with the patient in a seated position having abstained from medications. The best of three efforts was defined as the highest FEV1 each obtained on any of three efforts meeting the ATS criteria and it was selected regardless of whether they came from different spirometric manoeuvres or the same manoeuvre.</description>

    <description>Number of patients with at least one main post-operative pulmonary complications (including pneumonia, atelectasis and acute respiratory failure) within three weeks after the surgery. Post-operative pneumonia was defined by the presence of the following criteria: persistent lung infiltrate on chest X-ray or chest computerized tomography (CT)-scan, white blood cell count &gt;10,000 /mm3 and fever. Post-operative atelectasis was diagnosed by presence of atelectasis affecting one lobe or several lobes in chest X-ray test or chest CT-scan. Post-operative acute respiratory failure was defined by the presence of: PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg and/or PaCO2 &gt; 50 mmHg while breathing air or other evidences which were considered as respiratory failure by investigators.</description>

        <title>Change of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) From Pre-bronchodilator at Baseline to Post-nebulization One Day Before the Surgery</title>
        <description>Change of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from pre-bronchodilator at baseline to post-nebulization one day before the surgery (Treatment day 3). Measurements of FEV1 were performed using calibrated electronic spirometers. Equipment and techniques should conform to American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (P05-12782). At screening visit, pulmonary function testing (PFT) was performed at baseline and repeated 30 minutes following inhalation of 4 puffs of salbutamol hydrofluoroalkanes metered-dose inhaler (HFA MDI). At treatment day 3, pulmonary function testing was performed 60 minutes following the inhalation of investigational drug. Spirometry was conducted with the patient in a seated position having abstained from medications. The best of three efforts was defined as the highest FEV1 each obtained on any of three efforts meeting the ATS criteria and it was selected regardless of whether they came from different spirometric manoeuvres or the same manoeuvre.</description>

        <description>Number of patients with at least one main post-operative pulmonary complications (including pneumonia, atelectasis and acute respiratory failure) within three weeks after the surgery. Post-operative pneumonia was defined by the presence of the following criteria: persistent lung infiltrate on chest X-ray or chest computerized tomography (CT)-scan, white blood cell count &gt;10,000 /mm3 and fever. Post-operative atelectasis was diagnosed by presence of atelectasis affecting one lobe or several lobes in chest X-ray test or chest CT-scan. Post-operative acute respiratory failure was defined by the presence of: PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg and/or PaCO2 &gt; 50 mmHg while breathing air or other evidences which were considered as respiratory failure by investigators.</description>
