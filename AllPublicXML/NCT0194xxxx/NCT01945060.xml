      The purpose of this study is to see if the Artificial Pancreas (AP) Platform can successfully
      control blood sugar in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus on insulin pump therapy in a
      hospital setting. Investigators will also be studying to see if the heart rate informed
      Control To Range (hrCTR) can improve the performance of the system during and immediately
      after exercise.

    <textblock>
      The artificial pancreas (AP), known as Closed-Loop Control of blood glucose in diabetes, is a
      system combining a continuous glucose monitor (glucose sensor), a control algorithm (complex
      mathematical formulas), and an insulin pump. The algorithms are intended to maintain your
      blood glucose level within a certain range. This is called Control-to-Range. The algorithms
      are intended to maintain your blood glucose level within a certain range. The algorithms run
      on a portable AP platform on an Android smart phone, called the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs)
      Medical Platform.

      In this study, researchers hypothesize that the heart rate informed Control To Range (hrCTR)
      will limit the risk for hypo and hyperglycemia during and immediately after exercise in
      adolescents 12 - 17 years of age and assess if the hrCTR will improve additional measures of
      overall short term glycemic control in this population.

      This trial will be performed at both Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of
      Virginia. IRB approvals have been obtained at both institutions.
