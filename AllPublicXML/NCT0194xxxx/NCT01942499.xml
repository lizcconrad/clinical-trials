  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that individuals living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) demonstrate significant improvements following a formal rehabilitation program. The
      problem lies in the fact that these functional improvements diminish over a 12 month period.
      This decline in function is associated with decreased participation, a decline in health
      status, and an increased need to access the healthcare system. The objective of this project
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of a post-rehabilitation community-based exercise program
      for individuals with COPD and compare the outcomes with those achieved through standard care.

      Individuals with COPD who have completed a previous rehabilitation program will be enrolled
      in the study. Study participants will be assigned randomly to either a year-long community
      exercise program or usual care. Those assigned to the community program will exercise twice
      weekly at a local community centre supervised by trained fitness instructors. A case manager
      will facilitate the transition from the hospital rehabilitation program to the community
      centre. The case manager will also be available to participants and instructors for consult
      as needed. Continuing to build on an established partnership with the City of Toronto, the
      case manager will ensure fitness instructors receive specialized training in order to
      properly supervise and support the individuals with COPD. Participants assigned to usual care
      group will receive standard care by their family physician and respiratory specialist.
      Functional status will be evaluated before the program begins and again at 6-months and
      1-year. The outcome of each group will be compared to determine the effectiveness of the
      community exercise program. It is hypothesized that individuals who participate in the
      community exercise program will have better function and quality of life versus those
      individuals who receive standard care.
