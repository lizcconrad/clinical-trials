    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot evaluation of a parent-child mediation program
      for at-risk youth. It is investigating whether families who receive parent-child mediation
      show greater improvement in family functioning, as well as adolescent substance use, academic
      performance, and delinquency, over a 6-week and 12-week period compared to a wait-list
      control sample.

    <description>Family mediation is a method of resolving conflicts between parents and teens. During the mediation session, the parent and teen each meet one-on-one with a trained volunteer mediator, who is a neutral person who listens to each party's concerns without taking sides. Then the parent and teen come together and meet with this mediator to work on resolving conflicts they are having. Families participate in up to 3 mediation sessions.</description>
