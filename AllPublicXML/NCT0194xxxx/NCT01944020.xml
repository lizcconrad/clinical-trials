    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete
      loss of airflow during sleep, due to narrowing or closure of the upper airway. The resulting
      hypoxia has many cardiometabolic consequences, and leads to a disruption of sleep quality
      including reductions in the expression of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep
      (SWS). Patients also frequently experience excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), which, when
      present with OSA, defines the clinical entity OSA syndrome (OSAS). Obesity is the leading
      risk factor for the development of OSA. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the
      disorder itself may contribute to further weight gain, presenting a vicious cycle wherein OSA
      and obesity perpetuate each other. OSAS may promote weight gain by placing patients in a
      state of positive energy balance characterized by low levels of physical activity and
      disrupted patterns of appetite-regulating hormones. Continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP), the gold-standard treatment of OSAS, may improve energy balance in these patients,
      although this has not yet been adequately studied. The current proposal will investigate the
      effects of 2 months of CPAP on energy balance and cardiovascular risk in obese patients with
      moderate-to-severe OSA and EDS. Patients will be instructed to use CPAP at home each night
      throughout the 2-month treatment phases. At baseline and at the conclusion of the 2-month
      treatment phase, the investigators will measure levels of free-living physical activity,
      sleepiness, sleep quality, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, appetite-regulating
      hormones, hunger, and ad libitum food intake. It is hypothesized that active compared to sham
      CPAP treatment will result in improvements in energy balance, including increased physical
      activity, reductions in abnormally high levels of circulating leptin levels, and reductions
      in hunger, food intake, and cardiovascular risk factors. These improvements are hypothesized
      to be associated with increases in the expression of REM sleep and SWS, and reduced EDS as a
      result of CPAP.

      This study investigates the effects of 2 mo of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on
      physical activity, energy intake (EI), and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight/obese
      patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and excessive daytime
      sleepiness (EDS). Following pre-experimental baseline measures, patients will be instructed
      to use CPAP at home each night throughout the 2 mo treatment phase. Before and after the 2 mo
      treatment phase, patients will undergo a 1-d in-lab testing period at the Clinical Research
      Resource (CRR) at Columbia University Medical Center. Upon completion of the laboratory phase
      1, patients will return home for a 2 mo treatment period, followed by the second tracking
      period including laboratory visit 2.

      At the conclusion of the 2 mo treatment phase, patients will enter the laboratory at the
      Columbia University Medical Center for a 1-d period. Patients will arrive at ~0800 h and will
      remain in the laboratory for the following 24 h. Blood will be sampled in the fasting state
      in the morning, and will be assayed for select appetite-regulating hormones (leptin, ghrelin,
      adiponectin, glucagon-like peptide-1). We will al,so assess body composition. During the
      laboratory day, ad libitum EI will be measured for each treatment phase. Breakfast, lunch,
      snack, and dinner will be served at the standard times, but each meal item will be served in
      excess such that patients will be able to eat as much or as little of each food as they
      choose. Additional snack choices will also be freely available during the wake episode.
