    <description>Collect pilot data on the performance of the ICARS in patients younger than 10 years of age, as well as to introduce definitions for the various clinically defined stages of AT, and attempt to develop descriptors of change that could help in the assessment of patients longitudinally.</description>

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Patients aged 6-18 years with diagnosed with ataxia, preferably AT will be included.
             The diagnosis of AT will be made based on the criteria: typical clinical picture plus
             one of the following: 1. a proven mutation in the ATM gene 2. Deficient ATM protein
             proven by Western blotting 3. Elevated α-fetoprotein, cerebellar atrophy on MRI and
             immune deficiency/ chromosomal breakage/ T- cell lymphoreticular malignancy.

          2. Children aged 6-18 years with suspected AT (fulfilling partially the above criteria
             will be included)

          3. Children aged 6-18 years with AT like disease, with or without proven mutation in the
             MRE11 gene will be included

          4. Children aged 6-18 years of age with ataxia of other known or unknown etiologies might
             be included, but their total number should not exceed 20% of the cohort in each site
