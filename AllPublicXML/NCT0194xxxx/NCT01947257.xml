  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measure of the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is a very useful index in intensive care
      to estimate right ventricular after load. The reference technique for this measure is the
      right catheterism which is an invasive technique. It is possible to estimate the pulmonary
      artery pressure by using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) which allows, using the
      continuous Doppler, the measure of maximum speed of tricuspid regurgitation (TRvmax). The
      measure of the TRvmax can however be difficult for intensive care patients with little
      echogenicity or impossible for those having no tricuspid leak. The evaluation of the
      tricuspid regurgitation is also particularly difficult using TOE. To avoid these drawbacks,
      one can use the analysis of the pulmonary ejection in the pulmonary artery (PAAT) with TOE.
      However, the data of the literature are controversial on this method and it was not validated
      in mechanically ventilated intensive care patients.

      The aim of this work is to compare three methods of measure of the PAP: the measure TRVMAX
      (by means of the tricuspid leak) by transthoracic echocardiography, the measure of the TAAP
      by transesophageal ultrasound and the direct measure of the pulmonary pressures by right
      catheterization, in ventilated patients already monitored with a catheter in the right
      cavities for usual indications in intensive care (ARDS, shock). We shall analyze then the
      correlation between the TRVmax, the TAAP and the pressures measured by the right catheterism
      which serves as reference technique.
