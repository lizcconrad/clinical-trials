  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) has become a well-established treatment for patients with
      fecal incontinence since 1995. The mechanism of action of SNS is still not fully understood
      but recent studies have shown changes in both colonic motility and rectal sensibility. We
      have previously shown IBS patients to benefit from sacral nerves stimulation. With the
      present study, we aim to evaluate if subsensory sacral nerve stimulation is as effective as
      suprasensory sacral nerve stimulation.

      Twenty four patients with IBS-D or IBS-M according to the ROME III criteria, will be enrolled
      in the study.

      Having meet inclusion criteria, the patients are randomised to receive either OFF-subsensory
      or subsensory-OFF stimulation in a 2+2-week period followed by 2 weeks of suprasensory
      stimulation. Hereby rendering a percutaneous nerve evaluation (PNE) test of a total of 6
      weeks.

      During the PNE test the effect of the stimulation is evaluated by specific IBS symptom and
      quality of life questionnaires (GSRS-IBS and IBS-IS) and bowel habit diaries.
