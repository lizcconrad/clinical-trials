    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to collect feasibility and acceptability of an internet
      mindfulness meditation intervention for older adults and to collect preliminary data on mood
      and cognition changes from before to after the intervention. Up to 32 older adults will be
      randomized to receive a mindfulness meditation intervention or a time and attention control,
      both delivered over the internet (16 completers). Participants will have a one-hour session
      weekly for six weeks with daily home practice between sessions. Participants will complete
      the sessions online with a study iPad. Their home practice will also be installed on the
      study iPad as well as an objective adherence monitoring program that the investigators
      developed to track actual home practice between sessions. The feasibility and acceptability
      measures are enrollment rate, completion rate, and participant satisfaction. Self-report mood
      questionnaires and cognitive tasks will be measured before and after the intervention period
      and data used to conduct power analyses and sample size estimation for a larger clinical
      trial.

    <description>One session per week for 6 weeks online through study iPAD. The intervention is a standardized and structured program. The objectives are to: 1) help participants understand their personal reactions to stress, 2) teach them skills to modify their stress reactions, and 3) promote their desire for self-care and feelings of competence and mastery.</description>

    <description>A standardized and structured program based on Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction and has been piloted in our laboratory.Each session included 1) discussion on stress, relaxation, meditation, and mind-body interaction, 2) instruction and practice in formal and informal MM, and 3) enquiry about problem-solving techniques regarding success and difficulty in practicing mindfulness. Formal meditation instruction included a mindful Body Scan and Sitting Meditation (awareness of breath, body sensations, cognitive and emotional processes). Informal practice of mindful daily activities (e.g., washing dishes) was also taught to generalize mindfulness beyond the formal meditations. A 3-minute meditation was offered as a quick coping strategy, and it could be practiced with or without a guided recording.</description>

    <description>The Education control was matched for session time and home practice. The internet sessions included a general health video and questions about the material. For home practice, the participants listened to podcasts about the same topic. The session topics were 1) Healthy Eating, 2) Healthy Exercise, 3) Healthy Sleep, 4) Healthy Brain, 5) Healthy Mood, and 6) Community Involvement.</description>
