  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WiiNWALK is a 4 week physical activity, with the intervention of a WiiFit, targeted to
      improve walking capacity in individuals with either a unilateral below-knee or above-knee
      amputation. This is a randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the WiiNWALK
      program in older (50+ years) community living adults with lower limb amputations (LLA).

      Hypothesis: We expect the WiiNWALK intervention will have a treatment effect with improvement
      in functional walking capacity, compared to the control group who will only be playing
      cognitive games. Secondarily, a functional walking capacity will also include an improvement
      in lower extremity strength and balance, inter-limb gait symmetry, balance confidence along
      with participation in daily and social activities, locomotor capabilities and an increase in
      physical activities.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation (LLA) is prevalent among older Canadians. Estimates from 2003 suggest
      that &gt; 2 million individuals were living with LLA in North America with an annual estimated
      150,000 incident cases. Over 50% of these procedures are considered major, with 28% of
      individuals having a transtibial (TT) or below knee amputation and 26% having a transfemoral
      (TF) or above knee amputation. The WiiNWalk is designed to evaluate whether this intervention
      does improve the walking capacity of older adults through a series of balancing and other
      physical activities using the Wii balance board.

      An improved walking capacity (ie: being able to walk a longer distance) may effect balance,
      strength, and fitness components that are critical to improve prosthetic walking. The ability
      to walk a longer distance may effect a person's lifestyle as it allows the individual to move
      around his/her environment independently which in turn impacts ones choice of daily and
      social activities and participation, and therefore providing them with more mobility, freedom
      and choice.

      This study focuses on older adults because, according to Canadian Institute of Health
      Information data, 50-74 year old were 17 times more likely to have a LLA and individuals aged
      ≥ 75 were 36 times more likely to have a LLA.The primary reason for this exponential
      age-related increased incidence is the late stage effects of chronic diseases such as
      diabetes and vascular disease that are common in older adults.

      If as anticipated, the WiiFit proves to increase walking capacity, it will provide a low cost
      method for those with LLA to have an accessible system that, due to the weight-shifting,
      balance and aerobic training nature of the Wii games, will serve as a therapeutic agent for
      rehabilitation.

    <measure>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (1 month after baseline), 3 week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a self-report measure that captures information on the frequency, duration, and intensity of various physical activities. The 10 item PASE is generally partitioned into two parts. Part one, Leisure Time Activity, has six items that capture information about individual's involvement in daily activities such as participating in light exercise during the past seven days. The response options are never, seldom, sometimes, or often. Information on the type and the average time spent engaging in the activity per day is also captured.
Part two, Household Activity, has three yes/no items which ask about participation in daily activities such as dusting or washing dishes over the past week. The last question asks about involvement in paid or volunteer work over the past week. The PASE also asks about the number of hours per week as well as the amount of physical activity involved for the job or volunteer work.</description>

    <description>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) will be used to measure subjects' lower extremity function by scoring their ability to perform four tasks: double-leg standing balance (feet together, semi-tandem, tandem), single-leg standing balance, gait speed over 4 meters, and lower extremity strength (5x chair stands). Each task is scored from 0 (poor) to 4 (excellent). A total score will be generated by adding up the scores for individual tasks. We will look at overall and balance component scores.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Intervention (1 month after baseline), 3 week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>The Four Square Step Test (FSST) will measure dynamic standing balance. Four canes are placed on the floor to create 4 squares. The subject will step in each square as fast as possible and with use of his/her walking aid if needed. At the end of the test, the subject would have moved forward, backward, left and right while stepping over low objects. It also involves multiple transfer of weight between feet while changing direction. This test is timed and faster times indicate better dynamic standing balance.</description>

The difference in time (to the nearest second) to complete the simple and complex walks is calculated with higher differences suggesting poorer ability to cope with dual tasks (e.g., greater need to focus on walking).</description>

    <description>The Cognitive Games group will receive 40 minute supervised group training three times per week for a period of four weeks. The group for the first week will be held at the clinic, while the remaining three weeks be conducted at the subject's home and supervised by the Trainer remotely using a tablet with video conferencing capability. At the end of the four-week Supervised Phase, subjects will retain the Wii units and they will be encouraged to use the program on their own for an additional period of four weeks (Unsupervised Phase).
Subjects in the control group will play cognitive oriented video games using Wii Big Brain Academy Degree program. BigBrain™ is a video gaming system which has games and exercises to improve cognitive function(identify, memorize, analyze, compute, and visualize). Subjects use the Wii handheld remote to participate in the games by pointing and clicking the remote to select on-screen answers in response to on-screen questions.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will also receive 40 minute supervised group training three times per week for a period of four weeks. Interventions conducted over the first week will be held at the clinic, while the remaining three weeks be conducted at the subject's home and supervised by the Trainer remotely. At the end of the four-week Supervised Phase, subjects will retain the Wii units and they will be encouraged to use the program on their own for an additional period of four weeks (Unsupervised Phase).
The WiiNWALK protocol consists of performing Nintendo WiiFit activities. Subjects stand on the WiiFit balance board and interact with the WiiFit games through weight shifting or by using the Wii handheld remote control. The intervention protocol will include selected exercises consisting of: 1) Yoga 2) Balance Tasks 3) Strength training and 4) Aerobics.
At the in-clinic sessions in Vancouver, a motion-sensing device will also record video and skeleton data of the participant.</description>
