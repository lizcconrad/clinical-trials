      Primary Aim. The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of intradialytic massage on
      the frequency and severity of cramping among hemodialysis patients prone to lower extremity
      cramping during treatment.

      Hypothesis: Compared to control patients, intervention patients will be significantly less
      likely to have intradialytic cramping that requires staff intervention or treatment
      termination.

      This is a study involving 32 (16 intervention, 16 control) hemodialysis patients with
      frequent lower extremity cramps during treatment. Frequent cramping during dialysis
      treatments is defined as 1 or more episodes of lower extremity cramps during or after
      dialysis over the previous 2 weeks. Cramping frequency will be determined by chart notes.
      Muscle cramping is defined as contraction of the large muscle group of the lower extremities
      sufficiently painful to require intervention by the dialysis staff for relief.

      The intervention group will receive a 20 minute massage of the lower extremities by a trained
      and licensed massage therapist during each treatment (3x per week) for 2 weeks. The control
      group will receive usual care by dialysis center staff.

    <description>The intervention group will receive a 20 minute massage during each hemodialysis treatment for 2 weeks. Most patients receive dialysis 3 times per week resulting in 6 massage sessions. The massage will include both feet and legs up to and including the knee. Massage will include general light centripetal friction and point compression to bellies and myotendinous junction of muscles of the foot and calf not to exceed a perceived pain of 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being most severe and 1 being no pain.</description>
