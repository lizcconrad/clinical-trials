    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigation is to compare two catheter lock solutions (TaurolockTMHep100
      and Heparin 100 IE/ml), on the occurence of catheter related blood stream infection, in
      patients with intestinal failure and a central venous access device for home parenteral
      nutrition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with long-term intestinal failure are dependent on Home Parenteral Nutrition(HPN)
      delivered through a central venous access device(CVAD), placed as a subcutaneous tunneled
      catheter(Broviac). Catheter Related Blood Stream Infections(CRBSI) is a frequent complication
      leading to increased morbidity, hospital admissions, cost, and risk of repeated replacement
      of their tunneled catheter. The infections often originate from contamination of the catheter
      hub, and growth of microorganisms on the inner lumen of the catheter imbedded in a biofilm.
      To prevent infections good hygiene guidelines and the use of a catheter lock solution is
      applied.

      The primary objective is to compare two catheter lock solutions, TaurolockTMHep100 and
      Heparin 100 IE/ml, on the occurence of CRBSI. The secondary objectives are to compare the two
      devices according to other efficacy parameters, time to infection, cost and resource utility,
      tolerability and safety.

      Patients with a prior high risk of CRBSI will be included. Patients will instill the solution
      in their CVAD after each infusion of HPN, varying between minimum twice per week to once
      daily, depending on their individual HPN programme.

      Before the blinded randomization the patients will be paired according to gender, age and
      prior infection risk.

      Duration of the instillation will be 24 month or until outcome(CRBSI) accure.

             condition)

          -  has significant cardiovascular disease such as unstable angina, recent acute
             myocardial infarction or recent cerebral vascular accident (within 6 weeks); a cardiac
             rhythm which in the investigators judgment may result in significant hemodynamic
             effects
