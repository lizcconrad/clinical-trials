  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the effect of Iota-Carrageenan treatment on
      cold symptoms. The effect of treatment on the duration of the cold and the patients viral
      load plus cytokine level indicating the inflammatory response will be analyzed.

    <measure>Total Symptom Score (TSS) Over Days 2 to 4 (TSS2-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The total symptom score (TSS) is the sum of the 8 single common cold symptom scores consisting of 3 systemic (headache, muscle ache and chilliness) and 5 local (sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough and sneezing) symptoms.
Each common cold symptom was scored on a 4-point ordinal scale:
0 = symptom not present
1 = mild symptom (I can feel it but it has not disturbed or irritated me)
2 = moderate symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me some of the time)
3 = severe symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me most of the time)
The mean over days 2 to 4 (TSS2-4) was calculated as (TSS2 + TSS3 + TSS4)/3 where TSS2, TSS3 and TSS4 are the total symptom scores calculated for days 2, 3 and 4 respectively. TSS2-4 ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 24 (severe symptoms).</description>

2 = moderate symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me some of the time)
3 = severe symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me most of the time)
The mean of the sum of 3 single systemic common cold symptom scores over days 2-4 was calculated as (SSS2 + SSS3 + SSS4)/3 where SSS2, SSS3 and SSS4 are the systemic common cold symptom scores calculated for days 2, 3 and 4 respectively. SSS2-4 ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (severe symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Mean of the Sum of 5 Single Local Common Cold Symptom Scores Mean Over Days 2 to 4 (LSS2-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The mean of the sum of 5 single local common cold symptom scores (sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough and sneezing).
Each common cold symptom was scored on a 4-point ordinal scale:
0 = symptom not present
1 = mild symptom (I can feel it but it has not disturbed or irritated me)
2 = moderate symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me some of the time)
3 = severe symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me most of the time)
The mean of the sum of 5 single local common cold symptom scores over days 2 to 4 was calculated as (LSS2 + LSS3 + LSS4)/3 where LSS2, LSS3 and LSS4 are the local common cold symptom scores calculated for days 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

    <description>The total symptom score (TSS) is the sum of the 8 single common cold symptom scores consisting of 3 systemic (headache, muscle ache and chilliness) and 5 local (sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough and sneezing) symptoms.

3 = severe symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me most of the time)
The Area under the curve (AUC) over the 10-day period for the total symptom score (AUC-TSS 1-10) was calculated as the sum of the TSS calculated on each day from day 1 to day 10. AUC-TSS 1-10 ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 270 (severe symptoms).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of the Cold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of the common cold was assessed by the question &quot;Do you still have a cold?&quot; at the end of each treatment day. The duration of the cold was defined as ended by the first day of a &quot;No&quot; answer to this daily question.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Overall Assessment of Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Patient overall assessment of efficacy was assessed by the question &quot;How effective was the treatment in relieving your common cold symptoms?&quot; at day 10. A 5-point scale was used (0=poor, 1=fair, 2=good, 3=very good, 4=excellent).</description>

             rating scale

             obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  Severe nasal septum deviation or other condition that could cause nasal obstruction
             such as the presence of nasal polyps.

             influence symptom scores

          -  Taking any prescribed medication other than for contraception, that is considered by
             the investigator as a reason for exclusion e.g. systemic steroids, intranasal
             medicines, antibiotics

          -  Common cold or flu like symptoms for more than 48 hours.

          -  Recent (within the previous 2 days) intake of a common cold medicine that in the

        <title>Total Symptom Score (TSS) Over Days 2 to 4 (TSS2-4)</title>
        <description>The total symptom score (TSS) is the sum of the 8 single common cold symptom scores consisting of 3 systemic (headache, muscle ache and chilliness) and 5 local (sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough and sneezing) symptoms.
Each common cold symptom was scored on a 4-point ordinal scale:
0 = symptom not present
1 = mild symptom (I can feel it but it has not disturbed or irritated me)
2 = moderate symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me some of the time)
3 = severe symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me most of the time)
The mean over days 2 to 4 (TSS2-4) was calculated as (TSS2 + TSS3 + TSS4)/3 where TSS2, TSS3 and TSS4 are the total symptom scores calculated for days 2, 3 and 4 respectively. TSS2-4 ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 24 (severe symptoms).</description>
        <time_frame>Days 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set (FAS) which included all randomised patients who used at least one dose of trial treatment, who provided a baseline total symptom score (TSS) as well as any post-treatment data for the primary endpoint.</population>

          <title>Total Symptom Score (TSS) Over Days 2 to 4 (TSS2-4)</title>
          <description>The total symptom score (TSS) is the sum of the 8 single common cold symptom scores consisting of 3 systemic (headache, muscle ache and chilliness) and 5 local (sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough and sneezing) symptoms.
Each common cold symptom was scored on a 4-point ordinal scale:
0 = symptom not present
1 = mild symptom (I can feel it but it has not disturbed or irritated me)
2 = moderate symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me some of the time)
3 = severe symptom (symptom has disturbed and irritated me most of the time)
The mean over days 2 to 4 (TSS2-4) was calculated as (TSS2 + TSS3 + TSS4)/3 where TSS2, TSS3 and TSS4 are the total symptom scores calculated for days 2, 3 and 4 respectively. TSS2-4 ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 24 (severe symptoms).</description>
          <population>Full analysis set (FAS) which included all randomised patients who used at least one dose of trial treatment, who provided a baseline total symptom score (TSS) as well as any post-treatment data for the primary endpoint.</population>
