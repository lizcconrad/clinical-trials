    <textblock>
      Objectives: 1) Determine the effect of 4-weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and
      free acid form β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB-FA) on VO2peak, lactate threshold, critical
      power, anaerobic working capacity and neuromuscular economy in a population of endurance
      trained individuals. 2) Determine the effect of 4-weeks of HIIT and HMB-FA on changes in
      skeletal muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA=Volume/Fascicle length) and muscle
      quality (MQ=echo intensity) in the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis.

      Subjects: Fifty males and females between the ages of 18 - 35 will be recruited to
      participate in this study. Subject will be randomized to one of three groups: a control group
      (CTL), an HIIT only group (HIIT) or a group which will take the amino acid metabolite HMB and
      perform HIIT (HMB-HIIT). Individuals assigned to CTL will undergo baseline testing. They will
      then be asked to continue their normal exercise routine for 4 weeks and will undergo
      post-testing after this time period.

      Study Protocol: Two testing sessions, on nonconsecutive days, will occur at least 72 hours
      prior to the start of the training period. The same testing protocols will be repeated at the
      end of the 4-week training period. Testing protocols include performance testing (VO2peak,
      lactate threshold, critical power, anaerobic working capacity and neuromuscular economy) and
      anthropometric measures (physiological cross-sectional area and muscle quality). The training
      protocol for individuals in the experimental groups will consist of 4-weeks of high intensity
      interval training with three sessions per week on an electronically braked cycle ergometer.
      Individual work -loads will be calculated based on the outcomes from each participant's
      preliminary testing.

    <measure>EMG Activity Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after four weeks of high intensity interval training</time_frame>
    <description>To assess EMG activity, a bipolar surface electrode arrangement will be placed over the muscles of the quadriceps. The EMG signals will be expressed as root mean square (RMS) amplitude values. During the leg extensor trial, electromyography (EMG) root mean square (RMS) amplitude values will be recorded</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline after four weeks of high intensity interval training</time_frame>
    <description>Skeletal muscle images will be collected of the thigh muscles. These images will provide an ability to rate the quality of the leg muscles and determine the physiological cross-sectional area of the muscle</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline after four weeks of high intensity interval training</time_frame>
    <description>To obtain the maximum isometric strength (kilograms) participants will be positioned in a BioDex S4 isometric dynamometer in a seated position. The participants will then be instructed to exert their maximum strength when trying to extend the knee and to produce the strength as fast as possible.</description>
