      gastric banding in prospective clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical trial comparing experimental plicated adjustable gastric
      banding versus standard adjustable gastric banding. All enrolled patients will choose to
      either standard (control group) banding or plication (study group) banding. Each patient will
      complete a standardized survey rating their satisfaction from surgery, their satiety levels
      and Green Zone Patient Questionnaire at each visit.
