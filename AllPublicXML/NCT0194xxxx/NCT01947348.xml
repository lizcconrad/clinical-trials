  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with SVF (Stromal Vascular Fraction)
      has an effect on pain and inflammation associated with Osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-randomized, clinical study of 30 patients to determine safety and
      treatment potential of A3(Adult Autologous Adipose) SVF for the pain and inflammation
      associated with Osteoarthritis.

      Patients will be treated for Osteoarthritis due to degeneration or chronic injury. They will
      be given autologous SVF extract derived by the A3 method mixed with activated platelets from
      a PRP(platelet rich plasma) preparation as direct injections to the effected joints. Outcomes
      will be tracked with WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index),
      AUSCAN(Australian Hand Osteoarthritis Index) scores, and a general blood panel in order to
      evaluate systemic effects.
