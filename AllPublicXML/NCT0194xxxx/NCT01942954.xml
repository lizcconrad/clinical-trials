  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consequences of alcohol dependence are severe and may range from physical diseases to
      neuropsychological deficits in several cognitive domains. Alcohol abuse has also been related
      to brain dysfunction specifically in the prefrontal cortex. To assess these deficits and the
      application of a novel approach of cognitive stimulation to alcoholics, we have carried out a
      neuropsychological intervention program with mobile health technology. Patients diagnosed
      with alcohol dependence syndrome were submitted to cognitive stimulation during four weeks in
      a three-day/week basis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Only patients that scored higher than the cutoff values for their age on the Mini Mental
        Examination Test and with no clinical scores on the Symptoms Checklist Revised were
        included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with dependency from substances other than alcohol or with history of previous
        neurological disorders were excluded from the study. Patients were also screened for
        minimal computer literacy; no patients were excluded due to lack of this criterion.
