      A study in children ages 8 to 12 to assess EVO cognitive game play. The study examines two
      populations, children diagnosed with ADHD (ADHD and not on medication) and neuro-typical
      children. The investigators plan to evaluate 80 subjects (N = 40 per group) in three site
      locations over a 29 day study period. The 29 day study period includes 2 in-clinic sessions
      and 27 days of out-patient game play. During the 27 days of out-patient game play, the
      subjects will be instructed to play EVO 5 days per week for typically 30 minutes per day

      The investigators' hypothesis is that EVO will be playable and interesting to ADHD children
      and cognitive measures, as captured by EVO, will show a difference between ADHD children and
      age-matched neuro-typical children.

    <measure>Reaction Time in EVO Gameplay</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>EVO employs a perceptual discrimination attention/memory task as well as a continuous visuomotor &quot;driving&quot; task. Subjects were instructed to target a pre-specified stimulus, and ignore all other stimuli while navigating a road-like course. Reaction time was measured as the time between the initial presentation of the pre-specified target and when the subject tapped the tablet screen. Longer reaction times indicated a larger deficit in multitasking.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Spent Completing the Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time spent on completing the intervention is based on the prescribed therapy of 800 total minutes, or 13.3 hours, over the course of 28 days (7 sessions of EVO per day for 5 days per week for 4 weeks with each session lasting approximately 5.7 minutes long).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean of Differences in TOVA Attention Performance Index (API) at Baseline (Day 0) and at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>TOVA API is a comparison of the subject's scores based on selected measures that persons with an independent diagnosis of ADHD frequently demonstrated. The API is calculated from variability, response time, and D' (D Prime) using the following formula:
API = Response Time Z score (Half 1) + D' Z score (Half 2) + Variability Z score (Total) + 1.80
where Response Time is the average time it takes to respond correctly to a target, d' (D Prime) score is a response discriminability score reflecting the ratio of hits to &quot;false alarms&quot;, and Variability is a measure of consistency of speed of responding based on the standard deviation of the mean correct response times. API tells how similar the score is to the ADHD profile. A score of less than -1.8 indicates that the subject had similar performance to a normative ADHD population. A lower score indicates a more severe ADHD profile.
The calculation for difference in TOVA API was API at Baseline (Day 0) minus API at Day 28.</description>

        <title>Reaction Time in EVO Gameplay</title>
        <description>EVO employs a perceptual discrimination attention/memory task as well as a continuous visuomotor “driving” task. Subjects were instructed to target a pre-specified stimulus, and ignore all other stimuli while navigating a road-like course. Reaction time was measured as the time between the initial presentation of the pre-specified target and when the subject tapped the tablet screen. Longer reaction times indicated a larger deficit in multitasking.</description>

        <title>Mean of Differences in TOVA Attention Performance Index (API) at Baseline (Day 0) and at Day 28</title>
        <description>TOVA API is a comparison of the subject's scores based on selected measures that persons with an independent diagnosis of ADHD frequently demonstrated. The API is calculated from variability, response time, and D' (D Prime) using the following formula:
API = Response Time Z score (Half 1) + D’ Z score (Half 2) + Variability Z score (Total) + 1.80
where Response Time is the average time it takes to respond correctly to a target, d’ (D Prime) score is a response discriminability score reflecting the ratio of hits to “false alarms”, and Variability is a measure of consistency of speed of responding based on the standard deviation of the mean correct response times. API tells how similar the score is to the ADHD profile. A score of less than -1.8 indicates that the subject had similar performance to a normative ADHD population. A lower score indicates a more severe ADHD profile.
The calculation for difference in TOVA API was API at Baseline (Day 0) minus API at Day 28.</description>
