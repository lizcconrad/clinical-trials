    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced gastric cancer have showed poor prognosis. Only 81% of the patients
      could underwent curative surgery. In those, about 60% of patients would survive after 5 years
      from the surgery. As a result, role of chemotherapy has been increased. In ACTS-GC trial, S-1
      adjuvant therapy after D2 gastrectomy increased overall survival rate in advanced gastric
      cancer patients. However, subgroup analysis showed that S-1 adjuvant therapy was insufficient
      in patients with stage III or IV (according to the AJCC 6th criteria) gastric cancer. In
      addition, CLASSIC trial demonstrated that oxaliplatin plus capecitabine adjuvant therapy
      could increase disease-free survival after D2 gastrectomy in advanced gastric cancer
      patients. Notwithstanding these trial, optimal adjuvant regimen of advanced gastric cancer
      has not been established. We aimed to evaluate efficacy of S-1 plus oxaliplatin as adjuvant
      chemotherapy after D2 gastrectomy in stage III (according to the AJCC 7th criteria) gastric
      cancer patients.
