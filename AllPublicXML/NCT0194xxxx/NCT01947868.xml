  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-interventional, single-arm, multicenter study in a real-world
      population to assess the clinically symptom improvement and quality of life (QoL) in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and positive EGFR mutation who receive EGFR-TKIs as
      the first-line treatment.

      The Primary Objective is to estimate symptom improvement rates in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC and positive EGFR mutation who receive EGFR-TKIs as the
      first-line treatment. A clinically meaningful improvement is defined as an increase from
      baseline of 2 or more points for LCS (Lung Cancer Scales) at Week 4.

      The Secondary Objectives are:

        1. To estimate symptom improvement rates at weeks 2 and 12

        2. To estimate mean change from baseline in overall QoL scores using the FACT-L instrument
           and LCS score at Week 2, 4 and 12.

        3. To estimate the proportion of patients exhibiting an LCS change of 7 points or more at
           weeks 2, 4 and 12.

        4. Subgroup information of symptom improvement rate, QoL and disease-related symptom scores
           by gender, smoking status, smoking pattern, WHO performance, number of metastatic sites,
           female/never smokers and patients with COPD at week 2, week 4 and week 12.
