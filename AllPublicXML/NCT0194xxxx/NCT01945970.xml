    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies indicate that regular consumption of three cups of black tea per day
      reduces the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. In a number of previous nutrition
      intervention studies tea has been shown to improve vascular function as assessed by Flow
      Mediated Dilation (FMD).

      The current study tests a specific Black tea extract against a placebo in population that has
      previously show to be sensitive to the effect of black tea on Flow Mediated dilation. A tea
      extract that has previously been shown to improve FMD is included as the positive control.

    <description>Flow mediated dilation (FMD) measurement included the following steps:
1 minute base scan to measure the baseline diameter of artery (Resting stage)
5 minutes of forearm occlusion at 300±30 mmHg (cuff occlusion stage), just below the elbow 2-5 cm from antecubital crease)
4 minutes FMD scan, which started immediately after release of occlusion (reactive hyperaemia stage)
When the artery had returned to baseline a second 1 minute scan was taken
25 µg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was given to the subject
5 minutes GTN scan to assess the endothelium-independent dilation FMD and response to GTN was calculated as maximal percent increase in diameter above baseline (mean value of measures obtained during 1 minute before cuff inflation).</description>

        <title>Flow Mediated Dilation, Acute-upon-chronic, Black Tea</title>
        <description>Flow mediated dilation (FMD) measurement included the following steps:
1 minute base scan to measure the baseline diameter of artery (Resting stage)
5 minutes of forearm occlusion at 300±30 mmHg (cuff occlusion stage), just below the elbow 2-5 cm from antecubital crease)
4 minutes FMD scan, which started immediately after release of occlusion (reactive hyperaemia stage)
When the artery had returned to baseline a second 1 minute scan was taken
25 µg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was given to the subject
5 minutes GTN scan to assess the endothelium-independent dilation FMD and response to GTN was calculated as maximal percent increase in diameter above baseline (mean value of measures obtained during 1 minute before cuff inflation).</description>

        <description>Flow mediated dilation (FMD) measurement included the following steps:
1 minute base scan to measure the baseline diameter of artery (Resting stage)
5 minutes of forearm occlusion at 300±30 mmHg (cuff occlusion stage), just below the elbow 2-5 cm from antecubital crease)
4 minutes FMD scan, which started immediately after release of occlusion (reactive hyperaemia stage)
When the artery had returned to baseline a second 1 minute scan was taken
25 µg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was given to the subject
5 minutes GTN scan to assess the endothelium-independent dilation FMD and response to GTN was calculated as maximal percent increase in diameter above baseline (mean value of measures obtained during 1 minute before cuff inflation).</description>

        <description>FMD measurement included the following steps:
1 minute base scan to measure the baseline diameter of artery (Resting stage)
5 minutes of forearm occlusion at 300±30 mmHg (cuff occlusion stage), just below the elbow 2-5 cm from antecubital crease)
4 minutes FMD scan, which started immediately after release of occlusion (reactive hyperaemia stage)
When the artery had returned to baseline a second 1 minute scan was taken
25 µg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was given to the subject
5 minutes GTN scan to assess the endothelium-independent dilation FMD and response to GTN was calculated as maximal percent increase in diameter above baseline (mean value of measures obtained during 1 minute before cuff inflation).</description>

          <description>Flow mediated dilation (FMD) measurement included the following steps:
1 minute base scan to measure the baseline diameter of artery (Resting stage)
5 minutes of forearm occlusion at 300±30 mmHg (cuff occlusion stage), just below the elbow 2-5 cm from antecubital crease)
4 minutes FMD scan, which started immediately after release of occlusion (reactive hyperaemia stage)
When the artery had returned to baseline a second 1 minute scan was taken
25 µg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was given to the subject
5 minutes GTN scan to assess the endothelium-independent dilation FMD and response to GTN was calculated as maximal percent increase in diameter above baseline (mean value of measures obtained during 1 minute before cuff inflation).</description>

        <title>Endothelium Independent Dilation, Acute, Positive Control</title>
        <description>Flow mediated dilation (FMD) measurement included the following steps:
1 minute base scan to measure the baseline diameter of artery (Resting stage)
5 minutes of forearm occlusion at 300±30 mmHg (cuff occlusion stage), just below the elbow 2-5 cm from antecubital crease)
4 minutes FMD scan, which started immediately after release of occlusion (reactive hyperaemia stage)
When the artery had returned to baseline a second 1 minute scan was taken
25 µg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was given to the subject
5 minutes GTN scan to assess the endothelium-independent dilation FMD and response to GTN was calculated as maximal percent increase in diameter above baseline (mean value of measures obtained during 1 minute before cuff inflation).</description>
