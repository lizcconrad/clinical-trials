    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies short-infusion ziv-aflibercept in treating patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer receiving combination chemotherapy. Ziv-aflibercept may stop the
      growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving the drug over a
      shorter infusion time may result in improved efficiency and patient satisfaction.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of a shorter infusion of 30 minutes and 15 minutes of
      standard dose ziv-aflibercept when combined with FOLFIRI (folinic acid [leucovorin calcium],
      fluorouracil, and irinotecan [irinotecan hydrochloride]) in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the institutional safety experience with this combination using Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 for toxicity grading.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 15-30 minutes followed by FOLFIFRI
      chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over
      90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
