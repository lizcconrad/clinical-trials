    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. TEAEs are AEs occurring between the first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after the last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Following AEs were considered as AEs of special interest: anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, stress cardiomyopathy, Gilbert's syndrome, gastrointestinal perforation, injection site erythema, injection site hypersensitivity, injection site irritation, injection site pruritus, arthritis bacterial, cellulitis, klebsiella infection, oral candidiasis, pneumonia, skin infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, alanine aminotransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased, brain neoplasm malignant, and urticaria.</description>

          <description>DAS28-ESR is calculated from the TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in millimeters per hour (mm/hour) and PtGDA assessed on 0-10 cm VAS. Higher scores indicate greater affectation due to disease activity. DAS28-ESR total score= 0-9.4. DAS28-ESR &lt;/=3.2 indicates low disease activity, DAS28-ESR &gt;3.2 to 5.1 indicates moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-ESR &lt;/=3.2 indicates remission.</description>

        <description>DAS28-ESR is calculated from the TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, the ESR in mm/hour and PtGDA. DAS28-ESR total score= 0-9.4. Higher scores indicate greater affectation due to disease activity. The CDAI is a numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGDA and PGDA assessed on 0-10 cm VAS. CDAI total score = 0-76. Higher scores represent greater affectation due to disease activity. Correlation coefficient for relationship between DAS28-ESR and CDAI at different time points is reported. Correlation coefficient value range= -1 to 1. Higher positive value indicates greater positive relationship and higher negative value indicates greater negative relationship.</description>

        <title>Association Between Disease Activity Parameters: CDAI and SDAI, Assessed Using Correlation Coefficient</title>
        <description>The CDAI is a numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGDA and PGDA assessed on 0-10 cm VAS. CDAI total score = 0-76. Higher scores represent greater affectation due to disease activity. SDAI is a numerical sum of 5 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGDA and PGDA assessed on 0-10 cm VAS and CRP in mg/dL. SDAI total score= 0-86. Higher scores indicate greater affectation due to disease activity. Correlation coefficient for relationship between CDAI and SDAI at different time points is reported. Correlation coefficient value range= -1 to 1. Higher positive value indicates greater positive relationship and higher negative value indicates greater negative relationship.</description>

        <title>Association Between Disease Activity Parameter (DAS28-ESR) and Treatment Response Parameter (EULAR), Assessed Using Regression Coefficient</title>
        <description>DAS28-ESR is calculated from the TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, the ESR in mm/hour and PtGDA. DAS28-ESR total score= 0-9.4. EULAR response criteria (based on DAS28 score): Good responders (change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &lt;/=3.2); Moderate responders (change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;/=5.1 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 to &lt;/=1.2 with DAS28 &lt;/=5.1); Non-responders (change from baseline &lt;/=0.6 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 and &lt;/=1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1). Regression coefficient for relationship between DAS28-ESR and EULAR Good response at different time points is reported. Regression coefficient value range= not defined (any negative or positive value is possible). Higher positive value indicates greater extent of positive relationship and higher negative value indicates greater extent of negative relationship.</description>

        <title>Association Between Disease Activity Parameter (CDAI) and Treatment Response Parameter (EULAR), Assessed Using Regression Coefficient</title>
        <description>The CDAI is a numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGDA and PGDA assessed on 0-10 cm VAS. CDAI total score = 0-76. EULAR response criteria (based on DAS28 score): Good responders (change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &lt;/=3.2); Moderate responders (change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;/=5.1 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 to &lt;/=1.2 with DAS28 &lt;/=5.1); Non-responders (change from baseline &lt;/=0.6 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 and &lt;/=1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1). Regression coefficient for relationship between CDAI and EULAR Good response at different time points is reported. Regression coefficient value range= not defined (any negative or positive value is possible). Higher positive value indicates greater extent of positive relationship and higher negative value indicates greater extent of negative relationship.</description>

        <description>The SDAI is a numerical sum of 5 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGDA and PGDA assessed on 0-10 cm VAS and CRP in mg/dL. SDAI total score= 0-86. EULAR response criteria (based on DAS28 score): Good responders (change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &lt;/=3.2); Moderate responders (change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;/=5.1 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 to &lt;/=1.2 with DAS28 &lt;/=5.1); Non-responders (change from baseline &lt;/=0.6 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 and &lt;/=1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1). Regression coefficient for relationship between SDAI and EULAR Good response at different time points is reported. Regression coefficient value range= not defined (any negative or positive value is possible). Higher positive value indicates greater extent of positive relationship and higher negative value indicates greater extent of negative relationship.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI is a participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Total Score at Weeks 2, 24, and 52</title>
        <description>FACIT total score is sum of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) score and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F; additional concerns) score. FACT-G is a core questionnaire that evaluates quality of life (QoL) in cancer population. FACT-G consists of 27 questions grouped in 4 domains of general health-related QoL: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being; each item ranges from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). FACT-G score ranges between 0-108. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire that evaluates self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities. Each item ranges from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The sum of all responses result in the FACIT total score with a total possible range of 0 (better score) to 160 (worse score). Negative change from baseline represents a better QoL.</description>

        <description>PSQI is a questionnaire with 18 questions to assess sleep quality. The 18 questions are distributed to 7 elements (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction). A participant indicates how frequently each item was experienced on a scale from 0 to 3. The global score is the sum score of all 7 elements and ranges from 0-21 with higher values indicating worse sleep quality. A score of &gt;/=5 indicates poor sleepers.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. TEAEs are AEs occurring between the first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after the last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Following AEs were considered as AEs of special interest: anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, stress cardiomyopathy, Gilbert’s syndrome, gastrointestinal perforation, injection site erythema, injection site hypersensitivity, injection site irritation, injection site pruritus, arthritis bacterial, cellulitis, klebsiella infection, oral candidiasis, pneumonia, skin infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, alanine aminotransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased, brain neoplasm malignant, and urticaria.</description>
