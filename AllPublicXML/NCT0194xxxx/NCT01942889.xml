  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On the basis of published data and investigators results indicating that systemic redox in
      balance may contribute to the peripheral muscle dysfunction in COPD patients, the
      investigators propose a study testing the effects of antioxidants and exercise training in
      COPD patients. The results may have major implication in the improvement of pulmonary
      rehabilitation benefits

    <textblock>
      COPD will constitute the third cause of mortality in 2012. This chronic respiratory disease
      is characterized by peripheral dysfunction of skeletal muscle which is associated with major
      clinical outcomes (prognostics, symptoms, and health related quality of life). Muscle and
      systemic oxidative stress has been incriminated in this peripheral muscle
      dysfunction.Exercise training constitute the main validated therapeutic intervention leading
      to significant muscle function and clinical improvement.Our preliminary results have shown
      that COPD patients experiment dietary and enzymatic antioxidants defects.Yet, generic
      antioxidant supplementation has not shown significant muscle function improvement.Therefore,
      we aim to test the effects of an antioxidant supplementation targeted on the antioxidant
      defects associated with exercise training on the peripheral muscle function, exercise
      tolerance and health quality of life in COPD patients.At the cellular level, this muscle
      dysfunction is related with a fiber atrophy and a metabolic switch (reduce proportion of
      oxidative fiber).This study will compare the effects of an antioxidant supplementation on the
      peripheral muscle function and skeletal muscle cellular properties in association with
      exercise training during a pulmonary rehabilitation course.Volunteers will be randomised in 2
      groups: - 1 group treated with the antioxidant supplementation ( 28 days)- 1 group treated
      with the placeboIntervention will be allocated by chance and a double blind manner.
      Antioxidant supplementation will associate vitamins and trace elements that won't exceed the
      maximal nutritional dose recommended.

    <description>Description: sitting on a bench with a force sensor connected to a data acquisition and analysis system signal, subjects should reproduce three trials spaced 1 minute, by an extension movement of the knee joint against a stationary load, maximum way, keeping the arms crossed over the chest and leaning against the back in order to limit the involvement of other muscles. The most elevated of the three tests repeatable value close to 10% characterizes the maximum strength of subjects.</description>
