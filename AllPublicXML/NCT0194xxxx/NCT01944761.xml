  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of our proposed study are to (a) evaluate the feasibility of conducting a
      structured exercise program in children treated with cranial radiation for brain tumors, (b)
      test whether exercise results in improved thinking skills and emotional function, and (c)
      examine potential mechanisms of improved outcome, particularly recovery of white matter and
      grey matter.

    <textblock>
      Brain tumors are the leading cause of death and disability from childhood disease in
      developed countries. With treatment advances over the last 25 years, survival rates have
      improved dramatically. However, survival is often achieved at considerable cost. Cranial
      radiation is frequently required for effective tumor control, and is associated with
      significant neuro-toxicity, including white matter damage and cognitive morbidity. In order
      to achieve the best possible outcome for survivors, and ultimately conquer the long-term
      consequences of this disease, new interventions must be developed to ameliorate the
      neuro-toxic effects experienced by children. radiation injury can now be used to guide the
      development of interventions designed to rescue neural tissue. Furthermore, various new
      agents and activities with potential to stimulate neuro-recovery are now available. The
      potential value of exercise for rescuing the brain from neuro-toxic effects, for instance,
      has recently been reported. Next, neuro-cognitive processes that are particularly sensitive
      to the effects of cranial radiation have been identified and can serve as behavioral assays
      to test the effectiveness of these new interventions. Finally, novel neuro-imaging tools are
      available to perform in vivo evaluations in order to delineate potential mechanisms of
      neuro-recovery. We intend to integrate these new research findings to develop and evaluate a
      physical exercise-based intervention targeted at rescuing brain tissue of children with brain
      tumors from the neuro-toxic impact of cranial radiation.

    <description>Changes in white matter integrity may occur as a result of gliogenesis and will be measured using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Neurogenesis occurs primarily within the hippocampus, a structure important for learning a memory. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been demonstrated to be a potential surrogate imaging measure of neurogenesis. As such, we will use Arterial Spin Labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI to obtain estimates of CBF within the hippocampus.</description>

    <description>Designed to improve cardio-respiratory fitness, the exercise program will be conducted for 12 weeks at a frequency of 3 sessions per week. Each exercise session will be conducted after school for a total duration of 90 minutes. First, training in a circuit of developmentally appropriate activities (30 minutes) will occur. Second, the training circuit will be followed by participation in an organized sport (i.e. 30 minutes of floor hockey, basketball, or indoor soccer). Following the workout sessions the children will receive a healthy snack and have an opportunity for socialization (30 minutes).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Survivors will be included if they are between 7 and 18 years of age. - - Survivors
             will be included if they either declare English as their native language or have had
             at least two years of schooling in English at the time of their first assessment.

          -  Survivors must have been diagnosed with a hemispheric or posterior fossa tumor and
             been treated with cranial spinal or focal radiation.

          -  No more than 7 years may have elapsed between diagnosis and time of study.

          -  Survivors with a shunt will be included in the study, but will need to be identified
             prior to study on-set to discuss any specific considerations for imaging and physical
             activity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  are younger than 7 years (the delivery of an intervention program to young children
             carries challenges that make it difficult to include in an initial feasibility grant)
             or older than 18 years

          -  require sedation for MRI imaging

          -  severe neurological/motor dysfunction that would preclude safe participation in an
             exercise program.
