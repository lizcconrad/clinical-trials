  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how dietary changes affect the heart and blood
      vessels in patients with hypertension (high blod pressure) who have a condition called 'heart
      failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot; (HFPEF). This condition is also known as &quot;diastolic
      heart failure&quot; or &quot;heart failure with normal ejection fraction&quot;, and occurs even though the
      heart's pumping function is normal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an earlier study, the investigators found that patients with HFPEF who ate a special diet
      for three weeks had improved blood pressure control and lower levels of blood chemicals that
      may damage the heart and blood vessels. The eating plan in the study was based on the DASH
      diet, also known as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet. This plan is rich in
      fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and is recommended to decrease blood pressure in
      patients with hypertension. Current medical guidelines also recommend that both patients with
      hypertension and those with heart failure should decrease their dietary salt intake.

      The diets that patients will eat in this study are the DASH/sodium-restricted (DASH/SRD) diet
      as well as a control diet based on the average reported diet collected using Food Frequency
      Questionnaires during our pilot study. Patients will be randomized to one diet for three
      weeks and then crossover to the other diet for three weeks. Patients will then be asked to
      eat the DASH/sodium-restricted diet on their own at home with dietary support for an
      additional eight weeks.

      In this study, the main goal is to confirm the findings of our earlier study. The
      investigators would also like to understand how the DASH/SRD changes the function of the
      heart and blood vessels during exercise and the activity of genes that could be involved in
      HFPEF.

    <description>Each patient will eat 3 weeks of the provided DASH/SRD diet for 21 days. The diet is patterned after the intervention in the DASH-Sodium trial (Sacks FM et al. New Engl J Med 2001;344(1):3-10). The diet is designed, prepared, and packaged by research dietitians and all food and beverages are provided for study participants. At enrollment patients will be randomized to the DASH/SRD or Control Diet for 21 days and then cross over to the other for 21 days. Immediately following the provided DASH/SRD and Control Diet, patients will be instructed to adhere to the DASH/SRD for an additional eight weeks with dietary support.</description>

    <description>Baseline diet will be assessed via Block Food Frequency Questionnaire, and 24-hour urinary sodium, potassium, and 8-isoprostanes will be measured. Subjects will then be assigned to 21 days of the DASH/SRD, with all food and beverages provided. The target sodium content will be 1,500 mg/2,100 kcal, as per recent American Heart Association population recommendations for sodium intake. Adherence will be assessed through a three-day food diary at the midpoint of the intervention, and at the end of the 21 days urinary sodium, potassium, and 8-isoprostanes will again be measured.</description>
