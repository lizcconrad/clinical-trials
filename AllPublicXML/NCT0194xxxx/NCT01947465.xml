      Backgound and relevance of the project:

      Patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) are at increased risk of
      contracting infections. The increased risk can be attributed to the immunological disorder
      itself, as well as to the immunosuppressive treatment. Vaccination against many infections is
      recommended in this patient group. However, the immunogenicity of vaccines may be reduced and
      may also be influenced by the administered treatment. Potential reactivation of the
      underlying disease triggered by vaccination is another important concern.

      From the patients' and public health perspectives, an important task of physicians is giving
      advice on vaccines. Completing this task is often difficult, because data on the
      immunogenicity and safety of vaccines in these patient groups are scarce, especially with
      regard to treatment with new immunosuppressive medications, such as biological agents. Lastly
      and importantly, due to new therapeutic options, health among AIIRD patients has considerably
      improved and an increasing number of patients undertake overseas travel activities requiring
      additional vaccinations. In this context, reliable advice with regard to vaccinations is
      almost impossible, because for most travel vaccinations the immunogenicity and safety profile
      is unknown.

      Research addressing the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines in different autoimmune
      inflammatory diseases treated with different immunosuppressive medications is urgently needed
      to allow giving evidence based vaccine advice.

      In this observational study the immunogenicity and safety of tetanus booster and hepatitis A
      vaccinations will be assessed in AIIRD patients. The immune response will be evaluated as a
      function of the underlying disease and the possible influence of commonly used
      immunosuppressive drugs on the immune response will be studied.

      Rationale for studying tetanus booster and hepatitis A vaccine Tetanus vaccination is one of
      the most frequently recommended vaccinations, and the effect of a booster vaccination can be
      addressed. Hepatitis A vaccine is the most widely used travel vaccine. Despite their
      importance, only very limited data are available for tetanus and hepatitis A vaccine in this
      patient group. By focusing on these vaccines the study will lead the way to the evaluation of
      further vaccines.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether tetanus and hepatitis A vaccinations are as
      immunogenic and safe in AIIRD patients as in healthy controls.

      The study will be placed in 6 rheumatology clinics in Switzerland and in 4 travel medicine
      clinics. Consecutive subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthritis (ankylosing
      spondylitis), vasculitis (ANCA associated vasculitis and Beh√ßet's disease) and healthy
      controls will be recruited.
