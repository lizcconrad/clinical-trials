    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of iron overload is a common problem. It is important to optimize the diagnosis
      to ensure support for patients and their relatives especially regarding genetic disease.

      Iron overload revealed by a high level of serum ferritin and confirmed by the presence of an
      excessive amount of iron in the liver is a frequent situation. In a lot of case there is no
      increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation. This situation may arise in particular in
      patients with:

        -  a genetic iron overload related to mutation in the ferroportine gene, leading to a
           ferroportin disease. The diagnosis is based on the sequencing of the gene,

        -  a dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, the most frequent situation , where iron overload is
           associated with abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, whereas no
           genetic cause is identified.

      However, patients often have similar biological signs and despite the implementation of
      strict algorithm regarding the diagnostic procedure, it appears that a large number of
      patients are tested for the mutation in the ferroportin gene, and that mutation is not found
      in most cases. It is therefore essential to optimize the diagnosis process by introducing
      additional criteria.

      The investigators' hypothesis, based on the known elements, is that the response to a single
      dose of iron will modulate differently the iron parameters measured in serum, including
      hepcidin level which controls iron metabolism and metals associated with iron. This could be
      helpful for diagnosis procedure in patients with ferroportin disease or dysmetabolic
      hepatosiderosis.

      The quantification of serum hepcidin level is a potential method of investigation in iron
      metabolism disorders. However, apart from some extreme situations, the assay achieved solely
      is not helpful. This is due to the varying levels encountered from one subject to another for
      the same disease. This is related to the facts that values considered to be normal cover a
      wide range and that a value obtained for a given patient at a given time, can be influenced
      by many factors.

      It has been reported that a a single oral iron dose induced an increase of serum hepcidin
      level in healthy subjects which is abolished in subjects with genetic hemochromatosis linked
      to insufficient hepcidin expression related to mutations in the HFE or TFR2 genes.

      In patients with a dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, it was suggested that the expected
      hepcidinemia increase found after an iron intake was altered, likely due to a slight
      inflammatory signal responsible for hepcidin induction.

      The investigators hypothesize that a dynamic response of iron parameters, including
      modulation of hepcidin level, to an iron intake will allow to discriminate patients with
      ferroportin disease or dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, situations whose clinicobiological
      presentation is often confusing.

      Thus, the three objectives in this study will be :

        1. To define pharmacokinetic characteristics of serum hepcidin in response to iron oral
           intake and to determine the ability of this pharmacokinetic to discriminate dysmetabolic
           hepatosiderosis and ferroportin disease.

        2. To correlate amplitude of this response to the iron parameters modulation

        3. To correlate amplitude of this response to the concentration of divalent cations whose
           metabolism uses common genes to those involved in iron metabolism.
