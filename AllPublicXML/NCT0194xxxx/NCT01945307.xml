      We need human blood to understand the immune response to infection and to test promising new
      vaccines against infectious diseases in the laboratory. One test is called the Serum
      Bactericidal Assay (or SBA), which is measure of how effective antibodies are at killing
      certain bacteria and can be an important measure of how effective a new vaccine may be.

      The samples would be used in the laboratory analysis of clinical trials of vaccines used in
      adults and children, and some samples in pre-clinical (animal) experiments testing new
      vaccines before they enter human-stage testing. Most people have some form of protection
      against most bacteria already, so not everyone is a suitable blood donor for this laboratory
      test. We therefore start by taking a small blood sample and test this one before asking for
      more blood if we found yours suitable for the work we do.
