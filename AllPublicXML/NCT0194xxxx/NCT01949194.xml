  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, anti-angiogenic agents have been incorporated into clinical practice for the
      treatment of metastatic CRC, leading to improvements in progression-free survival and overall
      survival. Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets angiogenic and oncogenic
      kinases. Although structurally similar to another multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, it
      appears to be pharmacologically more potent and possesses broader antiangiogenic properties.

      Both sorafenib and regorafenib target BRAF wild-type and BRAF V600E mutant but the inhibition
      of p38 MAP kinase is a peculiar characteristic of regorafenib. A Phase I study of regorafenib
      as a single agent in patients with heavily pretreated CRC showed promising clinical activity
      with a disease control rate (PR + SD) of 59% in evaluable patients. In the Phase III trial
      (CORRECT), which was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing either
      regorafenib plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC, it was shown that
      regorafenib significantly increased overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS)
      and disease control rate (DCR), independently of KRAS status. A major interest, given the
      data presented in the CORRECT trial, is to determine predictive biomarkers to indicate
      patients likely to benefit, or to be resistant to this anti-angiogenic compound.

      This study aims to determine the efficacy of regorafenib as single-agent treatment for the
      treatment of second-line metastatic colorectal cancer and to identify predictive biomarkers
      in the actual metastatic tumors to be treated. In the case of metastatic CRC patients, liver
      lesions are frequently the most common site of metastatic deposit and these lesions can be
      biopsied to assess putative biomarkers. Patients will be asked to undergo a biopsy of a
      metastatic lesion prior to treatment, and an optional liver biopsy at the time of relapse.
      Using several high-throughput discovery platforms, biomarkers will be identified in the
      metastatic tumor specimens and in blood samples collected throughout the treatment. This will
      allow us to evaluate putative biomarkers and monitor tumor biomarker dynamics using serial
      blood collection.

      The objectives of this trial are to help identify the patient subgroup most likely to be
      responsive or resistant to regorafenib, so that future treatment with regorafenib can be
      directed to the more responsive but as yet identified patient population.

    <description>A biopsy from a liver metastasis will be taken at baseline for discovery of biomarkers that correlate with response to regorafenib. Genomic material (DNA and RNA) will be isolated from all biopsies. Those that pass quality control (high quality DNA, RNA and &gt;60% tumor content) will be considered evaluable. Batched analysis will be performed at the end of the study with the evaluable samples for multiplex biomarker discovery. Patient's biomarker status at baseline will be correlated with treatment effect on PFS and response (including response rate and disease control rate) to explore which biological targets may be particularly important in defining the appropriate treatment population for regorafenib.</description>
