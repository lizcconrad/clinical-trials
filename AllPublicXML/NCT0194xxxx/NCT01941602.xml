  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare different strategies for prevention of venous
      thromboembolism related to intracranial meningioma surgery. The investigators identified
      three hospitals where two have a very restrictive approach with respect to anticoagulant
      therapy while at the third hospital the use of anticoagulation the day before surgery was
      initiated as routine prophylaxis.

      Based on this &quot;natural experiment&quot; it will be explored whether the use of anticoagulant
      prophylaxis is associated with reduced risk of venous thromboembolism and/or associated with
      increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage as compared to the 2 cohorts where this
      intervention were absent.

    <description>enoxaparin had been prescribed at a dose of 40 mg (once daily) from the evening before surgery until patients were well mobilized. Also, at the time of surgery compression stockings were used, as well as a sequential compression device (SCD) until the morning after or longer if mobilization was delayed</description>

    <description>no pharmacological prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) had been used routinely. Occasionally, with delayed mobilization, a low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) had been prescribed. SCD had been used at increased frequency, and is today considered routine.</description>
