      Novartis-sponsored, open-label, multi-center, interventional ETP to provide LDK378 to
      patients with ALK (+)NSCLC, who have been pre-treated with an ALK inhibitor; except in
      countries where ALK inhibitors are not approved or available. The protocol will further
      evaluate the safety of LDK378 in patients with ALK(+) NSCLC.

        Inclusion Criteria (patients eligible for inclusion in this early treatment protocol have
        to meet all of the following criteria):

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC that demonstrates ALK
             positivity as assessed by approved FISH test (Abbott Molecular Inc), using Vysis
             breakapart probes (defined as 15% or more positive tumor cells); or the Ventana IHC
             test. If documentation of ALK positivity is not available, the test to confirm ALK
             positivity must be performed according to the above criterion, using a new tumor
             biopsy obtained prior to the first dose of ETP treatment (LDK378).

          2. Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC patient with documented disease progression at enrollment, and
             who does not qualify or have access to LDK378 through a clinical trial.

          3. Age 18 years or older at the time of informed consent.

          4. WHO performance status 0-3.

          5. Patients who have been pre-treated with an ALK inhibitor for locally advanced or
             metastatic NSCLC. Patients may be enrolled without prior exposure to an ALK inhibitor
             in countries where ALK inhibitors are not approved or available. Exposure to prior
             chemotherapy is not required.

          6. Patients must have recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies
             to grade ≤ 2 (CTCAE v 4.03), provided that concomitant medication is given prior to
             initiation of treatment with LDK378. Exception to this criterion: patients with any
             grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the treatment.

          7. The following laboratory criteria have been met:

                  direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt; 3.0 x ULN, except for patients with liver
                  metastasis, who are only included if AST &lt; 5 x ULN; alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt;
                  3.0 x ULN, except for patients with liver metastasis, who are only included if
                  ALT &lt; 5 x ULN.

               -  Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≥ 30 mL/min

          8. Patient must have the following laboratory values or have the following laboratory
             values corrected with supplements to be within normal limits at screening:

          5. Chemotherapy or an investigational therapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to starting the LDK378
             treatment who have not recovered from side effects of such treatment toxicities to ≤
             grade 2 or to their pre- treatment toxicities levels, with the exception of liver and
             cardiac functions which must be ≤ grade 1.

          6. Patients who have received thoracic radiotherapy to lung fields ≤ 4 weeks prior to
             starting the study treatment or patients who have not recovered from
             radiotherapy-related toxicities. For all other anatomic sites (including radiotherapy
             to thoracic vertebrae and ribs) radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting the LDK378

               -  herbal supplements

         14. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

         15. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.

             In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior
             to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
             not of child bearing potential.

         16. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male patients for 3 months
             should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by
             vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
