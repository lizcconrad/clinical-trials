      PREGNANT WOMEN IN ANTENATAL CLINIC WILL BE SCREENED FOR CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS INFECTION WITH
      ENDOCERVICAL SWAB.THOSE THAT TEST POSITIVE AND SATISFY THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WILL BE
      COUNSELLED AND ENROLLED INTO THE STUDY AFTER OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT.THE PARTICIPANTS WILL
      BE RANDOMISED INTO ONE OF THE TWO GROUPS.THE DRUGS WILL BE TAKEN FOR I WEEK AND THE SEXUAL
      PARTNER(S) WILL ALSO BE TREATED WITH DOXYCYCLINE FOR 1 WEEK. BARRIER CONTRACEPTION WILL ALSO
      BE USED DURING THE TREATMENT.THE SEXUAL PARTNERS WILL BE CONTACTED THROUGH TELEPHONE CALLS
      AND THE BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY WILL BE EXPLAINED TO THEM. LATEX MALE CONDOM
      WILL BE GIVEN TO THE WOMEN. ALSO, FOLLOW-UP TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE PUT ACROSS TO THEM DURING
      THE TREATMENT WEEK TO ENHANCE COMPLIANCE. A REPEAT ENDOCERVICAL SWAB WILL BE TAKEN 4 WEEKS
      AFTER TREATMENT TO CHECK FOR MICROBIOLOGICAL CLEARANCE. A STUDY PROFORMA WILL BE FILLED
      DURING THIS VISIT. THE DATA WILL BE ANALYSED USING STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES
      VERSION 17.

      AIM(S) OF THE RESEARCH TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY AND TOLERABILITY OF AMOXICILLIN COMPARED TO
      ERYTHROMYCIN IN TREATMENT OF ANTENATAL CHLAMYDIA INFECTION

      OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH

        -  TO DETERMINE THE PREVALENCE OF CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS INFECTION IN PREGNANCY

        -  TO COMPARE THE PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS WITH CLEARANCE OF ANTENATAL CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS
           INFECTION BETWEEN THE ERYTHROMYCIN AND AMOXICILLIN GROUPS

        -  TO COMPARE THE OCCURENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS

        -  TO COMPARE THE DRUG DISCONTINUATION RATES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUP
