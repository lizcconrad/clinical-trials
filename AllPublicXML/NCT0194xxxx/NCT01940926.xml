      This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT) study to
      investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 in
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. A single dose of nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 (≤ 40 µg
      BNOTA-PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into patients with RA. Visual and
      semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT
      will be performed for comparison.

      The Alpha(v)beta3 integrin, one of the most prominent members of integrin superfamily, is
      trans-membrane heterodimeric proteins which mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix
      adhesion. Integrin alpha(v)beta3 receptor plays an pivotal role in promoting, sustaining and
      regulating the angiogenesis and was identified as a marker of angiogenic vascular tissue.
      Cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides was identified as a key integrin
      recognition motif which could strongly bind to integrin alpha(v)beta3 and inhibit new blood
      vessel formation. Animal study in antigen induced arthritis demonstrated that intra-articular
      administration of a cyclic RGD antagonist of alpha(v)beta3 leading to inhibition of cell
      infiltrate, synovial angiogenesis, pannus formation, cartilage erosions and even diminishing
      arthritis severity. For these properties, RGD peptide-based multimodality molecular probes
      have been developed for noninvasive imaging by targeting integrin alpha(v)beta3. And compared
      with 18F-FDG PET/CT, radiolabeled RGD imaging is a promising approach to visualize
      angiogenesis and provide a therapeutic target for anti-angiogenetic and anti-integrin
      therapy.

      For the further interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2, an open-label PET/CT
      study was designed to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of
      68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 in RA patients.
