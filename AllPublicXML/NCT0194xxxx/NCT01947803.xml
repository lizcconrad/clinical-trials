    <textblock>
      This study is a single-group, open-label (name of study drug is known to patients),
      multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy/treatment response of paliperidone
      palmitate administered for 25 weeks as once-monthly injections to Chinese patients with
      schizophrenia who previously received treatment with oral antipsychotic medications. A target
      of 353 patients (inpatients or outpatients) with schizophrenia will be enrolled in the study
      and will receive injections of study drug (paliperidone palmitate) on Days 1 and 8, and
      thereafter at a monthly flexible dose, based on patients' tolerability and/or efficacy. The
      study will consist of a screening period of up to 1 week before treatment, a 25-week
      treatment period, and a follow-up period approximately 30 days after the last injection of
      study drug. Upon meeting the entry criteria for the study, patients will receive a total of 8
      intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate during the treatment period as
      follows: 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, and subsequent monthly IM
      injections with a flexible dose range of 75-150 mg eq. If the patient reports any signs or
      symptoms of worsening of schizophrenia, the investigator may prescribe a rescue medication
      (quick-relief or fast-acting medications that usually work right away to relieve symptoms)
      such as lorazepam (an antianxiety drug) to control agitation, irritability, restlessness, and
      hostility. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>PANSS is used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. PANSS includes a total score (sum of 30 items) and 3 subscale scores including positive subscale (7 items), Negative subscale (7 items) and General psychopathology subscale (16 items). The rank of each scale is rated from 1 point (absent) to 7 points (extreme).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>PSP scale is used for evaluation of a patient's personal and social functions. PSP is used for degrees of difficulties on four functioning dimensions during previous 1 month: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Every dimension is rated (i. absent to vi. very severe). PSP total scores range from 1-100, which are divided into 10 ratings to assess difficulties degrees. Ratings from 71-100 reflect only mild difficulties; ratings from 31-70 reflect manifest disabilities of various degrees; ratings â‰¤30 reflect functioning so poor that intensive support or supervision is needed.</description>

    <description>Paliperidone Palmitate is injected with a dose of 150 mg eq. on Day 1 and 100 mg eq. on Day 8 in the deltoid muscle, followed by a monthly flexible dose range of 75 - 150 mg eq. for injection, based on patients' tolerability and/or efficacy. Monthly doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle alternatively. All the antipsychotics should be discontinued prior to the first dose of study drug. Other antipsychotics are prohibited across this study.</description>
