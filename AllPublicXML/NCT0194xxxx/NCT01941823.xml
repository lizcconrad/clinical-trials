  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carnitine is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria and energy
      production in different muscles, including the myocardium. It is also needed to protect
      myocyte cell membranes from oxidative damage by removing excess acyl carnitine groups.
      Patients receiving chronic intermittent hemodialysis (HD) are known to be at increased risk
      for carnitine deficiency as a result of its removal during the dialysis procedure, lack of
      endogenous synthesis by the kidney, and inadequate dietary intake. The carnitine status of
      children undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has not been studied.
      Children undergoing CRRT in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting may be at increased risk
      for carnitine deficiency due to its continuous removal, lack of carnitine production by the
      kidney, and absence of carnitine intake (as majority of these children can not eat and there
      is no carnitine added to total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Carnitine deficiency may increase
      the risk of cardiac dysfunction in critically ill children. This is the first study to
      examine carnitine status in children undergoing CRRT. Standard echo as well as more sensitive
      speckle tracking echo will be used to evaluate the effect of carnitine deficiency on
      myocardial function.

      Study Design:The research design consists of a prospective study group that would be compared
      to two control groups (a prospective control groups and a retrospective control group). The
      study group will consist of critically ill children receiving CRRT and IV carnitine
      supplementation (added in the TPN). The prospective control group will consist of critically
      ill children not receiving CRRT or carnitine Retrospective control group will consist of
      critically ill children who received CRRT but did not receive carnitine supplementation. .
      Subjects for the prospective study and control groups will be recruited from the pediatric
      intensive care unit (PICU) and the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) at Children's National.
      Informed consent will be obtained from participants enrolled in the prospective study and
      control groups. Data for the retrospective control group will be obtained from the medical
      record.
