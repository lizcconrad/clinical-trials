  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is primarily to compare effectiveness of electroacupuncture and pelvic floor
      muscle training for SUI, and evaluate optimal efficiency of electroacupuncture for stress
      urinary incontinence (SUI). The early clinical research is a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) with a small sample,consisting of two arms of electroacupuncture group and sham
      electroacupuncture group to value difference of extent of SUI in 1h pad test after 4 weeks.
      The result indicates that electroacupuncture is an optimal method for SUI. As a further
      study, this research is a large sample multicenter trial with two parallel arms of
      electroacupuncture group and pelvic floor muscle training group. The primary purpose is to
      value effectiveness of electroacupuncture for SUI in aspect of frequency of leakage and
      amount of leakage, comparing with pelvic floor muscle training. And the secondary purpose is
      to evaluate safety of electroacupuncture therapy, and compare acceptance of
      electroacupuncture treatment and pelvic floor muscle training.

      Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as a complaint of involuntary leakage. Researches show
      that 9%-72% women between age 17-79 are urinary incontinence, in which stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI) is the most prevalent type of urinary incontinence. The morbidity rate of
      UI through the world is 27.6%, which SUI take percentage of 50.Morbidity rate of UI in
      Beijing is 46.5%,and among which 59.6% is SUI. Aging is a high risk for SUI, which will
      increase morbidity rate of SUI. Totally, 61.9% women over 50 year-old have SUI. SUI is
      defined as a complaint of involuntary leakage during sneezing or coughing, which make
      patients embarrassed and can not attend social activity normally, decreasing the quality of
      their lives. Attending social activity is very important for people's health, otherwise,
      people will get a series of diseases, like osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, hypertension,
      coronary heart disease,etc The International Consultation on Urological Diseases recommended
      pelvic floor muscle training as A level evidence treating simple mild and moderate stress
      urinary incontinence, which curative rate varies 30% to 60%. But the length of treatment
      should last at least 3 month. Therefore, patients' compliance is a key to the effectiveness.
      While, electroacupuncture is verified as a better treatment for SUI, which length of
      treatment is shorter than pelvic floor muscle training, and effective rate is over 80%,
      showing potential advantages. Early clinical research show that electroacupuncture for SUI is
      effective.

      This subject is primary to compare effectiveness of electroacupuncture and pelvic floor
      muscle training for SUI, and evaluate optimal efficiency of electroacupuncture for SUI. The
      early clinical research is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a small sample, which
      consists of two arms, electroacupuncture group and sham electroacupuncture group to value
      difference of extent of SUI in 1h pad test after 4 weeks. The result indicates that
      electroacupuncture is effective.

      As a further study, this research is a large sample multicenter trial with two parallel arms
      of electroacupuncture group and pelvic floor muscle training group. The primary purpose is to
      value effectiveness of electroacupuncture for SUI in aspect of frequency of leakage and
      amount of leakage, comparing with pelvic floor muscle training. And the secondary purpose is
      to evaluate safety of electroacupuncture therapy, and compare acceptance of
      electroacupuncture treatment and pelvic floor muscle training.

    <description>Since the average frequency difference of urinary incontinence in mean 24h of the 8th week is the average frequency difference of urinary incontinence in mean 24h of 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th weeks based on the &quot;72 voiding diary&quot;, which is 12 times treatment totally. Therefore, frequency of leakage in mean 24h is calculated by total frequency of leakage in week of 2th , 4th, 6th and 8th divided 12.</description>

    <description>Standing/sitting/lying on back, knees bent to chest. A set consists of three contractions, each lasting 10s, with a 10s break between contractions. Counting or measuring the duration of contractions and breaks is accomplished without effort by taking advantage of the duration of normal breaths. As most men take about 10 breaths per minute, each breath can be used as 6s timing device.The participants are treated continuously for 8 weeks for 3 sessions a week, 24 sessions for each patient in all.</description>
