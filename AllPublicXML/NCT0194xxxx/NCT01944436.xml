  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lewy body spectrum disorders are a common group of neurodegenerative diseases that cause
      memory loss, behavioural and motor disabilities that impair quality of life. Cognitive
      enhancers help people afflicted with these conditions. However, some people do not benefit
      from this treatment, while others experience serious side effects. Side effects and poor
      response lead to hospitalization and early institutionalization. Pharmacogenomics, the study
      of how DNA variation can influence drug effects, will be combined with functional changes in
      brain imaging in response to cognitive enhancers in patients with Lewy body disease. The goal
      is to develop a predictive test that can be administered in the clinic to aid physicians'
      choice of initial medication. This can reduce health care costs and improve treatment to
      Canadians suffering from these devastating disorders.
