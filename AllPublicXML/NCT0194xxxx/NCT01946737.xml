  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CT technology is evolving at a rapid pace, with introduction of multidetector row CT scanners
      (MDCT) and electrocardiographic (ECG) gating resulting in increasing numbers of heart scans
      CTCA (CT Coronary Angiography). CTCA provides a noninvasive alternative to conventional
      invasive coronary angiography (ICA), which is considered the gold standard in the
      investigation of coronary disease. There has been a gradual increase in the utilization of
      CTCA for primary assessment of low and intermediate risk patients. However concerns regarding
      radiation exposure and diagnostic accuracy, especially in the highrisk group, have prevented
      its widespread dissemination.

      To achieve best possible temporal resolution (minimize cardiac motion artifacts) and spatial
      resolution (provide diagnostic accuracy) relatively high radiation exposure is required, as a
      result of its inverse relationship with image noise and resolution. However radiation (X-ray)
      is associated with increased risk of cancer in exposed patients and it is therefore essential
      to continually devise strategies to reduce radiation exposure whilst maintaining image
      quality.

      A state-of-art CT scanner (Discovery CT750 HD, General Electric (GE) Healthcare), has been
      installed at Derriford hospital for further research on CTCA. It uses novel method of
      scanning, High Definition Computed Tomographic Coronary Angiography(HD-CTCA), analogous to
      high definition television) and image reconstruction (Adaptive Statistical Iterative
      Reconstruction ASIR)as opposed to conventional CT scanners using Filtered Back Projection
      (FBP)reconstruction. HD-CTCA enables acquisition of sharper images and ASIR offsets the
      resultant increase in radiation exposure. This is likely to result in images of higher
      diagnostic quality with an equivalent or slightly lower radiation exposure compared to
      present technology. Although initial results are encouraging, this needs further assessment
      before being applied to routine clinical practice. To assess this we have designed a study to
      perform HD-CTCA on 300 consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic ICA at Derriford hospital,
      directly comparing the accuracy of HD-CTCA to ICA (presently considered the gold standard).

      Hypotheses:

      There is no significant difference in the sensitivity and specificity of HD-CTCA for the
      detection of coronary artery stenosis of 50% or greater compared to conventional ICA.

    <description>We designed the New Generation Computed Tomographic Coronary Angiography (NG-CTCA) study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of high-definition CT with iterative reconstruction in an unselected population of patients suitable for CTCA with either a high pre-test probability of, or established coronary artery disease.
