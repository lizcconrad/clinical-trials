  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to
      a drug) and safety of paliperidone palmitate ranging from 75 to 150 milligram equivalents in
      repeated doses (4 injections) administered in the deltoid muscle (muscle in the shoulder) or
      gluteal muscle (group of muscles present in the buttocks) in participants with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), open label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance),
      parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) study.
      Approximately, 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. This study will consist of a
      screening phase (maximum 14 days), an observation phase (92 days), and a follow-up phase (98
      days). Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment group A, B, or C. During the
      observation phase, participants will receive injections of paliperidone palmitate of
      concentration ranging from 75 to 150 milligram equivalents in the deltoid muscle or gluteal
      muscle as applicable on Days 1, 8, 36, and 64 alternating between sides (left/right). Safety
      evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examination, injection site reaction, drug-induced
      extrapyramidal symptoms scale, and visual analog scale which will be evaluated throughout the
      study. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 190 days.

    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline (Day 1), Days 8, 36, 64, and 92</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline (Day 1), Days 8, 36, 64, and 92</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
