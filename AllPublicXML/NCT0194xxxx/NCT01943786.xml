    <textblock>
      Adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum is a common, serious disease and it is the second
      cause of death from cancer in Spain.

      The prognosis of CRC depends to a great extent on its stage when diagnosed. Patients with
      advanced disease, who present up to 40% of all patients, have a poor prognosis. Although the
      application of modern chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments obtains median survival
      periods of around 24 months, the proportion of patients with advanced disease who obtain a
      cure is low.

      Systemic treatment of advanced CRC has changed considerably in the last ten years with the
      introduction of active drugs such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and capecitabine. The most
      commonly used first line regimens are 5-Fluorouracil-Leucovorin-Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX),
      Capecitabine-Oxaliplatin (XELOX), 5-Fluorouracil-Leucovorin-Irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and, to a
      lesser extent, Capecitabine-Irinotecan (XELIRI). Chemotherapy regimens are combined with
      different agents against therapeutic targets, three of which are effective in colon cancer:
      bevacizumab, which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cetuximab or
      panitumumab, which target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

      The use of cetuximab and panitumumab is not recommended in patients with KRAS mutations and
      the combination of a VEGF and EGFR agents is not beneficial.

      Two recent studies results have identified KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of acquired
      resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab in colorectal cancer patients. The conclusions
      indicate that the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected non-invasively months
      before radiographic progression by a DNA Blood Test (Inostics´BEAMing Technology).

      Centro Integral Oncológico Clara Campal (CIOCC) is aiming to undertake a pioneer project
      aimed at integrating the analysis of KRAS switch status by BEAMing Technology in patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer, tumor KRAS wild-type and BEAMing wild-type treated with
      first line FOLFIRI-cetuximab

      In naive chemotherapy tumor-KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients, who are
      BEAMing positive (KRAS mutated in blood) before treatment may have worse evolution in terms
      of PFS (progression Free Survival) and response rate than BEAMing negative (KRAS native in
      blood) patients.

      To know the proportion of patients who are BEAMing positive (KRAS mutation can be detected in
      circulating extracellular DNA) at the beginning of treatment, could be of great importance
      for treatment efficacy.
