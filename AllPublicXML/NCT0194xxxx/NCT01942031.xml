  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a devastating disease. The acute mortality in Sweden is 20 % and 25 % of all
      patients relapse. Secondary prevention is proven efficient but observational studies have
      shown that a number of patients are lost to follow up and do not receive recommended
      prevention. The aim of the study is to 1) describe, by analyzing register data, the detection
      rate of patients with hospital diagnosis of stroke, TIA, and atrial fibrillation in the
      primary care center where they are listed. The analysis is done by sex, age, and
      socioeconomic status. Furthermore, rate of dispensed prescriptions of secondary preventive
      drugs are analysed for the identified population. 2) in a randomized controlled study
      evaluate if collegial feed back and targeted information of secondary prevention to the
      intervention group can improve the detection rate and the medication of the patients listed
      at the participating primary care centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All primary care centers in Stockholm County (approximately 200) are randomised to control or
      intervention (receiving structured feed back on detection rate of stroke/transient ischemic
      attacks in comparison to hospital discharge registry data. The randomisation is done group
      wise based on training areas. A data set is presented by different means; 1) in written
      reports, directly to the head of each primary care center in the intervention group 2)in oral
      presentation on training sessions for the physicians in each training ares. Measures of
      detection rates of diagnosis and dispensed prescriptions of secondary preventive drugs are
      made before start of the project and after one year. The control group, ie the primary care
      centers not receiving feed back, are measured in the same way and thus provide a control
      group. The hypothesis being that with visibility of the problem, it is easier to improve care
      wich is what all health providers aim to do.

      Outcome measures is percentage of patients with stroke (ICD code I60, I 61, I63, I64) and
      transitory ischemic attacks(G45) who are dispensed prescribed secondary preventive medication
      and death.
