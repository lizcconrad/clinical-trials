  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and COPD are characterized by an accelerated decline in lung function associated with
      incompletely reversible airflow obstruction. This could be the result of lung structural
      changes and inflammation. Tissue repairing mechanisms may result in a restitution ad integrum
      of bronchial epithelium. But in most cases, especially in COPD and severe asthma, the
      &quot;remodeling&quot; is characterized by mucus cells hyperplasia, overproduction of mucus, and
      physicochemical, biological and immunological changes. Clinically, this mucus overproduction
      is reported by patients as the clinical symptom called &quot;chronic bronchitis&quot;. Generally, it
      develops at a bronchiolar level where it is responsible for the progression of these
      diseases. There is a paradox, because the intrinsic properties of mucus seem rather
      beneficial so fighting against it may not be really wise at long-term. Especially its
      defensive effect against microbial agents which remains poorly explained. Currently, no
      treatment aims to reduce the production of mucus and mechanisms leading to such an
      overproduction are poorly understood in severe asthma and COPD. The identification of new
      targets to treat this overproduction of mucus in COPD is therefore of major interest.

      In view of current knowledge, inflammatory mediators and signal transduction leading to
      increased mucin production and increased number of goblet cells are probably IL-9, IL-13, IL
      -1ß and TNF-α involving calcium-sensitive chloride channels. Intracellular signaling pathways
      seem to be based on STAT-6, FOXA2, SPDEF, EGFR and / or COX-2
