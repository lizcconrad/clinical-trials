    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to estimate the effects of allocation to irbesartan, or
      doxycycline, or a combination of both irbesartan and doxycycline, compared with placebo, on
      measures of elastic function of the aorta in people with the Marfan syndrome and enlargement
      of the aorta.
