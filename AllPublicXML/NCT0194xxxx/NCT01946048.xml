    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common disorder that can lead to heart failure. Not all
      people with CAD are eligible for today's standard treatments. One new treatment approach uses
      umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells—specialized cells capable of developing
      into other types of cells—to stimulate growth of new blood vessels for the heart. The aim of
      the present study is to investigate safety and efficacy of intramyocardial implantation of
      allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy .
