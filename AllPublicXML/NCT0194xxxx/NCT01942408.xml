  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest condition affecting the rhythm of the heart and
      causes an irregular and often rapid heartbeat. Developing this condition may cause
      significant health problems and symptoms that affect normal day-to-day activities. Patients
      with AF also have a shorter life expectancy on average. Tablets used to try to normalise the
      heart rhythm rarely work well. As a result, doctors have devised a treatment to try to cure
      this condition. Special wires (called catheters) are used to deliver heat energy (called
      ablation) on the inside surface of the heart. This technique has been used more and more in
      recent years for patients with troublesome symptoms due to AF.

      The aim of the treatment is to draw lines of ablation in specific places in the heart.
      Unfortunately, a lot of patients (almost 50%) get AF again after this treatment and most of
      these patients have a second treatment performed. It is usually found at this second
      treatment that gaps have developed in the lines of ablation that were drawn the first time
      around. The investigators think that electively doing a second treatment to close these gaps
      a couple of months after the first treatment may mean that fewer of these patients will get
      AF again in the future. The investigators also want to find out what factors make a line of
      ablation less likely to develop gaps.

      In this study, participants will be assigned to one of two groups:

        1. a &quot;standard care&quot; group, who will have a single treatment initially.

        2. a &quot;repeat study&quot; group, who will have the initial treatment followed by a second
           treatment 8-10 weeks later.

      For patients in the &quot;repeat study group&quot;, investigators will see how many have developed gaps
      since their first treatment. The investigators will look at where these gaps are and will
      compare this with information collected during the first treatment to try to work out why the
      gap has developed. Any gaps found at the second treatment will be closed again.

      All participants will then be monitored carefully over 12 months to see how many from each
      group get AF again. To do this, all participants will be given a handheld heart rhythm
      monitor to keep until the end of the study. This device is simple to use. Participants will
      be asked to make a 30 second recording of their heart rhythm each day and also whenever they
      have symptoms. These recordings will be downloaded at review appointments arranged 6 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months and 12 months after the initial ablation procedure.
