  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous nutrition is an important therapy for the recovery of many patients. It is
      indicated when the patients cannot take food by mouth or use their intestines for feeding. It
      is important to indicate it in the appropriate setting because it's not free of complications
      and is a costly treatment. Some of the complications are: elevated blood sugar or lipids,
      elevated liver function tests, infection of the catheter or device used to administer
      intravenous nutrition. Intravenous nutrition is composed by proteins, lipids, carbohydrates
      (sugar in the form of glucose) and vitamins. Until recently, Intralipid, a soybean oil-based
      lipid emulsion was the only lipid available in Canada for this kind of nutrition. Since 2010,
      a new lipid emulsion (ClinOleic) based on olive-oil has been approved by Health Canada for
      use in intravenous nutrition. There is an increasing need for hospitals to evaluate the
      quality of intravenous nutrition administered to hospitalized patients in terms of: assessing
      indications, prescription, complications, clinical results and costs. The objective of this
      study is to determine if intravenous nutrition prescribed in hospitalized patients is
      indicated following existing guidelines in terms of timing of nutrition support,
      prescription, monitoring and whether it is associated with complications. In addition, length
      of stay and mortality will be assessed. Also, we will evaluate nutritional, infectious and
      inflammatory parameters in patients receiving soybean oil-based lipid emulsion (Intralipid)
      compared to those of patients receiving olive oil-based lipid emulsion (ClinOleic).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, Intralipid, a soybean oil-based lipid emulsion, has been the only available
      lipid for intravenous use in Canada. In 2010, ClinOleic, a new, predominantly olive oil based
      emulsion, has been approved by Health Canada as an alternative lipid.

      There is an increasing need for hospitals to do quality-assurance studies for in-patient
      parenteral nutrition (PN) to assess indications, PN prescription, complications, clinical
      outcomes and costs. The only in-patient population that is well studied is the intensive care
      unit (ICU) population. Several meta-analyses showed that PN was associated with higher
      infection rate, longer length of stay and higher mortality when compared with enteral
      nutrition. Results from these and other studies were the basis for the Canadian ICU
      Guidelines.

      The aim of this study is to determine if PN prescribed in in-patients is indicated,
      appropriately following existing guidelines in terms of timing of nutrition support,
      prescription and monitoring and, whether it is associated with complications. In addition,
      clinical outcomes such as length of stay and mortality will be assessed. Also, we will
      evaluate metabolic, nutritional, infectious and inflammatory parameters in patients receiving
      soybean oil-based lipid emulsion compared to those of patients receiving olive oil-based
      lipid emulsion.

    <description>Length of stay in the hospital and ICU will be recorded. We will record how many days it took,since admission to the hospital, for the patient to be discharged. This is an expected average of 4 weeks of length of stay.</description>
