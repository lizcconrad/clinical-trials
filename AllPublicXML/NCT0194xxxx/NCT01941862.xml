    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and usability of multiple
      computer-based treatments for mood and anxiety relevant risk factors. The target of the
      treatment is related to cognitive stress, which has been shown to be associated with a
      variety of negative mental health outcomes such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, suicidal
      ideation, and substance use disorders.

      DARTS is a newly developed computerized treatment targeting specific risk factors associated
      with suicide, mood, and anxiety symptoms. Eligible individuals will be randomized to one of
      several conditions. In all conditions, participants will complete various self-report
      questionnaires and a neurophysiology assessment that involves an EEG. Some participants will
      also be asked to complete four additional EEG assessments. In addition, all participants will
      be asked to complete a 1, 3, and 6-month follow-up appointment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The INQ is a 15-item self-report measure of the constructs of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness as defined by the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide. Van Orden et al. report high internal consistency coefficients for the thwarted belongingness (α=.85) and perceived burdensomeness subscales (α=.89). In support of construct validity, both subscales were found to prospectively predict suicidal ideation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ASI-3 is an 18-item self-report measure of anxiety sensitivity (AS). This scale was developed to provide a more stable measure of the three most widely recognized AS subfactors (cognitive, social and physical concerns) than the original ASI provides. Each subfactor is represented by six items. The measure has shown good psychometric properties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Suicide Scale (BSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The BSS is a 21-item widely used self-report measure assessing a broad spectrum of behaviors and attitudes related to suicide risk, including suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts. It has demonstrated strong reliability and validity.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Anxiety Risk Reduction</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The anxiety risk reduction condition will be a combination of psychoeducation plus Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM-I) for anxiety sensitivity (AS). The psychoeducational component will focus on the nature of stress and its effect on the body. Interoceptive exposure (IE) exercises, designed to correct the conditioned fear to these bodily sensations, will be explained and practiced.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Mood Risk Reduction</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The mood risk reduction condition will be a combination of psychoeducation plus Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM-I) for perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. The psychoeducational component will focus on dispelling myths related to burdensomeness and belongingness and describe their role in the development of mood symptoms.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Combined Risk Reduction</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The combined intervention will involve all of the interventions in the anxiety and mood risk reduction conditions and thus will not be matched for length.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Repeated Contact Control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants assigned to the repeated contact group will be assigned a &quot;personal&quot; study coordinator. The coordinator will contact them at specific intervals during the study. The rationale for these contacts will be provided (e.g., checking in on their status and helping to administer some brief measures). During the three weeks (corresponding to treatment session intervals for those in one of the active treatment conditions), the study coordinator will contact the participant once per week for a brief phone check in where suicide risk will be evaluated. Participants in the control group will also meet with their study coordinator during each of the scheduled follow-up visits.</description>
