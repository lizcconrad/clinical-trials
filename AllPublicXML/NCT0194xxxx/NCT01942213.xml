    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase IV prospective, observational study will evaluate patients, who have
      been diagnosed with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration and have previously received
      either a standard intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or aflibercept, in order to get and
      compare information regarding post-injection inflammatory (irritation in the eye)2-3 days
      post-injection.

      Additionally, patients will be evaluated for visual acuity and pain 2-3 days post-injection.

      Patients, age 65 to 90, with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration who present for
      treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept will be selected in this study. 300
      subjects from one site in the United States will be enrolled.

        -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study

        -  Age 65-90 years

        -  Diagnosis of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration who present for treatment with
           intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Previous intraocular inflammation

        -  Treatment with systemic anti-inflammatory agents

        -  Known systemic autoimmune diseases

    <description>All eyes will be evaluated 2-3 days after injection and graded in terms of (a) aqueous cells, graded subjectively on a scale of 0-4, (b) aqueous flare, graded subjectively on a scale 0-4, (c) aqueous flare graded objectively with the FM-600 Kowa flare meter and (d) vitreous haze, graded subjectively on a scale of 0-4.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate patients 2-3 days post-injection for best corrected visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed by the number of letters read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study eye chart at a starting test distance of 4 meters.</description>
