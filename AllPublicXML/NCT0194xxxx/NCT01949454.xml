  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate a new potentially cost-effective approach to improving
      trichiasis surgery outcomes, perioperative topical anti-inflammatory therapy. The
      investigators hypothesize that adjunctive topical fluorometholone therapy following
      trichiasis surgery will reduce the risk of recurrent trichiasis. The rationale for this
      hypothesis is that interruption of inflammation postoperatively would reduce postoperative
      scarring, leading to better outcomes. As an initial step toward evaluating this modality, the
      investigators believe it to be necessary to evaluate topical corticosteroid therapy in a
      safety-oriented study, for which the investigators also hypothesize that fluorometholone will
      have a perioperative safety profile acceptable for large-scale programmatic use. Topical
      corticosteroid therapy is associated with potential risks of cataract induction and
      intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in susceptible individuals. Fluorometholone has lower
      intraocular penetration than alternative corticosteroids, with correspondingly less
      IOP-raising effect while still having favorable effects on conjunctival inflammation, and is
      a low-cost generic drug. Its poor delivery of corticosteroid into the eye itself provides an
      advantage in this setting, as the major side effects of therapy are the result of intraocular
      effects, and therapy only is needed to the conjunctiva. However, prior to use in a
      large-scale trial it is sensible to make sure adverse outcomes are not observed in a
      substantial number of TT patients in a smaller scale trial. Secondary goals of such a trial
      are to evaluate alternative topical corticosteroid dosing schedules to identify an optimal
      dosing schedule and to identify any preliminary signals of potential efficacy.

    <description>Incident cataract is defined as either: 1) a two-step worsening on the nuclear, cortical, and/or posterior subcapsular LOCS-3 scale; or 2) undergoing cataract surgery prior to that point in follow-up.

Other dose-limiting toxicity: 1) SAEs (see below) judged as likely related to the treatment by the investigators; 2) vision-threatening non-trachoma infections, e.g., corneal ulcer; 3) anaphylaxis or other events requiring immediate resuscitation; or 4) when the clinician-investigators determine that other AEs observed in a subject would make future applications of the treatment contraindicated on the basis of side effects.</description>

          3. Plan for lid rotation surgery (Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation) on at least one upper
             eyelid

          4. LOCS 3 cataract grading is level 3 or less for the nuclear cataract scale, and level 2
             or less for the cortical cataract and posterior subcapsular cataract scales.

          5. Intraocular pressure between 8-20 mm Hg in the study eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications to the use of the test articles

          2. Known allergy or sensitivity to any medication used in this study, including the study

          3. Currently taking more than two ocular anti-hypertensive medications in the study eye
             (prior IOP-lowering surgery is acceptable; combinations of two agents such as Cosopt
             and Combigan are considered two medications)

          4. Glaucoma sufficiently advanced that an intraocular pressure spike potentially would
             put the patient at substantial risk of vision loss, per study ophthalmologist's
             judgment.

          5. Non-phakic (i.e., pseudophakic or aphakic) study eye (contralateral non-phakic eye is
             permitted).

          6. Other than trachoma, any active ocular infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal), or
             any active ocular inflammation (e.g., scleritis, iritis).

          7. History or diagnosis of ocular herpes or presence of a corneal lesion of suspected
             herpetic origin; or a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of ophthalmic mycobacterial
             infection in either eye.

          8. Corneal or scleral thinning in either eye.

          9. A severe / serious ocular pathology or medical condition which may preclude study
             completion.

         10. Any condition for which it is anticipated ocular or systemic corticosteroid therapy
             would be required.

         11. Unwilling to discontinue use of contact lenses for the duration of the study (should
             the unusual circumstance of a trachomatous trichiasis patient who uses contact lenses
             be encountered)

         12. Any significant illness or condition that could, in the investigator's or
             sub-investigator's opinion, be expected to interfere with the study parameters or
             study conduct; or put the subject at significant risk

         13. For women of childbearing age, currently pregnant and/or breastfeeding, as obtained by
             self-report (because of concerns about the (programmatic) use of azithromycin in this
             setting).

         14. Cataract in the study eye, defined as LOCS-3 cataract grading is level 3.1 or more for
             the nuclear cataract scale, or level 2.1 or more for the cortical cataract or
             posterior subcapsular cataract scales.
