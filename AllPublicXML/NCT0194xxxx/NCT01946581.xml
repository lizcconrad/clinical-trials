Motivations for choosing their surgeon and for selecting an IOL choice
Fears that they had before surgery
Degree of spectacle independence for activities, including driving (day and night), watching television, computer use, reading print material, using their mobile phone
Degree of overall satisfaction with vision
Degree to which they notice unexpected side effects (dysphotopsias)
Degree to which they felt informed about any side effects they did experience
Activities for which they would like to see better
Willingness to refer friends for the same surgery
Whether they have already referred friends for the same surgery</description>
