      This is a 4 part study:

      Phase 1a. -functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ( with oxytocin 24 IU vs. placebo =
      oxytocin 0 IU) - funded by grant #U54 HD079124-01, Phase 1b-eye-tracking(oxytocin 24 IU vs.
      placebo = oxytocin 0 IU), Phase 2a. fMRI (oxytocin 8 IU vs. oxytocin 40IU), Phase 2b.
      -eye-tracking (oxytocin 8IU vs. oxytocin 40IU). Time course of effect will also be assessed
      within session.

      We hypothesize that intranasal oxytocin treatment (OT) of individuals with an autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) will:

      Hypothesis 1a. will produce greater increases in Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and Nucleus
      Accumbens (NAc) activation during social reward anticipation compared to placebo, providing
      evidence that OT increases activation in brain regions critical for social motivation. (NICHD
      funding for this section/aim- Dr. Joe Piven -U54 HD079124-01)

      Hypothesis 1b. will spend proportionally more time attending to the social image on a screen
      vs. the non-social image compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis 2a. will produce differential effects in VTA and NAc activation during social
      reward anticipation compared with the oxytocin 8 IU vs. oxytocin 40 IU dose, providing
      evidence that OT dose-dependently increases activation in brain regions critical for social
      motivation.

      Hypothesis 2b. will differentially attend to the social image on a screen vs. the non-social
      image compared in the oxytocin 8 IU vs. oxytocin 40 IU dose, providing evidence that OT
      dose-dependently changes the value of social stimuli.

    <measure>Aim 1a. fMRI Activation Analysis/Connectivity</measure>
    <time_frame>30, 75 minutes post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Activation data will be analyzed using FEAT within FSL (Oxford University, U.K.). Onset times of events will be used to model BOLD signal responses containing a regressor for each response type convolved with a double-γ function. A priority region of interest will be the VTA and NAc which will be analyzed via anatomically defined ROI's.
Connectivity Analysis:Time series will be extracted from ROIs using FSL Featquery for each participant and averaged separately for each Treatment (OT, placebo) and Trial Type (rewarded, unrewarded) condition (seed and target regions will be functionally defined on the basis of task response). Correlation coefficients will be transformed using a Fisher r-to z transformation. Mean z-transformed values will then be computed across participants and ROI pairs, and then converted back to correlation coefficients.</description>

    <measure>Aim 1b. Proportion of Time Attending to Social Stimuli (Eye Tracking)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre dose and then 30, 60,120-240 minutes post dose</time_frame>
    <description>The eye tracking task involves the participant looking at a series of images in which a person's face occupies ½ the screen and a complex object occupies the other half of the screen that are presented for ~20 seconds each on a computer monitor. The participant is only told to look at the screen and sits approximately 18-24 inches in front of a computer monitor with built in cameras and lights to track eye movement. This is referred to as competitive attention task to social and nonsocial stimuli. Eye tracking will be assessed via a Tobii 1750 eye tracker or via mobile eye tracking, immediately after the fMRI scan, participants will participate in a 10 min lab-based eye tracking task in which a series of paired social and nonsocial stimuli are displayed for 10 seconds.</description>

    <time_frame>pre dose and then 30, 120, 240 and 360 minutes post dose</time_frame>
    <description>We will assay plasma oxytocin levels using standard radioimmuno assays to describe potential relationships between baseline levels, salivary oxytocin and fMRI activity. Total Volume of Blood = 7ml per time point (one 7ml lavender top tube).</description>

    <measure>Salivary Oxytocin (OT) levels for all aims.</measure>

    <description>We plan to collect salivary at times that coincide with the administration of the fMRI task. This data will be used to describe potential relationships between baseline levels, salivary oxytocin and fMRI activity. Collection involves inserting a cotton swab in the subjects mouth and be asked to keep it there for up to 5 minute to ensure total saturation of the swab.</description>
