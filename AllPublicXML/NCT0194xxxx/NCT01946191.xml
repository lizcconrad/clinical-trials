      The purpose of this study is to test whether online tracking tools and weight maintenance
      coaching visits for patients and real-time electronic progress reports for primary care
      providers (PCPs) [Continued Coaching (CC)] will support more successful weight maintenance
      than online tracking tools alone [Tracking Only (TO)] in a group of primary care patients who
      have lost â‰¥ 5% of their body weight.

      The investigators aim to address the key problem of how to implement U.S.Preventive Services
      Task Force obesity treatment recommendations in a cost-effective manner. The investigators
      propose a Randomized Clinical Trial - Maintaining Activity and Nutrition through
      Technology-Assisted Innovation in Primary Care (MAINTAIN-PC) - to test whether a group of
      primary care patients who have lost at least 5% of their body weight in the past year will be
      more likely to maintain their weight loss with a multifaceted intervention that includes
      online tracking tools, web-based &quot;coaching&quot; visits, and PCP engagement through real time
      electronic progress reports with counseling tips than when using online tracking tools alone.
      By integrating this intervention within an existing electronic health record and clinical
      flow, the investigators maximize potential for future dissemination.

      The MAINTAIN-PC study draws upon recommendations for the design of practical clinical and
      behavioral trials. The investigators will assess multiple relevant outcomes across clinically
      meaningful treatment strategies. The investigators will recruit a sample that is diverse in
      terms of gender, BMI and co-morbidity status, with a racial/ethnic mix reflective of the
      region, and that includes Agency for Healthcare Research Quality priority populations. The
      investigators will include clinical practices with diverse characteristics, and have selected
      interventionists who reflect the level of training typically seen among primary care clinic
      staff. The investigators will recruit 30-40 participants a month, with recruitment lasting
      5-6 months, and each participant in both CC and TO arms receiving a 30 month intervention.
      The last year of the study will focus on analyses, including cost-effectiveness analyses.
