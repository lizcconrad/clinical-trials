      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells
      transplantation in liver cirrhosis patients.

    <textblock>
      Decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC), a life-threatening complication of chronic liver disease,
      is one of the major indications for liver transplantation. Recently, umbilical cord blood
      mononuclear cells transfusion has been shown to lead to the regression of liver fibrosis in
      animal model. The investigators thus investigated the safety of the therapy with life signs
      like temperature, pulse, blood pressure, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and
      mortality and so on. And the efficacy was evaluated with the measurement of alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL),
      direct bilirubin (DBIL), albumin (ALB), cholinesterase (CHE), prothrombin time (PT) and
      child-pugh score.
