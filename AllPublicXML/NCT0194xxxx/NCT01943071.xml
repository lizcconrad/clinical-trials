  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attending day care centres with programs specifically designed for patients with dementia is
      believed to postpone admittance to nursing home as well as increase quality of life and
      well-being for both patients and their family caregivers. We aim to investigate to what
      degree attendance in day care centres with programs for people with dementia is effective for
      patient and their caregivers whilst also cost efficient for society. The study consists of a
      quasi-experimental trial with comparison group. 400 patients with dementia, along with a
      family caregiver, will be included in the trial. Effects will be measured at baseline, after
      one and two years. Data collection will be made at three levels; at patient level with
      measures of cognition, depression, quality of life, functioning in activities in daily
      living, neuropsychiatric symptoms and death; at caregiver level with measures of depression,
      level of burden and quality of life; and at societal level with measures of nursing home
      admittance, hospital stays and use of other health resources. Additionally,a qualitative
      interview study will include 20 dyads from the main trial. The main focus will be on how
      attending day care centre programs for patients with dementia affect the lives of both
      patients and caregivers. Five of these dyads will be followed closely throughout the
      participation period to be used as case examples.

      A quasi experimental trial with a comparison group will be performed to evaluate the effect
      of the day care centre programs by comparing results from municipalities with (intervention
      group) and without (comparison group) a day care centre program designed for people with
      dementia using standardized assessment tools. Furthermore, a survey will be used to explore
      the communication and co-operation between the professional staff at the day care centre, the
      patients and the family carers by administering questionnaires to all three parties. Only
      patients with mild degree of dementia will be asked to participate in the questionnaire.
      Finally, qualitative interviews will be made with 20 dyads of patients and family carers to
      collect their in depth experience with the day care centre program. Five of these patients
      and their family carers will be followed closely as case examples for two years.
