  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study is to examine the feasibility of implementing an internet-based
      treatment for insomnia among veterans with substance use disorders, some with co-morbid
      serious mental illness, and to develop potential methods to support and encourage veterans
      while they self-administer this treatment. Our hypotheses are that the implementation of an
      internet-based therapy will be feasible and that a method of support can be devised, and
      tested in the future.

    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (Total) following completion of the intervention (expected average of 7 weeks)
The Insomnia Severity Index is a self-report seven-item measure that targets the subjective symptoms and functional consequences of insomnia as well as the degree of concerns or distress caused by those difficulties, and corresponds to the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. Scores range from 0-28, higher scores indicate more severe insomnia, and scores ≥15 suggest moderate to severe insomnia.</description>

    <description>Participants will be followed for the duration of the intervention (7 individual modules, completed weekly, for an expected average of 7 weeks). Outcome measure will be characterized as the number completing all 7 modules of the program (dichotomous variable).
The intervention is a 7-week, self-administered course accessed via the Internet that includes instruction on psycho-education, stimulus control, relaxation training, sleep restriction, medication tapering, cognitive distortions, and mindfulness integrated into each module. Homework is assigned after each module. Participants are instructed to complete the sleep diary included in the program daily while participating in the program.</description>
