  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed research study, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy of gametes'
      (egg and sperm) treatment on fertilization as well as pre- and post-implantation embryo
      development.

      The spermatozoa will be prepared in the standard fashion and utilized for injection after
      exposure to a membrane permeabilizing agent. The injected oocytes will be then exposed to the
      previously mentioned activating agents for the purpose of inducing embryo development. The
      successfully fertilized oocytes will be further kept in culture for up to 5 days as per
      standard IVF/ICSI. Results in terms of fertilization and embryo cleavage will be assessed and
      monitored for the remainder of the culture period. Developing embryos selected according to
      standard criteria will be replaced to the patient or will be cryopreserved.

      Because fertilization failure carries such a high emotional and financial toll on our
      patients, at the present time, the only method to generate an embryo for these cases is to
      perform assisted oocyte activation in conjunction with ICSI. The research intervention -
      assisted oocyte activation - is believed to help alleviate the failed fertilization by
      obtaining some zygotes for the patient. In these cases of complete failed fertilization,
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) will be performed as a routine clinical treatment
      even if they are not enrolled in the study. After several failures, their reproductive
      physician may recommend the use of donor spermatozoa instead of the male partner's.

    <description>The spermatozoa will be prepared in the standard fashion and utilized for injection after exposure to a membrane permeabilizing agent. The injected oocytes will then be exposed to activating agents for the purpose of inducing embryo development. The oocyte activating agent is calcium ionophore and for sperm membrane permeabilization to assist in sperm DNA decondensation is streptolysin O (SLO). The successfully fertilized oocytes will be further kept in culture for up to 5 days as per standard IVF/ICSI. Results in terms of fertilization and embryo cleavage will be assessed and monitored for the remainder of the culture period. Developing embryos selected according to standard criteria will be transferred to the patient or will be cryopreserved.</description>
