    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two different augmentation
      strategies of antidepressant treatment for depressed older adults who have not responded to
      an adequate trial of antidepressant medication. The first augmentation strategy is Problem
      Solving Therapy (PST), a 12-week psychotherapy treatment that has been shown to be effective
      in depressed older adults. The second augmentation strategy is medication augmentation, which
      will begin with six weeks of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic medication that has also
      been shown to be effective in depressed older adults who have failed a trial of
      antidepressant medication.

      Depression is common in older adults, and antidepressant medication is only effective in
      about 60% of patients seeking treatment. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effectiveness of two different augmentation strategies of antidepressant treatment for
      depressed older adults who have not responded to an adequate trial of antidepressant
      medication. The first augmentation strategy is Problem Solving Therapy (PST), a 12-week
      psychotherapy treatment that has been shown to be effective in depressed older adults. The
      second augmentation strategy is medication augmentation, which will begin with six weeks of
      aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic medication that has also been shown to be effective
      in depressed older adults who have failed a trial of antidepressant medication. If patients
      have not remitted at the end of the 6 week aripiprazole trial, the aripiprazole will be
      stopped and they will be started on bupropion for the remaining 6 weeks of the study. Both
      aripiprazole augmentation and bupropion augmentation in depressed older adults have been
      approved by the FDA. No study has compared the effectiveness of PST and medication
      augmentation strategies for depressed older adults who are non-responders to an adequate
      trial of antidepressant medication in the current episode of their depression.
