      Purpose: To explore the relation between breastmilk nutrients and the cognitive abilities of
      breastfed infants.

      Phase 1: Near 3 months of age child and mother saliva samples for DNA obtained with breast
      milk sample.

      Phase 2: At 6 months of age child participates in electrophysiology session to test
      recognition memory.

      Phase 3: At 26 or 38 months of age, children will complete behavioral, dietary, and physical
      assessments.
