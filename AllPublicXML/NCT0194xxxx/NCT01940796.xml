  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking for the highest dose of the Brentuximab Vedotin that can be
      administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in patients that have chronic
      Graft vs. Host Disease, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the
      same dose of the study drug. The dose each patient will get depends on the number of
      participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and how well they have tolerated their
      doses.

      Each patient will receive a dose of Brentuximab Vedotin every 3 weeks. Brentuximab Vedotin is
      administered via intravenous infusion, or IV infusion, which means directly into the vein,
      over a period of about 30 minutes.

      Each cycle is 21 days long.

      Each patient will undergo the following tests and procedures when they come into the clinic
      to receive each dose of Brentuximab Vedotin:

      Days 1, 8, and 15 of 1st 2 cycles:

        -  Physical exam, which includes height, weight, body surface area and vital signs.

        -  A medical history, which includes questions about your health, current medications, and
           any allergies.

        -  Performance status, which evaluates how participant are able to carry on with your usual
           activities.

        -  Routine blood tests to test overall health (about 1 teaspoon of blood) Assessment of
           side effects- physician will evaluate the patient's current health and ask questions to
           see there are any experienced side effects from taking the study drug.

      Only Day 1 of 1st 3 cycles:

        -  Research blood draws for biomarker and PK assessments (pharmacokinetic assessments that
           measure the level of drug in the patient's blood) (about 4 teaspoons of blood)

        -  Biomarker studies blood draw (about 4 teaspoons) Viral monitoring blood tests to make
           sure each patient has not developed any new viruses as a result of treatment (about 4
           teaspoons of blood)

        -  Chronic GVHD assessments: The patient's physician may need to perform other tests to
           confirm the diagnosis of acute GVHD. These can include more blood tests, imaging
           studies, and possibly biopsies of affected organs. The exact tests will be determined by
           the patient's physician

      Planned Follow-up: If the patient's physician believes the patient is responding well to
      treatment, the patient may receive up to 16 cycles of Brentuximab Vedotin. The Investigator
      would like to keep track of patient's medical condition for 12 months after the patient has
      completed the first 2 cycles of treatment, no matter if the patient receives more doses or
      not. The Investigator would like to do this by calling the patient on the telephone to see
      how he/she is doing. Keeping in touch with patient and checking the condition helps the
      Investigator look at the long-term effects of the research study.

    <description>The dose of brentuximab Vedotin will be based on the cohort the participant is enrolled on. Dosing will be based on the participant's weight prior to each dose. Actual weight will be used except for participants weighing &gt; 100 kg. The dose for participants weighing &gt; 100 Kg will be calculated based on a weight of 100 kg. The dose should be rounded to the nearest whole number of milligrams. Brentuximab vedotin will be administered over approximately 30 minutes IV.Up to five dose levels will be tested in cohorts of 3-6 participants each. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established, 10 more participants will be treated at the MTD for analysis of efficacy.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after either
             myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimens. Any donor source of stem
             cells is eligible.

          -  Participants must be at least 100 days after HCT.

          -  Patients must have steroid refractory cGVHD, defined as having persistent signs and
             symptoms of chronic GVHD (section 13.1) despite the use of prednisone at â‰¥ 0.25
             mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least 4 weeks in the preceding 12
             months (or equivalent dosing of alternate corticosteroids) without complete resolution
             of signs and symptoms.

          -  Stable dose of corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., calcineurin
             inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil) for 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The
             dose of immunosuppressive medicines may be adjusted based on the therapeutic range of
             that drug

          -  Serum Cr â‰¤ 3 gm / dL

          -  Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl, AST &lt; 5x ULN), unless hepatic
             dysfunction is a manifestation of presumed cGVHD. For patients with abnormal LFTs as
             the sole manifestation of active cGVHD, documented cGVHD on liver biopsy will be
             required prior to enrollment. Abnormal LFTs in the context of active cGVHD involving
             other organ systems may also be permitted if the treating physician documents the
             abnormal LFTs as being consistent with active hepatic cGVHD, and a liver biopsy will
             not be mandated in this situation.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as defined by ANC â‰¥ 1000 / Âµl and
             platelets â‰¥ 20,000 / Âµl without growth factor or transfusional support

          -  Negative pregnancy test for females of child bearing age

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 - The safety and effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin has not been
             established in the pediatric population. Clinical trials of brentuximab vedotin
             included only 9 pediatric patients and this number is not sufficient to determine
             whether they respond differently than adult patients.

          -  The effects of brentuximab vedotin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because chemotherapy agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing prednisone requirement &gt; 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent)

          -  Exposure to any new immunosuppressive medication in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  ECP therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Active malignant disease relapse

          -  Active, uncontrolled infection

          -  Uncontrolled cardiac angina or symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or
             IV).

          -  Karnofsky performance status &lt; 30

          -  Prior use of brentuximab vedotin for GVHD is not allowed. Prior use of brentuximab
             vedotn for the treatment of malignancy is allowed.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because brentuximab vedotin is a
             chemotherapy agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with brentuximab vedotin, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with brentuximab vedotin.
