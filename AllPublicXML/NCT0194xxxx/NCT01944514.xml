  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide three million people a year die from sudden cardiac death (SCD). In most cases
      there is no warning and the heart is stopped by a sudden arrhythmia. We know that some people
      are at high risk of sudden cardiac death and can prevent their deaths with an implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) that is implanted in a minor operation.

      However, most people who die from sudden cardiac death are not found to be at high risk by
      our current risk markers and 40% of the people who have ICDs do not have therapy within the
      first 4 years after implant. We need new and better ways of identifying people who are at
      high risk of sudden cardiac death so that we can prevent their deaths with ICDs. Our
      understanding of the electrical signals in the heart has increased considerably in recent
      yearsÍ¾ in no small part this is due to our Principal Investigator Professor Andre Ng's basic
      science work. This study aims to take the understanding of action potential duration (APD)
      restitution gained through our work and other studies in humans and in computer simulations
      and translate it into a fresh way of assessing risk of sudden cardiac death.

      This study will carefully examine electrical activity, using APD restitution, in the hearts
      of patients who are having ICDs fitted because of their high risk of sudden cardiac death and
      combine this with a detailed heart scan, assessment of autonomic nervous system and gene
      expression data. We will then follow these patients up to see who benefits from their ICD.
      This wide ranging information will give us as complete a picture as possible of the factors
      that cause sudden cardiac death. We hope to use this to identify better predictors of sudden
      cardiac death.

      The study hypotheses are as follows:

      Primary

        1. Regional Restitution Instability Index (R2I2) will be significantly higher in patients
           reaching the endpoint of ventricular endpoint / sudden cardiac death than in those not.

        2. An R2I2 cut-off of 1.03 will partition patients into high and low risk groups.

           Secondary

        3. Peri-infarct zone mass in grams will be significantly higher in patients reaching the
           endpoint of ventricular endpoint / sudden cardiac death than in those not.

    <description>Regional Restitution Instability Index (R2I2) is a measure of electrical instability. R2I2 is calculated as the mean of the standard deviation of the residuals from the mean gradients for each ECG lead across a range of diastolic intervals. An R2I2 cut-off of 1.03 (no units) will partition the study population into high and low risk groups.</description>

    <description>Peri-infarct zone is calculated from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scans with late gadolinium enhancement. The full width half maximum technique will be used and Peri-infarct zone assessed using peri-infarct zone mass in grams.</description>
