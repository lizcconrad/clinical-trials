  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines the physical capacity of lung cancer patients assessed with the six minute
      walk test and handgrip strength. Demographic and selfreported exercise behavior is registered
      to explore correlations to functional and physical capacity.

      Assessments are made before first chemotherapy cycle and after fourth chemotherapy cycle, an
      expected average of 12 weeks between first and second assessment.
