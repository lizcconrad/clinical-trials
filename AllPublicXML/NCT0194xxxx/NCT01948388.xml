    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the utilization of two doses of
      corticotrophin ( ACTH) as a treatment in patients with early onset rheumatoid arthritis as an
      alternative to conventional steroid therapy by evaluating the change from baseline in the
      clinical findings as well as the structural findings on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
      Corticotrophin (ACTH) may prevent the well documented structural progression damage in RA
      patients using disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy alone.

      Acthar Gel Respository Injection, Corticotrophin( ACTH) administered to newly diagnosed
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis in conjunction with methotrexate, folllowed by a 24 week
      follow-up period. There will be a total of twenty (20) patients and two (2) treatment groups
      with 10 patients in each treatment group

        system (e.g. multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis).

        15. Patients with any other condition (e.g. clinically significant laboratory values) which
        in the Investigator's judgment would make the patient unsuitable for inclusion in the
        study.

        mechanical, or magnetic implant; cardiac pacemaker; aneurysm clip(s); implanted
        cardioverter defibrillator; or a cochlear implant) 17. Patients who have a potential
        ferromagnetic foreign body (metal slivers, metal shavings, other metal objects) for which
