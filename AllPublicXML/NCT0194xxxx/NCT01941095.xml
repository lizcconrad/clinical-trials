  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single arm study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      subcutaneous (SC) tocilizumab as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other
      non-biologic DMARDs in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis who are either naïve to
      or have an inadequate response to prior non-biologic or/and biologic DMARDs. The anticipated
      time on study treatment is 52 weeks. Those participants who will complete the 60-week study
      period and have achieved Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 remission or a good European League
      Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response at 52 weeks will be eligible to enter the extension phase
      until tocilizumab is commercially available and reimbursed in Greece.

    <description>Participants will receive tocilizumab 162 milligrams (mg) SC injection once a week (QW) either as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs during the treatment period of 52 weeks. The choice of monotherapy or combination treatment is according to the physician's judgment up to Week 24. Depending upon the participant's response to study regimen, they may either continue/discontinue/switch to tocilizumab monotherapy or may lead to intensification of methotrexate/non-biologic DMARDs with tocilizumab at a fixed dose of 162 mg SC QW till Week 52. Participants who will complete the treatment phase before tocilizumab is commercially available will enter an extension phase until tocilizumab is commercially available in Greece. Permitted DMARDs include methotrexate, azathioprine, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine.</description>
