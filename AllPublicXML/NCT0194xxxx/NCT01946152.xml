  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      pomalidomide that can be given in combination with dexamethasone and neupogen (filgrastim) to
      patients with relapsed or refractory MM.

      The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn if the drug combination can help to control MM.

      The safety of this drug combination will be studied in both parts.

      This is an investigational study. Pomalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients whose disease has not gotten worse within 60
      days after receiving at least 2 prior therapies (including lenalidomide and bortezomib).The
      combination of pomalidomide, dexamethasone, and filgrastim to treat MM is investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug(s) are designed to work.

      Up to 55 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to a study group based on when participant joins this study. Up to 7 groups of up to
      6 participants each will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study and up to 19 participants will be
      enrolled in Part 2.

      Induction Phase:

      If participant is enrolled in Part 1, the dose of pomalidomide participant receives will
      depend on when participant joined this study. The first group of participants will receive
      the lowest dose level of pomalidomide. Each new group will receive a higher dose of
      pomalidomide than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Up to 7 dose
      levels will be studied.

      If participant is enrolled in Part 2, participant will receive pomalidomide at the highest
      dose that was tolerated in Part 1.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone and filgrastim.

      The induction phase will last for 6 cycles.

      Maintenance Phase:

      After Cycle 6, participants in both parts will enter the maintenance phase. Participant will
      receive a lower dose of pomalidomide than participant was receiving during induction.
      Participant will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone that participant was receiving
      during induction. Participant will not receive filgrastim during the maintenance phase.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      During Induction:

        -  Participant will take pomalidomide by mouth on Days 1-21.

        -  Participant will take dexamethasone by mouth on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

        -  Participant will receive filgrastim through a needle under the skin on Days 22-28.

      During Maintenance:

        -  Participant will take pomalidomide by mouth on Days 1-21 of every cycle.

        -  Participant will take dexamethasone by mouth on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every cycle.

      If participant misses a dose of pomalidomide, participant should take it as soon as
      participant can that same day. If participant misses a day completely, participant should not
      make up the dose up the next day. If participant takes more than participant's prescribed
      dose of pomalidomide, participant should seek emergency medical care, if needed, and contact
      participant's study doctor right away.

      Pomalidomide should be taken without food, at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal.

      Participant or participant's caregiver will be given instructions on how to administer the
      filgrastim injection at home.

      Study Visits:

      Induction Phase:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-6:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be collected to check the status of the
           disease. If urine is collected, participant will collect the urine over a 24-hour
           period. Participant will be provided with a container to collect the urine in.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, participant will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons)
           or urine pregnancy test.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1-6:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, participant will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons)
           or urine pregnancy test.

      Maintenance Phase:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be collected to check the status of the
           disease. If urine is collected, participant will collect the urine over a 24-hour
           period. Participant will be provided with a container to collect the urine in.

        -  If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow biopsy
           and/or aspiration to check the status of the disease.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, participant will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons)
           or urine pregnancy test.

        -  If participant was found to have plasmacytomas at screening, participant may have CT
           scans, PET/CT scans, or MRI to measure them.

      If participant is not at MD Anderson, the routine blood draws can be done at participant's
      regular doctor's office.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the drug if the
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow
      study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over once participant has completed participant's
      long-term follow-up.

      End-of-Study Drug Visit:

      After participant finishes taking the study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have a neurological exam.

        -  Participant will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           participant's thyroid.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check how well participant's blood clots.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be collected to check the status of the
           disease. If urine is collected, participant will collect the urine over a 24-hour
           period. Participant will be provided with a container to collect the urine in.

        -  If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have x-rays of
           participant's entire body to check for any bone fractures or tumors in the bone.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, participant will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons)
           or urine pregnancy test.

        -  If participant was found to have plasmacytomas at screening, participant may have CT
           scans, PET/CT scans, or MRI to measure them.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      After participant's end-of-study drug visit, participant will be called every 3 months for 1
      year and every 6 months after that to see how participant is doing. These calls will take
      about 2-3 minutes.
