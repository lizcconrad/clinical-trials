  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group
      study, in male and female subjects who will be assigned into 1 of 3 treatment groups based on
      1:1:1 ratio. Following a 2 week run-in phase all subjects will receive treatment for 1 year
      (52 weeks) followed by a final follow up 2 weeks after their last visit, during this time
      subjects will be required to attend 10 clinic visits while the final follow up can be
      completed by telephone. Throughout the study subjects will be assessed on a mixture of
      symptom based measurements as well as lung function tests to monitor their progress in the
      study.
