  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomised case-controlled trial is to investigate whether ablation of
      incompetent perforating vein in addition to ablation of truncal vein reduces the rate of
      recurrent varicose veins post-treatment compared with patients who only have ablation of the
      truncal vein, who are left with untreated incompetent perforating veins.
