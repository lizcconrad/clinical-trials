      BACKGROUND: Lumbar spinal stenosis - known by patients as &quot;arthritis of the spine&quot; - is a
      condition that is very common; found in about 30% of older adults. It is the most common
      reason for people over the age of 65 to have back surgery. Some patients with stenosis do not
      need back surgery and can be treated with other methods, such as physical therapy,
      chiropractic, exercise, and medication. But we just don't have enough good research to tell
      us which treatment works best for which patient and under which circumstances. This research
      study hopes to provide more information about the effectiveness of the various non-surgical
      choices for managing stenosis.

      OBJECTIVES: This study will directly compare the effectiveness of three common non-surgical
      treatment approaches for stenosis:

        1. Medical care that involves prescription medications and/or spinal injections (epidurals)

        2. Group exercise in supervised classes given in a community center setting

        3. Hands-on (manual) therapy and rehabilitative exercises given in a clinic setting by
           physical therapists and chiropractors

      METHODS: This research study will involve 259 adults who are at least 60 years old and have
      been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis. The research volunteers will be divided into
      three groups, each group receiving one of the 3 types of treatments listed above under
      &quot;Objectives&quot;. The determination of which type of treatment each person receives will be
      determined by chance, using a computerized version of flipping a coin. This is a process
      known as randomization, which scientists think reduces the bias in research studies. A series
      of tests and questionnaires will be given to the patients before and after they get treatment
      and comparisons will be made to see how much improvement they made with each of the types of
      treatments. Finally, the researchers will compare the differences between the 3 treatment
      groups to see if certain types of treatment produced better results than others, and if there
      were any examination findings that could be used to predict which type of patient would do
      better with which type of treatment.

      BACKGROUND: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a condition that is highly prevalent in the
      senior citizen population. LSS is the most frequent indication for spinal surgery in patients
      over the age of 65 years. The fastest growth in lumbar surgery in the U.S. this past decade
      has occurred in older adults with LSS and the rate of complex fusion procedures has increased
      15-fold. These surgical procedures are associated with significant health care costs, risks,
      complications, and re-hospitalization rates. Yet, evidence is lacking for the effectiveness
      of the various non-surgical treatments offered to patients with LSS. This knowledge gap has
      greatly hindered the development of clinical practice guidelines relevant to the non-surgical
      treatment approaches for LSS.

      OBJECTIVES: This study will perform a comparison of three common approaches to the
      non-surgical management and treatment of patients with LSS. The specific research questions
      associated with this study are: (1) How do group exercise and manual therapy with
      rehabilitative exercise compare with medical care? (2) How do group exercise and manual
      therapy with rehabilitative exercise compare with each other? (3) Are there any baseline
      predictors associated with clinical improvement in any of these non-surgical treatment
      approaches? The long term objective of this study is to produce research evidence relevant to
      community stakeholders and to inform better decision making about non-surgical treatment
      options available to LSS patients.

      METHODS: This will be a comparative effectiveness study utilizing the research design of a
      randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). It will be a 3-group RCT that allows for
      pragmatic treatment approaches in each of the three study arms. The study sample will consist
      of 259 older adults (&gt;60 years) who have symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of LSS, which
      will be confirmed by clinical examination and diagnostic imaging. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized into one of three pragmatic treatment approaches: 1) medical care; 2) group
      exercise; or 3) manual therapy with rehabilitative exercise.

      All subjects will be treated for a 6-week course of care. Primary outcome measures are two
      validated research measurement tools; the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire (self-reported
      pain/function) and the Self Paced Walking Test (performance-based measure). We will also
      employ a novel secondary outcome measure; the Sense Wear Armband which provides a real-time
      measure of physical activity during normal daily living.

    <measure>Swiss Spinal Stenosis (SSS) Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary End-Point was 8 weeks ( 2 weeks after completion of 6-week intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary aim included a primary outcome measure of self-reported pain/function, which was the change in SSS total score between baseline and 8 weeks. The Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire (SSS) is a validated 12-item condition-specific instrument for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. It provides a patient self-report measure of pain and physical function. Higher scores represent worse symptoms and less physical function. The 12-item SSS total score range is 12-55. For our analysis, we compared the change in the 12-item Total score from baseline to 8 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Self Paced Walking Test (SPWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary end-point was 8 weeks ( 2 weeks after 6 week intervention is completed).</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary aim also included a performance-based outcome measure, which was the distance walked during the SPWT. The analysis was a comparison of between-group changes in SPWT between baseline and 8 weeks. The Self-Paced Walking Test (SPWT) is a validated objective measure of a patient's walking capacity, which is performed on a level walking surface. The patient is instructed to walk at their own pace and to stop when the symptoms are troublesome enough that s/he needs to sit down to rest. The total time and total distance walked are measured by the research assistant. Our unit of measure was the total distance walked, expressed in meters.</description>

    <measure>Sense Wear Armband</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary End-Point was 8 weeks ( 2 weeks after completion of 6-week intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary aim was to measure the change in physical activity between baseline and 8 weeks using the Sense Wear armband (SWA). The outcome measure was the average number of minutes spent daily performing physical activities &gt;1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs).The SWA is a small device that collects information from multiple sensors: a triaxial accelerometer, heat flux, skin temperature, and galvanic signal. The information is integrated and processed by software using proprietary algorithms utilizing subjects' demographic characteristics (gender, age, height, and weight) to provide minute-by-minute estimates of physical activity. The SWA has shown good reliability and validity. The research participants in our study will wear the SWA for a week before and after they complete the treatment interventions.</description>

        <description>Our primary aim included a primary outcome measure of self-reported pain/function, which was the change in SSS total score between baseline and 8 weeks. The Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire (SSS) is a validated 12-item condition-specific instrument for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. It provides a patient self-report measure of pain and physical function. Higher scores represent worse symptoms and less physical function. The 12-item SSS total score range is 12-55. For our analysis, we compared the change in the 12-item Total score from baseline to 8 weeks.</description>

The analysis was a comparison of between-group changes in SPWT between baseline and 8 weeks. The Self-Paced Walking Test (SPWT) is a validated objective measure of a patient's walking capacity, which is performed on a level walking surface. The patient is instructed to walk at their own pace and to stop when the symptoms are troublesome enough that s/he needs to sit down to rest. The total time and total distance walked are measured by the research assistant. Our unit of measure was the total distance walked, expressed in meters.</description>

        <title>Sense Wear Armband</title>
        <description>Our secondary aim was to measure the change in physical activity between baseline and 8 weeks using the Sense Wear armband (SWA). The outcome measure was the average number of minutes spent daily performing physical activities &gt;1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs).The SWA is a small device that collects information from multiple sensors: a triaxial accelerometer, heat flux, skin temperature, and galvanic signal. The information is integrated and processed by software using proprietary algorithms utilizing subjects' demographic characteristics (gender, age, height, and weight) to provide minute-by-minute estimates of physical activity.

          <title>Sense Wear Armband</title>
          <description>Our secondary aim was to measure the change in physical activity between baseline and 8 weeks using the Sense Wear armband (SWA). The outcome measure was the average number of minutes spent daily performing physical activities &gt;1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs).The SWA is a small device that collects information from multiple sensors: a triaxial accelerometer, heat flux, skin temperature, and galvanic signal. The information is integrated and processed by software using proprietary algorithms utilizing subjects' demographic characteristics (gender, age, height, and weight) to provide minute-by-minute estimates of physical activity. The SWA has shown good reliability and validity. The research participants in our study will wear the SWA for a week before and after they complete the treatment interventions.</description>
