    <textblock>
      The Mirabilis High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Treatment System delivers therapeutic
      focused ultrasound energy to the uterus under integrated ultrasound imaging guidance to offer
      non-invasive treatment for uterine fibroids. The purpose of this clinical study is to assess
      the initial safety and performance of the Mirabilis HIFU Treatment System for transabdominal
      treatment of uterine fibroids in eligible women who are scheduled to undergo hysterectomy
      following treatment with the device or who are seeking relief from fibroid-related symptoms.

    <measure>Evaluation of All Adverse Events Encountered</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse Events were monitored until the patient's exit from the study (up to 6 months post-treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the treatment was determined by evaluating the incidence of Adverse Events and Adverse Device Effects. Adverse Device Effects are Adverse Events that are related to treatment with the device. Relatedness of an Adverse Event to the treatment was determined on a case-by-case basis by the investigator. The average number of Serious Adverse Device Effects per patient and the average number of Non-Serious Adverse Device Effects per patient are reported to provide numeric outcomes of this evaluation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HIFU-related Non-Perfused Volume (NPV)</measure>
    <time_frame>The NPV was measured between 0 and 7 days post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of the treatment was quantified by measuring the HIFU-related Non-Perfused Volume (NPV) of tissue in each patient using either post-treatment contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or pathology assessment following hysterectomy. The NPV is used to measure the amount of tissue that was treated during the procedure.</description>

      <recruitment_details>All patients underwent transabdominal uterine fibroid treatment with the Mirabilis High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment System between January 8, 2011 and November 21, 2014 at two clinical sites in Mexico. The study was completed on May 20, 2015.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients were screened prior to treatment for eligibility criteria including size, location, and tissue characteristics of their uterine fibroid(s). Those patients meeting the established eligibility criteria were then scheduled for treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>HIFU-related Non-Perfused Volume (NPV)</title>
        <description>Efficacy of the treatment was quantified by measuring the HIFU-related Non-Perfused Volume (NPV) of tissue in each patient using either post-treatment contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or pathology assessment following hysterectomy. The NPV is used to measure the amount of tissue that was treated during the procedure.</description>
        <time_frame>The NPV was measured between 0 and 7 days post-treatment.</time_frame>
        <population>HIFU-related Non-Perfused Volumes (NPVs) are reported for all treated patients in whom they were observed following treatment. NPV outcomes are stratified between two cohorts: an early Development Cohort and a final Validation Cohort.</population>
