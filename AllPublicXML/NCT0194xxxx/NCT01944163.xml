      Rationale: Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is an inflammatory back pain disorder affecting up
      to 24% of young chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. For general practitioners (GPs) it is
      difficult to distinguish axSpA patients in the large amount of CLBP patients. In previous
      studies a referral rule for axSpA applicable in CLBP patients was developed and validated.
      The next step is to investigate the impact of the referral rule in daily practice. This
      impact analysis will test if the referral rule will be beneficial or harmful.

      Objective: To evaluate the clinical impact of a referral rule in young patients presenting at
      the general practitioners with chronic low back pain, who are at risk for axSpA, compared to
      usual care.

      Study design: A cluster randomized clinical trial. Study population: Primary care patients
      with chronic low back pain, aged 18-45 years.

      Intervention (if applicable): GPs are randomized in clusters either to use directly the
      referral rule or use the referral rule after 4 months. The referral rule consists out of four
      variables, a positive ASAS inflammatory back pain questionnaire, a positive family history
      for spondyloarthritis, a good reaction to NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and
      back pain duration longer than 5 years. If at least two out of four variables are present a
      referral to the rheumatologist is advised.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is a change in the Roland Morris
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) compared to baseline in the CLBP patients with or without use
      of the referral model.

      Secondary parameters: Quality of life measurements, cost-effectiveness, pain and fatigue and
      referral to rheumatologist and diagnosis of axSpA.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      The burden and risks associated with participation are minimal. No medical intervention is
      taken place. If the GP of the patients is randomized to the referral model, the patient is
      checked for the risk of axial spondyloarthritis, by the non-invasive referral model. If the
      referral model is positive a referral to the rheumatologist is advised. Is the GP is
      randomized to the 'usual care' there is no difference in the treatment of low back pain than
      nowadays. A GP is still allowed to treat the CLBP patients optimal and a referral to the
      rheumatologist is allowed but not actively advised.

      All participating CLBP patients are asked to fill several questionnaires at four different
      time points, at baseline, after 12 months and after 24 months. In total there are 8
      questionnaires and four separate questions. The questionnaire are designed to fill out by the
      patient themselves. The total time to fill in the questionnaire is estimated to be 30
      minutes.

      The benefits of the study are:

        -  For the CLBP patients, up to 24% of the back pain complaints are caused by axSpA, but
           the GPs are not (yet) aware of this disease. When a CLBP patient is participating in
           this study, the chance of having axSpA as cause for the back pain is investigated. This
           a benefit for a CLBP patients since there is effective treatment for axSpA.

        -  For the GP it is very difficult to distinguish an axSpA patients in the large amount of
           CLBP patients. If it appears that the validated referral rule has an impact on CLBP and
           GPs, the next step will be implementation of this referral model in daily practice and
           it will become a helpful tool for the GP.

        -  For the society, CLBP is a great socioeconomic burden for the society. When one of the
           causes for CLBP, namely axSpA is diagnosed and treated in an earlier stage this will
           lead to a decreased sick leave because of back pain and is therefore potentially
           cost-effective.
