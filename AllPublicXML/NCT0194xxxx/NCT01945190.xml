  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture is used extensively by patients worldwide for a variety of illnesses. While
      research is beginning to show effectiveness in clinical pain, the mechanisms underlying how
      these effects are evoked are poorly understood. Experimental models in healthy human
      volunteers can more closely control the variables of acupuncture needling and begin to
      separate out the relative contribution of specific components of needling and needle
      stimulation. By examining acupuncture's effects on experimental inflammatory models with
      well-characterized physiologic mechanisms, hypotheses can begin to be generated regarding how
      acupuncture produces its clinical effects. We propose to establish a model which could be
      used as a template to examine the individual components contributing to acupuncture's
      clinical effects on inflammation and pain. We hypothesize that acupuncture will have
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects on a ultraviolet B induced cutaneous lesion as well
      as a model of heat pain testing which activates central sensitization.

      Twenty healthy human volunteers will participate in a crossover study with active acupuncture
      and sham acupuncture interventions. They will be tested for their minimal erythemal dose
      (MED) to ultraviolet B exposure. An experimental lesion at 3x MED will be administered on the
      lower leg. Background information will be collected which could affect individuals'
      sensitivity to pain such as anxiety and depression, as well as their expectations regarding
      acupuncture treatment.

      The following day they will return for the first experimental day. A measurement with Laser
      Doppler will quantify the inflammation in the ultraviolet B lesion. Heat pain testing will be
      performed using a computer controlled thermode both on and off the ultraviolet B lesion.
      On-lesion testing will be for heat pain threshold. Off-lesion testing will examine temporal
      summation of heat pain.

      Next, a licensed acupuncturist will perform either true electroacupuncture or sham
      electroacupuncture in the region adjacent to the ultraviolet B lesion. Participants are
      blinded to the intervention, as is the examiner collecting data. Afterwards, Laser Doppler
      and heat pain testing will be repeated. The difference between pre-acupuncture and
      post-acupuncture measurements will represent the acupuncture -induced analgesic and
      anti-inflammatory effects.

      Participants will return for another ultraviolet B exposure adjacent to the first, and will
      receive whichever sham or true acupuncture intervention was not performed on the first study
      day.
