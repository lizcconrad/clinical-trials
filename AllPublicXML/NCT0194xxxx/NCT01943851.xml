  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label repeat dose, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given once-daily
      (QD) orally. Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended Part 2
      dose (RP2D) based on the safety, PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of
      GSK525762. Eligible subjects with select relapsed refractory hematological malignancies
      (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma [NHL]and multiple myeloma [MM]), will
      be enrolled in the QD and/or BID dosing cohorts until a MTD is established. Subjects may
      continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of consent. . Upon determination of the MTD, twice daily (BID) dosing cohorts may
      be opened to collect additional safety data and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of
      GSK525762 administered BID. Part 2 will explore clinical activity at the MTD or RP2D;
      separate expansion cohorts will be planned for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (NHL, including an exploratory sub-cohort of subjects with myc and B-Cell Leukemia
      (BCL)2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements/overexpression [double- and triple-hit lymphoma]), and
      multiple myeloma (MM). This is the first study of this agent to be conducted in subjects with
      these relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies for which no standard therapies
      are anticipated to result in a durable remission.

        be eligible for this sub-cohort, tumor sample from the subject must demonstrate
        rearrangement and/or overexpression of MYC and either BCL2 and/or BCL6 genes. Evaluation of
        double- or triple-hit status may be performed via appropriate local testing, and the
        determination of double- or triple-hit diagnosis will be at the discretion of the
        investigator and GSK Medical Monitor.

          -  Subjects with a prior history of stem cell transplant (autologous and/or allogeneic)
             are allowed if

             a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40
             milli-International units per milliliter and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per milliliter
             (&lt; 140 picomole per liter) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy
             (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the
             contraception methods defined in protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least two
             to four weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their

             contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the
             contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
             label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk
             of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at

             28 days (whichever is longer) following the last dose of study treatment.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the methods of contraception specified. This
             method must be used from the time of the first dose of study medication until 16 weeks
             after the last dose of study medication. In addition, male subjects whose partners are
             or become pregnant must continue to use condoms for 7 days after stopping study
             medications.
