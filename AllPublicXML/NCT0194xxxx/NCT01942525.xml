      Objective: The impact of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) on perinatal morbidity and
      long-term neurodevelopmental outcome has been published in numerous studies. Throughout this
      analysis, the influence of IUGR on the postnatal amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) in preterm
      infants below 30 weeks of gestation was assessed. The second concern was the correlation
      between the pattern of the aEEG in the first two weeks with neurodevelopmental outcome,
      comparing infants with and without IUGR.

      Methods: Routinely assessed aEEG data of preterm infants with IUGR born below 30 weeks of
      gestation in the years 2005 until 2007 were analysed retrospectively according to the aEEG
      score (combining occurrence of sleep-wake-cycles, background activity and suspected seizure
      activity). Neurodevelopmental outcome was evaluated at 24 months using the Bayley Scales of
      Infant Development and standardized neurologic examination.

        Retrospectively, children with intrauterine growth restriction (defined as a birth weight
        below the 10th percentile) treated at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the
        Medical University Vienna between 2005 and 2007 were included in the study. Besides IUGR,
        inclusion criteria were gestational age between 23+1 and 29+6 weeks and routinely assessed
        aEEG measurements. Infants with congenital anomalies and severe asphyxia were excluded. The
        control group consists of infants of the same age with normal birth weight (&gt;10th
        percentile) in the same study period.
