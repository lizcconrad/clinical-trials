  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators test the hypothesis that automated FiO2 adjustment increases
      the time of brain tissue oxygenation within the intended reference range. Furthermore, the
      investigators studied the change in workload during automated FiO2 adjustment as compared to
      manual adjustment by the nursing staff.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recorded data on brain tissue oxygenation will be compared with reference data obtained from
      other studies. Data from experimental mode (automated FiO2 control will be compared with
      manual FiO2 control).

    <description>Infants will be changed to a specific ventilator device approved for clinical use in neonates in Germany (Avea, Carefusion 234 GmbH Hoechberg, Germany), which is capable to automatically adjust the FiO2 based on readings of an incorporated SpO2 monitoring device. Infants will be allowed to adjust for at least 2h using the ventilator settings as chosen by the clinical team responsible. Thereafter, data will be recorded for 24h experimental time.</description>
