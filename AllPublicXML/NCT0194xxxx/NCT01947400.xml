  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction is an important aspect of care and is gaining increasing importance as a
      measure of Healthcare quality. Tools for improving physician-patient communication are
      available but have not yet been tested in the Hospital setting. The purpose of this project
      is to determine if training in AIDET (Acknowledge, Introduce, Duration, Explanation, Thank)
      communication method improves physician-patient communication. Patient satisfaction data will
      be compared to historical controls using modified HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of
      Health Plans Survey) as the primary outcome measure. In addition, a validation of delivery of
      AIDET communication will be accomplished through administration of questionnaires to
      patients.

      This is a process of change study, which will compare HCAHPS patient satisfaction surveys
      before and after the Hospitalist receives AIDET physician-patient communication training.
      Once the Hospitalists agree to participate in the study, they will receive AIDET training by
      a Studor Group certified trainer. Both before and after the training intervention,
      Hospitalists' use of the AIDET method will be validated by having patients complete anonymous
      questionnaires during their hospital stay.

      All HCAHPS surveys will be conducted by an external patient satisfaction survey vendor, and
      information will be de-identified both in terms of patient and specific Hospitalist.
      Validation questionnaires will be distributed by administrative staff, and will also be
      de-identified both in terms of patient and specific Hospitalist.
