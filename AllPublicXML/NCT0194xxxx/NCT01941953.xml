      Primary Outcomes Measures:

      - Disease control Rate at 8 weeks according to RECIST 1.1 (Tumor response was defined as the
      percentage of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease as best
      overall response).

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Progression-free Survival

        -  Overall Survival

        -  Adverse Events (assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE) version 4.0)
