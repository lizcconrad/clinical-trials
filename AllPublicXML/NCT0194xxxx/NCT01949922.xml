      Aim:

      To investigate efficacy and safety in a new treatment with injection of autologous muscle
      fibers into the anal sphincter in patients with fecal incontinence.

      Method:

      Patients with fecal incontinence after obstetric anal sphincter rupture will be included.
      After inclusion, they will be offered 3 months of pelvic floor muscle training. If the
      patients after completion of pelvic floor muscle training still suffer from fecal
      incontinence, the patients will be offered treatment with autologous muscle fiber injection
      into the anal sphincter. The patients will be followed one year after the injection. The
      autologous muscle fibers are harvested at the patients leg muscle, cut into small pieces and
      injected into the anal sphincter. A small part of the fibers are used for analysing number of
      muscle stem cells and thereby the regenerative potential of the sample.

      The study is a pilot study.
