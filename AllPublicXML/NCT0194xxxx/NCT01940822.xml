  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the cardiovascular response, if any, to intake of
      commercially available energy drink. We hypothesize that energy drink consumption compared to
      a control drink in healthy adults alters the cardiovascular hemodynamic system.The focus of
      this study is to elucidate the physiological/cardiovascular response to an energy drink
      consumption as compared to a control drink both at rest and during stressful conditions in
      healthy adults.

      The study will collect data to determine the hemodynamic changes (magnitude of heart rate and
      blood pressure response) in healthy adults after consumption of an energy drink and compare
      these responses to those after a control drink. Study will be performed at a hospital
      Clinical Research Unit on two separate days; minimum 24 hours and maximum 1 month apart.
      Participants will be fasting 4 hours prior to the study and will be asked to abstain from
      caffeine and alcohol for at least 24 hours prior to initiation of this study. Baseline
      measurements will be obtained during and after 10 minutes of rest. After the end of baseline
      recordings, the subjects will be given up to 500 ml (1 can, approximately 16 fluid ounces) of
      caffeinated energy drink or a control drink, based on randomization. They will have 30
      minutes to drink it. The second set of measurements will be obtained after an energy drink or
      control drink intake, using exactly the same protocol as at baseline. The second study visit,
      participant will receive the alternate intervention.
