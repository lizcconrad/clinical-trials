    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as
      mirikizumab. The study will investigate how the body processes the study drug and how the
      drug affects the body. The study will last about 3 months for each participant.

        Inclusion Criteria (Psoriasis participants):

          -  Are willing and able to washout topicals for at least 14 days before baseline on the 2
             target lesions

        Inclusion Criteria (Healthy participants):

          -  Are overtly healthy males or females, as determined by medical history and physical
             examination

          -  Are women not of childbearing potential

             inclusive, and a minimum body weight of 55 kg

          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the central

        Exclusion Criteria (Psoriasis and healthy participants):

          -  Have received treatment with biologic therapies for psoriasis (such as monoclonal
             antibodies, including marketed or investigational biologic therapy). Prior or current
             use of biologics for indications other than psoriasis may be allowed with sponsor
             approval

          -  Within 28 days prior to baseline: have received systemic nonbiologic psoriasis therapy

          -  Within 14 days prior to baseline: have received topical psoriasis treatment

          -  Have presence of significant uncontrolled cerebro-cardiovascular, respiratory,
             hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, neurologic or
             neuropsychiatric disorders or abnormal laboratory values at screening that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject if participating
             in the study or of interfering with the interpretation of data

          -  Have had clinically significant symptomatic herpes zoster within 3 months of screening

          -  Show evidence of active or latent tuberculosis (TB)

          -  Have received live vaccine(s) (included attenuated live vaccines) within 1 month of

          -  Have significant allergies to humanized monoclonal antibodies or any components of the
             mirikizumab product formulation or have a history of significant atopy

          -  Have had lymphoma, leukemia, or any malignancy within the past 5 years, except for
             basal cell or squamous epithelial carcinomas of the skin that have been resected with
             no evidence of metastatic disease for 3 years and cervical carcinoma in situ, with no
             evidence of recurrence within 5 years prior to baseline
