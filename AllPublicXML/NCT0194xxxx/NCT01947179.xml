    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and usability of a computer-based
      treatment for mood and anxiety relevant risk factors. The target of the treatment is related
      to cognitive stress, which has been shown to be associated with several negative mental
      health outcomes such as suicidal ideation, substance use disorders, and Post-Traumatic Stress
      Disorder.

      CAST is a newly developed computerized treatment targeting specific risk factors associated
      with PTSD, substance use, anxiety, and suicide. Eligible individuals will be randomized to
      one of two conditions. In both conditions, participants will complete various self-report
      questionnaires and a computerized presentation. Additionally, all participants will be asked
      to complete a one month follow-up appointment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month one follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ASI is a 16-item self-report measure of anxiety sensitivity. Each item consists of a possible negative consequence of anxiety symptoms. The scale assesses three AS subfactors including cognitive, physical, and social concerns. The measure has shown good psychometric properties.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Suicide Scale (BSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month one follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The BSS is a 21-item widely used self-report measure assessing a broad spectrum of behaviors and attitudes related to suicide risk, including suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts. It has demonstrated strong reliability and validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month one follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PDS is a self-report measure used to assess the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms during the past month. The measure was designed based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria. Respondents report if they have experienced any of 12 traumatic events, including an &quot;other&quot; category, and then indicate which event was the most disturbing. Additionally, respondents rate the frequency of 17 PTSD symptoms experienced in the past month in relation to the most disturbing event they endorsed. The PDS has excellent psychometric properties and can be used as a continuous measure of PTSD symptom severity.</description>
