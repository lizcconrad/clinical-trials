  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3s), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA), have anti-inflammatory properties and other documented beneficial health effects that
      could warrant n-3 fortification of combat rations. However, military combat rations must meet
      rigorous shelf-stability guidelines (e.g.,, 3 years at 80°F or 6 months at 100°F), which is
      problematic for natural food sources of n-3s (e.g., oil and fish), which degrade when exposed
      to high temperatures and prolonged shelf-storage. Encapsulation, e.g., coating freeze dried
      n-3s with gelatin, can prevent this degradation, and Natick Soldier Research, Development and
      Engineering Center's (NSRDEC) Combat Feeding Directorate used encapsulated n-3 technology to
      produce n-3 enriched ration items that withstand environmental stressors and meet shelf-life
      specifications for military rations. However, the bioavailability of the encapsulated n-3s in
      these rations is unknown, particularly when they are incorporated into high-protein food
      items and exposed to high temperatures and prolonged storage. In this randomized, cross-over
      study, civilian and/or military personnel will be asked to consume: 1) a high protein food
      item enriched with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) and previously stored for 6 months at 100°F; 2)
      a low-protein food item enriched with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) and previously stored for 6
      months at 100°F; 3) a high protein food item with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) that was not
      subjected to high-temperature and prolonged storage; and, 4) a low-protein food item with
      encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) that was not subjected to high temperature and prolonged storage.
      Serial blood sampling to measure acute changes in the circulating fatty acid profile will
      occur in the hour before and 6 hours after consumption of each ration component. The only
      known risks, which this study presents to participants, are those associated with venous
      catheter placement. The results will help military ration developers determine the ration
      components best suited for n-3 fortification.
