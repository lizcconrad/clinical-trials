  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain score after inguinal hernia repair surgery in children decreased as time passed in
      previous studies. Postoperative oral intake is usually resumed two hours after minor surgery
      in most of institutions, that may influence children's behavior and pain score.

      A recent study suggest that oral intake one hour after minor surgery does not increase the
      incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.

      The investigators primary endpoint is to clarify whether postoperative oral intake influences
      postoperative pain score in children.
