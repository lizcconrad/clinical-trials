  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of brain metastases (BM) in metastatic breast cancer is increasing, due to the
      improvement in the control of systemic disease, and due to an improved detection through
      imagery.

      The treatment management of single BM remains controversial. Indeed, even though it is widely
      accepted that local treatment increases the median survival time in patients having a good
      prognostic status, the adding of &quot;adjuvant&quot; whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is currently
      subject to controversy, due to its potential toxicity. Yet, two randomized trials have
      demonstrated a clear increase in intra-cerebral recurrence and in death from neurologic
      origin in case of absence of &quot;adjuvant&quot; WBRT, without change in overall survival (but overall
      survival was not a primary endpoint in any of these studies).

      The data from literature on cognitive toxicity (CT) of WBRT on BM are scarce and sometimes
      controversial. CT of WBRT affects the subcortical frontal functions. It is postulated that
      the alteration of hippocampal neurogenesis (mainly due to inflammation process), situated in
      the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, has an essential role in the development of these
      brain dysfunctions.

      It has been shown that the incidence of BM in the hippocampal region (hippocampus + 5mm
      expansion) is low, in the range of 8,6%.

      New irradiation techniques, in particular intensity-modulated radiotherapy associated with
      rotational radiotherapy, allow to modulate the dose on an intra-cerebral structure, all the
      while distributing an adapted dose to the remaining brain.

      This prospective, randomized study, will compare, through a battery of neuropsychological
      tests, the cognitive impact of WBRT of 40 Gy in 20 fractions with or without hippocampal
      avoidance by intensity modulated radiotherapy, in patients presenting with a single operated
      brain metastasis of breast cancer. If the hippocampal avoidance leads to a significant
      improvement in cognitive function, this radiotherapy scheme could become the standard
      postoperative treatment to be proposed to patients presenting the best prognostic factors.
      This would allow to prevent long-term cognitive deficit, while preserving WBRT benefit on
      intra-cerebral control.

      Justification of evaluation criteria :

      Principal criteria :

      Evaluation criteria to assess cognitive toxicity have been selected on the basis of the
      recommendations from C. Meyers and P. Brown, who propose an adapted test battery to evaluate
      memory, verbal function, visual and motor coordination, and executive function. The selected
      tests have been validated, also in French. They comprise HVLT-R (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test
      Revised), COWAT (Controlled Oral Word Association Test), Grooved Pegboard test, TMT A and B
      (Trailmaking tests A and B), and MMSE. The calculation of patient numbers was based on the
      HVLT-R test, as memory is thought to be the most frequently affected domain.

      The tests will be performed before treatment (&quot;baseline&quot; cognitive function), at 4 months and
      at 12 months. In case of a missing answer to the evaluation tests, the reason(s) for not
      answering will be noted.

      Secondary criteria :

      Quality of life : QLQ-C30, QLQ-BN20, ADL, IADL Intra-cerebral Progression-free survival (PFS)
      Overall survival.
