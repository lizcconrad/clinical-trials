  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combination of TS-1 and concurrent and
      short-course radiotherapy is feasible in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The rationale of this
      study primarily bases on the good efficacy of gemcitabine plus TS-1 and the great potential
      of local control of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in pancreatic cancer.

    <description>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are defined as the following manifestations of toxicity observed until completion of CCRT:

grade 3 leucopenia and/or neutropenia with infection
grade 4 leucopenia and/or neutropenia lasting 3 days or more
grade 4 leucopenia and/or neutropenia requiring G-CSF
platelet &lt; 25,000/mm3

hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL
g. serum AST/ALT ≥ 10 times ULN h. total bilirubin ≥ 3 times ULN i. creatinine &gt;3.0 - 6.0 times ULN (grade 3) i. grade 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicities including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, constipation, hyperglycemia, and abnormality of sodium, potassium, and calcium If three or more patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then the previous dose level will be considered as the MTD.</description>
