  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, we evaluate the effect of the mother suplementación with DHA during the
      gestation and lactation on diverse aspects of the development of newborn. The effect on the
      oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling, bone turnover and piscomotor and visual development
      was studied. Women will in the sixth month of pregnancy, consume a diet balanced during last
      3 months of pregnancy and the whole lactation. In addition the women will divide in two
      groups: one will receive a supplement of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to evaluate the effects
      on the development of the newborn child; whereas another group will receive a placebo.
      Different samples of blood of the mother and of mother milk will be taken and we will
      correlating her lipidic profile with the brain development of the newborn child, evaluated by
      different tests.

      The sample will be 120 volunteers that will be enrolled in the services of Gynaecology of the
      infantile Hospital of Granada. The pregnant women will be assigned from random form to one of
      2 groups that are described later:

      Group A: balanced diet Mediterranean, intake of 2 glasses / day of the dairy drink control.

      Group B: balanced Mediterranean diet together with the consumption of 400mg/day of DHA in the
      dairy product (2 glasses / day). The dairy products will be distributed in white packages
      without any indication that reflects the type of product that contains (double blind). Every
      volunteer will be assigned a key that guarantees the confidentiality of their analytical
      values.

      The dietary intervention will begin in the sixth month of pregnancy and will conclude to the
      third month of lactation (though there will improve itself the importance of a mother
      lactation up to 6 month postpartum). There will be obtained samples of blood (5 mL) of the
      mothers in the moment of the capture, in the childbirth and to 3 postpartum months. There
      will take a sample of blood of umbilical cord (5mL) in the moment of the childbirth (vein and
      artery). In addition there will take a sample of blood of the child (5mL) to 2.5 months.
      There will take also samples of mother milk (10mL), concretely of colostrum (2-3 postpartum
      days) and of mature(ripe) milk to 1, 2, 3 months. The samples will be preserved in freezer
      of-80ºC and sent to the different laboratories due preserved participants in order that there
      does not break the cold chain ( dry ice). In the first year of life of the child there will
      be practised tests of motive and cognitive development (Bayley's test and Fagan's test) in
      order to evaluate the influence of the dietetic intervention on the mother in the development
      of the child.
