    <textblock>
      The mortality rate of oral cancer in Taiwan is still high with no decrease. One of the
      reasons result in these situations is the patent visits hospital for treatment in late stage
      of oral cancer. Recently, the government makes effort in oral cancer screening to find oral
      potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) early. However, there is no conscience in treatment
      strategies of OPMD up to now. In this study, we will set a OPMD data bank, and use the cases
      to find out the potential biomarker, which is able to predict the oral cancer malignant
      transformation. Sixty OPMD with oral cancer transformation will be recruited, and 60 OPMD
      with no oral cancer malignant transformation will also be enrolled as the disease control
      group. Besides, 20 normal cases and 60 oral cancer cases resulting from previous OPMD will be
      collected. All those groups will detect the expression of p62/SQSTM1 to investigate the
      possibility that p62/SQSTM1 as a biomarker to predict the malignant transformation of OPMM,
      and a guideline to treat or not to treat OPMD.
