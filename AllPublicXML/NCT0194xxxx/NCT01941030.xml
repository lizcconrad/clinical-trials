      This prospective, randomized, multi-center, post-market study of approximately 50 subjects
      randomized 1:1 to Orbital Atherectomy (OA) performed with Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.'s
      Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty (BA) vs. BA alone
      for treatment of tibial vessel disease, defined as ≥ 50 % stenosis of the anterior tibial
      (AT), posterior tibial (PT), tibial peroneal trunk (TPT), or peroneal (PR) arteries by
      angiography. All subjects will have a corresponding wound being fed by the target vessel
      which will be assessed during the study.

    <measure>Change in Plaque Volume and Composition via IVUS</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, and post-balloon angioplasty</time_frame>
    <description>The pre- and post-treatment vessel size and plaque volume/composition in both study arms will be assessed via independent review of the IVUS images collected during the study by the IVUS Core Lab. The plaque burden will be broken down into the contributing percentages of each of the our primary plaque components: Fibrotic, Fibrofatty, Necrotic core, Dense calcium.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fractional Flow Reserve</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-orbital atherectomy (OA arm only) and post-balloon angioplasty (both arms)</time_frame>
    <description>Fractional flow reserve (FFR) will be measured to assess hemodynamic function following each device procedure. During FFR, adenosine will be given through the femoral artery sheath or access catheter in two doses: 600 mcg and 1200 mcg to determine the optimal hyperemic dose. A higher FFR is presumed to correlate to better flow which may improve wound healing. Some sites may be exempt from performing FFR.</description>
