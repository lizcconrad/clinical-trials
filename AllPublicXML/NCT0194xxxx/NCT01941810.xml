  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well bovine lactoferrin supplement works in improving
      taste in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Bovine lactoferrin supplement may help
      improve the ability to taste food in patients who are receiving chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation (bovine lactoferrin supplement) on
      self-reported taste and smell disturbances in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the baseline lipid peroxidation
      byproducts in saliva in cancer patients as measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactive
      substances (TBARs) assay.

      II. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the ability of cancer patients to
      generate increased lipid peroxidation byproducts when challenged with a weak iron-containing
      solution.

      III. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on self-reported general quality of
      life and on specific self-reported anorexia/cachexia issues in cancer patients with
      established chemotherapy-induced taste disturbances.

      IV. To assess the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in cancer patients with chemotherapy
      induced taste changes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bovine lactoferrin supplement orally (PO) three times daily (TID) for 1
      month.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and 1 month.

             the two exceptions are pancreatic cancer and colon cancer patients who are receiving
             oxaliplatin; those patients will be ineligible for participation in this current study
             but will be eligible for Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University

          -  Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive

             disease; untreated diabetes mellitus; active thrush; active oral infection; active
