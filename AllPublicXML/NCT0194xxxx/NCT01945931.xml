      The purpose of this trial is to determine if the safe delivery smartphone application
      distributed to health workers in Ethiopia will decrease perinatal mortality and the incidence
      of postpartum haemorrhage. It is also the purpose to determine if the safe delivery
      smartphone application distributed to health workers in Ethiopia will increase health workers
      knowledge and skills in intra-partum management of active management of third stage labour 2)
      treatment of post-partum haemorrhage 3) manual removal of placenta and 4) neonatal
      resuscitation.

      Abstract Hypothesis A safe delivery smartphone application distributed to health workers in
      Ethiopia will decrease perinatal mortality and the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage

      A safe delivery smartphone application distributed to health workers in Ethiopia will
      increase health workers knowledge and skills in intra-partum management of active management
      of third stage labour 2) treatment of post-partum haemorrhage 3) manual removal of placenta
      and 4) neonatal resuscitation

      Intervention A safe delivery smartphone application with animated videos to improve clinical
      management during delivery will be introduced in the intervention clusters

      Design Cluster randomized controlled trial with health facilities as the unit of
      randomization

      Area Nole Kaba, Haru, Homa, Genji and Gimbie districts in Ethiopia

      Population Pregnant women and their newborns delivered in a randomized health facility. For
      secondary outcomes health workers at randomized health facilities.

      Sample size 77 health facilities with minimum 2 health workers per facility and 30 deliveries
      per health worker

      Duration Pregnant women will be enrolled at delivery and followed to 7 days postpartum

      Outcomes Primary outcomes are perinatal mortality and postpartum haemorrhage. Secondary
      outcomes are health workers knowledge and skills

      Study time Data collection expected from September 2013 to September 2014

    <description>The safe delivery smartphone application is designed to train midwives and other birth attendants in developing countries in management of normal and complicated deliveries. The application is furthermore intended as a reference tool that could be used during clinical work for example for preparation before attending a birth, in a situation when a complication occurs, or for debriefing and self-evaluation after a complication. The application features four animated videos with clinical instructions of 3-8 minutes duration and written lists of essential obstetric drugs (indications, contraindications, dosage and administration and side effects) and essential equipment for a safe delivery.</description>
