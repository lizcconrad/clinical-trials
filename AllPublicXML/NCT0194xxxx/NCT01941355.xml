  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery often experience a range of problems
      and symptoms related to the procedure and the underlying heart disease. These problems
      include anxiety and depressive symptoms, immobility issues, complications such as wound
      seeping, neck and shoulder pains, interrupted and insufficient sleep. Over the last 2
      decades, cardiac rehabilitation has become recognized as a significant component in the
      continuum of care for persons with cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, cardiac
      rehabilitation has undergone a significant evolution moving from a focused exercise
      intervention to a comprehensive disease management program. In Guidelines for Coronary Artery
      Bypass Graft Surgery cardiac rehabilitation is described to include early ambulation during
      hospitalisation, and outpatient prescriptive exercise training beginning 6-8 weeks following
      surgery. Our hypothesis is that physical exercise with moderate intensity and a
      psycho-educative component as a part of cardiac rehabilitation can begin in early
      postoperatively during hospitalising. Results from studies on phase 1 rehabilitation in
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients are promising. However, no randomised trials
      have been conducted, and evidence is therefore lacking.

      The objective of this pilot trial is to investigate the effect of a phase 1 comprehensive
      cardiac rehabilitation programme consisting of a psycho-educative component, an
      exercise-training component including pulmonary training, cycling, neck and shoulder
      exercises, these in combination plus treatment as usual and treatment as usual in patients
      who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting.

      SheppHeartCABG is an investigator-initiated 2 x 2 factorial randomised clinical pilot trial
      with blinded outcome assessment. Recruitment from one site with 1:1:1:1 central randomisation
      to phase 1 rehabilitation; 1) exercise-training plus usual care, 2) psycho-educative plus
      usual care 3) exercise-training and psycho-educative plus usual, 4) usual care alone.

      The explorative outcome measures consist of two parts: physical capacity and mental and
      physical health. Physical capacity is measured by peak VO2 max and 6 minutes' walk test at
      discharge and 4 weeks following surgery. Perceived mental and physical health is measured by
      the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) at admission, discharge and 4 weeks following
      surgery. Furthermore questionnaires measuring anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale), health-related quality of life (HeartQoL), fatigue (MFI-20) cognitive and
      emotional representation of illness (B-IPQ), physical activity (IPAQ), self-rated health
      (EQ-5D), sleep (PSQI) and pain (Ã–MPSQ)
