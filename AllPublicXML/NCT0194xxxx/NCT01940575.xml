      -  Subjects:Adults with nasolabial fold

        -  Investigational Devices:

      Study Device: SkinPlus-Hyal® Comparator Device: Restylane®

      - Procedure Before Treatment: The subject's eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria) will
      be assessed, and the WSRS of his/her nasolabial fold wil be evaluated by the Investigator
      Treatment: The Injector will administer to the eligible subject the Study Device and
      Comparator Device respectively to the left and right nasolabial fold in a randomized manner.
      Post-Treatment: All subjects will visit the hospital at 2, 8, 16, 24 weeks since the day of
      administration, and will take pictures of the Nasolabial fold area and undergo efficacy and
      safety evaluation during each visit. The Photographic evaluator will evaluate the efficacy
