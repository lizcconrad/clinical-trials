      STUDY QUESTION: Which of the four abnormally elevated androgen groups (total testosterone
      [TT], androstenedione [A4], free androgen index [FAI], or dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate
      [DHEA-S]) present with an unfavorable metabolic and hormonal profile, appear to be more
      insulin-resistant and pose additional cardiovascular risk? SUMMARY ANSWER: Subjects with
      excess free androgen index tend to be obese and face the highest metabolic syndrome risk,
      adipocytokine alterations, insulin resistance (IR) and cardiovascular risk. The excess TT
      group presents with a marginal IR risk, while the excess A4 group has the highest
      antimüllerian hormone (AMH), and may counterbalance obesity; this group and the excess DHEA-S
      group have a favorable association with IR.

      STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION:A retrospective study in 160 Taiwanese women with HA and 165
      women without HA, with medical records reviewed from 2009 up to 2012. The hyperandrogenic
      women were classified into four groups (TT, A4, FAI, and DHEA-S) according to independent
      abnormally elevated androgen measures each above its cut-off value, and the groups were
      compared with each other and with controls.

      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: This study was performed in the Reproductive
      Endocrinology Clinic at Wan Fang Medical Center in Taipei, Taiwan. Anthropometric, metabolic,
      endocrine, and IR components as well as lipid accumulation product (LAP) index were compared
      between the groups. IR was assessed with the following markers: fasting glucose and insulin
      levels, oral glucose tolerance test, glucose-to-insulin ratio and homeostasis model
      assessment of IR index (HOMA-IR).

        A retrospective review of the medical records of women who visited the Reproductive
        Endocrinology Clinic was carried out at the Wan Fang Medical Center at Taipei Medical
        University from 2009 and up to 2012. A total of 160 Taiwanese women with hyperandrogenism
        (HA) and 165 women without hyperandrogenism (non-HA) were included in the study.
