  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in a patient population with suspected Coronary Artery Disease CAD) as
      defined by the presence of an abnormal nuclear (PET/SPECT) perfusion scan. In this study
      design, PET/SPECT will serve as the comparative standard for presence of myocardial ischemia.
      We intend to determine the accuracy of a novel MR technique for localization of perfusion
      deficits in comparison to PET/SPECT.

      This is not a study to specifically evaluate the efficacy or safety of the drugs but rather
      the diagnostic accuracy of the cardiac MRI procedure as a whole

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 2 imaging protocols will be used in this study: (1) One-day SPECT protocol, which
      involves the subjects undergoing stress myocardial perfusion SPECT and MRI in the same day;
      (2) Two-day PET/SPECT protocol, which involves MRI of subjects who have had a recent abnormal
      PET/SPECT study and includes an optional second-day visit.

      Two blinded readers will interpret MR and SPECT/PET studies by consensus to assess the
      presence of perfusion deficits at stress and rest.

    <description>Lexiscan® is being used off-label. The FDA Issued IND # is 119898. For the cardiac MRI, Lexiscan® will be used at the same dosage and administration as prescribed in the package insert - 5 mL (0.4 mg regadenoson) as packaged and supplied by the manufacturer, Astellas Pharma U.S., in single-use pre-filled syringes administered by rapid intravenous injection, followed immediately by saline flush.</description>
