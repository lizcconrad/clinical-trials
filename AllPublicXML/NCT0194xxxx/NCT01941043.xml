  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will evaluate the antidepressant effect of CERC-301 during 28 days of
      treatment in subjects with MDD who are currently experiencing a severe depressive episode
      despite stable ongoing treatment with selective serotonin- or serotonin-norepinephrine
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRI or SNRI). The study population will be enriched for subjects that
      would benefit most from rapid onset, those with recent active suicidal ideation, but not a
      risk to themselves or others and are deemed appropriate for an out-patient study with careful
      safety surveillance. This will allow the study to focus on the antidepressant effects of
      CERC-301 but also explore effects on suicidal ideation. To explore rapid onset, the primary
      endpoint will be at 7 days, but effects over the 28 days of treatment will be examined as a
      secondary endpoint.
