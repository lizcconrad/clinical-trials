      group, multicenter trial of postmenopausal subjects with an intact uterus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal subjects with an intact uterus who meet the study entry criteria will be
      randomized to one of five treatment arms (four active and one placebo) and followed for 12
      months. During the Screening period all subjects will be provided with a diary to self-assess
      the frequency and severity of their vasomotor symptoms. Subjects experiencing a minimum daily
      frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will participate in a VMS
      Substudy during the first 12 weeks of treatment. The Substudy subjects will be stratified by
      treatment arm within the sites, and only Substudy subjects have the possibility of being
      randomized to placebo. Subjects who qualify for the study except for experiencing a minimum
      daily frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will be stratified
      within sites to one of the four active treatment arms and followed for 12 months, but will
      not participate in the VMS Substudy. (However, VMS information will be collected from all
      subjects during the first 12 weeks of treatment.) All Study Subjects: Postmenopausal women
      with an intact uterus who seek relief from hot flushes and meet all other inclusion/exclusion
      criteria are eligible for 12 months of study treatment.

      VMS Substudy Subjects: A subset of All Study Subjects who have ≥7 per day or ≥50 per week
      moderate to severe hot flushes (as determined during Screening) are eligible for the 12-week
      VMS Substudy and for a total of 12 months of study treatment.

      Clinical evaluations will be performed at the following time points:

        -  Screening Period (Week: - 8.5) (up to -60 Days)

        -  Visit 1 Randomization (Week 0) (Day 1)

        -  Visit 2 Interim (Week 4)

        -  Visit 3 Interim (Week 8)

        -  Visit 4 Interim (Week 12)

        -  Visit 5 Interim (Month 6)

        -  Visit 6 Interim (Month 9)

        -  Visit 7 End of Treatment (Month 12)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be a female between the ages of 40 and 65 years (at the time of randomization) who is
             willing to participate in the study, as documented by signing the informed consent
             form.

          2. Be a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus and a Screening serum estradiol level
             of ≤50 pg/mL. Postmenopausal is defined herein as:

               1. ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or

               2. at least 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with a Screening serum FSH level of
                  &gt;40 mIU/ml, or

               3. ≥ 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy.

          3. Be seeking treatment or relief for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

          4. To participate in the VMS Substudy, a subject must also report ≥7 moderate to severe
             hot flushes per day, or ≥50 per week, at the baseline assessment during Screening
             (subjects whose hot flushes are less frequent may still participate as non-Substudy
             subjects.

             Note: A minimum of 14 consecutive days of complete hot flush diary data are required
             during the baseline assessment at Screening, and these consecutive days must occur
             within the last 14 days prior to the Randomization visit (not counting the
             Randomization visit day itself). The most recent 7 consecutive days of data prior to
             randomization (Day -7 to Day -1) will be used to determine the baseline number of
             mild, moderate and severe hot flushes for each subject.

          5. Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 34 kg/mP2P. (BMI values should be
             rounded to the nearest integer [e.g., 34.4 rounds down to 34, while 26.5 rounds up to
             27]).

          6. Be willing to abstain from using products (other than study medication) that contain
             estrogen, progestin, or progesterone throughout study participation.

          7. Be judged by the principal or sub-investigator physician as being in otherwise
             generally good health based on a medical evaluation performed during the Screening
             period prior to the initial dose of study medication. The medical evaluation findings
             must include:

               1. a normal or non-clinically significant physical examination, including vital
                  signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature).
                  Sitting systolic blood pressure is ≤140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≤90
                  mmHg at Screening. A subject may be taking up to two antihypertensive
                  medications.

               2. a normal or non-clinically significant pelvic examination.

               3. a mammogram that shows no sign of significant disease (can be performed within
                  previous 6 months prior to initial dose of study medication). Subjects must have
                  a BI-RADS 1 or 2 to enroll in the study. An incomplete mammogram result, i.e.
                  BI-RADS 0, is not acceptable. The site must obtain a copy of the official report
                  for the subject's study file, and it must be verified that the mammogram itself
                  is available if needed for additional assessment.

               4. a normal or non-clinically significant clinical breast examination. An acceptable
                  breast examination is defined as no masses or other findings identified that are
                  suspicious of malignancy.

               5. a normal Screening Papanicolaou (&quot;Pap&quot;) smear. (Subjects with findings of
                  atypical glandular cells [AGC], AGUS, ASCUS with high risk HPV type upon reflex
                  testing, LSIL, ASC-H, HSIL, dysplastic cells, or malignant cells must be excluded
                  from randomization.)

               6. an acceptable result from an evaluable Screening endometrial biopsy. The
                  endometrial biopsy reports by the two central pathologists at Screening must each
                  specify one of the following: proliferative endometrium; weakly proliferative
                  endometrium; disordered proliferative pattern; secretory endometrium; endometrial
                  tissue other (including benign, inactive or atrophic fragments of endometrial
                  epithelium, glands, stroma, etc); endometrial tissue insufficient for diagnosis;
                  no endometrium identified; or no tissue identified. However, at least one
                  pathologist must identify sufficient tissue to evaluate the biopsy. Additionally,
                  the endometrial biopsy reports by the two central pathologists of Other Findings
                  at Screening must each specify one of the following: endometrial polyp not
                  present; benign endometrial polyp; or polyp other. (See Exclusion criterion #27)

               7. a normal or non-clinically significant 12-lead ECG.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  To participate in the study, a subject must NOT:
