  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a medical intervention
      trial in childhood cancer survivors with early echocardiographic evidence of cardiac
      remodeling.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline cardiotoxicity is characterized by ventricular remodeling and progressive
      cardiac dysfunction. Since ventricular remodeling in other types of heart failure can be
      treated effectively with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), these agents
      would appear a logical therapy in children with anthracycline-induced heart failure. Previous
      experience with ACEi in childhood cancer survivors has shown mixed results, possibly due to
      the fact that treatment is initiated too late in the natural history of the disease.
      Providing treatment in childhood cancer survivors with early signs of cardiac remodeling may
      be more effective than treating children who have global dysfunction. The benefits of early
      intervention are unclear, so it is unclear whether CCS and their parents will be willing to
      receive treatment where the target outcome (prevention of decreased global function or
      congestive heart failure) may not occur for years after the intervention. Assessing the
      feasibility of this pre-emptive approach is the primary aim of the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrolled in the Survivor Cohort of the PCS2 study at The Hospital for Sick Children at
             the time of enrollment.

          2. Aged &lt; 20 years at enrollment.

          3. Weight ≥ 25kg at enrollment

          4. LVPW Z-score ≤-2.0 at any of the 0, 12 or 24 month PCS2 echocardiography assessments,
             on two consecutive echocardiograms at least 3 but no more than 15 months apart.

          5. EF greater than 50% at enrollment

          6. Serum potassium (to be ˃5.0mMol/l) at Initiation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known associated cardiac conditions for which angiotensin converting enzyme therapy is
             contraindicated (such as aortic stenosis, severe coarctation of the aorta, or
             hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with LV outflow tract obstruction)

          2. Active malignancy detected within last 2 years (i.e. must be at least 2 years in
             remission)

          3. Prior radiation therapy to a field that involved the heart

          4. Prior symptomatic heart failure, or prior reduction in EF below 50% detected on
             surveillance echocardiography.

          5. Use of any cardioactive medications including diuretics within the last 6 months

          6. Concurrent serious or life threatening disease or extracardiac organ compromise which
             would limit participation in the trial or potentially have secondary effects on
             cardiac function, as determined by the treating physician.

          7. Renal dysfunction precluding ACEi therapy, defined as serum creatinine greater than
             the 95th percentile for age or eGFR by the modified Schwartz formula of less than the
             5th percentile prior to recruitment to the interventional trial (within 30 days of
             recruitment date)

          8. Hypertension requiring treatment.

          9. History of angioedema or ACEi hypersensitivity

         10. Patients with hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, glucose-galactose
             malabsorption, or the Lapp lactase deficiency.

         11. Upper airway obstructive lesions

         12. Pregnancy

         13. Breast-feeding
