        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female Caucasians aged between 18 and 60 years

          -  Patients with mild to moderate AD (Atopic Dermatitis) presenting a scoring AD (SCORAD)
             rating below 50

          -  Skin type I - IV according to Fitzpatrick

          -  Acute AD symptoms on each assessment areas (local SCORAD ≥ 3 and &lt;/= 12) at Baseline

          -  Acute symptom of pruritus at Baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other skin disease at the test area that would interfere the clinical assessment
             in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Moles, tattoos, strong pigmentation, or scars at the test area that would interfere
             the clinical assessment

          -  Regular intake of antiphlogistic drugs (for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
             drug [NSAIDs])

          -  Any condition or treatment which might influence the trial (e.g. any treatment with
             topical antibiotics, antifungals, or corticoids) within 14 days prior to screening as
             well as during the trial (exception: topical treatment of AD lesions other than the
             test areas (for example, face) with low potency steroids restricted to small areas)

          -  UV-therapy or the use of solarium within 30 days before screening as well as during
             the trial

          -  Any alternative treatment of AD (e.g. acupuncture, kinesiology, and homoeopathy)
             within 30 days before screening as well as during the trial
