  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, open-label, 3-period, fixed-sequence study will evaluate the effect of
      multiple oral doses of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of RO5424802 in
      healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive a single dose of RO5424802 on Days 1 and 17 and
      rifampin daily from Days 8 to Day 20.

          <title>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of Alectinib</title>
          <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction of drug absorbed.</description>
