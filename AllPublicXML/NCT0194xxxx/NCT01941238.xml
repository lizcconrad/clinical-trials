  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Managing patients with type1 diabetes when fasting Ramadan is very challenging. Insulin pump
      offers the advantage of flexibility and precision to administering insulin and has been
      proven to reduce severe hypoglycemia compared to multi-dose injection (MDI). However, there
      are extremely limited studies on the difference between insulin pump compared to MDI on the
      incidence of hypoglycemia and other acute complications during fasting Ramadan

      The investigators hypothesized that insulin pump would be associated with less hypoglycemic
      events during fasting Ramadan compared to MDI without deterioration in glycemic control.
      Results of this study are descriptive but will fill a current gap in knowledge and may
      contribute to development of future guidelines for the management of type1DM during Ramadan.
