      As technologies are advancing quickly in the healthcare setting, new solutions have become
      available helping disable people to enhance their ability to communicate. One of these
      advances is the introduction of the 'eye gaze system'. Through processing eye movements, this
      device allows a person to write, speak, use the Internet and even control systems in the home
      or office. In the currently proposed study we aim to evaluate the psychological and
      functional effects of using the Tobii™ Eyegaze System by inpatients with tetraplegia who are
      unable to use arms and legs and sometimes are not able to talk because of an impaired
      respiratory function.

      Volunteering inpatients will be recruited at the National Spinal Injuries Centre. Volunteers
      will be instructed and trained to use the Tobii™ Eyegaze System. The number of sessions
      required to successfully master the device depends on the learning curve of the patient. The
      progress will be documented accordingly. After successful completion of the training and
      supervised use, the inpatients will be offered the Tobii™ Eyegaze System for unsupervised
      use, 4 hours a week, for the following 2 months. It is hypothesised that using the Tobii™
      Eyegaze System by inpatients with tetraplegia results in improved disability perception and
      independence scores. For the current feasibility study 12 participants will be recruited and
      assessed for 'Appraisal of Disability', 'Mood', 'Assistive Technology perception' and
      'eyeskills' to instruct the computer system. Positive study outcomes will encourage future
      studies of the role of the Tobii™ Eyegaze System in both a rehabilitation and home
      environment.
