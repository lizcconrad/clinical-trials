  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sildenafil (Viagra(R))is widely used by men with Parkinsons Disease (PD) and erectile
      dysfunction. A number of patients have reported that when they take Sildenafil, their need of
      anti-PD medication is reduced.

      We hypotheses that sildenafil increases brain blood flow and hence improves the function of
      specific brain regions, improving motor function.

      Motor function and cerebral blood flow of 8 patients will be tested before and after
      Sildenafil intake and before and after anti-PD medication.

      Erectile dysfunction can be experienced by up tp 40% of men with Parkinsons Disease (PD).
      Sildenafil (Viagra(R))is widely used by men with PD and erectile dysfunction. A number of
      patients have reported that when they take Sildenafil, their need of anti-PD medication is
      reduced.

      We hypotheses that sildenafil increases cerebral blood flow in basal ganglia and hence
      improves the function, improving motor function.

      Motor function and cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of 8 patients will be tested before and after
      Sildenafil intake and before and after anti-PD medication.

      rCBF will be measured by the Xe133 inhalation method and a fast-rotating, brain-dedicated,
      single photon emission computerized tomograph (SPECT, Tomomatic, 232, Medimatic, Inc.,
      Denmark). Two scans will be perfomed, when patients are i)in normal medicated state and ii)
      in normal medicated state 1 hour after intake of 100 mg sildenafil.

      Motor function will be measured i 4 conditions: i)in normal medicated state and ii) in normal
      medicated state 1 hour after intake of 100 mg sildenafil, iii) after 12 hours of
      discontiation of anti-PD mediciation and iiii) after 14 hours of discontiation of anti-PD
      mediciation and 1 hour after intake of 100 mg sildenafil.
