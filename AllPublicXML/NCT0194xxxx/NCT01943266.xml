  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently
      available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen
      balance method have been well described. Importantly, nitrogen balanced underestimates
      requirements.

      The current dietary reference intakes (DRI) requirement for healthy adult males is based on
      the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was
      reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of
      healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using
      indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO), our group estimated the protein requirement of young
      men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA).

      Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition
      survey conducted by national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES), the authors
      concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0
      g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on
      the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or
      lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults.
      Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population.

      The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of male elderly
      subjects between the ages of 65 - 75 years using the IAAO technique.
