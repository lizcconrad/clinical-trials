  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with
      alogliptin (Nesina) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who responded inadequately to
      diet therapy and exercise therapy alone, or a combination of diet therapy, exercise therapy,
      and α-glucosidase inhibitor.

      In addition, examining the safety and efficacy of alogliptin in patients with renal
      impairment, information on the appropriate dosage of alogliptin according to the severity of
      impaired renal function should be collected.

      A special drug use surveillance is planned to examine the safety and efficacy of long-term
      use of alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under the daily clinical use
      conditions.

      Participants of this surveillance will be patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who failed
      to respond adequately to diet therapy and exercise therapy alone or to a combination of diet
      therapy, exercise therapy, and α-glucosidase inhibitor. The planned sample size is 3,000
      subjects.

      The usual adult dosage for oral use is 1 alogliptin tablet (25 mg) once daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not adequately responded to any one of
             the following therapies:

               1. Diet therapy and exercise therapy alone

               2. In addition to diet therapy and exercise therapy, use of α-glucosidase inhibitor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients contraindicated for Nesina

               1. Patients with severe ketosis, diabetic coma or precoma, or type 1 diabetes
                  mellitus (these patients require prompt adjustment of hyperglycemia by fluid
                  infusion and insulin, and hence use of Nesina is not appropriate.)

               2. Patients with severe infection, pre- or post-operative patients, or patients with
                  serious traumatic injury (blood glucose control by insulin injection is desirable
                  for these patients, and hence use of Nesina is not appropriate.)

               3. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any ingredient of Nesina
