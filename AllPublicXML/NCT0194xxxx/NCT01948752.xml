  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study sought to examine the effect of menu labeling on food ordering and food
      consumption, including the effect of displaying calories along with other nutrients, such as
      sodium, fat, and sugar, as well as in different formats, such as traffic lights.

      The investigators hypothesize significant differences in the calorie amount of menu
      selections and food consumption across experimental conditions. The investigators anticipate
      that calorie amounts will be significantly higher in the no calorie information) compared to
      each of the other 3 conditions, and significantly lower in the Traffic Light conditions
      compared to calories only condition.

      2) Individuals in Condition 1 (no calorie information) will be significantly more likely to
      underestimate the calorie content of their meals compared to individuals in the intervention
      conditions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Calorie consumption.</measure>
    <time_frame>Calorie consumption was recorded for the meal consumed during the visit to the laboratory, approximately 30 minutes after the start of the study. No additional follow-up was conducted after the laboratory visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants consumed the food during the study visit, after ordering from the menus and completing survey measures. The calorie content of all food and beverage items ordered by each participant was calculated immediate after the study session using information provided by Subway. All items were weighed immediately prior to delivery to participants. After participants indicated that their meal was completed, research assistants collected and weighed any leftover food or beverage portions. A consumption variable was calculated for calorie, fat, sodium, and sugar consumption for each participant by subtracting the estimated number of calories in food and beverage waste from the total for the meal, based on differences in weight. No measures were collected after the study visit.</description>
