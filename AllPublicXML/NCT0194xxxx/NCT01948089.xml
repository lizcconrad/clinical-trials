    <textblock>
      This project will investigate the effectiveness of an intensive and focused working memory
      training program for chronic stroke patients. The investigators hypothesize that working
      memory training will be an effective method of improving working memory and related cognitive
      and behavioural functions in this population.

    <textblock>
      Vascular cognitive impairment due to vascular disease and stroke frequently includes problems
      with attention, working memory and executive functions (e.g., monitoring, planning, and
      organization).

      These deficits are common - 32-73%, and chronic, and interfere with a patients response to
      rehabilitation, independence in activities of daily living, community re-integration, and
      overall quality of life after stroke. Attention, memory and executive function impairments
      can adversely affect the ability to relearn various skills.

      Cognitive impairments and their impacts on other components of functioning not only impact on
      the individual, but can also adversely affect the family via increases in caregiver distress
      and burden. Thus, the presence of cognitive impairment has wide-reaching impact and deserves
      effective and consistent intervention similar to the attention devoted to improving function
      in physical domains.

      Cognitive training can improve cognitive function, particularly in those areas known to
      involved in vascular cognitive impairment, i.e., attentional and executive function.
      Accumulating evidence indicates that computer-based training can improve cognitive skills in
      healthy older adults as well as in clinical populations. Attention and working memory
      training has also been shown to be effective in patients in the chronic phase post stroke.

      The investigators propose that specific cognitive training to improve working memory could
      provide direct benefit to chronic stroke patients. Promising interventions focused on
      intensive and direct working memory training are emerging and have been shown to generalize
      to other cognitive domains, such as fluid intelligence.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Networks of Attention Battery scores at 10 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>The participants will be assessed on session 1 of week 1 and on session 31 of week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Networks of Attention battery is a computerized battery that provides performance data on tests of vigilance (simple and choice reaction time), orienting and selection (visual search) and executive control (dual tasking, working memory, inhibition). This battery will allow the attention and working memory deficits to be characterized for each patient and serve as near and far transfer measures of training effects.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Sternberg Digit Memory scores at 10 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>The participants will be assessed on session 1 of week 1 and on session 31 of week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Sternberg digit memory task is a measure of visual working memory wherein the subject is shown a set of n digits for study. After a short delay, a digit is shown and the subject is asked to recall whether that item was in the previously viewed set. This test will examine the near transfer of training to another working memory test.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Event Related Potentials using Cortical Activity Electroencephalography at 10 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>The participants will be assessed on session 1 of week 1 and on session 31 of week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Cortical activity Electroencephalography technology will be used to measure cortical activity. Stimulus presentation and participant response on the computerized Flanker test will be synchronized with EEG data acquisition. Numeric 'triggers' will be placed on the continuous EEG waveform corresponding to stimulus presentation and participant response. Data synchronization is necessary to perform event related potential (ERP) analysis to obtain the P3 component. 150 trials (~5.5 seconds per trial) will be processed using a &quot;SynAmps&quot; response time 128 channel EEG system from 18 scalp electrodes at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz for a total EEG data collection time of ~20 minutes. Electrodes around the eyes will allow detection and removal of trials with ocular artifacts.</description>

    <description>This exercise uses the n-back paradigm in which participants are asked to keep track of one or two series of sequentially presented auditory and/or visual stimuli in order to detect targets that match those presented n-items ago in the sequence. The task begins at 1-back (i.e., watch for targets that match those just presented) and gets harder (e.g., watch for matches with items presented 2 or 3 items ago in the sequence) as performance improves. The stimuli will vary weekly, and include varying auditory letters or words, or varying visual patterns or faces.</description>
