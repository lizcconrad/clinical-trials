    <measure>Changes in the intensity of specific endometriosis symptoms from baseline pre-surgery</measure>

    <description>The specific endometriosis symptoms include pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, pain at time of ovulation, dyspareunia to be assessed with a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS).
Other symptoms (Amenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, Global GI symptoms &amp; urinary discomfort,) will be assessed by oral enquiry to the patients based on numerical scale from 0 to 10 (0 being the best and 10 the worst status).</description>
