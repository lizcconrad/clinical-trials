    <measure>Changes From Baseline to Week 8 on Sleep Quality as Assessed by Polysomnographic Recorded (PSG) Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The key PSG parameters assessed were the latency to persistent sleep (PSG LPS), sleep onset latency (PSG SOL), wake-time after sleep onset (PSG WASO), total sleep time (PSG TST), number of awakenings (PSG NAW), and sleep efficiency (PSG SE). The results for PSG LPS, PSG SOL, PSG WASO, and PSG TST are presented separately from the PSG NAW, and from the PSG SE due to the different units of measurement involved. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a patient-rated scale desgined to measure the patient's perception of his/her insomnia. The ISI comprises 7 items: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, problems waking up early in the morning, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, how much others notice the sleep problem impairs quality of life, and distress caused by the sleep problem. Each of the 7 items is rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (best situation) to 4 (worst situation). The total score of the 7 items ranges from 0 to 28, with higher values indicating worse outcome. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

The ESS consists of 8 items describing different situations/activities and the patients rate the chance of them dozing off or falling asleep when they are in these situations. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (would never dose) to 3 (high change of dozing). The total score of the 8 items ranges from 0 to 24, with higher values indicating worse outcome.

    <description>The psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) measures sustained or vigilant attention by recording response time (milliseconds) to a visual/or auditory stimulus that appears at random inter-stimulus intervals (range: from 2 to 10 seconds). The patient was instructed to monitor a red rectangular box on the computer screen and to press a response button as soon as a yellow stimulus counter appeared on the screen. The parameters assessed using a PVT device were response speed and number of lapses. The results for response speed is presented separately from the number of lapses due to the different units of measurement involved.

The results for PSG LPS, PSG SOL, PSG WASO, and PSG TST are presented separately from the PSG NAW, and from the PSG SE due to the different units of measurement involved.

        <description>The Bond-Lader Visual Analogue Scale – Sedation (BL-VAS-s) is a patient-rated scale designed to assess the current level of sedation. The BL-VAS-s was assessed for the evening (19:00 to 23:59 hours), morning (00:00 to 08:59 hours) and at noon (11:00 to 13:59 hours). The BL-VAS-s is a single item scale rated on a 100mm visual analogue scale. The score is measured from the left to a mark made on the line by the patient and ranges from 0 (alert) to 100 (drowsy). As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (severe symptoms). Definitions of severity are provided at two-point intervals. The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in CGI-S Score</title>
          <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale assesses the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients), with higher values indicating worse outcome. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>
          <population>The full-analysis set (FAS) comprised all patients treated, who had a valid baseline assessment and at least one valid post-baseline efficacy assessment. The analysis was performed using observed cases (OC) data.</population>

        <description>The Montgomery Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Items in the scale assess apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (severe symptoms). Definitions of severity are provided at two-point intervals. The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome. Response was defined as a ≥50% decrease in MADRS total score from baseline. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (no difficulties) to 4 (serious difficulties). The total score of the 18 items ranges from 18 to 72, with higher values indicating worse outcome.

        <title>CGI-I Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Global Improvement (CGI-I) assesses the clinician's impression of the patient's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the patient's condition relative to a baseline on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), with higher values indicating worse outcome. As this was an open-label exploratory study, all outcomes should be considered as exploratory outcomes.</description>

        <population>The full-analysis set (FAS) comprised all patients treated, who had a valid baseline assessment and at least one valid post-baseline efficacy assessment. The analysis was performed using observed cases (OC) data.</population>
