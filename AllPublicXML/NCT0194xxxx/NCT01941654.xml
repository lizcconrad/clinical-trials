      To determine the efficacy of preemptive local ablative therapy in NSCLC patients with
      activating EGFR mutation who have oligometastatic residual metabolic-active disease after
      first-line EGFR TKI, as measured by PFS rate at 1 year from the trial enrollment.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically confirmed UICC 7th edition Stage IIIB (not amenable for curative intent
             local radiotherapy)/IV (metastatic or recurrent) non-small cell carcinoma of lung

          2. Documented activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R only) in tumor
             tissues

          3. Treated with first-line EGFR TKI for 3 months and achieved good radiological partial
             response that was documented with a CT scan

          4. Not more than 4 residual metabolic active (SUVmax &gt; 2.5) metastatic sites left on the
             screening PET-CT scan. (one bone metastatic site is regarded as a single site,
             mediastinal/ hilar lymph nodes in close proximity and possible to be treated in an
             acceptable volume is regarded as one lesion)

          5. The shortest diameter of the lesion must be ≥ 1cm and is amenable to local ablative
             therapy

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 - 2

          7. Age ≥ 18 years

          8. Pleural or pericardial effusion at diagnosis is allowed only if it has resolved on CT
             scan after 3-month EGFR TKI treatment

          9. Brain metastasis at diagnosis is allowed if it has been treated either surgically or
             with radiotherapy and there is no radiological progression on follow-up CT scan. The
             patient is neurologically stable for at least 1 week after cessation of steroid
             treatment

         10. Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:

               1. Serum alanine transaminase ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤ 5 x ULN if
                  liver function abnormalities are due to liver metastases

               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               3. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

               4. Platelets count ≥ 100 x 109/L

               5. Creatinine clearance &gt; 45ml/min

         11. Written informed consent that is consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy is not allowed except adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected
             early staged non-small cell lung cancer and it has been at least 12 months before the
             start of EGFR TKI treatment

          2. Prior radiotherapy is not allowed except brain irradiation

          3. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis

          4. Lymphangitis carcinomatosis of lung

          5. Prior or concomitant malignancy at other sites is not allowed except treated
             non-metastatic non-melanoma skin cancer, ductal carcinoma-in-situ of breast and
             carcinoma-in-situ of cervix with curative intent

          6. Uncontrolled active infection or medical condition (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, congestive heart failure [≥ NYHA Class II], uncontrolled arrhythmia,
             myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within the past 6 month)

          7. Pre-existing interstitial lung disease

          8. Woman of child-bearing potential or male patient is unwilling to use adequate birth
             control method prior to the study entry, for the duration of study participation and
             for at least 2 months after the EGFR TKI treatment has ended.

          9. Pregnant and Lactating female patient

         10. Non-compliance to the study procedure
