  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Atrial fibrillation is a common heart rhythm disturbance affecting some 1-2% of
      the western population. It may cause symptoms such as irregular heartbeats, shortness of
      breath, and fatigue. It may also be asymptomatic (ie &quot;silent atrial fibrillation). In some
      cases, atrial fibrillation is permanent whereas in others it is sporadic. Regardless of
      symptoms, there is an increased risk of stroke in some patients with this condition. Novel
      technologies are being developed to increase detection of silent atrial fibrillation, in
      order to find patients who might benefit from treatment with oral anticoagulants
      (blood-thinning medications) in order to reduce the risk of stroke. One of these technologies
      is thumb-ECG, a simple way for a patient to have his or her heart rhythm reliably analyzed at
      home.

      Hyperthyroidism (sometimes referred to as &quot;toxic goiter&quot;) is defined as an excessive
      production of thyroid hormone. It is known that hyperthyroidism may cause atrial fibrillation
      in about 8% of cases.

      Objective: To provide thumb-ECG-monitors to hyperthyroid patients before and after treating
      their hormonal disturbance, in order to find episodes of silent atrial fibrillation.

      Design: Prospective observational study.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Primary hypothesis: Silent atrial fibrillation is at least as common as overt atrial
           fibrillation in hyperthyroid patients.

        -  Secondary hypothesis nr 1: Atrial fibrillation continues to be more prevalent compared
           to the normal population even after hyperthyroidism is treated.

        -  Secondary hypothesis nr 2: The majority of patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial
           fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke and should be considered for treatment with
           oral anticoagulants.

        We will screen all patients residing in the extended region around Stockholm, Sweden who
        have been referred and admitted to the Radiumhemmet clinic for investigation (and usually
        treatment) with radioiodine. As of February 2016, we will also include patients referred
        for treatment with antithyroid drugs at the endocrinology clinics of 1) Sahlgrenska
        University Hospital, Gothemburg Sweden, 2) Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm,
        Sweden, 3) Danderyds Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden
