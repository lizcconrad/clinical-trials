  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team aims to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study to assess the
      effect of prophylactic antipyretics on the immune responses and rates of fever after
      inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children 12 through 35 months of age. In this pilot,
      40 healthy children, 12 through 35 months of age, including some children at risk of febrile
      seizure, will be randomized to receive prophylactic acetaminophen or oral placebo immediately
      following and every 4 to 6 hours in the 24 hours after receipt of a dose of IIV. Data derived
      from the pilot study will be used to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger scale
      study. Feasibility will include assessments of the speed and ease of study recruitment and
      adherence to and completion of study assessments. Children will be followed for the
      occurrence of fever, fussiness, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and use of medical
      services on the day of and day following vaccination. Antibody to influenza antigens
      contained in the 2013-2014 vaccine as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody
      will be assessed at baseline and four weeks following vaccination. The proportions of
      children experiencing fever, having solicited reactions, using medical services,
      demonstrating a serologic response corresponding to seroprotection and seroconversion to each
      of the IIV antigens will be determined for groups of children receiving acetaminophen and
      placebo. Likewise geometric mean HAI titers (GMT) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals
      for each IIV antigen will be calculated for both vaccine groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for inclusion in the study the following enrollment criteria must be met:

          1. The child must be 12 through 35 months of age.

          2. The child must only need a single dose of IIV during the current season. (Children
             only need 1 dose of vaccine in 2013-14 if they received a total of 2 or more doses of
             seasonal vaccine since July 1, 2010. Children who did not receive a total of 2 or more
             doses of seasonal vaccine since July 1, 2010 require 2 doses in 2013-14).[19]

          3. The parent/guardian must be willing and capable of providing written informed consent
             for the child.

          4. The parent/guardian must be available for follow-up and must at minimum have telephone
             access.

          5. The parent/guardian must agree to sign a medical release for the child so that study
             personnel may obtain medical information about the child's health (if needed).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants must not have any of the following:

          1. History of receipt of current year's licensed influenza vaccine.

             thimerosal if using thimerosal containing vaccine.

          3. History of a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) following a prior dose of
             influenza vaccine.

          4. History of an allergic reaction following acetaminophen or ingredients in the
             acetaminophen product.

          5. History of an allergic reaction following ibuprofen or ingredients in the ibuprofen
             product.

          6. History of liver disease.

          7. Currently taking the blood thinning drug warfarin (Coumadin).

             days (for live vaccines) prior to vaccination in this study or expects to receive a
             licensed vaccine during the 28 days following the last vaccination in this study.
             Concomitant vaccinations are not allowed.

          9. Routine immunizations are delayed or will be delayed by not being able to receive a
             concomitantly administered vaccine or a needed vaccine in the 28 days following
             receipt of the influenza vaccine.

         10. Received an experimental/investigational agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood
             product, or medication) within 28 days prior to vaccination in this study, or expects
             to receive an experimental/investigational agent within the follow-up time period (28
             days after the last vaccination in this study).

         11. A moderate to severe acute illness and/or a reported temperature greater than or equal
             to 100.0째F (37.8째C) within 72 hours prior to first dose of IIV or an axillary
             temperature greater than or equal to 100.0째F (37.8째C) at the time of enrollment. (This
             may result in a temporary delay of vaccination).

         12. Receipt of an antipyretic medication (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) within 72 hours
             prior to the first dose of IIV (This may result in a temporary delay of vaccination)
             or is already planning to administer a prophylactic antipyretic medication on the day
             of and the day following IIV (this exclusion does not apply if the caretaker indicates
             he/she might administer antipyretics after vaccination to reduce a fever).

         13. Immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use of
             anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 36 months.

             beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within the preceding 6 months (topical and
             nasal steroids are allowed).

         15. History of Guillain-Barr챕 syndrome within 6 weeks of a prior dose of influenza
             vaccine.
