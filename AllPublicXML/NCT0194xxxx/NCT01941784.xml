    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies a health education intervention in reducing weight gain in
      patients with newly diagnosed stage I-IV breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. A health
      education program may reduce weight gain and improve quality of life in patients undergoing
      chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of conducting a weight maintenance intervention, in terms of
      recruiting and retaining participants.

      II. To obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of an intervention to prevent weight gain
      on body composition, self-efficacy, perceived stress, fatigue, depression, exercise capacity,
      and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Changes in physical activity and dietary intake
      will also be monitored.

      III. To determine if the weight control protocol requires refinement for use in a randomized
      controlled trial.

      IV. To determine how many participants opt to enroll in a short-term healthy lifestyle
      program at completion of the final testing visit.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo four 30-60 minute health education sessions and 3 follow-up phone
      sessions with an interventionist trained in behavioral science, physical activity and
      nutrition, and positive psychology over 12 months.

      EDUCATION SESSION I: Participants receive information from the interventionist concerning
      healthy diet choices and exercise and begin to keep a food log.

      EDUCATION SESSION II: Interventionists review information from session I and patient food
      logs. Participants receive recommendations for exercise and set activity goals.

      EDUCATION SESSION III: Participants receive information on how to determine portion sizes and
      the importance of strength training and building lean muscle mass.

      EDUCATION SESSION IV: Interventionists review information from the previous 3 sessions and
      discuss the importance of planning and goal setting with participants. The interventionist
      also discusses physical and mental barriers to exercise.

      After completion of the education sessions, patients receive 3 phone calls at times
      convenient to the patient to answer questions about information learned in previous
      educational sessions.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up for 12 months.

    <description>Reasons why participants are not eligible will be reported and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reevaluated. The proportion of participants who completed all sessions and testing visits will be estimated and compared. Barriers to recruitment (e.g., timing of intervention, inconvenience, time constraints, participant feeling too sick) will be recorded to assist in designing the larger trial.</description>

    <description>Descriptive statistics consisting of frequency tables and percents for categorical variables and means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges for continuous variables will be tabulated. Repeated-measure analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs) to test for change in our primary variables over the 3 timepoints will be conducted, controlling for baseline differences. Additionally, effect sizes will be calculated as they account for sample size and are useful when a lack of power leads to nonsignificant findings. These estimates of variability will be used when designing a future trial.</description>
