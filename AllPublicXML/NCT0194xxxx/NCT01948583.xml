    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the humectant activity and the local tolerability of a new
      formulation of Gynomunal® vaginalgel in menopausal women (menopause since at least 2 years)
      with referred vaginal dryness

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, crossover clinical study; the subjects will use both formulations
      with an interval of 1 week (wash out period), in reversed sequence according to the treatment
      arm assigned at each subject during the basal visit.

      Both tested products will be applied in the vagina, using the dedicated applicator, once a
      day, preferably at bedtime. To investigate the activity of the products under study, 4 visits
      will be performed: a baseline visit (T0), a visit at the end of the first week-treatment
      (T1), a visit at the end of the wash out period (T2) and a final visit at the end of the
      second week-treatment (T3).

      Volunteers will be asked to follow their normal life and sexual habits, except for not having
      sexual intercourse 48 hours prior to each examination.
