    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of the trial is to
      investigate the bioequivalence (the expected biological equivalence of two pharmaceutical
      drug products with identical active ingredient) of Norditropin® (somatropin) versus
      Genotropin® (somatropin) in healthy adult subjects.
