    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nintedanib works in treating patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer who have failed up to two previous chemotherapy regimens.
      Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of fibroblast growth factor
      receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplified squamous cell lung cancer patients treated with BIBF 1120
      (nintedanib).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the 6-month PFS rate for the entire FGFR1 amplified group versus the FGFR1
      non-amplified patients.

      II. Compare the 6-month PFS rate for each FGFR1 amplified group (low, intermediate, and high)
      versus historical controls and FGFR1 non-amplified patients.

      III. To assess the following endpoints overall and by FGFR1 group: PFS, overall survival
      (OS), confirmed tumor response rate, and adverse events.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The relation of FGFR1 gene copy number with PFS, OS, confirmed response rate, and adverse
      events.

      II. The relationship fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) polymorphisms with toxicity and
      efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks.

    <description>The 6-month PFS rate was defined as the proportion of patients who were alive and progression-free at 6 months after start of study treatment. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>

        <title>6-month Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate Within the Entire FGFR1 Amplified Group</title>
        <description>The 6-month PFS rate was defined as the proportion of patients who were alive and progression-free at 6 months after start of study treatment. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>
