      A Field Study to Observe Symptom Scores and Allergy Medication Usage in Subjects with a
      History of House Dust Mite-Induced Rhinoconjunctivitis

    <textblock>
      House Dust Mites (HDM) are arachnids that infest bedding, carpet, upholstered furniture and
      fabric. Like many other allergens, exposure to HDMA in sensitised patients is associated with
      poorer lung function, greater medication requirements and more asthma symptoms as well as
      chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In contrast to other allergens, there is evidence that HDMA
      leads to the development of asthma, in addition to exacerbating pre-existing asthma in
      HDM-sensitised patients.

      The proposed observational study is designed to gather information on subjects with
      HDM-related rhinoconjunctivitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged 18-65 years

          -  A history of moderate to severe rhinoconjunctivitis (sneezing, rhinorrhoea, itchy
             nose, nasal blockage, and/or itchy/watery/red/sore eyes) consistent with allergy to
             HDM for at least 1 year.

          -  Non-asthmatic, or asthma controlled by Step 1 or 2 treatment as defined by GINA for at
             least one month.

          -  Subjects must have a 7-day reflective TRSS (i.e., reflective over the previous 7 days)
             of ≥12 and must have a score of ≥2 in at least two of the individual symptom
             components.

          -  Subjects must have Der p or Der f specific IgE ≥0.35 kU/L as measured by ImmunoCAP®. A
             blood draw for HDM-specific IgE must be performed during the Screening period.

          -  Subjects must have Der p or Der f specific IgE ≥0.35 kU/L as measured by ImmunoCAP®. A
             blood draw for HDM-specific IgE must be performed during the Screening period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant confounding symptoms of allergy to relevant local seasonal
             allergens (e.g., ragweed, mugwort, tree, grass, mountain cedar, mould) and cannot
             complete the Screening and Observation period outside the respective allergy seasons.

          -  Previous immunotherapy treatment with any HDMA for more than 1 month within 5 years
             prior to screening
