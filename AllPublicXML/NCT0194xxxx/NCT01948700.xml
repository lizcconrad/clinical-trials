  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic adolescents experience more severe alcohol-related consequences due to their alcohol
      abuse and yet significantly fewer Hispanic adolescents receive alcohol treatment,
      particularly among justice-involved youth. Despite the level of research that has been
      conducted on motivational interviewing (MI) with mainstream samples, no published studies
      have investigated the efficacy of this brief, individual intervention with Hispanic
      adolescents. The overarching objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a
      brief individual intervention (MI) for problem drinking behaviors with a sample of
      justice-involved Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents to determine if this intervention is
      differentially effective between Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents. Specifically, the first
      aim is to determine whether an MI intervention targeting alcohol abuse is effective at
      reducing alcohol use and related risk behavior in a sample of adolescent alcohol abusers. The
      second aim is to examine whether the effects of MI on problem drinking outcomes (e.g.,
      alcohol problems, quantity of drinking, frequency of binging) are different between Hispanic
      versus Caucasian adolescents. Because it is important to determine the mechanisms that
      mediate the effects of MI and determine whether these mechanisms differ between Caucasian and
      Hispanic adolescents, the third aim is to examine whether group (Hispanic vs. Caucasian)
      moderates the mediational linkages in the overall model using a cross-groups approach to
      moderated mediation. To accomplish these aims, 453 Caucasian and Hispanic justice-involved
      alcohol abusing adolescents (ages 14-17) will be randomized to either two 60 minute MI
      interventions (one at baseline and a second, one week later) or an education condition. All
      adolescents will receive behavioral assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The proposed
      research is expected to take a significant step towards reducing current racial/ethnic health
      disparities in alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents.
