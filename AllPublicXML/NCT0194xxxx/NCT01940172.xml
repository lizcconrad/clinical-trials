    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study in female subjects with relapsed ovarian cancer (including
      epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer).
      Approximately 30 to 40 subjects will be administered a combination of conatumumab and
      birinapant.

      In the initial dose-escalation stage of the study, adult female subjects will receive
      conatumumab in combination with increasing doses of birinapant in dose-escalation cohorts to
      determine the MTD of birinapant when administered with a fixed dose of conatumumab.

      In safety expansion stage, adult female subjects will receive conatumumab in combination with
      birinapant at the MTD of the combination.

        Inclusion Criteria-If subject:

          -  Is a women who is at least 18 years of age.

          -  Has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening for women of childbearing potential.

          -  Pathologically confirmed ovarian cancer (epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal
             cancer, or fallopian tube cancer) may have had a maximum of 3 prior systemic
             chemotherapy regimens (excluding hormonal therapies and investigational agents).

          -  Has a performance status of 0 or 1 by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             scale.

          -  Has a measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1
             criteria AND meet Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA 125 criteria.

          -  Has a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Has adequate liver, renal, pancreatic, coagulation and bone marrow function.

        Exclusion Criteria-If subject:

          -  Has symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases requiring current treatment (&lt;8 weeks
             from last cranial radiation treatment or &lt;4 weeks from last steroid treatment).

          -  Has known intolerance to any of the study drugs or any of their excipients.

          -  Has known or suspected diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or chronic
             active Hepatitis B or C.

          -  Has uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;160/100 mmHg without
             medication, or not controlled despite medications.

          -  Has received systemic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, anti-tumor
             necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, experimental or approved anticancer
             proteins/antibodies therapy

          -  Has impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease including the
             following:

               1. New York Heart Association Grade III or IV congestive heart failure.

               2. Myocardial infarction within the last 12 months prior to dosing with birinapant.

          -  Has a QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTcB) &gt;480 msec (including subjects on
             medication). Subjects with a ventricular pacemaker for whom QT interval is not
             measurable may be eligible.

             Investigator, would prevent the subject's participation, render the subject at
             excessive risk (including excessive risks due to the toxicity profile of the planned
             combination chemotherapeutic regimen), or limit the subject's compliance with the
             protocol's required evaluations.

          -  Has a prior history of cranial nerve palsy.

          -  Has autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases, for example, active rheumatoid
             arthritis, active inflammatory bowel disease or any chronic inflammatory conditions.

          -  Has pseudomyxoma, mesothelioma, unknown primary tumor, sarcoma, neuroendocrine
             histology, clear cell or mucinous histology or subjects with borderline ovarian
             cancer.

          -  Requires concomitant chronic use of anti-TNF therapies, corticosteroids or
             nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Intermittent use (7 or fewer days per
             14 days) of corticosteroids as pre-medications is allowed.
