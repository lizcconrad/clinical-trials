  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to determine if additional, increased contact with infants and
      families discharged to home after cardiac surgery improves infant and parent outcomes as
      compared to usual care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to compare videoconferencing (SKYPE or FACTIME) and a monitoring
      system called Buddy Check is helpful. Buddy Check is a web-based tool using speech and
      internet technology to maintain contact with the health care team.

      Infants are randomized to usual care or the intervention which uses automated daily phone
      calls and 2 virtual home visits each week. Weights, oxygen levels, and amount of food taken
      are obtained by the primary caregiver (parent) daily and sent via automated phone call, text
      message or email messages based on primary caregiver's desired.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Quality of life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 5 months of infant's life</time_frame>
    <description>Parental Quality of life will be measured by total score of &quot;QOL, The Ulm Quality of Life Inventory for Parents (ULQIE)&quot; collected at the completion of the study period for the infant and family, approximately 5 months of infant's life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Social Isolation Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 5 months of Infant's life.</time_frame>
    <description>Parental social isolation will be measured by the total score on the Enriched SocialSupport Index with higher scores indicating more support which is collected within 5 months of the infant's life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight Gain at 5 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 5 months of life</time_frame>
    <description>Weight gain will be measured by change in z scores of infant's weight (measured in grams)which will be obtained at discharge from the hospital and at the end of the study period, approximately 5 months of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 5 month's of Infant's Life</time_frame>
    <description>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms will be measured by the number of symptoms on the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale at the end of the study period, within 5 months of the infant's life.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Health Care Resource Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 5 month's of infants life.</time_frame>
    <description>Health Care Utilization will be measured by per patient costs based on number of re-hospitalizations, Length of Stay of re-hospitalization, number of emergency department visits and number of acute care visits within 5 months of infant's life.</description>
