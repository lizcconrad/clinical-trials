    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of vaccine therapy in healthy
      volunteers with or without previous exposure to cytomegalovirus. Vaccines made from a
      gene-modified virus may help the body build an immune response and may help prevent
      cytomegalovirus infection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a biological optimal dose of the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-modified vaccinia
      Ankara (MVA) Triplex vaccine (multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine).

      II. To determine if the vaccine is safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers at these
      doses.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide preliminary evidence of CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine driven expansion of
      CMV-specific immune responses that would support further evaluation of this vaccine in
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients.

      II. To confer CMV-specific immunity to CMV-negative volunteers and to determine the duration
      of immune enhancement of CMV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI) function up to 12 months
      following immunization of healthy volunteers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants receive multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM)
      followed by a booster injection 28 days later in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 12 months.

        SECONDARY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

          -  It is anticipated that there could be a delay of 1-3 months between screening and
             actual vaccination; alternatively, there could be a delay due to availability of the
             vaccine; therefore, prior to registration for vaccination, the following secondary
             eligibility criteria must be met:

          -  If not tested in past 4 months, serum chemistries and blood counts are within normal
             limits; hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen negative and hepatitis C virus (HCV)

          -  Women of childbearing age must have a urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours
             of each vaccine administration with a negative result

          -  Laboratory values prior to booster injection may include grade 1 laboratory
             abnormalities, but any grade &gt;= grade 2 will exclude the subject from a booster
             injection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous condition, or one that becomes known during the screening period, that
             would suggest that the individual could be immunologically impaired, or for which this
             study would pose a danger to him/herself or about which the P.I., in evaluating the
             subject for eligibility, determines that this exclusion is appropriate

          -  Subjects are excluded who have a history of cancer other than basal cell skin cancer,
             or any condition, psychiatric or otherwise, that would preclude informed consent,
             consistent follow-up or compliance with any aspect of the study (e.g., untreated
             schizophrenia or other significant cognitive impairment, etc. as determined by the PI.
             In addition, allergic diatheses as define by a history of asthma, anaphylaxis, or
             generalized urticaria, or by daily use of antihistamines, episodic (more than once in
             past 3 months) inhalational medications including steroidal agents, non-steroidal

                  and &gt; 460 msec for women)

               -  Repolarization (ST segment or T wave) abnormality

               -  Significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, including frequent ectopy (e.g., 2

               -  Evidence of past myocardial infarction

          -  Any previous condition, or one that becomes known during the screening period, that

             dose of vaccine

          -  Subjects who have had a live vaccine =&lt; 30 days prior to administration of study
             vaccine or subjects who are =&lt; 2 weeks within administration of inactivated vaccines

          -  Persons who are employed by or are a student at City of Hope and are in a chain of
