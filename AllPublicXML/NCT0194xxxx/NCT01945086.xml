  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of 2 doses of ustekinumab
      compared with placebo (inactive medication) in adult Japanese participants with severe atopic
      dermatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo-controlled
      (one of the study medications is inactive), multicenter, parallel group study (each
      participant group receives different treatments simultaneously). Participants will be
      randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either ustekinumab 45 mg, ustekinumab 90 mg, or
      placebo. The study will consist of a screening period, a 12-week double-blind treatment
      period, and a 12-week follow-up period. During the double-blind treatment period,
      participants will receive one subcutaneous injection of study medication at Week 0 and Week
      4. Participants will return to the study center for 7 evaluation visits on Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,
      16, 20, and 24. Clinical response will be evaluated by Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI),
      Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), photography, and Dermatology Life Quality Index
      (DLQI). Participants will record their itch condition twice daily using the participant daily
      diary from 2 weeks prior to randomization until Week 12. Blood samples will be drawn at time
      periods during the screening, double-blind treatment, and follow-up periods. Participant
      safety will be monitored throughout the study. Participants are permitted to use concomitant
      topical medications, as defined in the protocol and without any increase in dose, from 4
      weeks prior to randomization through to the end of the treatment period. After Week 12,
      additional treatment can be started or the dose of concomitant medications can be increased,
      if no improvement in clinical response is observed; in these cases EASI, IGA, and photography
      evaluations will be stopped. The study duration for each participant is expected to be
      approximately 30 weeks. Ustekinumab (also known as STELARA) is an antibody medication that
      inhibits the inflammatory proteins IL-12 and IL-23 and is approved as a treatment for
      moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis; this study will examine whether ustekinumab can
      provide benefit in atopic dermatitis and assess for any risks or side effects.

    <measure>Percent Change in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) Total Score From Baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90 percent [%]-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Itch Scale (ADIS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The atopic dermatitis itch scale (ADIS) will be used to assess pruritus (itching) among participants with AD. It will be evaluated by participant diary kept twice daily,in the morning(morning daily score[MDS]) and evening (Evening Daily Score[EDS]). The start-of-day item set consists of 4 items:itching at time of completing morning diary(Q1),presence of itching during night before(Q2), itching at its worst at night (Q3), and impact of itching on sleep at night(Q4). Appropriate items are summed to yield total score ranging from 0=minimum to 23=maximum, with higher scores reflecting greater itching. The end-of day item set also consists of 4 items: itching at time of completing the evening diary(Q1),the presence of itching during the day(Q2),itching at its worst during the day(Q3),and amount of time the participant experienced eczema-related itching(Q4). Appropriate items are summed to yield total score ranging from 0=minimum to 24=maximum,with higher scores reflecting greater itching.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) instrument designed to assess impact of disease on a participants QOL. It is a 10-item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall, QOL can be used to assess 6 different aspects: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships and treatment. Questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale: 0 (not relevant), 1 (a little), 2 (a lot), and 3 (very much). Scores of individual items (0-3) were added to yield a total score (0-30); higher score = greater impairment of participants QOL.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) Total Score From Baseline at Week 12</title>
        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90 percent [%]-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Itch Scale (ADIS) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The atopic dermatitis itch scale (ADIS) will be used to assess pruritus (itching) among participants with AD. It will be evaluated by participant diary kept twice daily,in the morning(morning daily score[MDS]) and evening (Evening Daily Score[EDS]). The start-of-day item set consists of 4 items:itching at time of completing morning diary(Q1),presence of itching during night before(Q2), itching at its worst at night (Q3), and impact of itching on sleep at night(Q4). Appropriate items are summed to yield total score ranging from 0=minimum to 23=maximum, with higher scores reflecting greater itching. The end-of day item set also consists of 4 items: itching at time of completing the evening diary(Q1),the presence of itching during the day(Q2),itching at its worst during the day(Q3),and amount of time the participant experienced eczema-related itching(Q4). Appropriate items are summed to yield total score ranging from 0=minimum to 24=maximum,with higher scores reflecting greater itching.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) instrument designed to assess impact of disease on a participants QOL. It is a 10-item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall, QOL can be used to assess 6 different aspects: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships and treatment. Questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale: 0 (not relevant), 1 (a little), 2 (a lot), and 3 (very much). Scores of individual items (0-3) were added to yield a total score (0-30); higher score = greater impairment of participants QOL.</description>

        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Total Score</title>
        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Sign of Disease Components</title>
        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline of Body Region Scores in EASI</title>
        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

        <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

          <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>
