          -  Use of hormonal contraception (i.e. oral contraceptives, hormonal contraceptive
             vaginal ring, but not hormone-containing intrauterine devices, depot injections or
             contraceptive implants)

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any relevant deviation from healthy conditions

          -  Subject is assessed by the investigator as unsuitable for inclusion, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Positive pregnancy test, pregnancy or planning to become pregnant within 1 month of
             study completion, or lactation

          -  Any relevant finding of the gynaecological examination

          -  Thrombotic predisposition according to thrombophilic testing

          -  Existing or history of arterial thrombotic or embolic processes, conditions which
             predispose to them e.g. disorders of the clotting processes, valvular heart disease
             and atrial fibrillation

          -  Existing or history of confirmed venous thromboembolism, family history of venous
             thromboembolism, and other known risk factors for venous thromboembolism.

          -  Relevant varicosis

          -  No use of an additional contraceptive method from screening examination until 1 month
             after last study drug administration (acceptable methods are considered to be barrier
             methods, sexual abstinence, non-hormone-containing intrauterine device, or
             vasectomisation for the male partner).

        Use of hormone-containing intrauterine device, depot injection or contraceptive implants

          -  Any history of relevant liver diseases (e.g. disturbances of liver function, jaundice
             or persistent itching during a previous pregnancy, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor
             syndrome, or previous or existing liver tumours)

          -  AST (aspartate transaminase) and/or ALT (alanine transaminase) &gt; 1.5 ULN (upper limit
             of normal)

In the last 7 days of the run-in period (Day -7 to Day -1), no treatment was given in order to induce withdrawal bleeding. The next day was to be Day 1 of the study. Subjects who were using oral contraceptives before the study started the run-in period after the usual tablet-free interval of 7 days.
