    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a compressed dosing schedule and the immunologic effects
      of co-administration of a flavivirus with JE vaccine.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To describe and compare the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue
           virus serotypes at baseline and 28 days after each CYD dengue vaccine dose.

        -  To describe the persistence of the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental
           dengue virus serotypes 6 months after CYD dengue vaccine Dose 3, irrespective of whether
           or not JE vaccine has been previously administered.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety profile after each injection of CYD dengue vaccine.

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue virus serotypes
           at baseline and 28 days after each CYD dengue vaccine dose when administered with or
           after JE virus vaccine.

        -  To describe the persistence of the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental
           dengue virus serotypes at six months post-Dose 3 in all four groups and at 12 months
           post dose 3 in Groups 1 and 3 with the compressed schedule.

        -  To describe the JE humoral immune response 28 days after each injection of CYD dengue
           vaccine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of
             non-childbearing potential, a female must be post- menopausal for at least 1 year,
             surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from
             at least 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after the
             last vaccination)

          -  Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination, or planned
             participation during the present trial period, in another clinical trial investigating
             a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure

          -  Receipt or planned receipt of any vaccine, outside the study protocol in the 4 weeks
             preceding or following trial vaccinations. (If influenza activity warrants vaccination
             of healthy young adults, influenza vaccination will be encouraged and will not lead to
             study exclusion.)

          -  Any history of flavivirus (FV) vaccination, or planned FV vaccination during the trial
             period.

          -  Previous residence (&gt;12 months) in, or travel in the last 30 days to dengue endemic
             regions.

          -  Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the 3 months prior to
             first vaccination or planned use during the study period

             immunosuppressive therapy such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within
             the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or
             equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months)

          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components (including protamine
             sulfate), or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the
             trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances, including dry natural
             latex

          -  Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,
             or hospitalized involuntarily

          -  Excessive alcohol consumption or drug addiction

          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might
             interfere with trial conduct or completion

          -  Identified as an employee of the Investigator or study center, with direct involvement
             in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or
             study center, as well as family members (i.e., immediate, husband, wife and their
             children, adopted or natural) of the employee or the Investigator

          -  Temporary Exclusion Criteria: Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to
             Investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥
             38.0°C [≥ 100.4°F]). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until
             the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided. If the delay for the
             febrile illness exceeds the window between screening and vaccination, or if deemed
             necessary by the Investigator, a prospective subject may be re-screened once the fever
             has resolved.
