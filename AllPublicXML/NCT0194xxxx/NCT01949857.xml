      The purpose of this Phase 4 trial is to assess the safety, immunogenicity, three-year immune
      persistence of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) and live attenuated HAV vaccine.

      Hepatitis A refers to liver inflammation caused by infection with the hepatitis A virus. HAV
      is is one of the most common hepatitis viruses that can cause hepatitis in China. The data
      from the phase 1, 2 and 3 trials suggested that both inactivated hepatitis A vaccine and live
      attenuated hepatitis A vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for
      healthy Chinese people.
