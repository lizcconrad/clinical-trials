    <textblock>
      Neonatal nutrition has to face a contradictory and conflicting nutritional regimen like a
      high percentage of amino acids from the first day of life in order to achieve normal
      neurodevelopment versus metabolic complications (insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, increased
      visceral fat) that this type feeding, in conjunction with complexity of prematurity, is
      likely to cause. Current study aims to investigate is whether individualized fortification of
      breast milk protein, based on the mother's milk protein content and targeting the recommended
      daily protein requirements, is associated with better nutrition, growth, biochemical and
      endocrine markers associated with the nutrition of preterm low birth weight neonates,
      compared to the standard fortification of human milk.

      Proteins are of the most important macromolecules in living organisms participating in almost
      all biological processes. Premature infants are forced to adapt to a new (extrauterine)
      environment where supply of nutrients, including amino acids, from mother ceases abruptly.
      Consequently, the aim of neonatologist is the appropriate, quantitatively and qualitatively
      nutritional support, to promote brain development, achieve normal endocrine and metabolic
      function, maintain a growth rate similar to the intrauterine one avoiding extrauterine growth
      restriction during postnatal period and at the same time encouraging the analogue modulation
      of body composition (increased muscle mass, decrease body fat, hydration).

      Malnutrition or inadequate nutrition of preterm infant which remains undiagnosed and without
      proper treatment could have serious consequences on psychomotor development and metabolic
      activity. Indeed, 75% of low birth weight premature infants exhibit extrauterine growth
      restriction at discharge, even when they have achieved growth equal to the considered
      satisfactory, ie 15g/kg/day.

      Beyond anthropometrics differences between preterm and full-term newborns, body composition
      varies as well. Preterms have higher percentage of body fat and decreased muscle mass at term
      time compared with full term neonates. However, it has not been clarified whether this
      differentiation is harmful predisposing to chronic diseases later in childhood or adult life
      (eg. obesity, metabolic syndrome).
