  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine differences in levels of serum chemokines from
      patients undergoing treatment with Boceprevir. The aim is to determine if non-responders have
      significantly different levels of chemokines than responders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing standard of care at the UNC Liver Center are consented for collection of
      an additional serum sample under the UNC Liver Center serum and tissue bank study. These
      samples will be used to analyze differences in serum chemokines across responders and
      non-responders.
