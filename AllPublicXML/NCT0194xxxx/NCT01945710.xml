      Study E7389-E044-112 is a Phase 1 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of E7389 liposomal formulation (E7389-LF) in patients with solid tumors.
      This dose-escalation study will determine the maximum tolerated dose, dosing schedules
      tested, the dose schedule regimen with a more favorable tolerability profile, and a
      preliminary indication of efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 first-in-human, non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance
      to study treatments), open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments),
      multicenter, 2-part, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of
      what the body does to a drug) of E7389 LF administered orally to patients with solid tumors.
      Each treatment cycle will be 21 days (Schedule 1) or 28 days (Schedule 1a or 2). Part 1 is
      the dose-escalation phase, which will be guided by pharmacokinetics and safety. Three to 6
      new patients will be enrolled in sequential cohorts (first cohort will receive the starting
      dose and subsequent cohorts will receive increased doses of E7389 LF). Enrollment in each
      cohort will be staggered; the second and third participant in every cohort will not be dosed
      until the first patient in that cohort completes 2 weeks of Cycle 1. If no dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) have been observed during the first 2 week of Cycle 1 in the first patient,
      the second and third patients in the cohort will initiate treatment. Enrollment will be first
      initiated into cohort 1 of Schedule 1 (dosing on Day 1 of 21 day cycle). Interim analysis
      will be conducted upon completion of this cohort. The following decisions will be made based
      upon the results of the interim analysis 1) proceed with escalating to next dose level
      (cohort 2) of Schedule 1 (dosing on Day 1 of 21 day cycle) and initiate cohort 1 of Schedule
      2 (dosing on Day 1 and Day 15 of 28 day cycle), or 2) discontinue plans to evaluate Schedule
      2 and initiate Schedule 1a (dosing on Day 1 of 28 day cycle).

      After the last patient in each cohort completes Cycle 1, the safety for DLT determination
      will be evaluated and a decision will be made on whether to escalate the dose in a new cohort
      of 3 to 6 new patients. Dose escalation will halt when the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      reached. The total number of patients to be enrolled in Part 1 will depend on the dose level
      at which the DLT will be achieved. After MTD for each schedule is determined, patients will
      be enrolled into Expansion Part of the study to confirm safety and tolerability of each
      dosing schedule. Nine to 12 patients will be treated with MTD for each schedule for 6 cycles.
      The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 18 months.

             of liver metastases less than or equal to 5 x ULN). In case ALP is greater than 3 x
             ULN (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver
             metastases) AND subject also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific ALP
             must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of the
             total ALP.

          5. Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0
             mg/dL (177 umol/L) or calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40
             mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula.

          6. Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater

             first dose of study drug.

          8. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, all
             with surgery at least one month before dosing).

             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use two highly effective methods
             of contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier
             method [condom and occlusive cap - diaphragm or cervical/vault caps - with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository], a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or
             have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study
             period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently abstinent, the
             subject must agree to use a double barrier method with spermicide as described above
             if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a
             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation.

         10. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the
             study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

         11. Provide written informed consent.

         12. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Subjects who have received any anticancer therapy within 21 days prior to study entry
             for cytotoxic agents (42 days for mitomycin C and nitrosoureas), radiotherapy,
             hormonal, biological (including humanized antibodies) and targeted agents, or within
             30 days for an investigational agent.

          3. Subjects who have not recovered from acute toxicities as a result of prior anti-cancer
             therapy to less than Grade 2, according to CTCAE, except alopecia.

          4. Subjects who have previously been treated with eribulin.

          5. Radiation therapy encompassing greater than 30% of the bone marrow.

             indication for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Any symptom(s) attributed to
             brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment, and
             radiographic stability should be confirmed by comparing a brain scan (CT with contrast
             or MRI with and without contrast) performed during the Screening Period to a brain
             scan performed at least 4 weeks earlier using the same modality.
