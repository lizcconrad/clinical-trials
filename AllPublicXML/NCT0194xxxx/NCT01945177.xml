      It is recognized that gastroscopy can miss intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and early gastric
      cancer. This could conceivably be due to the fact that these lesions may only present as
      subtle mucosal changes on conventional white light endoscopy (WLE) and thus be easily missed.
      In narrow band imaging (NBI) a rotating interference narrow band filter is interposed after
      the xenon light source such that when the NBI mode is switched on, discrete blue and green
      wavelengths are used and this improves mucosal surface contrast and facilitates visualization
      of mucosal details. A new NBI system is available that allows brighter illumination. We
      hypothesize that bright -NBI is superior to WLE in detecting focal gastric lesions such as
      gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and early gastric cancer in subjects undergoing

      Background It is recognized that gastroscopy can miss intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and
      early gastric cancer (EGC)[1-3]. This could conceivably be due to the fact that EGC, as well
      as premalignant changes, may only present as subtle mucosal changes on conventional white
      light endoscopy (WLE) and thus be easily missed.

      Chromoendoscopy has been used routinely in some centers during upper gastrointestinal (UGI)
      endoscopy in an attempt to improve mucosal contrast and detect subtle mucosal lesions[4].
      However, this is not the norm in most centers due to the inconvenience of dye spray. Narrow
      band imaging (NBI) facilitates the examination of the mucosal surface without a need for
      chromoendoscopy. It is based on the principle that the depth of penetration of light is
      wavelength dependent, with shorter wavelengths resulting in more superficial penetration i.e.
      blue light penetrates most superficially (mucosal imaging) while red light penetrates the
      deepest (submucosal imaging). In NBI a rotating interference narrow band filter is interposed
      after the xenon light source such that when the NBI mode is switched on, discrete blue and
      green wavelengths are used and this improves mucosal surface contrast and facilitates
      visualization of mucosal details[5]. Magnifying endoscopy (ME) is useful in assessing the
      gastric mucosal pit pattern and microvessel of gastric mucosal lesions, thus providing the
      possibility of predicting the histological nature of the mucosal lesion. Studies from Japan,
      a country with a high population risk for gastric cancer, which were based on preselected
      high risk patients or patients with known precancerous lesions or EGC, showed that NBI and
      NBI-ME could diagnose precancerous lesions such as intestinal metaplasia (IM)[6] as well as
      EGC[7-11].

      However, there is a lack of published data on the clinical utility of NBI in the detection of
      gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and EGC in the unselected general population. A
      recent study from Singapore looked at the utility of NBI and NBI-ME in patients aged 35 to 70
      years undergoing diagnostic UGI endoscopy and found that the detection rate of focal lesions
      was increased from 43.7% to 58.8% with NBI, compared to WLE. Among the additional lesions
      detected, NBI-ME identified 97.1% as IM, 1.4% as EGC and 1.4% as benign. The EGC was a
      synchronous cancer missed by WLE but detected by NBI[12].

      The current NBI system is limited by the dark endoscopic view. This has the potential
      limitation of making the detection of subtle lesions more difficult and lesions could be
      missed. A new prototype NBI system has been designed that has a brighter appearance. This
      prototype bright NBI coupled with high definition resolution is likely to overcome this
      drawback of original NBI.

      Hypothesis We hypothesize that bright -NBI is superior to WLE in detecting focal gastric
      lesions such as gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and EGC in subjects undergoing
      diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.

      Materials and methods

        1. Setting and trial design:

           A randomized controlled study.

        2. Subjects:

           Inclusion criteria: 1) Subjects aged &gt; 50 years undergoing diagnostic or screening upper
           GI endoscopy; 2) ability to provide a written consent to trial participation. Exclusion
           criteria: 1) presence of active gastrointestinal bleeding; 2) presence of coagulopathy
           precluding biopsies; 3) absence of informed consent.

        3. Informed Consent:

           The protocol will be approved by local Institutional Review Board. Trial subjects will
           sign informed consent prior to UGI endoscopy.

        4. Interventions:

           Subjects are randomized to undergo UGI endoscopy in either WLE or bright light NBI
           modes, using a high definition gastroscope (Olympus 190 or 290 series). An endoscopy
           assistant will then open the next numbered sealed envelop at the instruction of the
           endoscopist. For subjects randomized to WLE, the entire examination will be performed
           using white light. For subjects randomized to NBI, the NBI mode will be switched on
           before insertion into the stomach. Once the gastroscope is inserted into the duodenum,
           the endoscopist can switch back to WLE to examine the duodenal mucosa. Before withdrawal
           from the duodenum back into the stomach, the NBI mode will be switched on and gastric
           mucosal examination carried out in the NBI mode. After the gastric examination findings
           using NBI have been recorded, the endoscopist is allowed to re-examine the gastric
           mucosa using white light, but any additional findings will not be recorded in the study
           data sheet. During withdrawal into the esophagus, the endoscopist can switch back to WLE
           to examine the esophageal mucosa.

           Recorded parameters include 1) presence or absence of focal lesions and the suspected
           diagnosis such as a) IM; b) cancer; c) early cancer; d) gastric ulcer or erosion; e)
           other focal lesions. Switching from WLE to NBI and vice versa is allowed at the
           discretion of endoscopist after detection of a lesion. Endoscopists may elect to remove
           these lesions using WLE. Magnification is allowed in either group. IM is diagnosed on
           white light endoscopy based on by whitish color change with plaques, patches, or
           homogeneous discoloration on the gastric mucosa[13].High definition white light
           endoscopy may possibly visualize the villous pattern. IM is diagnosed on NBI based on
           the criteria such as light blue crest and villous morphology[14, 15]. Early cancer may
           present on white light endoscopy with varied non-specific features such as a subtle
           polypoid protrusion, a superficial plaque, ulcer, depression, or even a mucosal
           discoloration. However distortions of the mucosal pit pattern and microvascular pattern
           on NBI have been found to be characteristic[6].

           Lesion size is measured by a comparison to known diameter of open forceps and grouped
           into size categories. The decision to perform hot/ cold biopsies or snaring is left to
           the endoscopist. Each lesion is retrieved separately for pathologic examination.

           Recognizing that the incidence rate of cancer may be low from the study populations[16],
           the decision was made to use as a surrogate intestinal metaplasia, a known premalignant
           lesion, as the main outcome variable.

        5. Statistics:

             1. Methods of randomization:

                Randomization sequence will be generated using a computer program in blocks of 20
                of equal assignment pertaining to individual endoscopists who participate in the
                trial.

             2. Primary outcome variables:

                Detection rate of IM

             3. Secondary outcome variables:

                  1. Detection rate of gastric cancer

                  2. Aggregate detection rate of focal gastric lesions The diagnostic performance
                     of the imaging modality will form ancillary analyses. Histology will be the
                     gold standard.

             4. Sample size calculation:

           In the UGI endoscopy study that compared NBI with WLE in the general population, it was
           found that most focal lesions were due to IM and that after age 50 years, the prevalence
           rate of IM was 36%[12]. In this study, WLE detected IM in 4.4% of cases, whereas NBI
           detected IM in 16.2% of cases. We arbitrarily assumed that HD WLE increase the detection
           rate of IM to 10%, while keeping the IM det4ection rate by NBI to 16.2%. We determine
           our sample size to detect a 6.2% difference with a power of 80% and a two sided type 1
           error of 0.05. A total of 464 patients will be required.

        6. Timetable of work:

      The study will continue until the intended subject size of 464 subjects is reached. .
