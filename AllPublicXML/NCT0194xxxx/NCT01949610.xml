      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absorption, the metabolic pathways (a series of
      metabolic reactions) and the excretion of JNJ26489112 in healthy male adult participants
      after administration of a single oral dose of 1000 mg of 14C-JNJ26489112.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, 1-arm (group), open-label study (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) in healthy adult male participants. On Day 1, after completing a 10-hour
      overnight fast, participants will receive a single oral dose of 14C-JNJ-26489112 1,000 mg as
      a 10-mL suspension. Participants will be recruited in 2 cohorts. The 6 participants in the
      first cohort were dosed in error with doses less than 1000 mg. So, an additional cohort of 4
      participants will be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of 1000 mg 14C-JNJ 26489112.
      Total 10 participants will receive the study medication. Safety will be assessed by
      monitoring vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory
      tests throughout the study. The total duration of the study for each participant will be
      approximately 5 weeks (including up to 3 weeks for screening and 11 to 15 days of study) or
      up to 1 additional week for participants who excrete 14C-JNJ26489112 more slowly.

    <description>Suicide related outcome measures will be assessed by using Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). By using the C-SSRS, potential suicide-related events will be categorized using the codes defined by the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment from Code 0: no event that can be assessed based on the C-SSRS to Code 9: not enough information, nonfatal. The 4 suicide-related outcomes of interest are the following: suicidal ideation (Code 4), suicidal behavior (Codes 1 to 3), suicidal behavior or ideation (Codes 1 to 4), and possible suicidal behavior or ideation (Codes 1 to 6 and 9).</description>
