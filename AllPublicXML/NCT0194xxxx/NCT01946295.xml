      Objective of the trial is to study if famotidine add-on treatment is more effective than
      placebo add-on in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia among patients receiving insufficient
      response to ongoing antipsychotic treatment.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20.00-20.39, F20.5, F20.9) who have had the
             disorder for at least 5 years and who are on disability pension. (This means that
             their treatment response is not satisfactory and for the purpose of this study, the
             subjects are potentially treatment resistant).

          -  Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity score of at least 3.

          -  No changes in schizophrenia treatment within 12 weeks before study inclusion.

          -  Written informed consent

          -  The subjects must fulfil schizophrenia criteria both according to DSM- IV (295.10,
             .20, .30, .60, .90) (American Psychiatric association) and the Research Diagnostic
             Criteria for schizophrenia (RDC) [40]. They must also have at least mild residual
             symptoms (CGI 3 points). The DSM-IV diagnosis will be verified by use of the SCID-I
             [41]. The DSM-IV is clearly the most commonly used in psychiatric research, so this is
             important to be able to generalize the findings. However, several previous studies
             have used the RDC, so to be able to compare the results, we will diagnose the patients
             according to both systems.

          -  Women of child-bearing age will be included only of they use adequate contraception,
             or if we can otherwise verify that the subject is not pregnant (s-HCG), the
             possibility of pregnancy is negligible (e.g. the personnel of the housing facility
             reports that the person has not had sexual relationships for years) and the subject
             approves to remain sexually abstinent for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Epilepsy or a history of unclear seizures, stroke, Parkinson's disease, AIDS

          -  History of substance addiction or abuse within 3 months prior to enrolment.

          -  Individuals who are deemed at risk for aggressive behaviour or suicide

          -  If their laboratory tests, EKG or other clinical observation warrants exclusion, they
             will be excluded

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding subjects will not be included in the study.

          -  Patients with any serious unstable physical illness will also be excluded

          -  Patients who have been deemed to be legally incapacitated according to Finnish or
             Swedish law.

          -  Regular Uuse of H2-antagonists as prescribed by a physician.

          -  Known allergy to famotidine or any other component of interventional drug will be
             excluded.

          -  Ongoing treatment with clozapine and dixyrazine.

          -  Clinical condition &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved&quot;, assessed by CGI, during
             the placebo lead-in

          -  Renal insufficiency (P-creatinine not within normal range. Glomerular filtration rate
             &lt;30 ml/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula. )

          -  Liver insufficiency (S-ALAT elevated more than 2-fold above the laboratory specific
             normal range)
