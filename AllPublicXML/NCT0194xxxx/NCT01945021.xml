    <measure>Independent Radiology Reviewed Overall Objective Response (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Starting from the first dose study treatment until the first documented CR or PR.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Objective Response (ORR) was defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response or confirmed Partial Response according to RECIST v1.1 (as determined by Independent Radiology Review [IRR]), relative to the total population of response-evaluable patients (n=127). Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response by Independent Review</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 or 12 weeks until 6 months after the last patient was enrolled in the trial</time_frame>
    <description>The time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) according to Independent Review and that was subsequently confirmed to the first documentation of objective disease progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. It was calculated for the response evaluable population in the subgroup of patients with a confirmed objective response and who had a subsequent event of progression or death without progression. Patients who did not meet these criteria were censored on the date of the last on-study tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose of crizotinib every 8 weeks or 12 weeks until first documentation of objective response is observed, until 6 months after the last subject is enrolled on the trial</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response is defined as the time from the date of first dose to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), as assessed by Independent Radiology Review, that is subsequently confirmed. For patients proceeding from PR to CR, the onset of PR is taken as the onset of response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate at 8 Weeks by Independent Radiology Review</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured once at 8 weeks after the start of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Disease Control Rate at 8 weeks is defined as the number of patients with a confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD at 8 weeks, respectively, according to RECIST v1.1 (as determined by IRR), relative to the total population of response evaluable patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival Assessed by Independent Radiology Review</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose of crizotinib every 8 weeks or 12 weeks until the first documentation of objective disease progression or death</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of crizotinib to first documentation of objective disease progression or to death on study due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who had neither progression nor death without objective progression were censored at the time of data cut off.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from date of date of the first dose of crizotinib until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 6 months after the last subject is enrolled on the trial</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Type, Incidence, Severity, Seriousness and Relationship to Study Medications of Adverse Events (AE) and Any Laboratory Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of signed informed consent, then a minimum of every 4 weeks until 32 weeks, then a minimum of every 8 weeks, or until 4 weeks after last dose of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of patients experiencing a treatment emergent adverse events were summarized by type, incidence, severity, seriousness and relationship to study medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With a Shift of Chemistry Laboratory Results From Grade &lt;/= 2 to Grade 3 or Grade 4</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of baseline screening test every 4, 8, or 12 weeks until 28 days from last dose of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A summary of the number of patients in the safety population with available laboratory data whose chemistry laboratory results shifted from a baseline value of Grade &lt;/=2 to a post-baseline result of Grade 3 or Grade 4</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Scores on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of informed consent every 8 weeks or 12 weeks until cycle 8</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions which are incorporated into 5 functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social domains); a global health status/global QOL scale; 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and 6 single items that assess the additional symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. Scores for each sub-scale range from 0 to 100. Negative change from baseline scores indicated an improvement in symptoms, decreased functioning, or decreased global QOL, while positive change from baseline scores indicated an improvement in functioning, improvement in global QOL, or a worsening of symptoms. A clinically meaningful change was defined as a &gt;/= 10-point change in mean scores. Changes were described as statistically significant if the 95% CI for the change did not include 0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Scores on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module 13</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of informed consent every 8 weeks or 12 weeks until cycle 8</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-LC13 consisted of 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items that assessed specific symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site-specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use. Negative change from baseline scores indicated an improvement in symptoms, decreased functioning, or decreased global QOL, while positive change from baseline scores indicated an improvement in functioning, improvement in global QOL, or a worsening of symptoms. Scores on each sub-scale range from 0 - 100. A clinically meaningful change was defined as a &gt;/= 10-point change in mean scores. Changes were described as statistically significant if the 95% CI for the change did not include 0.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Scores on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30)</title>
        <description>The QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions which are incorporated into 5 functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social domains); a global health status/global QOL scale; 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and 6 single items that assess the additional symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. Scores for each sub-scale range from 0 to 100. Negative change from baseline scores indicated an improvement in symptoms, decreased functioning, or decreased global QOL, while positive change from baseline scores indicated an improvement in functioning, improvement in global QOL, or a worsening of symptoms. A clinically meaningful change was defined as a &gt;/= 10-point change in mean scores. Changes were described as statistically significant if the 95% CI for the change did not include 0.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Scores on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module 13</title>
        <description>The QLQ-LC13 consisted of 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items that assessed specific symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site-specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use. Negative change from baseline scores indicated an improvement in symptoms, decreased functioning, or decreased global QOL, while positive change from baseline scores indicated an improvement in functioning, improvement in global QOL, or a worsening of symptoms. Scores on each sub-scale range from 0 - 100. A clinically meaningful change was defined as a &gt;/= 10-point change in mean scores. Changes were described as statistically significant if the 95% CI for the change did not include 0.</description>

      <time_frame>AEs (non-serious) were collected from the time the patient took at least one dose of study treatment through 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. The overall AE reporting period for the final analysis is 11 Oct 2013 (first patient first dose) to 30 Jul 2015 (last patient first visit plus 6 months).</time_frame>
      <desc>SAE reporting began from the time that the subject provided informed consent through and including 28 days after the last dose of the crizotinib. Afterward, reporting occurred if the PI became aware of the SAE and at minimum, if the SAE was believed to be possibly related to crizotinib. Death was reported irrespective of any intervening treatment. The overall reporting period for SAEs for the final analysis was 25 Sep 2013 (date first patient consented) to 20 Jul 2015.</desc>
