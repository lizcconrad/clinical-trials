    <textblock>
      The investigators previously identified a novel HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope peptide, which
      was derived from a cancer-testis antigen, URLC10 as a target for vaccination against lung
      cancer. In this clinical study, the investigators examine using the peptides the safety,
      immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment to prevent relapse of the disease
      for HLA-A*0201-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients whose disease are
      controlled after any standard therapies.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and
      clinical efficacies of HLA-A*0201 restricted epitope peptides URLC10 emulsified with
      Montanide ISA 51 for disease controlled advanced non-small cell lung cancers.

      relapse of the disease.
