      Hypothesis: the antibody directed against certain antigens of Clostridium difficile would be
      predict the Clostridium difficile infection.

      This study evaluates the weight of immunity by studying patients with Clostridium difficile
      infection versus controls (each patient is associated with two controls : diarrheal control
      without Clostridium difficile, and non-diarrheal control with or without Clostridium
      difficile). Recurrence and the kinetics of immune response following infection Clostridium
      difficile are studied by following the patients during three months.

      There are also building biological samples collections clinically documented: sera, stool and
      strains.

        CASES :

        Inclusion criteria of the cases :

          -  Hospitalized patients with clinical signs of Clostridium Difficile Infection and
             specific detection in stools of Clostridium Difficile toxins or/and isolating in
             stools and by digestive biopsy a strain producer of Clostridium Difficile toxins.

          -  Patients for which a serum prior to the episode of Clostridium Difficile Infection,
             ideally as far as possible of the episode, but at least 6 days before the day of
             diagnosis (D0) will be available.

          -  Patients for which consent has been signed or by their legal representative by
             default.

          -  Patients for whom is found Clostridium Difficile Infection in their file surgical and
             those for whom Clostridium Difficile Infection is the reason for admission will be
             included in the study but will be subject of a separate analysis, and their witnesses.

        Exclusion criteria of the cases :

          -  Eligible patients for whom Clostridium Difficile Infection has been strongly suspected
             clinically but for which no microbiological confirmation will have been obtained.

          -  Eligible patients for whom no previous serum will have been recovered according to the
             criteria and conditions. The availability of a serum corresponding to the patient's
             admission is optional and can not be an exclusion criteria.

          -  Eligible patients (or their legal representatives) who are opposed to the use of their
             samples, the achieving samples and/or the longitudinal follow-up.

          -  Eligible patients who underwent plasmapheresis or treated with monoclonal antibodies
             to toxin A and B or immunoglobulins during the year preceding the episode of
             Clostridium Difficile Infection.

          -  Eligible patients but already included in the study for a recent infection with
             Clostridium Difficile or transferred to a second health facility for the same episode
             of Clostridium Difficile Infection.

          -  Eligible patients whose physicians responsible for the management refused
             participation in the study.

          -  Protected persons: pregnant women and children under the age of 18.

        Secondarily be excluded the following cases:

          -  Patients for whom no sample has been achieved or retained by the laboratory of Medical
             Biology who participated in the diagnosis and monitoring of the patient.

          -  Hospitalized patients at the time of Clostridium Difficile Infection suspicion and
             diagnostic sample but released or transferred before rendering necessary
             microbiological results at baseline (J0 or J3).

          -  Matched control in a case excluded will be excluded.

        NON-DIARRHEAL CONTROL : Eligible patients are those who do not have diarrhea at the time of
        recruitment.

        To ensure that exposure to risks similar for cases and controls (hospitalization, usually
        care epidemic period, ...) will be recruited eligible patients according to the following
        criteria:

          -  Within a maximum period of six months after the inclusion of cases.

          -  Hospitalized in the same hospitalization service type as the case.

          -  With a duration of prior hospitalization at least as long as the time between
             admission and the corresponding case J0,

          -  Matched on sex and three age categories (18-40, 41-60 and&gt; 60 years).

        The inclusion of these controls depends on the one hand signing an informed consent for
        participation in the study and secondly the lack clinical signs suggestive of Clostridium
        Difficile Infection at the time of inclusion and known history of Clostridium Difficile
        Infection in their medical records (one no-diarrheal control hospitalized (ND) for one
        case).
