      non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria is designed to provide data on an A/H7N9 vaccine made with HA antigen

      This Phase II randomized, double-blinded, controlled study in up to 1000 males and
      non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria is designed to provide data on an A/H7N9 vaccine made with HA antigen
      derived from the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus. The study aims to address several
      critical questions, including the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a monovalent
      influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur: 1) two doses administered at
      different dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) given with AS03 adjuvant
      manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals or without adjuvant (15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose and
      45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL dose); and 2) a combination of two doses of the A/H7N9 vaccine (15 mcg
      of HA/0.5 mL dose) each administered with a different adjuvant (AS03 or MF59 manufactured by
      Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics); and 3) two doses administered at 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose
      given with MF59 adjuvant manufactured by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics.

             Exclusion Criteria) are stable . Subjects may be on chronic1 or as needed (prn)
             medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of
             reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with

             confound the interpretation of the results.

          -  Have an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe, or

          -  Have immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use of
             anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within 3 years prior to study
