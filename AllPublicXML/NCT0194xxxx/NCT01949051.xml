  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 3-way cross over design in
      allergic rhinitis subjects. Subjects will receive repeat doses of intra-nasal levocabastine
      for 7 days in each period and the duration of the study will be about 13 weeks. An
      Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) will be used in this study. The primary objective of the
      study is to investigate the non-inferiority effect of 7 days treatment with levocabastine on
      nasal symptoms elicited by an EEC when administered once daily (QD) compared with twice daily
      (BID). Also study will be conducted to investigate the superiority of effect of 7 days
      treatment with levocabastine (QD and BID) on nasal symptoms elicited by an EEC in subjects
      compared to placebo.

    <time_frame>Day 8 of each treatment period (up to 13 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS (score of 0-12) is defined as the sum of the symptom scores for the four individual components (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itch, and sneezing, each scored on 0-3 scale [0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe]). TNSS was measured at the pre-allergen chamber challenge, and then every 15 minutes from 0 to 4 hours post start of the allergen chamber challenge. In the Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), aerosolized allergen was administered in a sealed chamber to evaluate the efficacy of antihistamines/other treatments. Weighted mean TNSS was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve over the 0-4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 8 of each treatment period (up to 13 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS contains symtom scores for the four individual components (nasal congestion [NACG], rhinorrhea [RHSCR], nasal itching [NAITS] and sneezing [SNZS]), each scored on a 0 - 3 scale [0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe]). TNSS was measured at the pre-allergen chamber challenge, and then every 15 minutes from 0 to 4 hours post start of the allergen chamber challenge. In the Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), aerosolized allergen is administered in a sealed chamber to evaluate the efficacy of antihistamines/other treatments. The participants recorded their symptom scores on an e-diary. The mean score for each participant was calculated using the available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Weighted mean of the individual symptoms of theTNSS were calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve over the 0-4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          <description>Participants received placebo/ Levo at a dose of 200 µg OD in the morning as 2 nasal sprays (50 µg per spray) into each nostril or 400 µg BID in the morning and evening as 2 nasal sprays (50 µg per spray) into each nostril for 7 days each, in a crossover design. Treatment was given in one of six sequences in Periods 1, 2, and 3, (14 to 20 day washout period between treatments): ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC, CBA (A, Levo 200µg; B, Levo 400µg: C, Placebo). On Day 8 of each treatment period (approximately 12 hours post dosing for treatment A and 24 hours post dosing for treatment B and C), participants entered the environmental exposure chamber (EEC) for a 4-hour period, and the assessments were conducted 12-24 hours post-dose. All participants attended a follow-up visit within 7 to 14 day after their final dose, and the overall duration for participation in the study (screening to follow-up) was 13 weeks.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean of the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) (0-4) Hours (h) Post Start of Allergen Chamber Challenge on Day 8</title>
        <description>The TNSS (score of 0-12) is defined as the sum of the symptom scores for the four individual components (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itch, and sneezing, each scored on 0-3 scale [0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe]). TNSS was measured at the pre-allergen chamber challenge, and then every 15 minutes from 0 to 4 hours post start of the allergen chamber challenge. In the Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), aerosolized allergen was administered in a sealed chamber to evaluate the efficacy of antihistamines/other treatments. Weighted mean TNSS was calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve over the 0-4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>

        <description>TNSS contains symtom scores for the four individual components (nasal congestion [NACG], rhinorrhea [RHSCR], nasal itching [NAITS] and sneezing [SNZS]), each scored on a 0 - 3 scale [0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe]). TNSS was measured at the pre-allergen chamber challenge, and then every 15 minutes from 0 to 4 hours post start of the allergen chamber challenge. In the Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), aerosolized allergen is administered in a sealed chamber to evaluate the efficacy of antihistamines/other treatments. The participants recorded their symptom scores on an e-diary. The mean score for each participant was calculated using the available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Weighted mean of the individual symptoms of theTNSS were calculated by dividing the value of the area under the response time curve over the 0-4 hours (calculated by trapezoidal rule) by the time interval of available data.</description>
