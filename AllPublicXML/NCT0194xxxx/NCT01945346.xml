  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate a new anti-inflammatory drug, PRX167700, in subjects
      with painful osteoarthritis of the knee.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate if PRX167700 improves the pain from
      osteoarthritis of the knee, and to assess its safety and tolerability. The study will also
      investigate PRX167700 pharmacokinetics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 74 subjects will receive either PRX167700 or placebo (a dummy treatment) for 15 days.
      Subjects will need to stop taking their usual pain reliever medicines for at least 7 days
      before starting treatment to induce a 'flare' in osteoarthritis symptoms (but they will be
      allowed to continue to use paracetamol for immediate pain relief as needed throughout the
      trial). The effect of PRX167700 or placebo on knee pain will be assessed before and after
      exercise on Days 1, 3, 7 and 14. On Day 15, blood samples will be collected to measure levels
      of PRX167700 and assess its activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 20 and 35 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Symptomatic primary OA of the knee for at least 3 months prior to Screening according
             to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.

          -  Diagnosis of OA of the knee based on ACR criteria with X-ray confirmation (a
             Kellgren-Lawrence X-ray grade of ≥2) in the target knee joint.

          -  Use of analgesics for the treatment of knee OA for at least 4 out of 7 days in each of
             the 4 weeks preceding the Screening visit.

          -  Willing and able to discontinue all current analgesic therapy, including over the
             counter (OTC) pain medications and topical analgesics for OA pain, for a period
             beginning at Screening and continuing for the entire duration of the study.

          -  Able to walk 100 metres on a flat course without rest and unaided.

          -  A self-rated Pain Intensity score in the target knee joint of between 3 and 8,
             inclusive, immediately after a timed 100 metres walk on a flat course.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study and, in the
             opinion of the investigator, able to read, comprehend and record information as
             required by the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary causes of arthritis of the knee, disease of the spine or of lower extremity
             joints (other than OA), knee pain characteristic of neuropathic pain.

          -  Oral corticosteroids within 1 month of Screening

          -  Therapeutic injections into the target knee joint within previous 3 months.
             Intra-articular corticosteroid injections into any other site within 1 month or
             intra-muscular corticosteroid injections within 3 months.

          -  Start or change in dosing regimen of other therapies for OA within 3 months of
             Screening.

          -  Start or change in an established physiotherapy programme within 2 weeks of Screening
             (Visit 1) or during the course of the study. An established physiotherapy program may

          -  Any significant clinical or biological abnormality (other than those related to OA)
             which would preclude safe participation in this study.
