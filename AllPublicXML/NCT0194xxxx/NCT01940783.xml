  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the contributing factors to the variability in outcomes amongst Cochlear Implant (CI)
      recipients was reported to be the placement of the electrode array in the scala tympani. It
      seems that the correct placement of the electrode initially into the scala tympani and
      subsequent avoidance of dislocation into the scala vestibuli as the insertion progresses, is
      a key factor in achieving good speech perception outcomes. Another important aspect related
      to the performance is the achievement of consistent electrical coverage with the electrode.
      Data reported for electrodes of different manufacturers give depths ranging from 240 - 600
      degrees showing the considerable variation across subjects. The HiFocus mid scala electrode
      was developed to cover one and a quarter turn and with the pre-curved design to be less
      susceptible to variations in individual cochlea dimensions and insertion techniques. A
      further mechanical feature of the pre-curved design is the avoidance of forces against the
      cochlear lateral wall and associated lower susceptibility of the electrode for moving out of
      the cochlea following insertion. Recently, a cone beam CT (CBCT) technique is being explored
      in the field of ENT with the potential to overcome some of the issues associated with the
      conventional CT techniques such as scattering, radiation and low isometric resolution. Images
      with comparable details to those of e.g. micro CTs are possible with much lower radiation
      dose. Modern imaging software i.e. 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org) may be used for 3D
      reconstruction, post processing and Brainsfit for registration. Registration is the alignment
      of two scans in the same coordinate system. This enables the identification of differences
      between two images recorded at time x and y. Once accurately superimposed any difference
      between the two images may be identified with an accuracy of 0.2 mm. Using these methods, one
      can assess the stability and the position of the electrode in the cochlea.

      Objective: The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the feasibility of using cone
      beam CT technique in combination with (high resolution) MRI to identify electrode movements
      following cochlear implant surgery and identify the inter-scalar position of the HFms
      electrode. The secondary objective is to quantify the average insertion depth and variations
      of the HFms electrode
