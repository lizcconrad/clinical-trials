    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine healthy children who skip breakfast and the effects of
      fasting on their neuropsychological functioning and the potential benefits that a Balanced
      Breakfast may have on their learning abilities. It is expected that this study will provide
      new knowledge on how prolonged periods of 8 or more hours without food affect neurocognitive
      processes and thus learning how specific meals following this period of fasting, which most
      children experience, change those processes, potentially for the better.

      The hypotheses for this study are:

        1. Children who consume breakfast will demonstrate significantly higher levels of
           attention, greater concentration, and diminished impulsivity compared to children who do
           not consume breakfast.

        2. Children who consume breakfast will demonstrate a significantly quicker reaction time
           and increased accuracy in correctly identifying target stimuli from an array compared to
           children who do not consume breakfast.

        3. Children who consume breakfast will demonstrate increased freedom from distractibility
           and enhanced short-term memory compared to children who do not consume breakfast.

        4. Children who consume breakfast will demonstrate increased cognitive processing speed
           compared to children who do not consume breakfast.

        5. Children who consume breakfast will have improved verbal learning compared to children
           who do not consume breakfast.

        6. Children who consume breakfast will have improved visual memory compared to children who
           do not consume breakfast.

    <textblock>
      Hunger can be considered a chronic health condition. Among children, the lack of available
      food to meet usual physical needs on a regular basis leads to poor cognitive and behavioral
      performance and is associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes. All of these
      findings are well documented among poor children living in families with sufficient food and
      are exacerbated even more among those in families living under conditions of food
      insufficiency. There has been a significant effort over the past 2 decades to document the
      effects of mechanisms of how hunger affects learning, cognitive performance, and behavior and
      how a meal, such as breakfast can mitigate those effects.

      The longest period during a 24-hour day when children go without food is the period from the
      beginning of sleep at night to the first meal of the following day. Therefore, the morning
      seems an ideal time to examine those biological factors that result from hunger or fasting
      and how they affect basic processes that underpin learning and behavior. Underprivileged but
      otherwise healthy children seem most affected by hunger. Thus, studies are needed to compare
      children from families of different economic income strata to understand better how a
      breakfast meal might affect those learning and behavioral processes, and whether the
      breakfast meal truly has a positive effect on basic learning and behavior.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects on short-term neuropsychological
      functioning of: a) consumption of breakfast versus no breakfast (2 different breakfast meals
      will be employed); and b) consumption of breakfast by groups of children from low income
      families vs children from families with average/middle incomes, who are 8-10 years of age.
      The primary outcome will be neuropsychological functioning in specific areas of cognition, as
      measured by standardized tests. A secondary outcome will be glucose homeostasis, measured by
      blood ketones and blood glucose and insulin.

      A total of 154 children will be recruited with an anticipated 20% drop out rate. The final
      sample will consist of 64 children in each socioeconomic group (total n=128) who will stay
      overnight three separate nights and participate in each breakfast condition. The sample will
      consist of low and middle income African- and Hispanic-Americans and Caucasian male and
      female children between the ages of 8-10. The sample size will consist of an equal number of
      boys and girls and will have an equal representation of children from the socioeconomic
      conditions (i.e. low and middle income) and ethnicities (African and Hispanic Americans and
      Caucasians) identified.

      The design consists of two independent groups based on SES with a crossover,
      repeated-measures (within subject and across subject design, under three breakfast
      conditions. The outcome measures (dependent variables) will include a battery of
      neuropsychological measures. All participating subjects are admitted to the Children's
      Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) Metabolic Research unit (MRU) three times for overnight
      stays with intervals of at least 2 weeks apart across 3 months.

    <measure>Visual Search Paradigm change across three timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered three times across three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Padova Visual Search Paradigm will be used to assess sustained attention. This measure requires the participant to make a decision about the presence of a specified target object in an array of simultaneously presented objects. Stimulus generation and response recording will be conducted by a software package E-Prime 2.0 and running on a Pentium PC connected to a 13-inch screen. The protocol developed by Padova for children will be used in this study.</description>

    <measure>CPT-II change across three timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered three times across three months</time_frame>
    <description>A normed computerized test designed to assess attention, vigilance, and impulsivity. Reaction times and accuracy are also calculated. This measure takes 14 minutes to complete and can be administered to individuals ranging in age from 6 years old to 55+ years. This task involves the subjects sitting in front of a computer screen while letters of the alphabet are flashed briefly, at various inter-stimulus intervals. The subject is instructed to press the spacebar on the keyboard whenever a letter is seen on the screen, except the letter &quot;X&quot;. The CPT-II will also be used to examine the correlation with the experimental visual search measure, and possibly offer external validity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Insecurity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered one time across three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Food Security Scale will be used to measure the level of food security for the study subject and is calculated from the response to eight questions that ask specifically about food-related experiences and conditions of children. The scale measures the severity of food insecurity among children in surveyed households and identifies- in the most severe range of the scale- households in which children have been hungry at times because of a lack of household resources for food.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered one time across three months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be used to determine if subjects have experienced sleep disturbances that may affect their performance on the neuropsychological tests. The CSHQ is a retrospective, 33-item parent questionnaire is the same is used in a number of studies to examine sleep behavior in young children. The CSHQ includes items relating to a number of key sleep domains that encompass the major presenting clinical sleep complaints in this age group: bedtime behavior and sleep onset; sleep duration; anxiety around sleep; behavior occurring during sleep and night waking; sleep-disordered breathing; parasomnias; and morning waking/daytime sleepiness. Parents are asked to recall sleep behaviors occurring over a &quot;typical&quot; recent week. Items are rated on a three-point scale: &quot;usually&quot; if the sleep behavior occurred five to seven times/week; &quot;sometimes&quot; for two to four times/week; and &quot;rarely&quot; for zero to one time/week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (FILE) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered one time across three months</time_frame>
    <description>The FILE will be used to determine if subjects have experienced unusually high levels of family stress that may affect their performance on the neuropsychological tests. The FILE assesses the combined effects of life events experienced by a family and was developed as an index of family stress. The FILE is a 71 item self-report measure which is designed to record the normative and non-normative life events and changes experienced by a family unit in the past year. There are nine factor structures for FILE: 1) intra-family strains conflict, 2) marital strains, 3) pregnancy or childbearing strains, 4) finance and business strain, 5) work-family transitions and strains, 6) illness and family &quot;care&quot; strains, 7) losses, 8) transitions &quot;in and out&quot;, and 9) family legal violations. Procedures have been established to generate a total stress score.</description>

    <measure>Physical Exam</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered one time across three months</time_frame>
    <description>Routine history and physical exam will be conducted by a physician. Height, weight, and assessment of Tanner stage, vital signs, and other routine examinations will be conducted. This exam also serves as a screening measure (e.g., history of drugs, developmental issues) that may affect participation status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood draws occur before and after each breakfast treatment and neuropsychological testing for a total of 6 blood draws across 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serum glucose and insulin levels will be determined two times during each stay: on awakening and after neuropsychological testing. We are looking to see if there is a correlation between serum glucose levels and neuropsychological functioning at an age when the brain is taking up more glucose per kg of brain and body weight than later in life and therefore the child is potentially more vulnerable to the effects of low blood glucose. The insulin levels are done to determine if insulin responses are appropriate for the measured glucose levels or if they are responsible for the observed glucose levels.</description>
