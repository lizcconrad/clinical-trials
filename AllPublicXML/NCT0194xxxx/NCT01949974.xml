  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare a non-pharmaceutical intervention (Integral
      Attention Program or PAI) versus standard palliative chemotherapy treatment plus PAI in
      patients with advanced cancer who have already received at least a first course of
      chemotherapy but had proven therapeutic failure.

      The study hypothesis is that palliative chemotherapy offers no clear benefits in relation to
      quality-of-life-adjusted survival compared to a comprehensive care program.

    <description>The key points of the PAI are:
To assess and manage pain and other symptoms resulting from disease progression.
To evaluate the information needs that may arise and to address them.
To encourage patient and family adaptation to the situation of advanced disease and in the terminal phase of it.
To provide guidance in decision-making while respecting patient autonomy.
To establish a plan of care and treatment, adapted to the evolution and needs of the patient.
To promote continuity of care.</description>

    <description>The PAI is a plan of care and treatment adapted in accordance with the evolution and needs of patients. This plan includes an initial comprehensive assessment of patients and their families during the first visit, including specialized psychological and social support when needed, voluntary art therapy and/or mindfulness. There will be outpatient monitoring, 24h phone assistance, home visits, support should hospitalization be required, and unscheduled visits by a palliative care team.</description>
