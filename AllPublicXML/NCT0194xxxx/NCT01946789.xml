  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is a phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study of

      non-small cell lung and squamous cell head and neck cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the safety and immunogenicity, immunomodulatory properties, and
      clinical benefits of treatment with weekly doses of ALT-803 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

    <description>Safety and effectiveness of ALT-803 on the peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) and absolute lymphocyte (ALC) counts. Defined by the increase in the total number of peripheral lymphocytes during the first cycle. The safety endpoint is the MTD of ALT-803, defined as the dose level below that at which ≥2 of 6 patients experience a DLT. The efficacy endpoint is the OBD, defined as that which produces an ALC ≥25,000/µL and/or a total WBC ≥35,000/µL among 2/3 of patients. For safety, we have also defined an &quot;exceeding OBD&quot; as the occurrence of ALC ≥35,000/µL and/or WBC ≥50,000/µL.</description>

             palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.

             excluded.

          -  Patients with non-small lung cancer must have had prior EGFR and ALK testing. Patients
             with sensitizing mutations in EGFR or ALK rearrangements should have been treated with
             prior targeted agents and have had progression or discontinued due to toxicity from
             these agents.

          -  No patients with known brain metastases.

        PRIOR/CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  At least one prior therapy using an agent with the potential for prolonged remission.

          -  Patients with BRAF v600 mutation should be excluded or may be included after
             experiencing progression following treatment with BRAF inhibitor regimen or if they
             consent to forgo FDA-approved therapies that increase median survival.

          -  At least 4 weeks from last dose of prior chemotherapy or immunomodulator therapy with
             full recovery of acute toxicities. For patients coming off molecularly-targeted
             therapy, at least 2 weeks since last dose and recovery from laboratory and
             constitutional toxicities.

          -  At least 2 weeks from completion of prior radiation therapy with full recovery from
             toxicities.

          -  At least 4 weeks from last dose of prior investigational therapy with recovery to meet
             baseline eligibility criteria.
