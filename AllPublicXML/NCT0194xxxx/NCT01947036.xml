      The study aims to establish whether defects in immune cell function are shared across
      multiple autoimmune diseases and whether those problems match to similar genes in the cells.

      This is a non-randomized, multi-center clinical research study. Subjects who are healthy or
      have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of type 1diabetes, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis,
      Crohn's disease, or rheumatoid arthritis will be asked to donate a blood sample. No
      follow-ups are planned.

      Investigators will:

        -  evaluate immune cells from subjects enrolled in this study and match the differences to
           types of immune cells known to cause autoimmune diseases

        -  investigate a particular disease pathway: the IL23R signaling cascade.
