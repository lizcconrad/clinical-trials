  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an online patient passport tool called the
      Arthritis Health Journal can assist people with rheumatoid arthritis in managing their
      disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient passports have been developed and used in chronic diseases, such as diabetes, to
      promote active involvement of patients in their care, and have led to better treatment and
      health outcomes. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active involvement of patients in monitoring
      their symptoms and their disease activity may facilitate treatment according to current
      recommendations, which emphasize the need for aggressive treatment to suppress inflammation
      and for using a &quot;Treat to Target&quot; approach where treatment is escalated until a target is
      reached and is promptly modified when target is no longer met. In this study, the
      investigators have developed an online tool that aims to help people with RA monitor their
      symptoms and their disease activity and self-manage their arthritis. The investigators will
      perform a proof of concept study assessing how the Arthritis Health Journal affects consumer
      effectiveness, patient self-efficacy, communication with health professionals, shared
      decision-making, and satisfaction with medical care. The investigators will also evaluate the
      feasibility and satisfaction with using the Arthritis Health Journal. The investigators will
      use a stepped wedge study design, in which 50 participants will be randomized to either the
      intervention group (immediate use of the Arthritis Health Journal) or the control group
      (waitlisted for 6 months). Due to the nature of the intervention, the study is not blinded.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Management Behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the overall score from the Partners in Health Scale, an 11 item questionnaire based on the principles of self-management, which measures people's ability to engage in behaviours for the self-management of a chronic disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Stanford Self-Efficacy Scale to measure patient's confidence in their ability to perform certain actions to manage their disease and cope with the consequences of their disease. Specifically we will include the &quot;Manage Arthritis Symptoms&quot;, &quot;Manage Disease in General&quot;, and &quot;Communicate with Physician&quot; subscales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consumer Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Effective Consumer (EC-17) scale to measure patient's ability to deal with a chronic condition and make decisions about their health care. We will use the global EC-17 score, as well as results to individual questions (6, 7, 9, and 13) which were selected for their relevance to our intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction with Care</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire to measure satisfaction with care and patient-physician interactions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Management Behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the results of individual questions 7 to 11 from the Partners in Health Scale, which specifically measure involvement in aspects of care relevant to our intervention.</description>
