  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      House Dust Mites (HDMs) are arachnids that infest bedding, carpet, upholstered furniture and
      fabric. Like many other allergens, exposure to HDMA in sensitised patients is associated with
      poorer lung function, greater medication requirements and more asthma symptoms as well as
      chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In contrast to other allergens, there is evidence that HDMA
      leads to the development of asthma, in addition to exacerbating pre-existing asthma in
      HDM-sensitised patients.

      ToleroMune House Dust Mite (TM-HDM), a combination of seven Synthetic Peptide
      Immuno-Regulatory Epitopes, is being developed for the treatment of HDM allergy.

      This study to assess the tolerability of ToleroMune House Dust Mite in subjects with
      controlled asthma and house dust mite-induced rhinoconjunctivitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged 18-65 years.

          -  Asthma controlled by Step 1 or Step 2 treatment as defined by GINA in the four weeks
             prior to randomisation.

          -  Asthma controlled by Step 1 or Step 2 treatment as defined by GINA in the four weeks
             prior to randomisation.

          -  No change in asthma controller treatment (dose, frequency) in the four weeks prior to
             randomisation.

          -  A reliable history consistent with rhinoconjunctivitis on exposure to HDM for at least
             1 year that has required symptomatic treatment on at least one occasion during the
             year prior to randomisation

          -  Positive skin prick test to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus with an average wheal
             diameter at least 5 mm larger than that produced by the negative control.

          -  ImmunoCAP® Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-specific Immunoglobulin E ≥ 0.35 kU/L.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of life-threatening asthma

          -  Asthma exacerbation in the 12 weeks prior to randomisation

          -  Pre-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) &lt; 80 % of predicted,
             regardless of the cause.

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity ratio of &lt; 0.7.

          -  Concurrent respiratory disease that would confound study participation or affect
             subject safety.

          -  Non-HDM allergy that may significantly interfere with the results of this study.

             7. Previous immunotherapy treatment with any HDM allergen for more than 1 month within
             5 years prior to screening.
