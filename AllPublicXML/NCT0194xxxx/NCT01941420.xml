      The investigators decided to make a study with a cohort of patients as homogenous as possible
      with a cross clamp time around 70 min. Adult patients with a severe aortic stenoses without
      any other significant heart disease was included in our prospective randomised study. This
      group of patients was chosen for two reasons. First, these patients have left ventricular
      hypertrophy making the myocardium vulnerable to ischemia, secondly the investigators wanted
      to avoid the possible confounding effect of ischemia found in patients with variable degrees
      of coronary artery disease. Therefore, patients with additional significant coronary artery
      disease (≥ 50% stenoses) were excluded from the study.

      Objective: Myocardial protection during a cardiac arrest is mostly managed with cardioplegia.
      To day we normally used a blood or crystalloid based solutions. It has been published a lot
      of papers comparing the too groups with different results. To our knowledge no prospective,
      randomized study has compared modified St Thomas based Blood and Crystalloid cardioplegia on
      the acknowledged markers (CK-MB, troponin-T) of myocardial damage during aortic valve
      replacement on patients without additional significant coronary artery disease.

      Methods: 100 patients with aorta stenoses undergoing aortic valve replacement without
      significant coronary artery stenoses or other significant concomitant heart valve disease
      were included in the study. They were given antegrade cold blood or cold crystalloid
      cardioplegia delivered through the coronary Ostia every 20 min throughout the period of
      aortic cross-clamp. CK-MB and troponin-T were compared between the two groups.

        Patient material. Patients who are to undergo surgery for isolated severe aortic stenosis,
        without other heart disease will be included prospectively after informed consent. They
        will then be randomized to one of two types of cardioplegia same morning that they will be
        operated.

        From November 2006 to February 2009, 80 consecutive patients undergoing elective aortic
        valve replacement at Ullevål University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, volunteered to participate,
        and were included in the study. All patients gave their written consent. The local ethical
        committee approved the study protocol. Eligible for operation were patients with a mean
        aortic valve gradient &gt; 50 mmHg or aortic valve area &lt; 0.7 cm2 or symptomatic aortic valve
        stenosis. Before induction of anesthesia, at the same day as the operation, patients were
        randomly allocated to one of two groups, either receiving cold (4-8°C) crystalloid or cold
        (4-8°C) blood cardioplegia. The randomisation was performed by opening of sealed envelopes
        and every cohort of ten patients was block-randomized (five crystalloid and five blood) to
        ensure an even distribution of the two cardioplegia regimen with time. Although
        cardioplegia is frequently given retrogradely through the coronary sinus, this procedure
        might give an inadequate protection of the right ventricle unless combined with antegrade
        administration of cardioplegia through the right coronary ostium. For the sake of
        simplicity, in the present study, cardioplegia was delivered antegradely only through the
        coronary ostia strictly every 20 min with a pressure of £ 300 mmHg with a Stöckert roller
        pump (Stöckert Instrumente GmbH, Munich, Germany), throughout the period of aortic
        cross-clamping. Initially, 400 ml of cardioplegia was administrated immediately following
        asystole. Every 20 min, 300-400 ml was administrated into the left coronary ostium and
        200-300 ml into the right coronary ostium, taking the size of the heart into consideration.
        Patients with significant coronary artery stenoses (≥ 50%) or other significant concomitant
        heart valve disease were excluded from the study. Ten patients were also excluded from the
        study after randomisation (five patients in each group) for the following reasons: In the
        group receiving blood cardioplegia four patients were excluded because they needed
        additional cardioplegia (because of emergence of spontaneous heart rhythm after 10-12 min)
        before that scheduled by the protocol. One patient was excluded because the heart did not
        stop and the surgeon decided to open the aorta and administer cardioplegia directly into
        the coronary ostia. In the group receiving crystalloid cardioplegia two patients were
        excluded because they needed additional cardioplegia (because of emergence of spontaneous
        heart rhythm after 10-13 min) before that scheduled by the protocol. Two patients were
        excluded because the heart did not stop initially and the surgeon decided to open the aorta
        and administer cardioplegia directly into the coronary ostia. One patient was excluded
        because the second shot of cardioplegia was given 30 min after the first (and not 20 min as
        decided by the protocol).
