  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal bacteria can metabolize unabsorbed polyphenols (plant compounds) to produce
      smaller molecules which may impact health. In addition, evidence suggests that this process
      may be affected by body fatness. This study aims to investigate absorption of blackberry
      polyphenols, their impact on intestinal bacteria, polyphenol metabolites formed by intestinal
      bacteria, and how these processes differ for obese and lean individuals. It is hypothesized
      that polyphenol absorption and metabolism will differ between obese and lean individuals and
      that differences in intestinal microbiota may play a role.
