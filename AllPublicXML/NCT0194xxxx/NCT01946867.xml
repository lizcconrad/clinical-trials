  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Cancers of the oral cavity represent 30% of head and neck carcinomas in the
      western world. The oropharynx is the posterior continuation of the oral cavity and connects
      with the nasopharynx (above) and laryngopharynx (below). It is also a frequent site of
      primary head and neck cancers. These structures play a crucial role in swallowing, breath and
      speech. Locally advanced oropharyngeal cancers can obstruct the air flow or infiltrate
      muscles or nerves, which significantly disturb local functions. The incidence of Head and
      Neck Squamous Cell Cancer in patients older 65 years is high, 47% occurred in this population
      as recorded by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in the United
      States. Regarding the therapeutic strategies, the association of radiotherapy with
      chemotherapy or biologics has demonstrated significant improvement of outcomes with the
      drawback of higher toxicity, or as demonstrated by 2 meta-analyses, without survival
      improvement in older patients. NBTXR3 and radiation therapy may increase the cancer cell
      killing and complete tumor shrinkage allowing a definitive treatment and preservation of
      local structures and functions in patients older 65 years, who cannot receive cisplatin.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will receive a single administration of NBTXR3 on day 1, either as an intra-arterial
      or intratumor injection, followed by Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy starting 24 hours
      later (day 2), and up to completion of 7 weeks, i.e. 70 Grays, 2Grays/fraction. Patients
      whose tumor has completely shrunk will be followed for the post-radiotherapy evaluation up to
      the End of Treatment visit. Those patients whose tumor has not shrunk more than 50% of the
      baseline size, will stop the radiotherapy and may have a salvage tumor surgery. Then, all
      patients will be followed every 8 weeks, for the safety evaluation and cancer disease status
      until the end of the study.
