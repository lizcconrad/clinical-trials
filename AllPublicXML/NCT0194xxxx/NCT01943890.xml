    <textblock>
      Background Nebulised hypertonic saline (HS) is an established basic airway clearance
      treatment in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). However, there is scarce evidence regarding the practical
      implementation and administration of different HS volumes, including physiotherapy and
      aspects of breathing pattern.

      The aim of the study was to implement standardised and age-adjusted nebulised volumes of
      hypertonic saline in cystic fibrosis patients, included in physiotherapy and lung drainage
      techniques.

      Aims: To establish a safe, efficient routine for implementation of HS in daily treatment and
      to investigate the efficiency and tolerance of high volumes of HS integrated with chest
      physiotherapy.

      HS was given twice daily with volumes of 4,5 ml in children aged 0-5 years, 6 ml at age 6-16
      years and 9 ml at age &gt; 16 years. The protocol included guidance of standardized breathing
      pattern, upright and sideways positioning and voluntary cough.
