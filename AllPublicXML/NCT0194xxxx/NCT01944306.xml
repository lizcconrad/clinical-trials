  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contraceptive failure is the primary cause of unintended pregnancy in the United States. With
      obesity rates at epidemic proportions, any association between obesity and strategies that
      prevent undesired pregnancies constitutes a significant public health and economic concern.
      Evidence from recent epidemiological studies and our preliminary data (sub-therapeutic levels
      of steroid hormones due to drug clearance and half-life) suggest that obesity reduces oral
      contraceptive efficacy. Furthermore, preliminary analysis suggested that a sub-group of obese
      women, defined by their own birth weight, are at higher risk of contraceptive failure.
      Further studies are necessary to investigate whether birth weight, a surrogate marker of in
      utero growth restriction, is a useful diagnostic marker for the identification of women prone
      to contraceptive failure. Such an understanding is critical to finding a contraceptive
      strategy with better efficacy for these women.

      The overall goal of this project is to test pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptive agents in
      obese women with low birth weight and compare to obese women with normal birth weight. The
      main hypothesis for this proposal is that an adverse in utero environment programs the
      expression and function of enzymes and transporters that underlie pharmacokinetics of oral
      contraceptives, and leads to contraceptive failure.

      Reproductive-aged, ovulatory women of obese BMI &gt;30 kg/m2 with normal birth weight (5.5-8
      lbs; n=10) and low birth weight (&lt;5.5 lbs; n=10), will be placed on oral contraceptives for 1
      month. At several key time points, synthetic steroid pharmacokinetics, gonadotropins
      (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone) and ovarian hormone levels (estradiol,
      progesterone) will be monitored.

    <description>Serum concentration-time data for each subject will be analyzed using a non-compartmental model assumption. Serum concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at the beginning and end of the profile will be set to zero. Serum concentration-time profiles will be summarized using descriptive statistics and graphical display. Student t-tests will be used to test whether the average values of each of the pharmacokinetic parameters, including free concentrations, differ between the four groups of women.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 21-25 of oral contraceptive use</time_frame>
    <description>To compare gonadotopin levels, average leutinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels measured for days 21-25 will be calculated. In addition, the follicle stimulating hormone/leutinizing hormone ratio will be calculated at each time point. The average levels of these measures will then be compared between the four groups of women using a student's t-test.</description>

        Reproductive-aged, ovulatory women seeking to initiate contraception with combined oral
        contraceptives will be recruited from the female population of the Portland, OR area.
        Subjects must have access to their birth weight record. Enrollment will be confined to
        women who have not used a hormonal contraceptive method for 30 days or more prior to
        enrollment.
