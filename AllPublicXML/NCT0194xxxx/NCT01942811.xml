      The goal of the US-Mexico Binational Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT) is a
      multi-site study conducted in the US (East Los Angeles) and Mexico (Tijuana) which aims to
      reduce drug demand on both sides of the border. The study also aims to build a collaborative
      partnership between the US and Mexico research teams. The Bi-National QUIT Study will conduct
      a randomized control trial for risky drug use in several Los Angeles area community health
      centers. The intent of the trial is to interrupt the progression to addiction for the casual
      and occasional users of illicit drugs and non-medical users of pharmaceuticals. The
      Bi-National QUIT protocol will include (1) a computerized assessment of the patient's
      drug-use history (2) very brief (&lt;5 minutes) clinician advice during a patients pre-arranged
      medical visit which will be preceded by a computerized assessment of the patient's drug-use
      history (3) a post visit assessment and video doctor (repeating the very brief clinician
      advice) in the waiting room (4) two post-visit telephone drug-use counseling sessions to be
      conducted by drug-health educators at approximately 2 and 6 weeks after the start of the
      intervention. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3 months post-randomization.
      Parallel activities will take place in the U.S./Los Angeles sites and Mexico/Tijuana sites.
      Data will be shared between both teams. Data analysis will be collaboratively conducted by
      both teams.

    <description>The goal of the Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT) is to conduct a small RCT of a primary care clinic-based very brief intervention protocol for reducing the use of illegal drugs and the occurrences of drug-related harm in low-income, racially-diverse patient populations at two 'safety-net' clinics in Los Angeles. The design will emphasize screening, very brief clinician advice, and telephone drug-use health education to reduce 'at risk' drug use and thus interrupt progression from casual or episodic abuse to dependence.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

        US Sites: Exclusion Criteria

        Patients

          -  Pregnancy. Women who report being pregnant at the time of randomization will be
             excluded from participation. This latter exclusion criterion is based on the following
             reasons: (a) The interaction of drug use (in any amount) and fetal-maternal health is
             physiologically complex and beyond the scope of this proposed intervention. (b) Drug
             users who are pregnant are considered high-risk pregnancies and will likely be lost to
             follow-up during the study as they will be promptly referred by their primary care
             clinician to an obstetrician per usual clinic protocol. However, enrolled patients who
             become pregnant after the intervention will not be withdrawn. Their eventual exits
             from the study will be counted as drop-outs and will be included as &quot;no change&quot; in our
             &quot;intent to treat&quot; analysis. Finally, (c) a tailored brief intervention protocol for
             pregnant women may require more than simple clinician advice and a 2-session phone
             health education program. Such an intervention would be more effective if designed
             around the activities of prenatal care. Previous RCTs of problem alcohol use targeting
             healthy adults have excluded patients who are pregnant.8,9

          -  Homeless status. The clinics we have chosen have large numbers of homeless patients.
             Since this is a study on the general poverty population, we are asking homeless status
             in order to avoid over-sampling homeless patients. We will set a quota on number of
             homeless patients we can enroll without over-sampling these patients. If we reach this
             quota, we will apply homeless status as an exclusion criteria for subsequent subjects.

          -  Repeaters. Patients who have been screened or enrolled before will be asked a set of
             repeater questions. This includes a question on whether they have ever been involved
             in our UCLA study at the clinic before. We will also ask them a set of questions that
             combines aspects about the potential subject (mother's first name, father's first
             name, month and day of birth) that will screen them out if they screen again in the
             future.

          -  ASSIST Score: Drug Dependence. The RA will receive a message that the subject scored
             27+ on all illicit drugs on the WHO ASSIST (i.e. indication of possible substance
             dependence/addiction). The RA will inform the patient that they are at risk for
             certain health behaviors and ask the patient if they want to disclose this information
             to their doctor. If they agree to disclose information to their doctor then we will
             fill out a letter informing the doctor of patient's dependence on specific drugs. We
             will also provide the patient with a list of local substance abuse treatment
             referrals. Please see Appendix A for copies of these referrals (Appendix A. Los
             Angeles County Substance Abuse Treatment Facilities).

          -  From Date of Screening Subject Enrolled in a Drug Treatment Facility. Subjects
             enrolled in a treatment program are excluded from the study. These subjects show
             commitment to the treatment program. Moreover, these program would serve as a
             competing intervention to ours, biasing the potential effect of our intervention.
