  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock has a high mortality risk despite the availability of various treatments.
      Endotoxin, that is present in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, is a potent trigger
      of innate immunity. Endotoxin leads to an activation of a cascade with an overwhelming
      systemic overflow of pro- and anti- inflammatory mediators at the early phase of sepsis with
      generalized vascular endothelial damage, tissue injury and multi-organ failure.

      Extracorporeal blood purification therapies aim to reduce the circulating level of endotoxin.
      Different extracorporeal blood purification systems are available. The oXiris™ device
      comprises a surface treated AN69 membrane capable to adsorb a large spectrum of plasma
      cytokines, such as IL-6 and HMGB1 protein. The positively charged inner surface of the
      membrane allows absorbing negatively charged bacterial products such as endotoxin. From an
      historical perspective, filters containing AN69-based membranes have been the most commonly
      used products for CRRT in the management of critically ill patients and a substantial volume
      of published data exist.

      Another extracorporeal endotoxin removal therapy is the hemoperfusion with ToraymyxinTM (PMX)
      filter, which is a cartridge selectively removing blood endotoxin. PMX is composed of
      polymyxin B covalently bonded to polystyrene-derivative fibres. It is well known that the
      polarity of the polymyxin B antibiotic binds endotoxin and has bactericidal activity.
      Therefore, the rationale underlying extracorporeal therapy with PMX is to remove circulating
      endotoxin by adsorption.
