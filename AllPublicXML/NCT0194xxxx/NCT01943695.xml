    <description>The ultimate goal is for participants to complete approximately 130-180 minutes/week of non-linear aerobic training at 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity VO2peak), concurrent with chemotherapy. VO2peak will be determined by the CPET performed at baseline. The 130-180 minutes/week will be achieved via 3 individual aerobic training sessions at approximately 10 to 50 minutes/session (± 10 minutes). All sessions are required to be supervised.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Aerobic Training After Chemotherapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The ultimate goal is for participants to complete approximately 130-180 minutes/week of non-linear aerobic training at 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity (VO2peak), after the completion of chemotherapy. VO2peak will be determined by the CPET performed at midpoint, or pre-surgery for neoadjuvant patients. For patients receiving adjuvant therapy, (except those who have additional surgery after chemotherapy), the aerobic training intervention must begin within 2 weeks of the patient's midpoint CPET. For patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and have additional surgery after chemotherapy, the aerobic training intervention will begin within approximately 6 weeks of surgery, per the discretion of the treating physician. The 130-180 minutes/week will be achieved via 3 individual aerobic training sessions at approximately 10 to 50 minutes/session (± 10 minutes). All sessions are required to be supervised.</description>

    <arm_group_label>General Physical Activity Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will receive a home-based, general physical activity program. Specifically, all patients assigned to general physical activity will receive an initial, in-person consultation with staff exercise physiologist outlining a structured home-based aerobic walking program with a goal up to 150 minutes per week outside of their normal daily activity. Patients will be provided with a fitness tracker (e.g. FitBit) to evaluate exercise duration and intensity. Patients will be asked to record type, duration, and average heart rate during sessions in an exercise log to assess compliance. Staff exercise physiologists will contact patients by telephone or in person on a monthly, or less, basis to check progress, answer questions and record compliance.</description>

    <description>Patients that elect supervised home based training will receive a study kit which includes a heart rate monitor, blood pressure cuff, treadmill and tablet to complete aerobic training requirements. The study kit will be given to the patient upon completion of their baseline testing. The treadmill will be shipped to the patient's home and coordinated by the Ex Onc group. The treadmills are MSK owned equipment that will be deployed to the patient's homes via the vendor TechnoGym. A member of Ex Onc will be at the patient's home to oversee the installation of the treadmill and to deliver the study kit. The team member will also provide an orientation session for the patient to set up all study kit items. If the orientation session cannot be completed at home, the Ex Onc team will arrange for orientation to take place on site at MSK.</description>
