  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will observe participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis who are
      switching therapies from natalizumab to dimethyl fumarate to determine disease stability.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, single site, open-label, single arm observational study
      examining the initial efficacy and tolerability of dimethyl fumarate in a real world clinical
      setting for patients with a relapsing form of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) when crossed over from
      natalizumab therapy.

      The decision to cross over from natalizumab to DMF will be made by the patient and the
      prescribing physician and must precede enrollment in the study.

      MS disease status and history will be gathered from the patient's medical records. Patients
      will be followed for the first 24 weeks of their transition from natalizumab. Assessments
      will be performed at Baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter for 24 weeks. These assessments
      may include:

        -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)

        -  Relapse Assessment

        -  Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) including quality of life, fatigue, and cognition
           outcome measures

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

        -  Laboratory testing

      Study drop outs due to DMF intolerability or other etiologies will be encouraged to complete
      the trial even if placed on alternative therapies.
