      RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as 131 I-MIBG, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells
      and not harm normal cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well 131 I-MIBG works in treating patients with
      refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine can provide palliative therapy for
           patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the acute and late toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine disease and symptom responses of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a compassionate use study.

      Patients receive iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine IV over 2 hours. Beginning 10 days
      later, patients with low neutrophil counts receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously until
      blood count recovers. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive a second dose of
      iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine at least 6 weeks after the first dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Original diagnosis of neuroblastoma based on 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Histopathology

               -  Elevated urine catecholamines with typical tumor cells in the bone marrow

          -  Refractory or relapsed disease, meeting 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Failure to respond to standard therapy (e.g., combination chemotherapy with or
                  without radiotherapy and surgery)

               -  Evidence of disease progression (i.e., any new lesion or an increase in size of &gt;
                  25% of a pre-existing lesion) at any time
