  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter phase II trial is designed to study the unique combination of chemotherapy
      (irinotecan./carboplatin) and bevacizumab in the extensive-stage setting. This clinical
      setting seems ideal for evaluation of the role of bevacizumab in delaying progression and
      prolonging survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive 6 courses of irinotecan, carboplatin, and bevacizumab. The
      interval between chemotherapy courses will be 28 days. If after 6 courses of treatment,
      patient's response is a CR/PR/SD they will continue on Bevacizumab until tumor progression or
      up to 6 cycles (6 months) total.

      Treatment sequence:

        -  Irinotecan 60mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15

        -  Carboplatin AUC=4 day 1 only

        -  Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg days 1 and 15
