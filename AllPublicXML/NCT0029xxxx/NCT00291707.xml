      The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of two
      chemotherapies drugs, Cetuximab and Pemetrexed (Alimta), when given in combination with
      radiation therapy. Currently Pemetrexed is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for two other types of cancer, mesothelioma and lung cancer, but it is considered
      investigational and is not approved by the FDA for head and neck cancer. Cetuximab is
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of colorectal cancer; however, it is not yet approved
      for head and neck cancer.

      Pemetrexed is a drug that kills tumor cells by stopping cells from functioning normally. It
      has been studied in thousands of subjects and has been shown to be effective at killing tumor
      cells in many cancers, including head and neck cancer. In preclinical studies, Pemetrexed
      showed such promising activity against a wide range of tumor types including those mentioned
      above as well as breast, colon, and bladder cancers.

      Cetuximab (also known as &quot;C225&quot; and &quot;Erbitux&quot;) can increase the effectiveness of our standard
      treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. Cetuximab is a type of drug known as a monoclonal
      antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are used to try to destroy some types of cancer cells while
      causing little harm to normal cells. They are designed to recognize specific molecules that
      are on the surface of particular cancer cells. The monoclonal antibody recognizes the protein
      and locks onto it. This may trigger the body's immune system to attack the cancer cells and
      can sometimes make the cells destroy themselves. Cetuximab targets the epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR), an important molecule for the growth of cancer cells. The use of
      radiation therapy and Cetuximab has also been studied with good results. We will find what
      effects (good and bad) Cetuximab has on you and your head and neck cancer.

      Both Cetuximab and Pemetrexed have been studied intensively to determine their effectiveness.

      In this study, we will find what effects (good and bad) Cetuximab and Pemetrexed, with
      radiation; have on you and on your head and neck cancer. We will find out if the combination
      of Cetuximab, Pemetrexed and radiation has better results than what we ordinarily expect with
      radiation and chemotherapy. We will also find out if the side effects are worse than those we
      usually see. In addition, we will test both blood and tumor tissue and determine what effects
      Cetuximab has on these specimens. Finally, we will look for &quot;markers,&quot; or cancer identifiers,
      in your tumor cells and blood that may help to predict what the best treatment is for head
      and neck cancer patients in the future.

          -  All subjects requiring radiotherapy to the head and neck for a poor-prognosis
             malignancy will be eligible.

          -  Two cohorts of subjects: no prior history of head and neck radiation, i.e.
             non-irradiated and prior history of head and neck radiation, i.e. previously
             irradiated.

          -  Subjects with recurrent head and neck cancer with no clinically measurable distant
             disease as well as those subjects in whom distant disease was of low volume and local
             and regional palliation is clinically warranted will be eligible.

          -  Subjects without prior treatment should have stage IV disease (see AJCC staging system
             in Appendix 2, Protocol) or have an expected long-term survival of less than 10%.

          -  No prior treatment with systemic anti-EGFR inhibitors or Pemetrexed. Any number of
             prior systemic therapies is allowed.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 .

          -  Age ³ 18 years.

          -  Subjects must have fully recovered from the effects of any prior surgery,
             chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. A minimum time period of 4 weeks should elapse
             between the completion of prior chemotherapy and enrollment in the study.

          -  ANC ³ 1500/µl, platelet count ³ 100,000/µl. Hemoglobin should be &gt;8 g/dL.

          -  Creatinine clearance 45 ml/min or higher calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:
             Calculated Creatinine Clearance = (140-age) X actual body wt.(kg) 72 X serum
             creatinine Multiply this number by 0.85 if the subject is female

          -  Total bilirubin within normal limits and AST/ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of
             normal (less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in the presence of liver
             metastases).

          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all subjects prior to beginning therapy.
             Subjects should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

          -  Subjects should be willing and able to take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation
             and should interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents for a
             5-day period (8-day period for long acting agents such as piroxicam), see section 5.57

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements, significant history of uncontrolled cardiac
             disease; i.e., uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, recent myocardial
             infarction (within prior 3 months), uncontrolled congestive heart failure, and
             cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction.

          -  May not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with chemotherapy. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial
             participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In
             addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner
             of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control.
             Subjects who are women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must be
             willing to use effective contraception while on study.

          -  All WOCBP should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect
             they might be pregnant .

          -  HIV-positive subjects are excluded from the study.

          -  Prior grade 3 or 4 infusion or hypersensitivity reaction to a monoclonal antibody.

          -  For subjects who have baseline clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions
             before initiation of protocol therapy, consideration should be given to draining the
             effusion prior to starting therapy due the potential of increased toxicity with
             Pemetrexed in that setting.
