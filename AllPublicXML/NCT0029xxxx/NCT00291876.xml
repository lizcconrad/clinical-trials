  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the persistence of hepatitis A antibodies at 138, 150,
      162, 174,186, 198, 210, 222, 234 and 246 months after subjects received their first dose of a
      2 dose vaccination schedule of hepatitis A vaccine.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at year
      11 to 20.

      No additional subjects will be recruited during this long-term follow-up.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up study at Years 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 after
      primary vaccination with GSK Biologicals' hepatitis A vaccine (two-dose schedule). To
      evaluate the long-term antibody persistence, volunteers will donate a blood sample at Years
      11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 after the first vaccine dose of the primary
      vaccination course to determine their anti-hepatitis A (anti-HAV) antibody concentrations.

      If a subject has become seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies during any of the long-term
      blood sampling time point (i.e. Months 138, 150, 162, 174,186, 198, 210, 222, 234 and 246),
      he/ she will be offered an additional vaccine dose. A blood sample will be taken on the day
      of the additional vaccination 14 days and one month after additional vaccination to evaluate
      the immune response following this vaccination.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007
      and to extend the follow up until Year 20.

      The study has 10 phases: 100571, 100572, 100573, 100574, 100575, 110677, 110678, 110679,
      110680, 110681.

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. GSK supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>For 5 subjects at Month 234, serum sample tubes were broken. Due to risk of contamination, anti-HAV concentrations analyses were not performed for these subjects, who were excluded in the LT-ATP cohort for immunogenicity analysis at Month 234.</limitations_and_caveats>
