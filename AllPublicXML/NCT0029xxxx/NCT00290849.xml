      The objectives of this registry are to assess the use of the thrombin-specific anticoagulant
      bivalirudin during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a real life setting. In
      particular, data will be collected to analyze experiences of bivalirudin use in respect to
      the following objectives;

        -  examine the aspects of safety and effectiveness of bivalirudin

        -  gain experience regarding the characteristics of patients in bivalirudin treatment

        -  evaluate the handling of bivalirudin and its practicality
