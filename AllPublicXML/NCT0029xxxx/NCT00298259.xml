      Background: Fracture of several ribs in more than one place as the result of trauma, leads to
      paradoxical movement of the chest wall and ventilatory failure. The mainstay of management in
      these patients has traditionally been analgesia and positive pressure ventilation to splint
      the chest wall and allow healing of the ribs to begin. However, this management option leads
      to prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay with increasing complication rates as patients
      remain on a ventilator for prolonged periods. Patients often remain on a ventilator for two
      to three weeks while waiting for enough rib healing to provide sufficient chest wall
      stability to allow the patient to take over all their breathing themselves. Until that time,
      patients are at risk of pneumonia and sepsis and other complications. Long term disabilities
      which have been reported in these patients include ongoing pain syndromes, inability to
      return to work, particularly manual type labour and cosmetic chest wall deformities.

      An alternative treatment strategy is to operatively fix the ribs. By fixing the ribs
      operatively, the patient no longer requires internal pneumatic stabilization (provided by
      mechanical ventilation) and can be weaned from the ventilator within days rather than weeks.
      This can potentially lead to earlier discharge from the intensive care unit, and an avoidance
      of the multiple complications which arise in the ventilated patient. Rib fixation may also
      lead to less pain and deformity, improved mobility in the post injury phase and earlier
      return to work.

      Hypothesis: that early operative fixation of ribs in patients presenting with flail chest
      secondary to trauma will result in less mechanical ventilatory requirements, earlier
      discharge from the intensive care unit and lower rate of complications associated with
      prolonged mechanical ventilation. This will lead to cost savings in the treatment of these
      patients.
