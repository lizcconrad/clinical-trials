  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that oral supplementation with omega-3 PUFA will decrease occurrence of
      arrhythmic events among post-MI, ICD recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, double- blind interventional study.
      Patients will receive 3.6 g of EPA and DHA fish oil and placebo oil for 6 months, randomly,
      in a crossover design, with a four month washout period between treatments.

      Randomization will be stratified by ejection fraction (â‰¤ 35% or &gt; 35%), and the type of the
      index arrhythmia (VT - spontaneous or inducible by electrophysiologic study (EPS), versus
      other - VF, SCD, Primary prevention - MADIT II).

      Ischemia severity was chosen to be evaluated by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography
      (SPECT) during stress (dipyridamol infusion).

      Subcutaneous adipose-tissue biopsy, a biomarker considered the gold-standard for the
      objective assessment of long-term habitual dietary intake of fish and marine omega-3 PUFA
      (EPA and DHA) will be obtain.

      Compliance will be monitored by counting returned capsules or bottles and by measuring the
      omega-3 PUFA composition in red blood cells (RBC).

      Three different types of questionnaires will be used in this trial to obtain more information
      as to the additional potential benefit of omega-3 PUFA supplementation:

        1. The newly Israeli Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) will be used to examine dietary
           intake of other nutritional habits/patterns and its relationship to the study outcomes.

        2. The Hebrew language SF-36 health survey will be used to examine general health status.

        3. The Back questionnaires will be use to examine possible beneficial effects of fish oil
           supplementation on depressive symptomatology.
