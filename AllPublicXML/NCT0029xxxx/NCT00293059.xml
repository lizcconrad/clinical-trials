          <description>The blood loss volume for participants with excessive bleeding (2 or more bleeding episodes each with blood loss volume of 80 mL or more during the run-in phase) was determined for the 90 days before treatment (ie, run-in phase) and for the 90 days under treatment. A negative value indicates a reduction in blood loss while under treatment compared to before treatment.</description>

        <description>The PGWBI questionnaire consisted of 22 questions that were answered using a 6-grade Likert scale. The minimum overall score was 22 and the maximum was 132. The higher the score, the better the well being of the participant. The observation phase was the last 4 weeks. The following 6 dimensions were derived from the questionnaire: anxiety, depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control, health, and vitality and the highest possible scores were 30, 18, 24, 18, 18, and 24, respectively.</description>

Participants were asked to indicate their current health state by ticking the most appropriate of 3 statements about each of the questions (ie, no problems, some problems, extreme problems). The best possible answers were (1,1,1,1,1), which equals a valuation score of 1.0. The worst possible answers were (3,3,3,3,3), which equals a valuation score of .594.

        <description>The MBL for each cycle includes intermenstrual bleeding in addition to withdrawal bleeding. Baseline MBL was the mean MBL of measured MBL during three cycles in the run-in Phase. One cycle was defined as 28 days. For this analysis, the run-in Phase was defined by the days 1 to 84 (= 3 cycles each of 28 days). End of Study MBL was measured during Cycle 7 of the Treatment Phase (data imputation and Last Observation Carried Forward was applied).</description>
