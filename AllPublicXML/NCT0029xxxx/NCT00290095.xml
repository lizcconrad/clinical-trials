  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell tumor with an annual incidence of 6 pr. 100 000. In the
      absence of curative treatment, the aim of the therapy is not only to induce an objective
      response and a prolongation of survival but also to improve the patients quality of life.

      This project will raise two problems which make QoL-data hard to interpret

        1. In a clinical trial where many patients are included, statistically significant
           differences are obtained. However, there is widespread agreement that p-values do not
           indicate whether a particular finding has clinical significance because statistical
           significance does not necessarily equate to a meaningful difference or change in QoL. A
           crucial task for clinicians in interpreting trial-based QoL results is to determine if
           the observed change is clinically important to the patient.

        2. When measuring changes in QoL in a pretest-posttest design,response shift can affect
           results. Patients with advanced disease can report surprisingly good QoL.Including
           response shift into quality of life research would allow a better understanding of
           changes in the QoL that patients report.
