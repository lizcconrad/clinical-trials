      Double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized Multicenter, Phase III study comparing 2
      parallel groups (alfuzosin 10mg OD or placebo) in patients with a first episode of acute
      urinary retention related to BPH.The acute episode is managed with catheterization and with
      study drug treatment for 2 to 3 days, followed by an active voiding trial to assess the
      patients' ability to void after catheter removal.

      Those patients who successfully void will continue their randomized treatment for a total
      treatment duration of 6 months. For all patients who are prematurely withdrawn during the
      study, a post-study (clinic or phone) visit will be performed for collection of health care
      consumption data.
