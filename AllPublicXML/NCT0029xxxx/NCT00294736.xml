  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 1 study of escalating doses of Tarceva in
      patients with advanced NSCLC who currently smoke.

      Part I will establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Tarceva in current smokers.

      In Part II, patients will be randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups: Arm A (Tarceva MTD
      established in Part I) and Arm B (150 mg Tarceva daily). Patients in both arms will be
      treated for two weeks and then have pharmacokinetic samples collected on day 14. Part II is
      open as of Nov-2006.
