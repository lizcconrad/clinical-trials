      Vaccination against tuberculosis (TB) /healthy PPD-negative adults aged 18 to 45 years.Three
      doses of primary vaccination followed by a booster dose after completion of primary
      vaccination course. Booster vaccination will be given only to subjects receiving the
      candidate tuberculosis vaccines and not to the subjects receiving active comparators or
      control.

    <textblock>
      The safety and immunogenicity of 2 antigen doses in PPD-negative adults will be evaluated. In
      addition, 2 active comparator groups of volunteers will receive the vaccine alone without an
      immunostimulant and 1 control group will receive the adjuvant (AS02) alone to assess the true
      effect of the candidate tuberculosis vaccine (Mtb72F/AS02).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose.
