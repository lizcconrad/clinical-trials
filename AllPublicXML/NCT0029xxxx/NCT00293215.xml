    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial of a drug called CMD-193 which is a humanised monoclonal antibody
      linked to a toxin (calicheamicin). The purpose of this study is to determine in patients with
      advanced tumours expressing the Lewis-Y antigen:

        -  How much and how long 111-In-CMD-193 (CMD-193 tagged with a small amount of radioactive
           Indium – also called Indium-111 or 111In) circulates in the blood, where the antibody
           goes in the body, and how much attaches to the tumour.

        -  Whether CMD-193 causes changes in the metabolism (activity) of the tumour.

        -  Whether CMD-193 causes shrinkage of the tumour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancers arising from an organ can be cured in some cases with various combinations of
      surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, once some cancers spread, treatment with
      conventional methods is unlikely to cure the cancer and treatment is designed to control the
      growth of the cancer and the problems it is causing. This is a clinical trial of a drug
      called CMD-193 which is a humanised monoclonal antibody linked to a toxin (calicheamicin).
      The experimental treatment approach used here involves targeting a marker (antigen) called
      the Lewis-y antigen on the tumour cell’s surface with a specially constructed humanised
      monoclonal antibody. This antibody delivers a toxin (calicheamicin) into the tumour cell and
      this may kill the tumour cell.

      This clinical research study explores where CMD-193 distributes in the body, and the activity
      of CMD-193 in humans. CMD-193 recognises and binds to the Lewis-y antigen which is present on
      some cancers. If a radioactive label is attached to the antibody, the antibody can be seen in
      a special type of scan, to seek out and stick to the tumour. Showing how the antibody
      localizes to tumour may assist in determining optimal dosing for future trials.

      This study is open to patients with advanced cancers where tumour samples that were
      previously removed are shown to express the Lewis-y antigen. A series of tests will be
      performed to determine eligibility to participate in the trial. Groups of patients will be
      allocated increasing doses of CMD-193 at study entry to explore the effects in a series of
      doses.

      Patients will each receive 6 infusions of CMD-193 (the first dose will be labeled with a
      trace dose of radioactive Indium-111 (111In)) at three weekly intervals, unless toxicity,
      disease progression or withdrawal from study for another reason occurs.

      On study, 111-In-CMD-193 will be given intravenously (by infusion into a vein) over one hour.
      Patients will be observed for three hours after the infusion. An ECG (heart trace) will be
      performed prior to the first dose of 111-In-CMD-193 and repeated 30 minutes after the
      infusion. To determine how the body rids itself of CMD-193, blood samples will be taken just
      before and after the 111-In-CMD-193 infusion, and at three hours after infusion completion: 3
      in total. These blood samples will be drawn from a separate intravenous access line which
      will be placed into a vein. Blood samples will also be drawn on the next day, then
      approximately every second day for the first week. Special scans to see where 111-In-CMD-193
      goes in the body will be done approximately one hour after the first infusion, and 3 more
      times over the next seven days. The procedure will take about one hour each time.

      Further blood tests will be done once per week, coinciding with clinical visits. These
      samples will check the general health of the blood cells and blood chemistry, and assess
      blood levels of CMD-193. Blood tests will also see if the immune system recognises the
      infused antibody by making another antibody against it.

      Evaluation of the function (metabolism) of the tumour will also be performed with a special
      scan called a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. This PET scan will be performed before
      the first CMD-193 infusion, and after the 2nd and 4th infusions of CMD-193. Tumour assessment
      will take place before the study with appropriate tests such as CT scans, plain X-rays etc.
      These scans will be repeated 15-21 days after the 2nd, 4th and 6th infusions of CMD-193.

      Additional infusions of CMD-193 may be administered for patients who have tolerated CMD-193
      treatment and if there is evidence of response.
