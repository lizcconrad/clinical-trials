  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DTPa and IPV vaccines are recommended for immunization of infants in Korea. The use of
      combination vaccines simplifies routine paediatric vaccination. The Protocol Posting has been
      updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

      Participants in this Phase IIIb study will either receive GSK Biologicals' combined
      diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus (DTPa-IPV) vaccine or
      co-administration of GSK Biologicals' combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTPa)
      vaccine and Sanofi-Pasteurs' inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Vaccines for both groups will be
      administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Two blood samples will be collected during the
      course of the study: prior to vaccination and one month after the third vaccine dose.
