  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label study comparing the
      tolerability of Rebif® injections (44 microgram [mcg] administered subcutaneously three times
      a week) with and without Rebiject™Mini, an auto-injection device in relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either one of the two
      Rebif® groups in a 1:1 ratio on Study Day 1 stratified by center. Subjects will receive a
      minimum of 3 months of treatment with Rebif® 44 mcg three times a week and will be asked to
      assess their injection site reactions on a weekly basis. Clinic visit will occur at 1 and 3
      months after the initiation of treatment.
