    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to create and study a Mindfulness-Based
      Addiction Treatment (MBAT) for nicotine dependence. Mindfulness is a method to help focus
      attention on being in the &quot;here and now.&quot; It can be learned through training in how to
      control one's attention. It is usually taught through meditation. The overarching goals of
      the study are to evaluate the efficacy of MBAT for nicotine dependence and the mechanisms and
      effects posited to mediate MBAT's impact on abstinence.

      This 3-group randomized clinical trial will develop and evaluate a Mindfulness-Based
      Addiction Treatment (MBAT) for nicotine dependence. Mindfulness reflects a purposeful control
      of attention and can be learned through training in attentional control procedures.

      Current cigarette smokers (N=550; 400 in formal study; up to 80-150 pilot) will be randomly
      assigned to Usual Care (UC), Standard Treatment (ST) or MBAT. UC will be four 5-10 minute
      counseling sessions following the problem-solving approach in the Treating Tobacco Use and
      Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline (Guideline). ST is a standard smoking cessation group
      program using a problem-solving/coping skills approach. MBAT is a group smoking cessation
      program derived from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based
      Cognitive Therapy. MBAT will not alter the basic mindfulness approach used in MBCT and MBSR,
      but will replace depression-related material with smoking cessation strategies from the
      Guideline. All participants will receive nicotine patches and self-help materials. MBAT
      mechanisms and effects will be assessed using &quot;implicit&quot; cognitive psychological measures and
      computer-administered questionnaires. Participants will be tracked from baseline through 4
      (UC) or 8 (ST and MBAT) treatment visits and follow-up visits 1 and 23 weeks post-treatment.

      The overarching goals are to evaluate MBAT's efficacy for nicotine dependence and the
      mechanisms and effects posited to mediate MBAT's impact on abstinence.

      Primary specific aims are to:

        1. Examine the effects of MBAT on abstinence rates

        2. Examine the effects of MBAT on mindfulness/metacognitive awareness, attentional control,
           smoking automaticity, smoking associations in memory, negative affect, depression,
           stress, affect regulation expectancies, self-efficacy, withdrawal, and coping across the
           pre- and post-cessation period, and whether these variables mediate MBAT effects on
           abstinence.
