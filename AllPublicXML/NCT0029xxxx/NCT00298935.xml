  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT):

        -  decreases pain and improves physical functioning in women during the third trimester of
           pregnancy

        -  decreases complications during obstetrical delivery

        -  improves quality of life in the post-partum period
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Women experience multiple changes in their anatomy and physiology during pregnancy that may
      cause pain and adversely affect quality of life. Additionally, about ten percent of women
      will experience signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia or pre-term labor during their first
      pregnancy.

      Preliminary studies of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) have demonstrated a decrease
      in pain during pregnancy, although the mechanisms responsible for this effect are unclear.

      Another theory is that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may help normalize
      sympathetic outflow, thereby minimizing pregnancy complications. A recently published
      retrospective study also suggests that pregnant women receiving osteopathic manipulative
      treatment (OMT) may be at lower risk for pre-term delivery and the presence of meconium
      during delivery.
