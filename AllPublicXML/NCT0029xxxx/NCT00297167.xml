  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy objective of this study is to compare the coefficient of fat absorption
      (CFA) following oral administration of Aptalis Pharma's (formerly Eurand Pharmaceuticals)
      pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) capsules and placebo in participants with cystic fibrosis
      (CF) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment, crossover, multicenter
      trial in participants with CF and EPI. The study consists of a screening period (1 to 14
      days), a washout period (2 days), a dose titration/stabilization period (6 to 9 days), a
      blinded randomized treatment period (6 to 7 days), an open-label normalization period 1 (5 to
      14 days), a blinded crossover treatment period (6 to 7 days), followed by an open-label
      normalization period 2 (7 days). The order of treatments (placebo followed by EUR-1008
      [APT-1008] or EUR-1008 [APT-1008] followed by placebo) will be determined by randomization at
      the beginning of randomization treatment period only and will be carried through the
      crossover treatment period. The starting dose will be 1,000 lipase units per kilogram per
      meal (lipase units/kg/meal), which will be titrated to control symptoms of EPI, with the
      total dose not exceeding 10,000 lipase units/kg/day.

    <measure>Percent Coefficient of Fat Absorption (CFA%)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 up to Day 6 of hospital treatment in first and second double-blind intervention periods</time_frame>
    <description>Percent CFA was calculated as ([fat intake - fat excretion]/fat intake)multiplied by 100, determined in the stools collected during the 72-hour hospitalization period.

          <description>Abdominal symptoms included abdominal pain, flatulence and bloating. Symptoms were classified by severity as mild (no impairment of daily activities), moderate (slight impairment of daily activities), or severe (unable to perform daily activities). Mean number of symptom of specific severity per day for each participant was calculated. Mean number of symptoms per day was calculated for Day 3 to Day 6 in first and second double-blind intervention periods for total participants.</description>
