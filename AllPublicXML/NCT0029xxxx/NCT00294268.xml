  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural
      treatment (CBT) designed to help obese patients lose weight and to maintain their weight
      losses over time. It is hypothesized that CBT will result in greater sustained weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the present study is to improve the maintenance of weight loss, and hence
      the physical, psychological and social well-being, of obese patients who have sought weight
      loss treatment. To do so, it will implement a cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) with
      motivational enhancement strategies specifically designed to target weight maintenance. It is
      hypothesized that the maintenance-oriented CBT approach will result in sustained weight loss,
      as well as improved physical, psychological and social well-being.
