      This study will evaluate the tolerability and safety of valsartan in patients with stable,
      chronic heart failure (NYHA Class ll-lll). The 12-week double blind study has a 2-week
      (maximum) screening, and a 10-week active treatment phase. In each of the treatment arms (QD
      and BID), patients are up-titrated to a maximum valsartan total daily dose of 320 mg.
      Patients remain on their prior CHF standard care therapy throughout the study period, and the
      up-titration of valsartan is based on patient tolerability.
