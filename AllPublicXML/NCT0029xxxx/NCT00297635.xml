      This study will help determine whether the use of a wireless glucose meter and and an
      internet-based automated diabetes management system to organize blood glucose values will
      help improve glucose control during the start of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
      therapy by an insulin pump device in patients with type 1 diabetes. Outcome measures to be
      determined include an assessment of glucose excursions, overall glucose control, health care
      team staff and patient time required and a satisfaction survey.

      The study is focused on the following objectives:

        1. Determine whether the use of the GlucoDYNAMIX™ diabetes intervention system and the
           GlucoMON™ telemetry device will facilitate faster regulation of blood glucose excursions
           into a well-controlled range, compared to conventional monitoring and reporting.

             -  hemoglobin A1c at the end of the 3 month study period and again after an additional
                3 month follow-up period to account for a possible for an extended difference
                between the groups;

             -  magnitude of glucose excursions and fluctuations as indicated by the standard
                deviation between glucose tests to indicate relative glucose control and the mean
                daily glucose value over the 3 month period following the initiation of pump
                therapy; and,

             -  frequency of severe hypoglycemia and extended hyperglycemia.

        2. Determine whether use of the GlucoDYNAMIX intervention system, during initiation of
           adult insulin pump starts, results in a measured saving of staff time in support of data
           collection, analysis and patient feedback including delivery and follow-up to monitor
           effects on glucose control from patient implementation of prescribed changes. This
           objective will be measured by:

             -  tracking the number of interventions each day;

             -  estimating the amount of time spent collecting, analyzing and communicating with
                each study patient; and,

             -  daily logs will be tallied and verified weekly.

        3. To determine through use of questionnaires administered to the patients and to the
           professional staff whether use of the technology results in perceived improvement in the
           quality of care and improved satisfaction for all involved. This objective is primarily
           concerned with people's willingness to commit to using a similar technology as standard
           practice for future initiation of insulin pump starts for adult patient with diabetes
           mellitus.

      Study Design and Description The study is designed to run for a period of 3 months of
      intensive management for each enrolled patient as they begin insulin pump therapy plus
      detailed glucose records beginning 4 weeks prior to the initiation of insulin pump therapy.
      Understanding relative glucose control following intensive management requires that we
      consider the results of the patient's HbA1c 3 months after conclusion of intensive management
      thus extending the time frame to 6 months.

      Group A The Intervention Technology Group will be issued a GlucoMON device, a GlucoMON
      wall-mount recharging unit, a OneTouch Ultra glucose meter, paper logbook forms and test
      strips to support frequent testing for the 3 months following initiation of insulin pump
      therapy. The patient will be instructed on use and care of the GlucoMON as well as the
      OneTouch Ultra during a one-on-one session at the meeting immediately prior to initial
      delivery of insulin via the pump start.

      Patients are also issued a specially configured low-cost 2way wireless email device which
      supports sending and receiving individual messages of up to 500 characters including the
      ability to send canned response options for easy data marking. Real-time messaging as part of
      the system is described in Addendum B. The intelligent logic behind the patient interaction
      is managed on a server in Diabetech's remote data center thus allowing for easy modification
      and centralized management of the patient interaction.

      The TJU diabetes staff will initially review the patient record daily and will document the
      results of their review including any changes prescribed to the patient and the approximate
      amount of time involved in the handling of the encounter.

      Group B (Control) The Conventional Technology Group will be issued a OneTouch Ultra glucose
      meter, paper logbook forms and test strips to support frequent testing for the 3 months
      following initiation of insulin pump therapy. The patient will be instructed on use and care
      of the OneTouch Ultra during a one-on-one session at the meeting to begin initial delivery of
      insulin via the pump start.

      Patients will be instructed to complete the logbooks and fax daily to the TJU diabetes
      center. The TJU diabetes staff are available to review patient logs Monday thru Friday 8-5.
      Emergency after hours help is also available. The staff will initially review the patient
      logbook and will document the results of their review including any changes prescribed to the
      patient and the approximate amount of time involved in the handling of the encounter.

      Data Analysis The data collected will include the patient's self-monitoring blood glucose
      (SMBG) test data, time-event logging annotations to the glucose tests, baseline and follow-up
      hemoglobin A1c test results, clinical events including hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and
      results of satisfaction questionnaires and time spent for analysis by the clinical staff for
      each patient.

      The endpoints to be measured include frequent blood glucose testing, as is usual when a
      patient is initiating therapy with an insulin infusion pump, as well as HbA1c. The glucose
      levels will be analyzed with regard to the magnitude of glucose excursions and fluctuations
      and the mean daily glucose value over the 6 month period following the initiation of pump
      therapy.

      The mean and standard deviation of each treatment group's (intervention and control) HbA1c
      will be calculated for each time point (0, 3, and 6 months post enrollment). Statistical
      differences in the HbA1c values between treatment groups at each time point and between
      different time points for each group will be sought. In addition, the change in HbA1c between
      time points (0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 0 to 6) will be calculated. The mean and standard deviation
      of these HbA1c changes will be calculated for each treatment group and analyzed for
      statistical significance.

      SMBG data will be analyzed using glycemic control indices to compare the efficacy of both
      treatments. The following numerical indices will be used to describe the quality of metabolic
      control:

        1. The mean and standard deviation of patient SMBG data

        2. The percentage of SMBG data points that are above and below a threshold for
           hyperglycemia (e.g., 200mg/dl) and hypoglycemia (e.g., 60mg/dl)

        3. The M-value is a quantitative index of the lack of treatment efficacy of an individual
           patient. The index describes both mean glycemic control and glucose excursions. The
           M-value is a logarithmic transformation of the deviation from an arbitrary standard
           (selected by the physician) that gives extra weight to hypoglycemic values. The original
           concept of Schlichtkrull et al. (1965)3 has been modified by Service et al. (1970) 4
           into the formula:

           |10 log10 (x/standard)|3 / n where x is a SMBG data point, standard is aM = glucose
           value chosen to define the degree of metabolic control (typically 100 mg/dl), and n is
           the number of samples. BG values below 100mg/dl cause the M-value to rise rapidly while
           BG values above 100 mg/dl cause the M-value to rise more slowly. M-values less than 18
           correspond to good metabolic control [Schlichtkrull J 1965].

        4. The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) quantifies the amplitude and duration
           of wide swings of BG values, diurnal variability of mean BG values, and episodes of
           hypoglycemia as an index of diabetic instability. MAGE is calculated by taking the
           arithmetic mean of the changes in BG when they exceed one standard deviation of the BG
           mean over the preceding 24-hour period. Excursions less than 1 standard deviation are
           ignored. MAGE is a valuable index of metabolic control in healthy and diabetic subjects
           [Service 1970]. MAGE averaged 42 mg/dl in healthy subjects, 147 mg/dl in type 1 diabetic
           patients treated with multiple injections of short-acting insulin, and 161 mg/dl in type
           1 diabetic patients treated with a single daily injection of intermediate-acting
           insulin.

      These indices will be computed using a moving window of data. The window will be stepped
      across each patient's SMBG data set through the intensive management period. Those data
      points that fall within the window will be used to compute the indices. The steps and widths
      of the window will be set at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days. For example, with a step and width of 7
      days, each calculation of the M-value of a patient's SMBG data would encompass 7 days and
      there would be 12 different calculations for each week of the 3-month intensive management
      period. Statistical differences in the indices for a given window for each treatment group
      will be sought.

      The amount of time taken by nurses and physicians to manage each patient will be tabulated.
      These data will be used to compute a cost associated with the management of the insulin pump
      start for each patient. The mean and standard deviation of this cost will be calculated for
      each treatment group and analyzed for a statistical significance.

      A paired Student t-test or a one-way analysis of variance will be used to calculate a
      significant difference. A p value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant.

      Standard Care Guidelines typically involve the diabetes center distributing a handbook of
      sorts to the patient upon diagnosis or as part of the initial visit to your center. In terms
      of ongoing care, patients are responsible for acquiring tools on their own for managing
      diabetes. In addition to insulin, patients must purchase their own glucose meters, test
      strips, lancing device, lancets, alcohol, fast acting sugar of some sort to treat low blood
      sugar, glucagon for severe hypoglycemia, etc... Depending on the form of insulin therapy, the
      patient must also purchase syringes or an insulin pump with disposable cartridges and
      infusion sets.

      For the duration of the study, patients enrolled as Standard Care (Group B) will be given a
      glucose meter and test strips at no charge.

      To facilitate communication of blood sugars and other diabetes relevant data with the center,
      the diabetes center shares one page of a standardized logbook form on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper. It is
      the patient's responsibility to make copies of this form for their own use and also to
      deliver these completed forms to the diabetes center as needed. Methods for delivering this
      logbook include faxing (a patient must purchase their own fax machine or pay/borrow as well
      as any costs associated with fax transmission), US Mail (using their own envelope and
      postage) or hand deliver (using their own transportation).

      Study Population As a patient elects to participate they will be assigned alternatively to
      either Group A or Group B beginning with assignment of the first patient enrolled into Group
      A.

      Informed Consent Informed consent will be obtained from each participant.

      Documentation Requirements All data and documentation will be held private and secure in
      compliance with HIPAA guidelines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must reside in the Philadelphia area and participate in regular in person visits
        to the Jefferson Diabetes Research Center. Patients must be at the stage of their treatment
        where they are going to initiate insulin infusion pump therapy. Patients must be at least
        18 years of age before starting the protocol and must have never used an insulin pump
        before. Ideally, at least a few of the study participants will use English as a second
        language. Since the technology is capable of delivering messages to the wireless email
        device in several languages including Spanish and French, there is no English only
        requirement. Likewise, patients not capable of operating the wireless email device will be
        included since the GlucoMON device is specially designed to enable patient use without
        technology aptitude typical for personal computers and interactive wireless devices.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients living outside the Philadelphia area and those that are not immediately going to
        initiate insulin pump therapy wil be excluded. Patients unwilling to perform at least 4
        blood glucose self-tests will be ineligible for participation in this study. Conventional
        guidelines for minimum self-care will apply including criteria for discontinuance of
        insulin pump therapy.
