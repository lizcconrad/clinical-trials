  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of intake of Omacor (Omega-3-acid
      ethyl ester 90) 2g/day on specified parameters related to the stability of carotid plaque in
      patients awaiting endarterectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence both from epidemiological studies and large clinical trials that
      consumption of long-chain Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) found in oily fish and
      fish oils, protects against cardiovascular disease in Western Populations. The large clinical
      trial GISSI-Prevention showed radical reductions in Cardiovascular Disease and Sudden Cardiac
      Death after the intake of Omega-3 PUFA, and statistically significant effects were seen after
      only a few months of use.

      One of the models for explaining this markedly effect hypothesizes that Omega-3 PUFA, with
      its anti inflammatory effects, might act to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques by decreasing
      infiltration of inflammatory cells into the plaques and/or by decreasing the activity of
      these cells once resident in the plaque. A previous clinical study has showed increased
      incorporation of the Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in carotid plaque after intake of
      Omega-3 PUFA. The morphological properties of the plaque was also altered, showing thicker
      fibrous caps and less inflammation determined by the AHA and modified AHA classification.

      These findings are important to confirm. Secondly additional indicators of plaque stability
      are required to strengthen the hypothesis. Also the mechanisms by which the morphological
      changes come about need to be identified. The model that is being used assesses structural
      changes associated with plaque rupture and instability through different important variables.

      Comparisons: Double blind comparison of Omacor 2g/day and placebo in patients awaiting
      endarterectomy.
