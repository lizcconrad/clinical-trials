    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and Week 52 (end of the observation period) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included SAEs as well as non-serious AEs which occurred during the trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>PASI: combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score. Body was divided into 4 sections (head, arms, trunk, and legs); each area was scored by itself and scores were combined for final PASI. For each section percent area of skin involved was estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90 - 100%), and severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, induration, and desquamation; scale: 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4; total score ranged from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints Count (DAS 28) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 28 joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 100 mm; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). DAS28 total score range: 0-10, where DAS28 less than or equal to (=&lt;) 3.2 = low disease activity, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate disease activity and &gt;5.1 = high disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ritchie Index at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Ritchie index: the numerical measurement of joint tenderness (28 joints) in participants with arthritis. The number of quantitative evaluations of the pain experienced by the participants when the joints were subjected to firm pressure when exerted over the articular margin or in some instances by passive movement of the joint. Participant's reaction to pressure exerted by the physician were documented on 4-point scale, 0=not tender, 1=tender, 2=tender and caused wince, 3=reflexive effort to withdraw. Ritchie index was calculated as the total of the individual grades for all joints; ranged from 0 to 84, where higher score indicated higher tenderness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Physician global assessment of disease activity was measured on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 mm = no disease activity to 100 mm = most possible disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Nail Involvement</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in C-reactive Protein (CRP) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Itching at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Pain at Week 52</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 questionnaire was used to determine participants' quality of life (QoL). It comprised 12 items which covered 8 concepts : physical functionality, role impairment due to physical problems, physical pain, perception of general health, vitality, social functionality, role impairment due to emotional problems, and psychological wellbeing. Results were presented in the form of 2 meta-scores, the physical component and the mental component, each ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores=better QoL, positive changes from baseline=improvement in QoL.</description>

Body was divided into 4 sections (head, arms, trunk, and legs); each area was scored by itself and scores were combined for final PASI.

        <description>SF-12 questionnaire was used to determine participants’ quality of life (QoL). It comprised 12 items which covered 8 concepts : physical functionality, role impairment due to physical problems, physical pain, perception of general health, vitality, social functionality, role impairment due to emotional problems, and psychological wellbeing. Results were presented in the form of 2 meta-scores, the physical component and the mental component, each ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores=better QoL, positive changes from baseline=improvement in QoL.</description>
