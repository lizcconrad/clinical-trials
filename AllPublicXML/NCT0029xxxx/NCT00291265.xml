      This study will test the accuracy of a new home-use electronic device that measures and
      records small changes in Parkinson's disease symptoms, such as tremor and impaired movement
      and speech. The testing is done at home and the results are sent by Internet to the patient's
      doctor. Detecting Parkinson's disease in its early stages may permit doctors to provide early
      treatment and slow the rate of disease progression.

      Patients with early Parkinson's disease (less than 5 years) with rest tremors and
      bradykinesia (slowness and difficulty of movement) who are not taking medications for the
      disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with training and practice in
      using the home monitoring device over 2-3 weeks. Those who demonstrate proficiency with the
      device may be enrolled in the study.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

      Baseline Visit

      Participants' undergo symptoms ratings using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and
      assessments of memory, thinking and depression.

      At-home testing

      Participants begin at-home testing with the monitoring device after the baseline visit and
      repeat the tests weekly for 6 months. The test information is automatically uploaded to a
      home computer (provided by the study) and sent to the investigators via Internet. The test
      procedure is as follows:

        -  Introduction questionnaire (1 minute): Participants are questioned about how they are
           feeling at test time.

        -  Pegboard test (4 minutes): At the sound of a tone, the participant moves eight pegs from
           the right to the left using their right and then left hand.

        -  Tapping test (3 minutes): At the sound of a tone, the participant alternately presses
           two buttons with the right index finger and then the left index finger.

        -  Reaction time/movement time testing (3 minutes): At the sound of a tone, the participant
           moves his or her index finger from one button to the other, first with the right hand
           and then with the left hand.

        -  Digitography testing (4 minutes): At the sound of a tone, the participant alternates
           between pressing two keys with the index and middle fingers.

        -  Speech + Actiwatch tremor data upload (7 minutes): The participant: 1) takes a deep
           breath and says &quot;ahhh&quot; for as long as possible; 2) is shown a picture and, at the sound
           of a tone, is asked to tell a story about the picture; 3) uploads the tremor data from
           the Actiwatch (a device worn on the wrist that records tremors).

      Objective: Because neuroprotective strategies in Parkinson's disease are primarily aimed at
      intervening in the early phase of disease, appropriate measures of minor, subtle parkinsonian
      impairments need to be defined. The gold standard of rating scales for Parkinson's disease is
      the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scale (UPDRS), but it covers the gamut of disability
      levels and does not specifically focus on early impairments. We have developed a series of
      motor tasks that can be performed with a home-based computer module so that data can be
      collected frequently and prospectively without obligating the patient to come to a medical
      center.

      Study population: The study population will consist of patients with mild and early Parkinson
      disease.

      Design: This feasibility study will longitudinally follow 50 patients with mild and early
      Parkinson's disease who are not receiving symptomatic therapy for the treatment of motor
      impairment. They will be trained to perform the task and transmit data on a weekly basis.

      Outcome measures: We will analyze time-related changes in several domains of motor function
      (tremor, limb bradykinesia, fine motor bradykinesia, voice, reaction time/movement time) and
      correlate these changes with the UPDRS at 3 and 6 months. We hypothesize that patients will
      find this assessment technology easy to use, a positive force in their lives, and that they
      will be committed to the program throughout its duration. Further, we hypothesize that motor
      changes will be detected with this technology at a time when UPDRS scores do not show
      decrements. Over six months, however, declines in the UPDRS will occur and correlate with the
      decrements in computer-based motor task. If, as we hypothesize, the home-based motor testing
      program is both feasible and useful in the assessment of early impairments in Parkinson's
      disease, it will be particularly applicable to neuroprotective trials currently being
      designed.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. PD, defined with at least two of the following cardinal features: rest tremor,
                  bradykinesia, rigidity with PD diagnosis less than or equal to 5 years.

               2. Hoehn and Yahr stage less than 3.

               3. No clinical evidence of other parkinsonian syndromes (Progressive supranuclear
                  palsy, Multiple system atrophy, drug-induced parkinsonism, lewy body dementia).

               4. The patient must not be on any drug therapy for symptomatic control of
                  parkinsonism, specifically levodopa, dopamine agonist, amantadine,
                  anticholinergic drugs, COMT-inhibitors, selegiline while participating in the
                  initial 6 months of the study.

               5. Patients must express a willingness and intent to remain off all medications that
                  could affect parkinsonism for the first 6 months of the study without first
                  informing the site PI. Starting an anti-Parkinson medication does not necessarily
                  disqualify a patient from continuing with the study. After the initial 6 months
                  of participation, the patients will be allowed to start a anti-Parkinson
                  medications.

               6. Patient must express a willingness and intent to remain off of all medications
                  that could affect parkinsonism for the first 6 months of the study without first
                  informing the site PI. Starting an anti-Parkinson medication does not necessarily
                  disqualify a patient from continuing with the study. After the initial 6 months
                  of participation, the patients will be allowed to start anti-Parkinson
                  medications.

               7. Patient must demonstrate proficiency in the use of the At Home Testing Program in
                  an office setting.

               8. Participants must be willing to have a technician come to their homes to set up
                  the equipment, check on it periodically, and remove it at study end.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients who have comorbid neurological or psychiatric disorders (even if they don't
             require medications).

          2. Patients who have had Parkinson's disease for more than 5 years.

          3. Patients who have another movement disorder (Progressive supranuclear palsy, Multiple
             system atrophy, drug-induced parkinsonism, Lewy body dementia).

          4. Disruptive non-compliance with requirements of the study causing an inability to
             collect valid and clean data.

          5. Inability to accurately perform the task required of this study (i.e. cannot use the
             equipment properly and to transfer data using a simple USB connection).

        Please note that there is no inclusion or exclusion criteria based on depression or
        dementia. However, if these problems interfered with proficiency of data acquisition during
        the screening phase, they will not be eligible. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale will
        be the measure used. Depression scale scores will be used as potential co-variants to
        compliance in exploratory analysis. Furthermore, treatment of other medical conditions will
        be allowed during the treatment period. Treatment of any feature of Parkinson's disease
        that does not involve the exclusionary medications (see inclusion/exclusion criteria) will
        be allowed.
