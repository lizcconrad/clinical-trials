  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that patients with ESRD on hemodialysis have high levels of inflammatory
      markers which may contribute to the high rates of cardiovascular disease and mortality seen
      in these patients. Vitamin D use in dialysis patients has been shown to have a survival
      benefit, with paricalcitol at advantage over calcitriol. Since there is some evidence for
      involvement of the vitamin D receptor in inflammation, this study is designed to look for an
      effect of paricalcitol on markers of inflammation in hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ESRD have a high incidence of acute phase inflammation. Studies have shown that
      C-reactive Protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are excellent biomarkers for inflammation,
      and high levels are predictive of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this population.
      Both uremia and the dialysis process itself contribute to this inflammatory state. It is our
      hypothesis that paricalcitol therapy decreases the biomarkers of inflammation which may have
      implications for future studies of morbidity and mortality in this population.
