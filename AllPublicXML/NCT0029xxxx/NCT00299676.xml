  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to investigate the changes in cognitive
      functioning, behavior, and functional improvement in Alzheimer's disease patients treated
      with Galantamine who are living at home (i.e. not in permanent residential care), and to
      obtain information regarding usual clinical practice that can be used for communicating
      treatment expectations to patients and supporters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study to assess the changes in cognitive functioning,
      behavior, and functional improvement in Alzheimer's disease patients treated with Galantamine
      who are living at home (i.e. not in permanent residential care), and to obtain information
      regarding usual clinical practice performed by relevant specialists. There will be no
      experimental component associated with this study and all observational activities will be
      part of routine care. This study will follow patients with Alzheimer's disease, who are
      currently not in permanent residential care, for a period of 18 months. The three domains of
      cognition, behavior and function will be evaluated at baseline using the Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE) and/or ADAS-Cog, the abridged Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
      (IADL) and a 14-item behavioral assessment scale. Changes in the 3 domains will be observed
      after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of Galantamine therapy through the completion of The Clinician
      Interview Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus), abridged IADL, behavioral changes, and the
      Mini-Mental State Examination/ADAS-Cog. Primary outcome is to determine changes from baseline
      in cognition, behavior and function will be assessed after 3, 6, 12, and 18 months as
      measured by the CIBIC-Plus, abridged IADL, the Mini-Mental State Examination/ADAS-Cog and
      behavioral changes. The secondary outcome is development of information regarding treatment
      expectations that can be used for communicating with patients and supporters. Galantamine
      will be prescribed according to routine clinical practice and as per the Product Information
      leaflet
