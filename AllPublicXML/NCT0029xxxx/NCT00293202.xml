  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Etanercept is a novel anti-inflammatory agent currently used in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis. We are examining whether etanercept is effective in improving the nutritional
      status of hemodialysis patients as a consequence of its ability to decrease inflammation.
      Hemodialysis patients with end stage renal disease have a high mortality rate. In individual
      patients, mortality is associated with a low serum albumin concentration, a marker of poor
      nutritional status, and with elevated C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. Since
      efforts to improve nutrition through dietary intake have not been successful, inflammation is
      thought to play a key role in determining nutritional status. Recently, it has been shown
      that malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis are closely related in patients with
      chronic renal failure. It is our hypothesis that suppression of the cycle of inflammation,
      malnutrition, and vascular injury caused by atherosclerosis will improve survival in dialysis
      patients. This study is designed to examine whether suppression of the inflammatory response
      can be accomplished safely with etanercept and to determine if this suppression will improve
      nutritional status and clinical outcome in hemodialysis patients with poor nutritional status
      and evidence of inflammation.

    <description>Hemodialysis patients having a serum albumin of less than or equal to 3.8 g/dl and a CRP greater than or equal to 0.8 mg/dL will receive either etanercept at a dose of 25 mg by subcutaneous injection twice a week or a placebo for a period of 48 weeks. The outcome is an increase in serum albumin and pre-albumin in the treated group.</description>
