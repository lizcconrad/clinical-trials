  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic Rhinitis is an inflammatory disease which causes an influx of inflammatory cells and
      cytokines into the nasal mucosa. These biomarkers can also be found in the nasal secretions.
      The evaluation of these inflammatory biomarkers is of great interest as this could lead to a
      concept of measuring the efficacy of anti-allergic treatments by assessing the changes in
      nasal biomarkers after allergen challenge. To use this model as an assessment of
      pharmacodynamics it is crucial to evaluate the specificity and reproducibility of cellular
      and cytokine levels in the nasal secretions after allergen provocations.

      In a 2 part repeated measurement design 20 patients with allergic rhinitis and 20 healthy
      subjects will undergo two 4-hour pollen exposures in an interval of 21 days.

      The aim of this study is to explore the cellular and cytokine levels this allergen challenge
      will induce in nasal secretions and to assess if an increase in those inflammatory biomarkers
      is specific to the patient subgroup and whether the results are reproducible after the second
      allergen challenge.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects, aged 18-55 years.

          -  Women will be considered for inclusion if they are: Not pregnant or nursing. Of
             non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is pre-menarchial or post-menopausal with documented proof of
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation, or meet clinical criteria for menopause and have been
             amenorrhoeic for more than 1 year prior to the screening visit).Of childbearing
             potential and using an appropriate method of contraception (Oral contraceptive pill or
             double barrier).

          -  FEV1 &gt; 80% of predicted at screening.

          -  Absence of any structural nasal abnormalities or nasal polyps on examination, a
             history of frequent nose bleeding or recent nasal surgery.

          -  Absence of conditions or factors, which would make the subject unlikely to be able to
             stay in the Fraunhofer ECC for 4 hours.

          -  Non smoker or smokers with a history of less than 10 pack years.

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study.

          -  Available to complete all study measurements.

          -  For subjects with allergic rhinitis:

          -  History of allergic rhinitis to grass pollen and a positive skin prick test for
             Dactylis glomerata pollen at or within 12 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Subject must exhibit a moderate response upon 4.000 Dactylis glomerata pollen
             grains/m3 during 4 hours in the ECC on visit 2, which is defined as a Total Nasal
             Symptom Score of at least 6. (TNSS is the sum of obstruction, rhinorrhea, itch, and
             sneeze, each of which has been scored on a scale from 0 to 3).

          -  Subjects with mild stable asthma that is controlled with occasional use of as-needed
             short-acting beta-agonists and associated with normal lung function may be included
             also.

          -  Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) of &lt; 3 and a score &lt; 2 for each symptom, i.e.
             obstruction, rhinorrhea, itch, and sneeze prior to entering the pollen chamber.

          -  for healthy subjects:

          -  No history of allergic rhinitis and a negative skin prick test including Dactylis
             glomerata at or within 12 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) prior to and during pollen exposition of &lt; 3 and a
             score &lt; 2 for each symptom, i.e. obstruction, rhinorrhea, itch, and sneeze.

             seizures.
