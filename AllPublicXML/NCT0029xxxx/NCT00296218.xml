      Primary Objective

        -  The main objective of this study is to assess if a two-month regimen of irbesartan in
           patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome without ST segment elevation can
           reduce inflammation markers (ie hsCRP), in comparison to a similar regimen of enalapril.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To compare both regimens on several other biological parameters which have demonstrated
           their relevance and their predictive clinical value (ie BNP, microalbuminuria, troponin
           I …) in this patient population.

        -  To compare on the above parameters the early initiation of treatment versus the
           initiation of treatment at hospital discharge.

        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to
        allow patients and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace
        the advice of a personal physician or health professional.

        Main criteria are listed hereafter:

             (non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes):

               -  ECG ST or T changes (ST depression or transient elevation of at least 1mm or T
                  wave changes in at least 2 leads)
