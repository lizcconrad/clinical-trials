  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, open-label study will be performed in approximately 990 healthy
      females undergoing IVF. Each study center will follow their study center standard practice
      for IVF unless otherwise noted in this protocol. The study centers will be provided with the
      medications for down regulation, stimulation and ovulation induction. The subjects will be
      randomized to study medication on the day of oocyte retrieval or the day following and will
      continue treatment for up to 10 weeks. The subjects with a confirmed pregnancy will be
      required to return to the clinic several times during the course of the 10 week treatment
      period for serum pregnancy tests and transvaginal ultrasounds to monitor the pregnancy.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Pre-menopausal females between the ages of 18 and 42 years Non-smokers. For females
             who are past smokers, they must have stopped tobacco usage for at least 3 months prior
             to baseline visit.

          2. Early follicular phase (day 2-4) FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) less than or equal
             to 15 IU/L and Estradiol within normal limits

          3. LH (luteinizing hormone), PRL (prolactin), T (testosterone), DHEA-S
             (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), within the
             normal limits for the clinical laboratory, or considered not clinically significant by
             the investigator within 6 months prior to screening.

          4. Negative serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, HIV antibody, and
             rapid plasma reagin tests within 3 months prior to screening

          5. Seropositive for rubella and varicella and ABO grouping and Rho (D) typing prior to
             screening

          6. Documented history of infertility (eg, unable to conceive for at least one year or for
             6 months for women ≥38 years of age or bilateral tubal occlusion or absence).

          7. Male partner with recent (within 6 months prior to screening) semen analysis showing
             normalcy adequate for IVF by standard WHO and/or Kruger criteria. Donor sperm may be
             used, if indicated, provided that it meets standard WHO criteria.

          8. Normal Transvaginal ultrasound at screening (or within 14 days of screening) with
             presence of both at least ovaries without evidence of clinically significant
             abnormality consistent with findings adequate for ART with respect to uterus and
             adnexa (no hydrosalpinx or clinically relevant uterine fibroids).

          9. At least one cycle with no fertility medication prior to screening.

         10. Hysterosalpingography, hysteroscopy, or sonohysterogram documenting a normal uterine
             cavity.

         11. Negative pregnancy test on the day of pituitary down regulation (prior to
             administration of GnRH agonist).

         12. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Requires Donor oocyte or embryo recipient; gestational or surrogate carrier

          2. Undergoing blastomer biopsy and other experimental ART procedures

          3. Inadequate number of oocytes defined as fewer than 3 oocytes retrieved in the study
             cycle

          4. Presence of any clinically relevant systemic disease (eg, insulin-dependent diabetes
             mellitus).

          5. Surgical or medical condition which in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor may
             interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drugs to be
             used.

          6. Subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 34 at time of Screening.

          7. Previous IVF or ART failure due to related to either a sperm/fertilization problem
             which resulted in unsuccessful fertilization or an ART with a poor response to
             gonadotropins. Poor response is defined as development of less than 2 mature follicles
             or history of 2 previous cycle cancellations prior to oocyte retrieval due to poor
             response.

          8. Presence of abnormal uterine bleeding of undetermined origin.

         13. For male partner, obvious leukospermia (&gt; 2 million WBC/mL) or signs of infection in
             semen sample within past 2 months of pituitary down regulation; if either of these
             conditions exists, male should be treated with antibiotics and retested prior to his
             partner's pituitary down regulation.

         14. Documented intolerance or allergy to any of the medications used including the study
