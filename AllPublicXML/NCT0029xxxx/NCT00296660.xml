  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data and body fluid samples from people with acute or
      established HIV infection and from HIV uninfected people. Data from this study will be used
      to better understand properties of HIV, including HIV transmission and the differences
      between acute and established HIV infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have identified strategies for the large-scale identification of acute HIV
      infections. One system using such strategies has already been implemented in North Carolina,
      and this system will be used in this study run by the Center of HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology
      (CHAVI). This study will collect data on the mechanism of HIV transmission and the genetic,
      biologic, antigenic, and structural characteristics of the virus. The study will enroll HIV
      infected people with acute HIV infection and their sexual partners, people with established
      HIV infection, and HIV uninfected people.

      This study will last 96 weeks. Group 1 participants will be people with acute HIV infection.
      These participants will have 15 study visits; some visits will include a physical exam and
      medical history. Group 1 will also be asked to complete a sexual behavioral assessment at
      study entry and every 12 weeks thereafter. Group 2 participants will be people with
      established HIV infection. Group 3 participants will be HIV uninfected people. Groups 2 and 3
      will have 10 study visits; some visits will include a physical exam and medical history.
      Groups 2 and 3 will also be asked to complete a sexual behavioral assessment at study entry,
      every 12 weeks until Week 72, and Week 96. Group 3 will undergo HIV testing at each visit and
      will receive pre- and post-test counseling.

      At each visit, participants will undergo HIV safe sex counseling and will update their
      locator information. Blood, genital secretion, and breast milk collection will also occur at
      each visit.

        Up to 1300 with either an acute HIV-1 infection, established HIV-1 infection, or without
        HIV-1 infection will be enrolled. Sexual partners of those with an acute infection will
        also be enrolled.
