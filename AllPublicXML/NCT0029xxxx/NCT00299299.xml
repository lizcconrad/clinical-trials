    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility and reproducibility of patient-specific motion models. These
      will be used for quantification of safe margin reduction. Patient-specific motion models will
      be built by post-processing 4D MRI data with non-rigid registration. By comparing these
      models between visits, model reproducibility will be assessed, and the methodology refined.

      The study will use a real time position management (RPM) system for respiratory gating. The
      RPM system senses the respiration motion of the patient by tracking a pair of reflective
      markers on a lightweight &quot;marker block&quot; constructed of a synthetic material. This block is
      placed on the patient's abdomen.

      During Radiotherapy, the beam is only switched on at pre-determined phases of respiration.
      The appropriate phase of respiration is determined by the RPM system. This implies a reliable
      correlation of external block motion to internal hepatic movement. This correlation is not a
      simple one, and requires &quot;modeling&quot;.
