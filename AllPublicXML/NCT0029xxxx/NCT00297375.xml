  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tramadol
      HCl/acetaminophen as a pain medication compared with placebo in the treatment of acute pain
      from a migraine headache. Although tramadol HCl/acetaminophen is approved to treat acute
      pain, it is not approved for the treatment of acute pain associated with migraine headache.
      The study hypothesis is that tramadol HCl/acetaminophen is safe and effective as a pain
      medication in the treatment of acute pain associated with a migraine headache.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although new drugs and procedures are available to treat acute migraine pain, inadequacies in
      treatment still exist. The ingredients in tramadol HCl/acetaminophen tablet and the way it
      works may be effective in the treatment of the pain of acute migraine headache. The
      combination of tramadol HCl/ acetaminophen works faster than tramadol alone and lasts longer
      than acetaminophen alone. This is a multicenter, single-dose, outpatient, randomized (study
      with two groups one in treatment and one control group), double-blind (neither patient nor
      investigator knows which patient is receiving study drug or control treatment),
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group (each group receives only one type of treatment) study of
      adult patients who experience at least moderate pain from migraine headaches. After being
      randomly assigned to a group patients will leave the study center with one dose (2 tablets)
      of study medication, either active treatment or placebo. The next time the patient has a
      migraine headache of at least moderate pain, the patient will take the study medication and
      start to answer questions about their headache pain and pain relief in a study diary.
      Patients should return to the study center within 72 hours of taking this dose. The study
      hypothesis is that tramadol HCl/acetaminophen is safe and effective as a pain medication in
      the treatment of acute pain associated with a migraine headache.

      2 tramadol HCl (37.5 milligrams)/acetaminophen (325 milligrams) combination tablets or 2
      matching placebo (inactive substance) tablets for tramadol HCl/acetaminophen taken one time
      orally
