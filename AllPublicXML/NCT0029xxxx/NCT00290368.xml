  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-drug, biomarker study to assess the utility of the model of repeated nasal
      allergen challenges in subjects with atopic rhinitis as a method of inducing an increased
      response to inhaled allergen, which will more closely resemble the responses seen during the
      hayfever season.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects with a history of seasonal (intermittent) atopic rhinitis,
             aged 18-40 years.

          2. Otherwise healthy with no health problems that may jeopardize the subjects
             participating in the study, absence of history of other significant allergies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months).

          2. Presence of any respiratory disease other than a history of mild stable asthma not
             requiring treatment and associated with normal lung function (FEV1 &gt; 80% predicted at
             screening).
