  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare PEG-interferon alfa-2b and two different doses of
      rivavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in previously untreated adult subjects

      Primary Objective:

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different PEG-interferon and
      Ribavirin regimens in patients who have not previously been treated for Hepatitis C. Patients
      have an equal chance to assignment to one of two treatment arms:

      Treatment Arm A:

      PEG-interferon 1.5 mcg/kg2 QW + Ribavirin 800 mg/day

      OR

      Treatment Arm B:

      PEG-interferon 1.5mcg/kg2 QW + Ribavirin 800 to 1400 mg/day

      Arm A &amp; Arm B: Duration of treatment will be 48 weeks for genotype 1 patients and 24 or 48
      weeks for genotype 2 or 3 patients.
