    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and quality of life adjuvant
      docetaxel-cisplatin chemotherapy versus no adjuvant treatment in patients with completely
      resected NSCLC Stage I-II.

      Open multicentre, centrally randomized, two-arm parallel-group, phase II pilot-study.
      Duration of the Treatment : Arm A - will be 4-6 cycles Docetaxel 75mg/m2 and Cisplatin
      75mg/m2 on day 1 every 21 days.

      Arm B untreated control group - best supportive care. A follow-up check-up examination will
      be performed every 3 months for a total of three years.

    <description>Docetaxel (Taxotere ) 75 mg/m² as a 1 hour i.v. infusion, followed immediately by cisplatin 75 mg/m² as a 1 hour i.v. infusion, on day 1 every 21 days for 6 cycles.
Dose reductions and/or treatment delays or discontinuation of treatment are planned for arm A in case of severe haematological and/or non haematological toxicities.
Premedication:
Dexamethasone 8 mg p.o. (or any other steroid commonly used) will be given -12 h, -3 h, -1 h before start of docetaxel infusion, then + 12 h, +24 h and + 36 h post infusion.
All patients should receive a prophylactic antiemetic premedication to prevent nausea and vomitus, which includes a 5-HT3 antagonist prior to start of each docetaxel infusion.
Hyperhydration Patients will require intravenous hydration according to institutional guidelines.</description>
