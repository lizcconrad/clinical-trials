  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is prevalent in the American population and is strongly
      associated with premature coronary disease. Lifestyle intervention, primarily exercise and
      dietary changes, are foundational treatment strategies for independent components of MS, but
      these interventions have not been thoroughly evaluated in MS. Even with very modest weight
      loss, in the setting of caloric restriction and exercise, marked improvement MS parameters
      have been noted. However, it is not known whether it is diet with weight loss or exercise
      that improves the metabolic derangements associated with MS. We propose a study designed to
      examine the relative impact of diet or exercise on the components of MS. Furthermore, it is
      known that psychological factors significantly impact the ability of patients to initiate and
      sustain lifestyle changes. We will monitor certain psychological states to evaluate their
      impact on the success of weight loss and sustainability of lifestyle changes throughout this
      study. Specific Aims: 1.) Evaluate the relative efficacy of diet with weight loss or exercise
      on improving the markers of metabolic syndrome. 2.) Determine of pre-existing psychological
      factors influence the effectiveness of diet with weight loss or exercise on the markers of
      metabolic syndrome. Design: Adult women (&gt; 18 yrs) with a body-mass index (BMI)  30 kg/m2
      will be assessed for MS and randomized to one of three groups (n = 34/group), Control (C),
      diet with weight loss alone (D), or exercise alone (E). The intervention groups will
      participate in supervised dietary changes designed for weight loss or exercise for 6 months.
      Anthropomorphic, serologic, and psychological parameters will be monitored and compared using
      ANOVA. Hypothesis: As indexed by the improvement in the laboratory markers of the components
      of metabolic syndrome, exercise alone has a more profound positive impact on Metabolic
      Syndrome then diet with weight loss alone.

      Research procedures: The interventions in this study will be caloric dietary restrictions
      intended to result in a 10% reduction of body weight within 6 months, or a supervised aerobic
      exercise program designed to improve cardiovascular fitness. The diet with weight loss group
      will meet with a registered dietician on a weekly basis for the first 2 months and then
      bi-weekly for the duration of the study for education and review of the subject’s caloric
      intake. Similarly, the exercise group subjects will participate in weekly supervised aerobic
      exercise sessions. At these visits, a food logbook and an exercise logbook will be turned
      into the study staff to review. Prior to inclusion in the study, the patient’s medical record
      will be reviewed for evidence of metabolic syndrome, specifically, recent lipid analysis,
      blood sugar, weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure. A self-report history
      and physical examination form, Perceived Behavior Control Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck
      Depression Inventory will also be included as part of the enrollment process and ongoing
      participation. Pre-intervention/initial screening includes fasting triglycerides, HDL,
      glucose, hs-CRP, Uric Acid, insulin, and plasma creatinine, 24-hour urine collection, blood
      pressure, waist and hip circumference, height, weight, VO2 max estimated from sub maximal
      standardized treadmill exercise test, Beck Depression Inventory, Perceived Behavioral Control
      Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale and Pre-intervention 3-day food record and physical activity
      questionnaire to assess baseline diet and activity levels. During study monitoring: daily
      exercise log (exercise group), assessed weekly, (determine the intensity, duration, and
      frequency of aerobic exercise), daily food log (diet with weight loss group), assessed for
      caloric intake, quarterly 3-day food records, assessed for caloric intake, and composition of
      fats, carbohydrates and proteins, quarterly blood pressure, weight, height, waist and hip
      circumference, quarterly fasting serum triglyceride, HDL, fasting serum glucose, and uric
      acid, and quarterly physical activity questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Perceived
      Behavioral Control Scale, and Self-Efficacy Scale. Post-study assessment: fasting serum
      triglycerides, HDL, serum glucose, uric acid, hs-CRP, insulin, and plasma creatinine, 24-hour
      urine collection, body weight, height, and waist and hip circumference, VO2 max estimated
      from sub maximal standardized treadmill exercise test, and 3-day food record, physical
      activity questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Perceived Behavioral Control Scale, and
      Self-Efficacy Scale. The control group will complete the pre and post measurements and the
      3-day food record and physical activity questionnaire as required by the diet and exercise
      groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:Subjects who have been noted to meet the initial study criteria or have
        self-determined their eligibility from direct mailings, newspaper advertisement, or
        poster/flyers (female, age &gt; 18, and a BMI of &gt; 30) will contact the study coordinator.
        Subjects will come for an initial assessment where informed consent will be obtained. Their
        eligibility for inclusion or exclusion will be based on a determination that they do have
        metabolic syndrome and determined by the study coordinator (Janine Albers) and the
        principal investigators (Michael Hein or Jack Williams). This will be assessed by a review
        of their medical record, laboratory assessment, anthropomorphic measurements, and a focused
        History and Physical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria: Cardiovascular: uncontrolled dyslipidemia (fasting triglycerides &gt;
        1000), type 1 diabetes, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (Hgb A-1-c &gt; 9.0%) or if on insulin,
        or uncontrolled hypertension (SBP &gt; 180 or DBP &gt; 100). Also, subjects with stable or
        unstable angina, a precedent myocardial infarction within six months of the study, or
        severe activity dyspnea, untreated major depression or patients with suicidal ideation,
        severe exercise-limiting inflammatory or degenerative arthritis, patients on anti-obesity
        medications or serotonin reuptake inhibitors, patients who are already involved in a
        regular aerobic exercise program (&gt; 3 sessions of 30min/wk) or are involved with other
        weight loss programs with dietary regimen intervention as a component, e.g. Weight Watchers
        or other similarly structured weight loss programs. Pregnancy. Weigh greater than 350
