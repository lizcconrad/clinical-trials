      The purpose of the ACTIVE study was to test if cognitive training interventions could
      maintain functional independence in elders by improving basic mental abilities, with
      follow-up assessments through five years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ACTIVE was a 4-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The primary objective of
      ACTIVE was to test the effectiveness and durability of three distinct cognitive interventions
      in improving elders' performance on basic measures of cognition and measures of cognitively
      demanding daily activities (e.g., food preparation, driving, medication use, financial
      management). These interventions previously had been found successful in improving cognitive
      abilities under laboratory or small-scale field conditions.

      The three interventions shared common design features: 1) equivalent intensity and duration;
      2) small group settings in ten 60-75 minute sessions; 3) focus on strategies for solving
      problems, remembering, or responding quickly to information; 4) modeling and demonstration of
      strategy usage; 5) practice on exemplar problems; 6) individual and group exercises; 7)
      feedback on performance; 8) fostering of self-efficacy regarding performance; 9) applying
      strategies to real-world tasks; 10) individualized training experiences, and 11) social
      interaction activities. In all three interventions, Sessions 1-5 focused on strategy
      instruction and exercises to practice the strategy. Sessions 6-10 provided additional
      practice exercises, but no new strategies were introduced. Content for each of the 10
      sessions was scripted in a trainer's manual.

      Interventions:

        1. Reasoning training focused on inductive reasoning, the ability to solve problems that
           follow a serial pattern and manifest in executive functioning. Participants were taught
           strategies to identify the pattern or sequence required to solve a problem. Training
           exercises involved identifying patterns in both laboratory-type reasoning tasks and in
           everyday activities, e.g., understanding the pattern in a bus schedule.

        2. Memory training focused on verbal episodic memory, which deals with acquisition and
           retrieval of information acquired in a particular place at a particular time.
           Participants were taught mnemonic strategies for remembering lists and sequences of
           items, text material, and main ideas and details of stories and other text-based
           information. Training exercises involved recalling laboratory-like episodic memory tasks
           as well as tasks related to everyday activities such as recalling a shopping list.

        3. Speed training focused on visual search and the ability to identify and locate visual
           information quickly in a divided attention format, with and without distractors.
           Participants practiced speeded tasks on a computer, and were allowed to proceed to more
           complex tasks, and faster and faster presentation speeds at their own pace.

        4. A control group received no training.

      In addition, booster training was provided to help participants maintain gains made from
      initial training and to further improve cognitive skills. Booster training was provided to a
      random sample of approximately 50% of training participants at 11 and 35-36 months after
      primary training.

      Participant involvement included assessments conducted at baseline, immediately
      post-intervention, and at 12, 24, 36 and 60 months. Assessments were conducted in individual
      and group sessions. For participants randomized to intervention groups, the interventions
      were conducted in small group settings in ten 60-75 minute sessions over a 5-6 week period.
      These were behavioral interventions with no pharmacologic component. Eleven months after the
      initial training was provided, booster training was offered, in all three intervention arms,
      to a randomly selected 60% of initially trained subjects. Booster training was delivered in
      four 75-minute sessions over a 2-3 week period.

      The primary study hypotheses were:

        -  Each training group will perform better than the other training and control groups on
           their respective primary and proximal outcomes

        -  Those groups that received booster training will perform better than those that did not
           receive booster training on their respective primary and proximal outcomes.

    <description>Memory outcome was computed as the summation of Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), and the Rivermead Behavioral Paragraph Recall test immediate recall. The possible range of the memory outcome is 0 to 132. Higher values represent a better outcome. Changes in outcome were computed as &quot;10 year minus baseline&quot; and the negative values indicate the decline from baseline.</description>

For the analysis, the reversed score was used and the possible range of the reversed everyday IADL function outcome is 0 to 38. Higher values for the reversed scores represent a better outcome. Changes in outcome were computed as &quot;10 year minus baseline&quot; and the negative values indicate the decline from baseline.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment occurred from March 1998 through October 1999 at six metropolitan field centers: University of Alabama at Birmingham, Boston Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged (now Hebrew Senior Life), Indiana University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Pennsylvania State University, and Wayne State University.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligibility and demographics were gathered at telephone screening.Health history, physical status, functional status, mental status, cognitive and function measures were gathered via in-person exams in individual and small-group formats at baseline.Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of three interventions or no-contact control group.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Memory Training</title>
          <description>Memory training focused on verbal episodic memory. Participants were taught mnemonic strategies for remembering lists and sequences of items, text material, and main ideas and details of stories and other text-based information.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Reasoning Training</title>
          <description>Reasoning training focused on the ability to solve problems that follow a serial pattern. Participants were taught strategies to identify the pattern or sequence required to solve a problem.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P3">
          <title>Speed of Processing Training</title>
          <description>Speed of processing training focused on visual search and the ability to identify and locate visual information quickly in a divided attention format. Participants practiced increasingly complex speeded tasks on a computer.</description>

        <title>Changes in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Difficulty From Baseline to Year 10</title>
        <description>The self-reported measure of everyday IADL function was the summation of the IADL difficulty sub-scores from the Minimum Dataset - Home Care (MDS-HC) which assesses performance in the past 7 days on 19 daily tasks spanning meal preparation, housework, finances, health care, telephone, shopping, travel, and need for assistance in dressing, personal hygiene, and bathing. For the analysis, the reversed score was used and the possible range of the reversed everyday IADL function outcome is 0 to 38. Higher values for the reversed scores represent a better outcome. Changes in outcome were computed as &quot;10 year minus baseline&quot; and the negative values indicate the decline from baseline.</description>

        <description>Everyday Speed of processing was computed as the summation of Complex Reaction Time (CRT) and Timed IADL (TIADL). For the analysis, the reversed score was used and the possible range of the reversed everyday speed of processing outcome is -3 to 100. Higher values for the reversed scores represent a better outcome. Changes in outcome were computed as &quot;10 year minus baseline&quot; and the negative values indicate the decline from baseline.</description>
