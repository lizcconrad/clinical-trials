      Colorectal cancer is a major health concern in the Western world with an estimated lifetime
      risk of 5-6%. The goal of achieving effective cancer prevention is driven by the prediction
      that CRC will become the leading cause of death (surpassing heart disease) in this decade,
      with an estimated 1,000,000 new cases and over 500,000 deaths per year, worldwide. Despite
      continuing advances in diagnosis and therapy, long-term survival rates have not improved
      significantly over the last four decades. Nearly 50% of all CRC patients will die of the
      disease. Preventive strategies offer the best hope, at least until our understanding of the
      biology of cancer matures to the point where it can be implemented into therapy. The search
      for new chemopreventive compounds with minimal toxicity raises particular interest in
      phytochemicals.Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a natural compound derived from the rhizome of
      Curcuma Longa, an East Indian plant, commonly called turmeric. It has been shown to possess
      potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, for which it has a long history of
      dietary use as a food additive. Curcumin has also a potent anti-proliferative effects against
      a variety of cancer cell lines in vitro, which stem from its ability to modulate many
      intracellular signal transduction pathways. Human phase I-II studies found curcumin to be
      safe, and indicated no dose-limiting toxicity when taken by mouth at doses up to 10 g/day.
      This data, together with the dismal therapeutic options available for colon cancer patients,
      suggest that curcumin warrants investigation in this setting. The present study evaluates
      gemcitabine in combination with curcumin and celecoxib for patients with colon cancer.

      The primary end point of the study is time to tumor progression. The study is designed to
      detect increase in median time to tumor progression from 2.7 months to 4.0 months, with 80%
      power at a significance level of 5%. This requires approximately 100 patients. The median
      time to tumor progression of 2.7 months was found in the Investigational New Drug (IND)
      treatment program for gemcitabine, which enrolled 3023 patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic colon cance
