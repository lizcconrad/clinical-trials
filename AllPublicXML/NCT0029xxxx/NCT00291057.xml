  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous phase II study, the safety and efficacy of a novel formulation of malathion
      0.5% was evaluated in patients 2 years of age and older. Based on the results of that study,
      this formulation is currently in a phase III study for that population.

      The current study will use blood markers and clinical evaluations to determine the safety and
      tolerability of this formulation when used in children 6-24 months of age.
