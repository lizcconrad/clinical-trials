      In patients with hypertension who undergo elective PCI, the effects of long-term
      administration of Calblock (azelnidipine) on plaque volume will be determined quantitatively
      by 3D-IVUS and compared with those of amlodipine besilate (Norvasc or Amlodin).

      Clinical studies have demonstrated that calcium antagonists can reduce cardiovascular events
      in patients with coronary artery disease. Recently, suppression of the development of
      coronary atherosclerotic plaque by calcium antagonists has been reported as one of the
      mechanisms involved. Thus, calcium antagonists have been promising strategy for preventing
      the progression of the coronary atherosclerosis. Various calcium antagonists are clinically
      available at present and these drugs may differ from each other with respect to the
      anti-atherosclerotic effects. Consequently, we plan to perform the ALPS-J study to compare
      the effects of two long-acting calcium antagonists, azelnidipine and amlodipine, on plaque
      quantitatively by IVUS. In this study, azelnidipine (16 mg/day) or amlodipine besilate (5
      mg/day) will be administered to patients with hypertension for 48 weeks after elective PCI.
      The plaque volume will be measured in each patient by IVUS at the time of PCI and 48 weeks
      after PCI. Percent change in plaque volume from the baseline value will be used as the
      primary endpoints for evaluation of efficacy. We plan to enroll 100 patients in each group
      for a total of 200 patients.
