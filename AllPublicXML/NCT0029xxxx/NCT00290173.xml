  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial comparing the efficacy of oral ritodrine in the form of sustained release
      capsules for the maintenance of uterine quiescence after successfully treated episode of
      threatened preterm labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We randomized 120 women with singleton pregnancy who were successfully treated for threatened
      preterm labor before 34 completed weeks to receive either maintenance tocolysis with two 40
      mg ritodrine sustained release capsules three times a day (study group, n=62) or no treatment
      (control group, n=58) for three days. The primary outcome measure was the recurrent episode
      of threatened preterm labor within 72 hours, which was defined as regular palpable uterine
      contractions and change in cervical effacement and/or cervical dilatation on clinical
      examination. Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of preterm birth, neonatal
      adverse outcomes, and maternal side effects.
