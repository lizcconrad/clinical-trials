  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of a specific immunomodulatory
      principle (QbG10) together with conventional grass pollen allergen leads to a more rapid and
      more pronounced decrease of sensitivity against pollen than with the grass pollen allergen
      alone

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 to 65 years of age

          -  Mild to moderate seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to sensitization against
             grass pollen as evident from history (≥ 2 years), and positive nasal provocation test

             pollen extract

          -  Female participants must meet one of the following criteria:

        serum FSH will be determined and must be &gt;40 U/mL), hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,
        or tubal ligation. Patient agrees to consistently practice an effective and accepted method
        of contraception throughout the duration of the study and for 1 additional months after the
        last immunization (hormone-based, or intrauterine device, or double barrier contraception,
