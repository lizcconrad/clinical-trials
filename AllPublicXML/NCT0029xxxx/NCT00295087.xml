    <textblock>
      Women who are affected with premature ovarian failure will exhibit skewed X-chromosome
      inactivation patterns compared to women with normal menstrual function (as defined by being
      pregnant), indicating a possible X-chromosome defect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian failure (POF) affects approximately 1% of women. For most women a cause is
      not found, but structural abnormalities of the X-chromosome commonly lead to POF, suggesting
      genes on the X-chromosome are necessary for normal ovarian function. It is known that certain
      gene mutations on the X-chromosome can lead to changes in the normal random pattern of
      X-chromosome inactivation in females.

      We propose to study X-inactivation patterns in a cohort of women with idiopathic POF, and
      compare their pattern to a mean age-matched cohort of women with normal menstrual function.

      We hypothesize that some women with POF will show skewed X-inactivation, suggesting a
      mutation on the X-chromosome as the etiology of their POF.
