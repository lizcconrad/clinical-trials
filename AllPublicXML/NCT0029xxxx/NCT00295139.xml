      The main purpose of this study is to determine if the multifaceted treatment for substance
      abuse in dual disordered patients is more effective in reducing drug use than a supportive
      control treatment. The researchers will also determine if adding a case management component
      (Critical Time Intervention; CTI) to the intervention will increase treatment engagement and
      retention.

      Drug and alcohol abuse by people with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) is one of
      the most significant problems facing the public mental health system. We have been conducting
      a project to develop a multifaceted treatment for substance abuse in dual disordered patients
      (Behavioral Treatment for Substance Abuse in Schizophrenia; BTSAS). Results have shown that
      the treatment is well-accepted by patients and has a significant effect on drug use. While
      BTSAS has been effective at retaining subjects and fostering reduced drug use, a major
      problem that occurred was low rates of engagement. The main purpose of this study is to
      determine if BTSAS is more effective in reducing drug use than a supportive control treatment
      and to determine if adding a case management component (Critical Time Intervention; CTI) will
      increase treatment engagement and retention in BTSAS.

    <description>Multifaceted treatment for substance abuse in dual disordered patients which contains 6 components: 1) a urinalysis contingency to enhance motivation to change and increase the salience of goals; 2) structured goal setting to identify realistic, short term goals for decreased substance use; 3) motivational interviewing to enhance motivation to reduce use; 4) social skills and drug refusal skills to enable development of relationships with people who do not use drugs, and to provide success experiences that can increase self-efficacy for change; 5) education about the reasons for substance use and the particular dangers of substance use for people with SPMI; and 6) relapse prevention training that focuses on behavioral skills for coping with urges and dealing with high risk situations and lapses. BTSAS is specifically structured to reduce the load on memory and attention, and minimize demands on higher level cognitive processes.</description>
