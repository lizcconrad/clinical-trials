  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial of Serostim® (mammalian cell-derived recombinant human
      growth hormone, r-hGH) versus placebo in subjects with human immunodeficiency
      virus-associated adipose tissue redistribution syndrome (HARS).

      The primary study objective is to determine whether Serostim® treatment reduces adipose
      tissue maldistribution more effectively than placebo. The primary co-endpoints are derived
      from measures of visceral adipose tissue assessed by computerized tomography (CT) and the
      ratio of trunk; and limb fat assessed by dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.
      Anthropometric measures, physical exams, quality of life assessments, serial photographs, and
      various laboratory measures will be used to address secondary objectives. These secondary
      objectives relate to the impact of Serostim® on Physician and subject assessments of change
      in body shape, health-related quality of life, attitude towards medication compliance,
      metabolic markers, fat redistribution, and safety.

      On Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive daily Serostim®,
      Serostim® and placebo given on alternate days, or daily placebo. Serostim® doses will be
      based on body weight, with a maximum dose of 4 milligram (mg).

      Therapy will continue for 12 weeks. Treatment will then be altered and the new treatment will
      be continued through Week 24. Interim Study Visits will be required at Weeks 2 and 4
      (Treatment Period 1) and at Weeks 14 and 16 (Treatment Period 2). Subjects will be offered to
      be enrolled into a maintenance Protocol (Study 23056) at Week 24.
