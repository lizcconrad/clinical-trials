    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is associated with neurocognitive impairment, diminished life satisfaction,
      lack of independence, and poor functioning in social, occupational and other desired and
      expected community roles. The personal, social and economic costs of this illness are
      enormous. Neurocognitive deficits (e.g., slowed thinking, poor attention and memory,
      inadequate problem solving) are now recognized as core features of the illness, and primary
      contributors to functional impairment among patients (Bellack, Gold &amp; Buchanan; 1999; Green,
      1996). While standard antipsychotic medications improve psychotic symptomatology in many
      patients, their impact on neurocognition is modest, at best, and dramatic functional deficits
      remain even after adequate pharmacological treatment (Keefe et al., 1999). Hence, there is
      growing interest in alternative treatment strategies to address cognitive deficits, including
      computer-assisted cognitive remediation.

      The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of a computer-assisted cognitive
      remediation program we have developed: Computer Assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR). Fifty
      individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders will be recruited and randomly assigned
      to one of two conditions: a) 36 sessions of CACR; or b) 36 sessions of a manualized computer
      control condition (RC). The efficacy of CACR will be assessed on behavioral performance in
      three dimensions: (1) on the trained learning exercises, (2) on neuropsychological measures,
      and (3) on role play based assessments of everyday problem solving. We hypothesize that CACR
      will be more effective than the control treatment in each domain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV
             criteria

          2. Age 18 through 50

          3. Subjects will be clinically stable as judged by current outpatient or inpatient
             treatment staff

          4. Primary psychiatric medication is a new generation antipsychotic other than Clozapine
             and/or a dose of first generation antipsychotic equivalent to 10 mg. of less of
             haloperidol for one month prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented history of organic brain disease

          2. Documented history of mental retardation

          3. Physical limitations (e.g., with hearing or vision) that would interfere substantially
             with use of computer-based exercises

          4. Diagnosis of current Substance Dependence according to DSM-IV criteria

          5. Participation in the prior full trial of this remediation program (this exclusion is
             meant to apply to individuals participating in the full controlled trial, and not to
             individuals participating in the preliminary sub-study).
