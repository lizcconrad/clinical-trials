      Aim 1. To compare across three hospital sites the effects on health and cost outcomes
      observed by the following three interventions, each designed to enhance adaptation and
      improve outcomes of hospitalized cognitively impaired elders and their caregivers:

        1. augmented standard care (ASC) - standard hospital and, if referred, home care plus early
           identification of CI during the patients' hospitalization by trained registered nurses
           (RNs) with immediate feedback to patients' primary nurses, attending physicians and
           discharge planners;

        2. resource nurse care (RNC) - standard hospital and, if referred, home care plus early
           identification of CI during the patient's hospitalization by trained RNs and hospital
           care by RNs trained in the use of expert clinical guidelines developed to enhance the
           care management of hospitalized cognitively impaired elders and to facilitate their
           transition from hospital to home; or,

        3. advanced practice nurse care (APNC) - standard hospital care plus transitional (hospital
           to home) care substituting for standard home care and provided by APNs with advanced
           training in the management of CI patients using an evidence-based protocol designed
           specifically for this patient group and their caregivers.

      [H1] We hypothesize that health and cost outcomes with APNC, a comprehensive intervention
      designed to meet the unique needs of cognitively impaired older adults hospitalized for an
      acute medical or surgical event and their caregivers will be associated, relative to health
      and cost outcomes with ASC and RNC, with improvement in patient, caregiver and cost outcomes.

      [H2] We hypothesize that improvements in patient, caregiver and cost outcomes observed for
      the RNC group will be greater than those observed for the ASC group.

      Aim 2. To compare within each site and over time, health and cost outcomes (identified in Aim
      1) from patients treated with either ASC or RNC, both relatively lower intensity
      interventions, with the outcomes of patients at the same site observed after switching to
      APNC, a high intensity intervention.

      [H3] We hypothesize that compared to patients receiving the ASC or the RNC interventions,
      patients at the same site will have improved patient, caregiver and cost outcomes after the
      site switches to APNC.

      [H4] We hypothesize that patient, caregiver and cost outcomes achieved by the groups
      receiving APNC interventions at T1 and T2 will be similar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment (CI) is a major health problem complicating the care of increasing
      numbers of older adults hospitalized for an acute medical or surgical condition. Dementia and
      delirium, the most common causes of CI among these elders, is associated with higher
      mortality rates, increased morbidity and higher health care costs. A growing body of science
      suggests that these patients and their caregivers are particularly vulnerable to systems of
      care that either do not recognize or ignore their needs. The consequences are devastating for
      the patients and their caregivers and add tremendous burden to hospital staffs coping with a
      severe shortage of nurses. For these reasons, the Institute of Medicine identified improved
      care management of this patient group as a national priority for action. Unfortunately,
      little evidence is available to guide optimal care of this patient group or to address the
      unique needs of their caregivers. Collectively, available evidence suggests that these
      patients may benefit from interventions aimed at improving management of CI, comorbid
      conditions or both but the exact nature and intensity of intervention needed to effectively
      and efficiently improve their outcomes and those of their caregivers is not known. Thus, the
      timing is excellent for rigorous research aimed at identifying care management strategies
      that will result in high quality, cost-effective outcomes for this challenging patient group
      and their caregivers.
