  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an immuno-mediated skin disorder, which affects about 2-3% of the population
      worldwide. For moderate-severe forms of psoriasis systemic immunosuppression is the treatment
      of choice. This clinical trial was initiated to compare the safety and effectiveness of
      mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine A for the treatment of psoriasis. Patients are
      randomized to receive either 2.5 mg/kg BW cyclosporine A or 1 g bid mycophenolate mofetil. If
      after six weeks no decrease in the PASI score occures cyclosporine A doses are increased to 5
      mg/kg BW for additional six weeks. In the other arm mycophenolate mofetil is increased to 1 g
      tid for additional six weeks.
