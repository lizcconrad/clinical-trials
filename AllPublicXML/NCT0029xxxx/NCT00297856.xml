  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-licensure studies of GSK Biologicals' Boostrix速 have shown it to be generally safe and
      well-tolerated. This post-licensure study is designed to evaluate relatively uncommon/rare
      outcomes in a large population cohort. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to
      comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
