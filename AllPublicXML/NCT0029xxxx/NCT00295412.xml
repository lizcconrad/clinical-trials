  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lifetime of substance use disorders in schizophrenia is close to 50%. Substance abuse in
      schizophrenia is associated with negative consequences. Unfortunately, there no clear
      guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of this dual diagnosis population. Preliminary
      results suggest that second-generation antipsychotic drugs (mainly clozapine) may relieve
      drug cravings in schizophrenia. We performed a 12-week pilot study to evaluate the impact of
      quetiapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, on substance abuse parameters, psychiatric
      symptoms and side effects in patients schizophrenia and comorbid substance use disorders. Our
      expectation was a 20 % decrease in drug cravings from baseline to end-point.
