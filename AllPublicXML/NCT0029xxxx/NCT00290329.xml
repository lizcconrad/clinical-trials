    <description>Assessed solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling spreading beyond 30 millimeters (mm) of injection site (Mencevax ACWY 2-5 YOA Group) and beyond 50 millimeters (mm) of injection site (Mencevax ACWY 6-17 YOA Group and Mencevax ACWY ≥ 18 YOA Group).</description>

    <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were drowsiness, fever [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above (≥) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)], irritability and loss of appetite. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 drowsiness = drowsiness that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = fever &gt; 39.0 °C. Grade 3 irritability = crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite = not eating at all. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

Any = occurrence of the symptom reported irrespective of intensity grade and causal relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 symptom = symptom that prevented normal activity.
