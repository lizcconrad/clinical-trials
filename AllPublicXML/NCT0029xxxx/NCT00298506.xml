      1. To assess the efficacy of FK506 combined with MMF vs intravenous CTX pulses in treatment
           of class Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅴ + Ⅳ or Ⅴ + Ⅲ LN.

        2. To investigate the safety and tolerability of FK506 combined with MMF vs intravenous CTX
           pulses in the treatment of class Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅴ + Ⅳ or Ⅴ + Ⅲ LN.

        3. To explore the dosing of FK506 combined with MMF and their effective range of blood
           concentration.
