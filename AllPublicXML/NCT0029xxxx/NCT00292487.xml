      The purpose of the study is to compare the incidence of contrast induced nephrotoxicity
      following the administration of Isovue or Visipaque in patients with mild to moderate renal
      impairment who undergo a clinically indicated IV contrast-enhanced (multidetector computed
      tomography) MDCT of the liver or MDCT angiography of the lower extremities. Serum Creatinine
      (SCr) will be measured before and up to 48-72 hours post dose.
