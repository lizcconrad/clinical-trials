  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will identify patients with infections commonly observed in transplant recipients,
      describe the epidemiology of their infection, study the risk factors associated with various
      infections and examine strategies of early diagnosis and prevention of infection
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following variables will be followed: time and location of positive cultures, underlying
      diseases and severity of illness, recent immunomodulative therapies, physical exam findings,
      previous medical surgical conditions, microbiology and virology culture results, laboratory
      and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage of onset of infection, microbiological data and
      resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism identified, suspected source of
      infection, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information, pathology
      and histology results, summaries of admissions, discharges, operations, death, medications,
      clinical outcome gender, height, weight, ethnicity, date of transplant, type of transplant,
      primary diagnosis, and past medical history. Also required are medical summaries of
      admissions, discharges, operations, and deaths

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.
