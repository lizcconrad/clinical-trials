        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Previously diagnosis of multiple myeloma as determined by any two of the major
             criteria, or major criteria 1 plus minor criteria b, c, or d, or major criteria 3 plus
             minor criteria a or c, or minor criteria a, b and c or a, b, and d.

             Major criteria:

               -  Plasmacytomas on tissue biopsy

               -  Bone marrow plasmacytomas (&gt;30% plasma cells)

               -  Monoclonal immunoglobulin spike on serum electrophoresis immunoglobulin G (IgG)
                  &gt;3.5 g/dl or immunoglobulin A (IGA) &gt; 2.0 g/dl; kappa or lambda light chain
                  excretion &gt; 1 g/day on 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis

             Minor criteria:

               1. Bone marrow plasmacytomas (10 to 30% plasma cells)

               2. Monoclonal immunoglobulin present but of lesser magnitude than given under major
                  criteria

               3. Lytic bone lesions

               4. Normal IgM &lt; 50 mg/dl, IgA &lt; 100 mg/dl, or IgG &lt; 600 mg/dl

          2. Has relapsed or refractory disease as determined by the following:

             Relapsed disease:

             • Disease progression developed following the achievement of at least stable disease
             or better to an anti-myeloma regimen.

             Refractory disease:

             • Disease progression developed during therapy with an anti-myeloma regimen prior to
             the achievement of at least stable disease or better. Includes the development of
             disease progression during maintenance or consolidation therapy with glucocorticoids
             or cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          3. Age &gt; 18 at signing of informed consent.

          4. ECOG performance status 0-2.

          5. Renal function 1.5 x upper limit normal (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], serum creatinine

          6. Liver function ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (total bilirubin, SGOT (AST) and SGPT
             (ALT) values).

          7. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum
             -human chorionic gonadotropin, -HCG); men and women of reproductive potential must
             employ effective contraceptive methods while on study therapy, and for 1 month
             following completion of treatment.

          8. Signed IRB-approved informed consent by patient prior to all study related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of a prior malignancy with in the last 3 years with the exception of resected
             basal cell carcinoma, in situ cervical cancer at any time or other resected
             malignancies with no evidence of recurrence 5 or more years since diagnosis.

          2. Patients with a hemoglobin count of &lt; 8.0 g/dl, platelet count of &lt; 50,000 cells/mm3,
             or an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt; 1000 cells/mm3.

          3. Serious infection, medical condition, or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, places the subject at unacceptable risk or might interfere with the
             achievement of the study objectives.

          4. Chronic viral infection: positive hepatitis B or hepatitis C serology, known positive
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or human T-leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV).

             the initiation of study medication.

          7. Treatment with chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma or any
             investigational agent within 6 weeks of study entry.
