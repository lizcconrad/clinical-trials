  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The expression of transporters involved in bile acid homeostasis is differentially regulated
      during obstructive cholestasis. Bile acids are also substrates of the drug efflux transporter
      breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) that is highly expressed in the human intestine.
      Therefore we intend to analyze whether intestinal BCRP expression could be altered during
      cholestasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BCRP is capable of transport bile acids and may indicate that this transporter is involved in
      bile acid homeostasis. As an efflux pump, it could protect the enterocytes from potential
      toxic bile acid concentrations. During cholestasis, where the enterohepatic circulation is
      disrupted, there occurs an adaptive regulation of transporters for bile acids, bilirubin and
      cholesterol. These changes take place in liver, kidney, as well as in the intestine.

      Using real-time RT-PCR analysis we determine BCRP mRNA expression levels in duodenal tissue
      of healthy subjects and cholestatic patients. BCRP protein levels will be determined by
      immunohistochemistry.

      Healthy subjects and cholestatic patients are enrolled in the study after giving informed
      consent. Control subjects with an indication for a gastrointestinal tract endoscopy within a
      cancer-screening program and patients with obstructive cholestasis with an interventional
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are included in this study. During
      endoscopy four biopsy specimens are obtained from the distal part of the duodenum. Biopsies
      are immediately stored at –70°C until further processing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  clinical diagnosis of obstructive cholestasis (obstructive jaundice was defined on the
             basis of chemical parameters (bilirubin, g-glutamyltransferase, and alkaline
             phosphatase) and on imaging procedures (ultrasound and ERCP) demonstrating a dilated
             bile duct system)
