  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric consultation and short-term follow-up will produce equivalent clinical outcomes
      and be less costly when provided via videoconferencing (telepsychiatry) than when provided
      in-person.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We predict that patients referred by their family physician for a psychiatric consultation
      and, if needed, short-term follow-up will have equivalent clinical outcomes when seen via
      telepsychiatry as compared to those patients seen in-person. We also predicted that
      telepsychiatry will be cheaper than in-person care.Study Design: a single-centre equivalence
      trial.We will use a sample size calculation and analytical methods that are specifically
      tailored for equivalence trials.
