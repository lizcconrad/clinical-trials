    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel group, international
      study in approximately 750 patients with active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who are naive to
      Methotrexate (MTX) therapy. Rheumatoid Factor (RF)-positive and RF-negative patients will be
      enrolled and will be allocated equally between 3 treatment arms.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) From Screening at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of progression in structural joint damage (PJD) by change in Total Modified Sharp Score (TMSS) from screening to Week 52 in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population. TMSS is the sum of the erosion score (ES) and the joint space narrowing (JSN) score and has a range of 0 to 398. The ES is the sum of joint scores collected for 46 joints and has a range of 0 to 230. The JSN is the sum of joint scores collected for 42 joints and has a range of 0 to 168. A score of 0 would indicate no change and higher scores represent a worsening of joint erosions and joint space narrowing.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score From Baseline at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) From Screening at Week 52</title>
        <description>Rate of progression in structural joint damage (PJD) by change in Total Modified Sharp Score (TMSS) from screening to Week 52 in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population. TMSS is the sum of the erosion score (ES) and the joint space narrowing (JSN) score and has a range of 0 to 398. The ES is the sum of joint scores collected for 46 joints and has a range of 0 to 230. The JSN is the sum of joint scores collected for 42 joints and has a range of 0 to 168. A score of 0 would indicate no change and higher scores represent a worsening of joint erosions and joint space narrowing.</description>

        <description>Percentage of patients without radiographic progression at Week 52, defined as change in total modified Sharp score (TMSS) &lt;= 0. TMSS is the sum of the erosion score (ES) and the joint space narrowing (JSN) score and has a range of 0 to 398. The ES is the sum of joint scores collected for 46 joints and has a range of 0 to 230. The JSN is the sum of joint scores collected for 42 joints and has a range of 0 to 168. A score of 0 would indicate no change.</description>

          <description>The modified total sharp score is the sum of the erosion score (ES) and the joint space narrowing (JSN) score and has a range of 0 to 398. The ES is the sum of joint scores collected for 46 joints and has a range of 0 to 230. The JSN is the sum of joint scores collected for 42 joints and has a range of 0 to 168. A score of 0 would indicate no change and higher scores represent a worsening of joint erosions and joint space narrowing.</description>

        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) is a patient completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip,and common daily activities. Each domain has at least two component questions. There are four possible responses for each component ranging from 0(without any difficulty) to 4 (unable to do).HAQ-DI=sum of worst scores in each domain divided by the number of domains answered. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a questionnaire used to assess physical functioning and is made up of eight domains: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health. Transforming and standardizing these domains leads to the calculation of the Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Summary measures. Scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.
Means are adjusted for baseline value, Rheumatoid Factor status and region.</description>

It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities. Each domain has at least two component questions. There are four possible responses for each component on a scale of 0 (without difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). Higher scores=greater dysfunction.

          <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) is a patient completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities. Each domain has at least two component questions. There are four possible responses for each component on a scale of 0 (without difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). Higher scores=greater dysfunction.
Improved:HAQ-DI score change &lt;=-0.22 Unchanged:HAQ-DI score change -0.22 to 0.22 Worsened:HAQ score =&gt; 0.22</description>

        <description>MCID is defined as a change from baseline in SF-36 Physical Health Component Score of &gt;5.42.
SF-36 is a questionnaire used to assess physical functioning and is made up of eight domains: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health. Transforming and standardizing these domains leads to the calculation of the Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Summary measures. Scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
