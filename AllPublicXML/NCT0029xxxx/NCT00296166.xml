  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patents with atrial fibrillation can be treated with the purpose of curing the
      arrhythmia.This may be achieved by catheter ablation and Maze surgery where the latter
      includes open heart surgery.

      By catheter ablation the arrhythmia can be cured in about 70 % of patients who have episodes
      of atrial fibrillation. In patients with permanent atrial fibrillation the results are not as
      good.

      We will compare a conventional ablation approach where lesions are created on the inside of
      the heart with a thoracoscopic approach where the lesions are created from the outside of the
      heart.

      Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation will be considered for randomisation Patients
      will be randomised to either conventional endocardial catheter ablation or epicardial
      thoracoscopic ablation.

      Objectives of study:

      Primary endpoint:presence of sinus rhythm after 6 months Secondary endpoints: complications,
      cost-effectiveness, structural changes (evaluated by echocardiography), p-BNP and
      inflammatory markers, atrial fibrillation burden evaluated by Holter monitoring

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Patients with permanent AF are seldomly symptomatic enough to justify intervention. We decided
    to stop inclusion due to low recruitment rate.
