    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, portable telerehabilitation
      system for physical therapy of the upper limb after stroke or traumatic brain injury. The
      system is based on the use of a commercially available force feedback joystick and will work
      with an ordinary home PC and a standard high-speed internet connection. Using the joystick,
      the patient will perform exercises designed to aid in recovering motor function of the hand
      and arm. The joystick will be programmed to either assist or resist the patient's movements.
      The system will include sophisticated analysis of patient status and progress to provide the
      therapist and physician with detailed information. In the first phase of the study, we will
      develop the system in cooperation with the physical therapy staff and other rehabilitation
      specialists. The investigators will examine the usability, comfort, safety and therapeutic
      benefit of the system. In the second phase of the study, the investigators will employ the
      system in patients' homes, using the internet to connect to rehabilitation specialists in the
      clinic. The study hypothesis is that it is possible to adapt commercially available, low cost
      gaming equipment such as force feedback joysticks to provide therapy for patients in their
      own homes, and that patients will be able to work with this system and will find it enjoyable
      and helpful for recovering motor function.
