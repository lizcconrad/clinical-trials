    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial of atomoxetine (1.8
      mg/kg) for the management of chemotherapy-related acquired attentional disorders in children
      who have survived Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. Atomoxetine will produce a favorable impact on
      ADHD symptoms in children with chemo-related acquired attentional disorders.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      atomoxetine as determined by the change in the ADHD-RS-IV Total score compared to placebo in
      the symptomatic treatment of patients diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
      (by DSM-IV ADHD-NOS criteria) occurring as a neuropsychological late-effect of chemotherapy
      used to treat Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL).

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. to assess the effect of once daily (AM) dosing of atomoxetine (1.8mg/kg) compared to
           placebo on ADHD symptoms as measured by:

             -  ADHD-RS Total score inclusive of subtypes for inattention, hyperactivity and
                combined subtypes.

             -  Clinical Global Impression-ADHD

        2. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine compared with placebo based on
           treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, physical
           examinations, and ECGs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 6-18 years

          -  Must have successfully completed treatment for ALL and are currently 1-year &quot;disease
             free&quot; as judged by the investigators.

          -  Must meet DSM-IV criteria for &quot;ADHD-NOS.( Attachment A) The attention deficit symptoms
             have been precipitated by chemotherapy-related neurological injury. Therefore, the
             DSM-IV category is ADHD-NOS.

          -  Must have an Investigator-completed ADHD-RS total and/or subscale score of ≥1.5
             standard deviations above age/gender norm.

          -  Laboratory results, including chemistries, hematology, and urinalysis do not
             demonstrate clinically significant abnormalities.

          -  ECG demonstrates no clinically significant abnormalities

          -  Educational level and degree of understanding of the patient and their parents permit
             suitable communication between the investigators and study coordinators.

          -  Subjects and parents are judged to be reliable to keep appointments.

          -  Must be able to swallow tablets.

          -  Must have demonstrated compliance during their chemotherapy program.

          -  Must weigh &gt; 20 kg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have relapsed or are having re-occurring symptoms/signs of ALL.

          -  Have had substantial exposure to radiation therapy (&gt;2000: cGy) since high dose
             radiation treatment is associated with neurocognitive deficits or be &quot;treatment
             resistant&quot; pharmacologically.

          -  Past exposure to atomoxetine.

          -  ADHD symptoms or treatment prior to the diagnosis of ALL

          -  Documented bipolar disorder, psychosis, affective disorder.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Suicide risk.

          -  Seizure disorders (except history of febrile seizures).

          -  Histories of multiple drug allergies.

          -  Histories of alcohol or substance abuse.

          -  Prior or current medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigators, could
             be exacerbated by atomoxetine.

          -  Sympathomimetic overactivity such as catecholamine secreting tumor.

          -  Use of MAOI medications.

          -  Have taken psychostimulants one week prior to randomization.
