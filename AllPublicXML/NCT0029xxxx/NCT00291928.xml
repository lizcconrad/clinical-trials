  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is primarily to investigate the safety profile of HuMax-CD20 in
      patients with active RA. Furthermore, the trial is designed to identify the dose levels to be
      used in future trials (based on evaluations of safety, pharmacokinetics and ACR and DAS
      responses).

      This trial consists of a double-blind, placebo controlled, dose escalation part with
      randomization to trial treatment within each of three sequential cohorts (Part A), and a
      parallel group part with randomization into one of four treatment arms (Part B). Patients in
      Parts A and B will receive two infusions of either HuMax-CD20 (300 mg, 700 mg, or 1000 mg) or
      placebo and will be followed for safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic measurements for 24
      weeks. Hereafter patients will be followed every 12 weeks until B-cells (CD19+ cells) have
      returned to baseline levels. For patients in Part B, the follow-up visits at 36 and 48 weeks
      after initial trial treatment (Follow-up Visits 1 and 2) will include additional measurements
      of safety and efficacy.
