  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of one-hour infusions
      given once daily for 5 consecutive days in a 21-day treatment cycle; to define a recommended
      phase 2 dose; and to learn more about the clinical activity of SNS-032.

      Other objectives of this study include measuring pharmacokinetics (how long the drug can be
      measured in the body), preliminary evaluation of biomarkers to see how the levels of certain
      proteins change after administration of SNS-032; assessment of the effects of SNS-032 on QT
      interval.
