  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selectins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced
      kidney injury and resultant delayed graft function (DGF). PSGL-1 is a ligand for P-, E-, and
      L-selectin. It has been reported that YSPSL (rPSGL-Ig) blocks P-selectin and, to a lesser
      degree, E- and L-selectin. Both sPSGL-1 and YSPSL (rPSGL-Ig) have been shown in animal models
      to reduce both cytokines and tissue damage associated with ischemia reperfusion and to
      improve renal function post-transplant. Therefore, the current phase I/II clinical study is
      designed to assess the safety and efficacy of YSPSL (rPSGL-Ig) in preventing DGF in patients
      undergoing cadaveric kidney transplants and to determine a dose for future pivotal studies.

      This will be a multicenter, single-dose, dose-escalation study. The study will be in 2 parts:
      the first, Part A, will be an open label evaluation of single doses of four dose cohorts; the
      second, Part B will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study of
      two dose cohorts. Patients who are undergoing cadaveric kidney transplantation and are at
      risk for development of DGF, based upon known risk factors, will be eligible to participate
      in the study. A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled in Part A. 60 patients will be
      enrolled in Part B.
