  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycine is a natural amino acid neurotransmitter that acts as a co-agonist at NMDA receptors
      in brain. We hypothesize that symptoms of the schizophrenia prodrome will improve with
      glycine to a greater degree than with placebo.

    <measure>Scale of Prodromal Symptoms Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Scale Of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) is a 19-item instrument. The SOPS is comprised of symptoms that are classified as falling into four pathology domains: positive, negative, disorganized and general. The scales identify and measure five attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, six negative symptoms, four disorganization symptoms and four general symptoms. These seven-point scales cover severity variance in the subpsychotic or attenuated range. Each item is scaled 0-6, with 0-2 being the normal range, 3-5 being the risk syndrome range, and 6 being severe and psychotic for the positive symptoms and very severe for the other symptoms. The higher the score, the more symptoms an individual has and is therefore negative in its interpretation. The severity of the prodromal state is judged according to the sum of the ratings from each of the SOPS items and can range from 0 to 114. Actual SOPS total scores in this study ranged from 23 to 59 across subjects at baseline.</description>

The higher the score, the more symptoms an individual has and is therefore negative in its interpretation. The severity of the prodromal state is judged according to the sum of the ratings from each of the SOPS items and can range from 0 to 114. Actual SOPS total scores in this study ranged from 23 to 59 across subjects at baseline.</description>

            <description>Glycine dosing was fixed at an initial dose of 0.2 g/kg q.h.s for 3 days, then 0.2 g/kg b.i.d. for 4 days, then 0.2 g/kg in the a.m. and 0.4 g/kg in the p.m. for 4 days, and finally 0.4 g/kg b.i.d. Subjects weighing &gt; 100 kg were limited to a total daily dose of 80 g daily.
Glycine and placebo were dispensed under IND 33,515 (DCJ) as one of two proprietary formulations developed by Glytech, Inc. Dosing was initiated with small microencapsulated beads or “sprinkles” (80% glycine by weight), with placebo consisting of microencapsulated sucrose. Recommended administration of the sprinkles was to spoon them onto pudding or applesauce and swallow them with minimal chewing.

Recommended administration of the sprinkles was to spoon them onto pudding or applesauce and swallow them with minimal chewing. Since earlier product testing by Glytech revealed that a few individuals did not like the somewhat granular texture of the sprinkles, subjects could switch to a second Glytech formulation, consisting of proprietary pre-flavored glycine or sugar powders to be dissolved in 8 ounces of water.

          <title>Change in Scale of Prodromal Symptoms Total Score</title>
          <description>Scale Of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) is a 19-item instrument. The SOPS is comprised of symptoms that are classified as falling into four pathology domains: positive, negative, disorganized and general. The scales identify and measure five attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, six negative symptoms, four disorganization symptoms and four general symptoms. These seven-point scales cover severity variance in the subpsychotic or attenuated range. Each item is scaled 0–6, with 0–2 being the normal range, 3–5 being the risk syndrome range, and 6 being severe and psychotic for the positive symptoms and very severe for the other symptoms. The higher the score, the more symptoms an individual has and is therefore negative in its interpretation. The severity of the prodromal state is judged according to the sum of the ratings from each of the SOPS items and can range from 0 to 114. Actual SOPS total scores in this study ranged from 23 to 59 across subjects at baseline.</description>
