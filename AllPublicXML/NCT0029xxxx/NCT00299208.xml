      The goal of this study is to develop a safe, well tolerated, and highly efficacious
      azithromycin combination treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Azithromycin is a
      drug that has shown potential for malaria treatment. It will be combined with other malaria
      drugs currently approved for treatment in Thailand. About 120 people, ages 20-65, will be
      enrolled in Thailand. Participants will have severe cases of malaria and they will be
      hospitalized 28 days for treatment.

      The study is aimed at identifying a well tolerated, practical and highly efficacious
      treatment regimen of azithromycin in combination with artesunate or quinine for uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria for future studies, to monitor for the tolerability and safety of these
      combination regimens and to compare tolerability, safety and efficacy of azithromycin when
      given in combination with artesunate as compared to quinine. This study is also aimed at
      comparing tolerability, safety and efficacy of the combination of artesunate and azithromycin
      when given as a single daily dose (200mg As+1000mg Az) for 3 days as compared to 2 doses of
      100mg As+750mg Az per day for 3 days and to compare the tolerability, safety and efficacy of
      the combination of quinine and azithromycin when given as 3 daily doses of quinine (10mg/kg)
      + Az 500mg vs. 2 daily doses of quinine (10mg/kg) + Az 750mg when given for 3 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute symptomatic falciparum malaria infection as determined by malaria smear with a
             parasite density of 100 to 100,000 asexual parasites/µL with fever, defined as
             &gt;37.5ºC, during the current illness, or history (within the last 48 hours) of fever.

          2. Age: 20-65 years old

          3. Male or female. All females are required to have a negative human chorionic
             gonadotropic (hCG) pregnancy test (urine). All females of childbearing potential (not
             surgically sterile, or less than two years post menopausal) are required to use an
             acceptable method of contraception, such as implant, injectable, oral contraceptive(s)
             with additional barrier contraception, intrauterine device, sexual abstinence, or
             vasectomized partner, throughout the study.

          4. Written informed consent obtained.

          5. Willing to stay hospitalized for 28 days for treatment and observations.

          6. Otherwise healthy outpatients (with no other clinically-significant illnesses as
             described in Exclusion Criteria, #6).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential who do not use an
             acceptable method of contraception (as described in Inclusion Criteria, #3).

          2. Mixed malaria infection on admission by malaria smear.

          3. A previous state of intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study drugs quinine,
             artesunate, or azithromycin or to drugs with similar chemical structures (quinidine,
             any artemisinin derivative, and macrolides such as erythromycin).

          4. Malaria drug therapy administered in the past 30 days by history (quinine,
             chloroquine, mefloquine, artemisinin derivatives, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine,
             lumefantrine).

          5. Previous participation in this trial, or participation in any other studies involving
             investigational or marketed products, concomitantly or within 30 days prior to entry
             in the study.

          6. Clinically significant illness (intercurrent illness e.g. pneumonia, pre-existing
             condition e..g. malignancy or conditions that may effect absorption of study
             medication e.g. severe diarrhea or any signs of malnutrition as defined clinically).

          7. Laboratory evidence or history of significant cardiovascular, liver or renal
             functional abnormality, which in the opinion of the investigator would place them at
             increased risk. Specifically, the following will serve as exclusionary laboratory
             values:

               1. Creatinine &gt; 1.4 X ULN (&gt;2.0 mg/dl),

               2. Glucose &lt; LLN (75 mg/dl),

               3. AST, ALT &gt; 3x ULN (120 U/L), or

               4. Prolonged QT wave on baseline electrocardiogram (QT &gt;0.45s)

          8. Symptoms of severe vomiting (no food or inability to take food during the previous 8
             hours).

          9. Signs or symptoms of severe malaria.

         10. Anyone who received a transfusion of red blood cells within the prior 30 days.

         11. Unable and/or unlikely to comprehend and/or follow the protocol.

         12. Self-reported alcohol and/or any other drug abuse.

         13. Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by
             the study protocol.
