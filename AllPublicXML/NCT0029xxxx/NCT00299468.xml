  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will test - in a chronically ill managed long term care population - the effectiveness of
      an intervention that provides nurse Care Managers with an inventory of evidence-based
      practices tailored to patients with different levels of knowledge, skills and confidence to
      engage in self-care management. Specifically, we will develop a &quot;change package&quot; of
      evidence-based hypertension (HTN) management strategies geared to patients scoring at the
      four different stages of activation on the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). We will randomly
      assign a group of interdisciplinary teams in the managed long-term care plan to intervention
      or control status and will train the Care Managers on the Intervention teams to use the
      change package in conjunction with a patient's PAM score to design - with the involvement of
      the patient - an individualized HTN management plan. We then will assess the impact of the
      intervention on patient activation and outcomes.

      The three main aims of the project are to:

        1. Determine whether the PAM-driven intervention increases patients' knowledge and
           self-management skills, measured by both generic PAM scores and HTN-specific measures
           developed by the research team.

        2. Determine whether the PAM-driven intervention improves HTN patients' systolic and
           diastolic blood pressure (BP), measured in three ways:

             -  Average percent reduction in systolic and diastolic BP.

             -  Percent of patients who achieve BP control (defined as &lt;140 systolic and &lt;90
                diastolic BP or &lt;130 systolic and &lt;80 diastolic for patients with diabetes or renal
                disease).

             -  Percent of patients with controlled HTN who maintain control.

        3. Conduct an analysis to examine implementation of the intervention by trainers and Care
           Managers in the Intervention group and to understand the barriers and facilitators
           affecting the implementation process.

           In addition, we will conduct a feasibility study with a subset of Care Managers to
           determine how the Visual Scan Assessment of Patient Activation might be incorporated
           into routine assessment and care planning procedures. Therefore, the fourth aim of the
           project is to:

        4. Assess the feasibility and perceived usefulness of the Visual Scan Assessment as a tool
           to increase feedback to Care Managers on how well they are supporting patient self-care
           management.
