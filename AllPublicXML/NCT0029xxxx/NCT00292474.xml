  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of a paclitaxel eluting stent system (TAXUS stent) is to prevent restenosis
      by blunting the initial response to stent implant injury and sustaining the arrested response
      until vascular healing has taken place.

      The purpose of the TAXUS IV-SR trial is to study the safety and efficacy of the TAXUS Stent
      under controlled trial circumstances used in the treatment of new coronary artery lesions
      (heart blockages) This clinical investigation will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the TAXUS Stent with 1 ug/mm2 (loaded drug/stent surface area) of paclitaxel incorporated
      into a slow rate-release formulation of a triblock copolymer carrier system for treatment of
      new coronary artery lesions.

      This was a prospective randomized, double-blind, multicenter safety and efficacy trial.
      Patients were stratified by presence or absence of medically treated diabetes mellitus and
      vessel diameter (&lt;3.0 mm or &gt;/=3.0 mm), then randomized 1:1 to receive either the TAXUS Stent
      or a Control stent. Additional study stents were permitted to optimize outcomes. The study
      was considered complete (with regard to the primary endpoint) after all patients enrolled had
      completed the 9 month follow-up.

      Enrollment of 1172 patients was planned; 1326 were treated and randomized at 73 centers
      involving 76 sites by 8 July 2002 with 667 in the TAXUS group and 659 in the Control group.

          3. Documented stable angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification
             [CCS] 1, 2, 3, or 4) or unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia (Braunwald
             Class IB-C, IIB-C, or IIIB-C), or documented silent ischemia

          4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &gt; or = 25%
