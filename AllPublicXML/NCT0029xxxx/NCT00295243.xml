      Participants will take GW572016 by mouth daily each cycle (cycles 28 days in length) and will
      be given Topotecan intravenously on Days 1, 8 and 15. During Cycle 1 participants will be
      required to spend the evening before Day 1 in the General Clinical Research Center and
      frequent blood samples will be drawn on Day 1; this schedule will be repeated the evening of
      Day 6 with the blood samples drawn on Day 7. Participants will have weekly CBCs.
