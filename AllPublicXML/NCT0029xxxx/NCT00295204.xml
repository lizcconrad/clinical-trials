      Comparing the arrhythmia diagnostic yield of MCOT as compared to standard loop event monitors
      in patients presenting with palpitations, syncope or near syncope occurring less frequently
      than every 24 hours. Patients randomized and are enrolled for 30 days. Prior testing
      required: 24 hours of non diagnostic monitoring,

      Cardiac monitoring is used for diagnosing patient with symptoms. Holter monitoring or cardiac
      loop monitoring are the tests most ofter prescribed for patients depending on the frequency
      of symptoms. If the symptoms occur daily, a Holter may be prescribed, but when the symptoms
      become less frequent the diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring declines greatly. The current
      yields are approximately 5-10% depending on the indication. When the Holter is not longer an
      option for patients with infrequent symptoms a cardiac loop event monitor is prescribed to
      make a diagnosis. The yields on this monitoring also average approximately 25-35%. We feel
      that the yield on the Mobile Cardiac Ouptatient Telemetry (MCOT) service proviced by
      CardioNet is significantly higher due to the fact that every beat is analyzed using an
      algorithm and that many times the arrhythmia causing the symptoms has ended before the
      patient is able to press the button on the loop monitor to record the ECG. This study
      compares the MCOT service with Patients over 18 years of age experiencing syncope, near
      syncope or palpitations less frequently than daily. Require 24 hours of non-diagnostic ECG
      monitoring prior to randomization. Patients remain on monitoring for 30 days unless an
      arrhythmia diagnosis is made. The primary endpoint is confirmation of exclusion of a probable
      arrhythmic cause of pre-syncope, syncope or palpitations experienced by the subject prior to
      enrollment in the study. Secondary endpoints include time to diagnosis, time to detection of
      clinically significant arrhythmias, comparison of non-clinicaly significant arrhythmias, rate
      of asymptomatic arrhythmias both clinically and non clinically significant and a diagnosis
      related resource utilization. The study size is 300 subjects.
