      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and
      radiation therapy before a donor umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant helps stop the
      growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's
      stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy
      any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from
      a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine
      and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving chemotherapy together with
      total-body irradiation followed by donor umbilical cord blood transplant, cyclosporine, and
      mycophenolate mofetil works in treating patients with hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the engraftment potential of unrelated allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB)
           using nonmyeloablative conditioning comprising fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and
           total-body irradiation followed by post-transplant immunosuppression comprising
           cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil in patients with hematologic malignancies.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of neutrophil and platelet recovery and the completeness of donor
           cell engraftment in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease
           (GVHD) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of malignant relapse in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the 1- and 2-year survival and event-free survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the phenotype and function of immune cells recovering after UCB
           transplantation in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to HLA disparity (0-1 vs 2) and number of graft
      units (1 vs 2).

        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning: Patients receive nonmyeloablative conditioning comprising
           fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -8 to -6 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days
           -7 and -6. Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily on days -4 to -1.

        -  Unrelated allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT): Patients undergo 1 or
           2 unrelated allogeneic UCBTs on day 0.

        -  Immunosuppression: Patients receive cyclosporine orally or IV over 2 hours 2-3 times
           daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 100, followed by a taper in the
           absence of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil
           orally or IV twice daily on days -3 to 30, continuing beyond day 30 if no donor
           engraftment. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously beginning on
           day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
