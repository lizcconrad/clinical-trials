  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, relies upon the health care providers and
      the patients self-care. Self management programs for diabetes that target self-empowerment
      tools have been found to be effective in some studies, but have not typically included
      individuals on Medicaid.

      Our goal for this trial was to observe if patients participating in such a program could
      decrease glycated hemoglobin levels, improve health status and improve self-care practices.

      Design, Setting and Population: A Phase 3, one year prospective trial, randomized to
      intervention or control (usual care) with Medicaid or dual-Medicare beneficiaries, with
      diabetes, aged 40-85 years old residing in South King County, Washington.

      Intervention: A targeted, multi-component, self-management program incorporating a
      stage-of-change approach to overcome barriers and facilitate life-style behavior changes to
      achieve patient-driven health action plans for nutrition or exercise goals.

      Main Outcome Measures: Glycemic control (HbA1c), physical and mental health, self-care
      practices.

      Recruitment Status: Completed: participants are no longer being recruited; data analysis is
      complete.
