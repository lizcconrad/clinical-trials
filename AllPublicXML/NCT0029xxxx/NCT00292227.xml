  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess whether rotigotine has an effect on the electrical
      activity of the heart. Moxifloxacin infusion is used as positive control to assess assay
      sensitivity.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -2/ Day -1) 20:00h, Day 42 20:00h</time_frame>
    <description>Change in QTcI was analyzed by a parallel-group comparison between rotigotine patch and placebo patch. The QT interval refers to the respective time interval in the Electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using an individualized heart rate correction formula including QT/RR curvature optimization (QTcI). The baseline QTcI value was obtained from the average of the ECG assessment on Day -2 and Day -1. Absolute values are presented as unadjusted Mean and Standard Deviation. Baseline and final measures were taken at 20:00h.</description>

        <description>Change in QTcI was analyzed by a parallel-group comparison between rotigotine patch and placebo patch. The QT interval refers to the respective time interval in the Electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using an individualized heart rate correction formula including QT/RR curvature optimization (QTcI). The baseline QTcI value was obtained from the average of the ECG assessment on Day -2 and Day -1. Absolute values are presented as unadjusted Mean and Standard Deviation. Baseline and final measures were taken at 20:00h.</description>

          <description>Change in QTcI was analyzed by a parallel-group comparison between rotigotine patch and placebo patch. The QT interval refers to the respective time interval in the Electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using an individualized heart rate correction formula including QT/RR curvature optimization (QTcI). The baseline QTcI value was obtained from the average of the ECG assessment on Day -2 and Day -1. Absolute values are presented as unadjusted Mean and Standard Deviation.

        <description>Change in QTcI was analyzed by a parallel-group comparison between rotigotine patch and placebo patch. The QT interval refers to the respective time interval in the Electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using an individualized heart rate correction formula including QT/RR curvature optimization (QTcI). The baseline QTcI value was obtained from the average of the ECG assessment on Day -2 and Day -1. Absolute values are presented as unadjusted Mean and Standard Deviation.

          <description>Change in QTcI was analyzed by a parallel-group comparison between rotigotine patch and placebo patch. The QT interval refers to the respective time interval in the Electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using an individualized heart rate correction formula including QT/RR curvature optimization (QTcI). The baseline QTcI value was obtained from the average of the ECG assessment on Day -2 and Day -1. Absolute values are presented as unadjusted Mean and Standard Deviation.

        <description>Change in QTcI was analyzed by a cross-over comparison between moxifloxacin infusion and placebo infusion. The QT interval refers to the respective time interval in the Electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using an individualized heart rate correction formula including QT/RR curvature optimization (QTcI). Absolute values are presented as unadjusted Mean and Standard Deviation. Baseline and final measures were taken at 20:00h.</description>
