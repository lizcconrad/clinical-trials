    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that have frequent chest
      infections are the patients most likely to become worse over time. Why these people are more
      susceptible to chest infections is not known. One reason might be that the white cells in
      their lungs called macrophages do not work properly. Normally, these cells remove all the
      debris inhaled into the lung. This can also include bacteria. In patients with COPD, these
      macrophages are not able to remove these particles. The research question addresses why this
      happens

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comprises chronic bronchitis, small airways
      disease and emphysema. The major risk factor for the development of COPD is cigarette smoking
      therefore, the prevalence of this disease is increasing. COPD accounts for increasing numbers
      of hospital admissions due to increased numbers of chest infections and exacerbations. This
      may be related to the reduced capacity of macrophages from COPD patients to phagocytose
      bacteria and apoptotic cells. The reasons for this defect in the innate immune response in
      these subjects is unclear but there are suggestions that scavenger receptors may be altered
      by oxidative stress and reduce the phagocytotic pathway. This would be relevant in COPD, as
      increased oxidative stress is associated with cigarette smoking. We have preliminary data
      that shows a similar reduce phagocytotic response in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from
      COPD patients compared with smokers and non-smokers. As these cells have not been exposed to
      oxidative stress other mechanisms may play a role in reducing phagocytosis. Using this MDM
      model, by taking blood from patients with COPD, we aim to investigate the mechanism of
      defective phagocytosis in COPD. We will measure the expression and regulation of cell surface
      scavenger receptors in cells of disease patients and control subjects and examine the
      signalling pathways leading to actin polymerization and phagosome formation. Finally, we aim
      to identify novel therapeutic strategies to reverse this effect and augment phagocytosis of
      macrophages in patients with COPD. Such a strategy would reduce chest infections and
      exacerbations and hence improve quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy non-smoking subjects:

        All normal volunteers will meet the following criteria:

        Age 21-75 years. No history of respiratory or allergic disease. Normal baseline spirometry
        as predicted for age, sex and height. Non-smokers. No history of upper respiratory tract
        infection in the preceding six weeks. Not taking regular medication

        COPD subjects:

        COPD is diagnosed according to American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society and
        British Thoracic Society guidelines by the doctors in Professor Barnes' COPD clinic.

        All COPD volunteers will meet the following criteria:

        Age between 35-75 years. A smoking history of at least 10 pack years. ( 1 pack year = 20
        cigarettes per day for 1 year) FEV1:FVC ratio of &lt;0.7, post-bronchodilator FEV1 of &lt;85%
        predicted, reversibility with inhaled beta2-agonist of &lt;15% of predicted FEV1: all three
        criteria are required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will not included in this study if they meet any of the following exclusion
        criteria:

        Clinically significant findings in the medical history or on physical examination other
        than those of COPD in the COPD group.

        Pregnant women or mothers who are breastfeeding. Subjects who are unable to give informed
        consent.-
