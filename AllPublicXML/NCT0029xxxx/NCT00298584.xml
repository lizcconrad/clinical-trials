  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which of the two procedures commonly used to
      collect urine, percutaneous suprapubic aspiration (SPA) and urethral catheterization (UC), is
      less painful, and the success rates and complication rates associated with both methods.

      Infants hospitalized in the NICU undergo numerous invasive and painful procedures. Exposure
      to early repeated painful procedures has been correlated with both short-term and long-term
      negative sequelae, such as altered pain responses and increased sensitivity to pain (Taddio
      2005). Fifty eligible infants in the NICU will be randomized to undergo urine collection by
      either suprapubic aspiration (SPA) or urinary catheterization (UC). Outcome measures will
      include pain, procedure success, and procedure duration. Pain will be measured using facial
      grimacing (the infant's face will be videotaped for the entire procedure), heart rate and
      oxygen saturation. Procedure success will be defined by the collection of about 2mL of urine
      (Falcao, 1999). The procedure duration in seconds for the first attempt will be calculated.
      Infants will be monitored during the procedure for adverse events such as apnea, bradycardia,
      desaturation, emesis, increased ventilatory support. Results will be extremely valuable in
      aiding health care providers to choose a urine collection technique that minimizes the pain
      and maximizes the success of the procedure.
