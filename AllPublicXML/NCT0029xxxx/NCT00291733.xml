  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levodopa-induced dyskinesias have been associated with irregular oscillatory discharge
      characteristics of basal ganglia. From the other hand, LEV which shares a different
      electrophysiologic profile than other antiepileptics, inhibits hyper-synchronization of
      abnormal neuronal firing in experimental models of epilepsy. LEV also reduces
      levodopa-induced dyskinesias in MPTP-lesioned macaques and modulates &quot;priming phenomenon&quot;
      which associated with long-term changes in synaptic function that can lead to dyskinesias in
      PD.

      Study objectives :

        -  To evaluate the effects of levetiracetam (LEV) in two doses (500 and 1000mg) vs placebo
           on disabling dyskinesias that develop as result of long-term treatment with levodopa,
           occurring at the time of maximal clinical improvement in patients with Parkinson's
           disease (PD).

        -  To evaluate the safety of LEV in patients with PD and antiparkinsonian medication.
