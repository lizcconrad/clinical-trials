  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Computer-based continuing education courses may be effective in improving the
      skills of primary care doctors to identify skin cancer risk factors, perform skin cancer
      exams, and counsel patients. They may also improve the skills of primary care doctors to
      assess and counsel patients on their weight, diet, and physical activity.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well computer-based continuing
      education courses work in improving doctors' ability to perform skin cancer or weight control
      exams and counseling during routine office visits.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of a continuing education course designed to improve primary care
           physician performance in examination and counseling of patients about skin cancer vs a
           continuing education course designed to improve physician assessment of weight
           management.

        -  Evaluate physician performance of skin examination during routine patient visits at 12
           months after completion of the skin cancer continuing education course.

        -  Evaluate physician counseling around skin cancer issues.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of the skin cancer continuing education course in improving
           physician skin cancer triage skills and in changing physician attitudes and knowledge
           regarding skin cancer issues.

        -  Assess improvements in physician assessment of weight, diet, and physical activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Physicians are stratified according to
      participating center. Physicians are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (skin cancer continuing education course): Physicians complete a 1-hour continuing
           education course on skin cancer. The course is available to the physician as a reference
           for up to 12 months. Physicians complete an online test at baseline, immediately after
           the course is completed, and at 1 month and 12 months after course completion to assess
           their knowledge, attitudes, skill, and practices towards skin examination and skin
           cancer counseling.

      Patients are interviewed by telephone within 1 week after a routine office visit with their
      physician to assess the physician's skin assessment and skin cancer counseling practices. The
      interviews are conducted prior to and at 1 month and 12 months after the physician completes
      the continuing education course.

        -  Arm II (weight control continuing education course): Physicians complete a 1-hour
           continuing education course on weight, dietary, and physical activity assessment and
           counseling. The course is available to the physician as a reference for up to 12 months.
           Physicians complete an online test at baseline, immediately after the course is
           completed, and at 1 month and 12 months after course completion to assess their
           knowledge, attitudes, skill, and practices towards weight, dietary, and physical
           activity assessment and counseling.

      Patients are interviewed by telephone within 1 week after a routine office visit with their
      physician to assess the physician's weight, dietary, and physical activity assessment and
      counseling practices. The interviews are conducted prior to and at 1 month and 12 months
      after the physician completes the continuing education course.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 physicians and 4,500 patients will be accrued for this
      study.
