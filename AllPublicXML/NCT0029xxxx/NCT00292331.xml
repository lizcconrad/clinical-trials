  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis by comparing the efficacy of
      cyanoacrylate injection (GVO) and band ligation (GVL) in the treatment of acute GVH in liver
      cirrhotic patients with or without concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

    <textblock>
      Gastric variceal hemorrhage (GVH) has a poorer prognosis than esophageal variceal hemorrhage.
      However, data on its optimal treatment are limited. We designed a prospective study to
      compare the efficacy of endoscopic band ligation (GVL) and endoscopic N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate
      injection (GVO). Liver cirrhotic patients with or without concomitant hepatocelluar carcinoma
      (HCC) and patients presenting with acute GVH were randomized into two treatment groups.
      Forty-eight patients received GVL, and another 49 patients received GVO. Both treatments were
      equally successful in controlling active bleeding (14/15 vs. 14/15, P = 1.000). More of the
      patients who underwent GVL had GV rebleeding (GVL vs. GVO, 21/48 vs. 11/49; P = .044). The
      2-year and 3-year cumulative rate of GV rebleeding were 63.1% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      44.5%-81.7%), 72.3% (95% CI, 51.3%-93.3%) for GVL and 26.8% (95% CI, 12.5%-41.1%), 26.8% (95%
      CI, 12.5%-41.1%) for GVO; P = .0143, log-rank test. The rebleeding risk of GVL sustained
      throughout the entire follow-up period. Multivariate Cox regression indicated that
      concomitance with HCC (relative hazard: 2.453, 95% CI: 1.036-5.806, P = .041) and the
      treatment method (GVL vs. GVO, relative hazard: 2.660, 95% CI: 1.167-6.061, P = .020) were
      independent factors predictive of GV rebleeding. There was no difference in survival between
      the two groups. Severe complications due to these two treatments were rare. In conclusion,
      the efficacy of GVL to control active GVH appears to have no difference with GVO, but GVO is
      associated with a lower GV rebleeding rate.
