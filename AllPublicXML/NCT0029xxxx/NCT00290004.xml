  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, toxicities, dosage and response
      rate for an investigational drug, motexafin gadolinium, administered to patients with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. The secondary purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the clinical benefit rate, the time it takes for a patient's chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma to worsen, the duration of response and the time
      during which patients survive without chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic
      lymphoma worsening. Additionally, the patient's response to motexafin gadolinium will be
      compared to the response of the patient's cells in a laboratory to motexafin gadolinium.

             immunoglobulin staining if negative for t[11;14] translocation or cyclin D1) or SLL as
             defined by WHO classification criteria and is refractory or relapsed as defined by one
             of the following:

               -  Refractory disease: progressive disease while on therapy

               -  Relapsed disease: progressive disease after at least one treatment course of
                  therapy with disease response or stabilization

          -  ECOG performance status score of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Laboratory values of:

          -  Greater than three prior regimens (where a regimen is defined as a treatment for
             CLL/SLL given initially or after disease progression)

          -  Prior malignancy requiring current or prior treatment within the past 5 years, except
