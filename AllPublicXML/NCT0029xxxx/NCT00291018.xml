    <measure>NDI</measure>
    <time_frame>84 months</time_frame>
    <description>NDI is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping, and recreation and is the most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain.
The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0-5 rating scale (0='No pain' and 5='Worst imaginable pain'). The points can be summed to a total score. The test can be interpreted as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage: 0 points or 0% means no activity limitations, 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation.
Mean duration of the test is 3-8 minutes and the results can be interpreted as:
0-4 points (0-8%) no disability;
5-14 points (10-28%) mild disability;
15-24 points (30-48%) moderate disability;
25-34 points (50-64%) severe disability;
35-50 points (70-100%) complete disability</description>

    <measure>SF-36 Physical Composite Score (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>84 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short form-36 (SF-36) is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life (QoL) across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. The eight domains that the SF-36 measures are as follows: physical functioning; role limitations due to physical health; role limitations due to emotional problems; energy/fatigue; emotional well-being; social functioning; pain; general health. A single item is also included that identifies perceived change in health, making the SF-36 a useful indicator for change in QoL over time and treatment.
It can take patients at least half an hour to complete the SF-36.
The Physical Composite Score (PCS) specifically looks at the mean average of all of the physically relevant questions.</description>

        <title>NDI</title>
        <description>NDI is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping, and recreation and is the most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain.
The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0-5 rating scale (0='No pain' and 5='Worst imaginable pain'). The points can be summed to a total score. The test can be interpreted as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage: 0 points or 0% means no activity limitations, 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation.
Mean duration of the test is 3-8 minutes and the results can be interpreted as:
0-4 points (0-8%) no disability;
5-14 points (10-28%) mild disability;
15-24 points (30-48%) moderate disability;
25-34 points (50-64%) severe disability;
35-50 points (70-100%) complete disability</description>

        <title>SF-36 Physical Composite Score (PCS)</title>
        <description>The Short form-36 (SF-36) is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life (QoL) across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. The eight domains that the SF-36 measures are as follows: physical functioning; role limitations due to physical health; role limitations due to emotional problems; energy/fatigue; emotional well-being; social functioning; pain; general health. A single item is also included that identifies perceived change in health, making the SF-36 a useful indicator for change in QoL over time and treatment.
It can take patients at least half an hour to complete the SF-36.
The Physical Composite Score (PCS) specifically looks at the mean average of all of the physically relevant questions.</description>
