      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a brief preoperative smoking
      intervention on postoperative complications in women undergoing breast cancer surgery.

      Secondary purposes are to examine long-term smoking cessation rates and experienced stress
      and nicotine withdrawal symptoms during the smoking cessation period.

    <textblock>
      Smokers are at greater risk of developing postoperative complications. The connection between
      smoking and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease is furthermore well documented.

      Smoking cessation 6 weeks before orthopaedic surgery significantly reduces the risk of
      developing postoperative complications. However, smoking cessation for an even shorter period
      may theoretically have similar effects on postoperative complications.

      Intensive smoking intervention programmes increase long-term smoking cessation rates
      significantly. Little evidence is available on the efficacy of brief smoking intervention
      programmes for newly diagnosed cancer patients.

      This study therefore aims to examine the effect of a brief smoking intervention on
      postoperative complications and long-term smoking cessation rates in women undergoing breast
      cancer surgery.

      The study is a randomised clinical trial in which study participants are randomised by block
      randomisation to either standard care (control group) or a brief preoperative smoking
      intervention (intervention group). Patients in the intervention group are counselled to
      comply with an intended perioperative smoking cessation period of 13 days.

      The intervention and control groups will be compared up to 12 months postoperatively in
      regard to frequency of postoperative complications and smoking cessation rates. Additionally,
      experienced stress and nicotine withdrawal symptoms during the perioperative smoking
      cessation period will be compared between the groups.
