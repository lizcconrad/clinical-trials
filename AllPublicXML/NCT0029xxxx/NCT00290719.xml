      RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and irinotecan, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving
      gefitinib together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of gefitinib when given together
      with cisplatin, irinotecan, and radiation therapy before surgery and to see how well they
      work in treating patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer that can
      be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the pathologic response (complete and partial) in patients with resectable
           esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer treated with neoadjuvant gefitinib,
           cisplatin, irinotecan hydrochloride, and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the rate of complete resection in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine surgical morbidity and mortality in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

        -  Induction phase: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-14. Patients with
           stable or responding disease proceed to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive gefitinib as in the induction phase
           beginning in week 4 and continuing through the last day of radiotherapy. Patients also
           receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days
           22, 29, 43, and 50 and undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks
           (total of 25 doses).

        -  Surgery: Within 4-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients
           with stable or responding disease undergo an esophagectomy and lymph node dissection.
           Patients with a progressive or unresectable disease are removed from the study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
