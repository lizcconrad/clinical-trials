      The purpose of this program is to provide access to AMD3100 for patients who would benefit
      from an autologous stem cell transplant but who have either previously failed to collect
      enough cells for transplant following standard therapy or are not considered by their
      physician to have a reasonable chance of collecting enough cells for transplant.

      The purpose of this program is to provide access to AMD3100 for patients who would benefit
      from an autologous stem cell transplant but who have either previously failed to collect
      enough cells for transplant following standard therapy or are not considered by their
      physician to have a reasonable chance of collecting enough cells for transplant.

      Compassionate use is a way to provide experimental treatment to a patient who is not eligible
      to receive that therapy in a clinical trial, but who has a serious or life-threatening
      illness for which other treatments are not available.

      Peripheral blood stem cells are obtained by apheresis following a stem cell mobilization
      regimen. The standard of care regimen for stem cell mobilization includes a growth factor,
      G-CSF. AMD3100 is given in addition to G-CSF prior to each apheresis session. If enough
      peripheral blood stem cells for transplant are collected, the patient is treated with high
      dose chemotherapy in preparation for transplant and is transplanted with cells obtained from
      the AMD3100 and G-CSF regimen. Patients are followed for safety and transplant outcomes for
      up to 12 months after transplant.
