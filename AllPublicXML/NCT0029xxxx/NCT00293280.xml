      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lomustine, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lomustine works in treating patients with
      stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the response rate to lomustine in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell
           lung cancer with aberrant methylation of the MGMT gene.

        -  Determine whether the response rate in these patients is significantly greater than that
           of the historical control.

      Secondary

        -  Collect preliminary data on toxicity, disease stabilization, time to disease
           progression, and overall survival.

      Tertiary

        -  Evaluate the association between clinical outcome and immunohistochemical staining by
           grouping the patients as complete or partial loss of MGMT gene.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lomustine once on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
