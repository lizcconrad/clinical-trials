    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the time-course of recovery to a T4/T1 ratio
      of 0.9 after a dose of sugammadex when administered at least 15 minutes after the last
      administration of rocuronium in a wide range of surgical procedures and anesthetic regimens
      (routine use). Safety evaluation is part of the study.

    <description>Each subject will receive an intravenous single bolus dose of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. If further neuromuscular block is required after endotracheal intubation, maintenance dose(s) of 0.15 mg/kg rocuronium may be administered.
At least 15 minutes after the intubation dose or the last maintenance dose of rocuronium, an intravenous single bolus dose of 4.0 mg/kg Org 25969 will be administered.</description>
