  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The face is involved in 40-50% of patients with burns admitted to the Dutch Burn Centres.
      Scarring of the face as a consequence of burns will often have a detrimental effect on
      function and aesthetics, and may cause negative effects on psychosocial wellbeing. What the
      best treatment is for facial burns, minimising scarring, is unclear. Besides that, there is
      little empirical evidence regarding the impact of facial scarring on psychosocial wellbeing.

      In clinical practice good results are felt to be achieved by treatment of facial burns with
      flammacerium. To substantiate the perceived advantages of flammacerium, its efficacy is
      compared to flammazine, a current alternative of care. The efficacy of treatment will be
      assessed in a prospective randomised multicentre clinical trial. Efficacy will be analysed in
      terms of number of patients requiring surgery and functional and aesthetic outcome.

      Apart from medical outcome, this study offers the opportunity to study psychosocial problems
      associated with facial defects. It is still an unresolved question whether facial scarring
      causes more or different psychosocial problems. Therefore, self-esteem and quality of life
      will be examined over time, in relation to depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms and
      other factors, such as coping style and social support.

      By evaluating the efficacy of different treatment strategies, we aim to optimise the standard
      of care of facial burns. Furthermore, this study wants to shed more light on the psychosocial
      impact of facial injury. With these results psychosocial professionals will be able to focus
      on persons at risk and to be better able to meet a patient's personal needs.
