  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, cross-over clinical trial to compare
      the effects of phenylephrine or norepinephrine on cardiac function during carotid artery
      surgery in patients under general anesthesia. The effect of the vasopressor on cardiac
      function will be measured using electrocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography and
      cardiac troponin I intraoperatively and postoperatively. We will use a cross-over pattern
      since both drugs exhibit rapid onset and short duration of action. We hypothesize that there
      will be less myocardial ischemia associated with the use of norepinephrine when compared with
      phenylephrine during carotid artery surgery.
