  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of early conversion tracheostomy from
      endotracheal intubation (ET) to percutaneous, dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) in traumatic
      brain-injured patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of early (less than or equal
      to 72 hours) versus late (10 to 14 days) conversion from endotracheal intubation to
      percutaneous, dilatational, translaryngeal tracheostomy for mechanical ventilation of
      traumatic brain injured patients.

      The primary efficacy parameter will be the number of days on mechanical ventilation.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  Number of days in the hospital

        -  To assess the incidence of ventilator-acquired pneumonia in each group

        -  To assess the incidence of accidental extubation in each group

        -  To assess the incidence of death in each group
