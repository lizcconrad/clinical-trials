  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of both the knee and hip joints are common conditions; knee osteoarthritis
      affects 6% of adults over 30 years of age and osteoarthritis of the hip affects between 3%
      and 6% of the Caucasian population. Both forms of osteoarthritis are associated with
      disability. Conventional treatment (analgesics and the use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory,
      NSAIDS) is prophylactic, aimed at decreasing pain and improving function. However long term
      use of NSAIDS is associated with a high incidence of adverse events (gastrointestinal tract
      symptoms). A safer alternative treatment would therefore be beneficial.

      Both anecdotal evidence and recent studies have implicated the potential of the herbal remedy
      Devil's Claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) for the treatment of painful, chronic arthritic type
      conditions (Ernst and Chrubasik, 2000). Devil's Claw is an extract obtained from the root of
      the Harpagophytum procumbens plant, a member of the sesame family found in the Kalahari
      region in South Africa. It has been shown that this herbal remedy has anti-inflammatory and
      analgesic effects (Baghdikian et al, 1997). Currently Devil's Claw is marketed for use as a
      supportive treatment of degenerative arthrosis, is not a Medicines Control Agency licensed
      product and is freely available to the general public in health food stores and pharmacies.

      The objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy, optimum dosage and safety of the
      herbal remedy Devil's Claw (Harpagophytum) in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee
      and/or hip. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the following three
      principal questions:

        1. To compare the efficacy of Devil's Claw with placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis
           of the knee and/or hip

        2. To determine the optimum dose of Devil's Claw and

        3. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of three doses of Devil's Claw in the treatment
           of osteoarthritis of the knee/hip and to compare them to placebo There are also a number
           of secondary research objectives that will also be addressed (see later).

      These objectives are based on the following hypotheses :

      Hypotheses

        -  Devil's Claw has anti-inflammatory properties (as assessed by the reduction in pain,
           stiffness and disability aspects on the WOMAC) in chronic osteoarthritis of the knee
           and/or hip after 16 weeks of treatment, as compared to placebo.

        -  A dose response effect exists in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee/hip by
           Devil's Claw.

      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging two-centre study PREPARATIONS FOR
      INVESTIGATION: Devil's Claw (AllyaÂ®)/placebo as tablets

      STATISTICAL METHODS:

      Analysis on an intention to treat basis.

      The following tests will be performed and all statistical significance will be set at p &lt;
      0.05:

      Primary efficacy analysis: The primary outcome will be the reduction in WOMAC total score
      from baseline to week 16. The week 16 means for the four treatment groups will be compared
      using an analysis of covariance taking account of baseline assessments and any demographic
      differences, age, gender, etc, which are found to be significant. Multiple comparison tests
      will be used to examine specific differences of initially specified interest, such as the two
      highest doses of Devil's Claw versus placebo.

      Secondary Efficacy Analysis: Similar analyses of covariance will be used to examine treatment
      group differences at week 16 compared with baseline for WOMAC subscales (pain, stiffness and
      physical function), and Quality of Life assessments (SF-36). Changes in the subject's
      well-being and overall global assessment will be compared using appropriate non-parametric
      tests, e.g. Mann-Whitney test or MacNemar's test. Changes in attitudes and health beliefs to
      CAM will be assessed using Chi-Squared tests.

      Safety Evaluation: Group differences between adverse event reporting will be assessed by
      descriptive methods.

    <measure>Western Ontario and Mc Master University OA Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8 and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC is a disease specific outcome measure for osteoarthritis. It has three subscales assessing pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions) and function (15 questions). together the subscales give an overall total score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best; an increase in total score indicates an improvement in health. THe outcome was measured at baseline, week 8 and week 16. In this study the primary outcome was the reduction in WOMAC total score from baseline to the end of treatment at week 16.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Subscale on Western Ontario and Mc Master University OA Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8 and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Subscale assessed by 100mm VAS based on five questions addressing pain in osteoarthritis using the terminators no pain (0mm) to extreme pain (100mm). a higher score therefore indicates more severe pain. This outcome was recorded at baseline, week 8 and week 16 (end of treatment). The outcome for this study was reported as the change in WOMAC pain score from baseline to end of treatment at week 16.</description>

    <measure>Disability Subscale on The Western Ontario and Mc Master University OA Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subscale assessed by 100mm VAS based on twelve questions addressing disability in osteoarthritis with a higher score indicating worse symptoms. The VAS used terminators of no disability (0mm) to extreme disability (100mm). The measure was recorded at baseline, week 8 and week 16. We reported the outcome as the change from baseline to end of treatment at week 16.</description>

    <measure>Stiffness Subscale on the The Western Ontario and Mc Master University OA Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8 and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Subscale assessed by 100mm VAS based on two questions addressing stiffness in osteoarthritis;a higher score indicating worse symptoms. The VAS used terminators of no stiffness (0mm) to extreme stiffness (100mm). The measure was recorded at baseline, week 8 and week 16. We reported the outcome as the change from baseline to end of treatment at week 16.</description>

    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8 and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life assessment containing 8 scales clustered into 2 summary scales: physical health and mental health. Each question is scored out from 0 (indicating worst health) to 100 (indicating best health). Mean scores for the 8 scales (total scores/no questions completed) are calculated to give a total score for each of the two summary scales between 0 (worst health) and 100 (best health). SF36 was recorded at baseline, week 8 and at the end of treatment at week 16. we reported the change from baseline to end of treatment as the outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8 and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>To assess changes in the subject's well-being based on 7 point likert scale ranging from very poor (0 point) to very good (7 point). Outcome was recorded at baseline, week 8 and end of treatment at week 16. We reported outcome as the change in patient global assessment from baseline to end of treatment at week 16.</description>

        <description>WOMAC is a disease specific outcome measure for osteoarthritis. It has three subscales assessing pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions) and function (15 questions). together the subscales give an overall total score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best; an increase in total score indicates an improvement in health. THe outcome was measured at baseline, week 8 and week 16. In this study the primary outcome was the reduction in WOMAC total score from baseline to the end of treatment at week 16.</description>
