  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy, safety and tolerability of lamotrigine as
      used in a natural clinical setting, to examine the positive effects of lamotrigine, and the
      reasons why some patients choose to continue or discontinue lamotrigine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been numerous randomized, double-blind controlled trials demonstrating the value
      of lamotrigine in the treatment of seizures. However, randomized trials take place in
      artificial experimental conditions with many restrictions imposed. There hasn't been much
      focus on positive effects on the patient, such as improvement in mood and level of alertness
      related to the drug. Other factors related to quality of life that affect the decision to
      continue or discontinue the drug are also important. Anecdotal experience suggests that
      lamotrigine is associated with increased alertness, enhanced energy levels and improved
      general sense of well-being. Observational studies that promote awareness of such
      distinguishing features and other aspects of efficacy are essential for guiding
      decision-making when prescribing anti-epileptic drugs.
