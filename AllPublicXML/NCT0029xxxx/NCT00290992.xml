    <textblock>
      Primary: To estimate efficacy of SR29142 to the pediatric patients with newly diagnosed
      hematological malignancies at high risk for Tumor Lysis Syndrome, by evaluation of plasma
      uric acid concentration.

      Secondary: To investigate the safety in this population and anti-SR29142 antibodies, anti-SCP
      antibodies, and pharmacokinetic parameters.
