  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to compare efficacy and safety of TachoComb H versus standard
      surgical treatment for the control of local bleeding in patients undergoing prostatectomy.
      Specific objectives include the comparison between test treatments for intraoperative
      haemostatic efficacy as well as for post-operative blood loss to be assessed by haemoglobin
      and haematocrit concentration of drainage fluid.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. has the subject given informed consent according to local requirements before any
             trial related activies? A trial related activity is any procedure that would not have
             been performed during the routine management of the subject.

          2. Is the subject 18 years of age or above ?

          3. Is the subject planned for a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (cT3)?

             After prostate resection and primary haemostatic treatment

          4. is only minor (i.e. oozing) or moderate haemorrhage persisting after primary surgical
             haemostatic procedures of the major vessels (no pulsating arterial haemorrhage and/or
             major venous bleeding)?

        Exclusion:

        At pre-operative screen

          1. Is there anamnestic or laboratory evidence of coagulation disorders including
             haemophilia A or B and von Willebrand disease ?

          2. Has the patient a history of allergic reactions after application of human fibrinogen,
             human thrombin, bovine aprotinin and/or collagen of any origin?

          3. Is the patient undergoing an emergency operation?

          4. Did the patient participate in a clinical trial less than 30 days prior to inclusion
             in present trial?

          5. Does the patient participate in a clinical trial concomitantly with present trial?

             After tumour resection and primary haemostatic treatment

          6. Has any serious surgical complication occurred?

          7. Has any fibrin glue haemostatic (including any type of TachoComb) been used before
             randomisation?
