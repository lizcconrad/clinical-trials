      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Omacor 4g/day on blood lipid
      parameters and on the function and stiffness of blood vessels in HIV infected patients on
      Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)

      Results from recent studies show increasing numbers of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) incidents
      among patients on HAART treatment (Highly Active Antiviral Therapy). Three elements have
      received special attention:

        1. the immunodeficient effects of the HIV infection itself may influence the progression of
           arteriosclerosis

        2. the higher levels of risk behaviour in this group of patients (i.e. high prevalence of
           smokers in this group)

        3. The HAART treatment itself increases plasma levels of cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and
           triglycerides, resulting in HIV related lipodystrophy.

      The cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs are well established both through epidemiological
      studies and through small and large clinical trials. Clinical trials have shown positive
      effects of n-3 PUFA on plasma triglycerides, and statistically significant reductions in
      cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death. Moreover n-3 PUFAs have been shown to have
      beneficial effects on endothelial function. Based on the above rationale it is expected that
      Omacor (Omega-3-acid ethyl ester 90) will have positive effects on risk factors related to
      Ischemic Heart Disease in HIV patients on HAART treatment.

      Approximately 50 patients will be randomized to Omacor 4 grams/day or placebo. Treatment
      period is 12 weeks.
