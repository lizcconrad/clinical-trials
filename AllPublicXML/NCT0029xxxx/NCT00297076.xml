  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The following are study specific eligibility criteria. In addition to these criteria,
             investigators must exercise clinical discretion regarding selection of appropriate
             study subjects, taking into consideration any local treatment practices or guidelines.

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in the CCR104456 protocol only if all of the
        following criteria apply:

          -  HIV-1 infected subjects aged 18 years or older. All subjects participating in this
             study should be counseled on the practice of safe sex throughout the study. Females
             must fall into one of the following categories:

        Non-childbearing potential: defined as women who are surgically sterile or post-menopausal,
        the latter indicated by history of no menses for a minimum of one year prior to the date of
        the screening visit; Childbearing potential: has a negative pregnancy test result (-human
        chorionic gonadotropin; -HCG) within 35 days prior to administration of investigational
        product (Day 1) and agrees to use a proven double barrier method of contraception (e.g.
        spermicide + condom) during the study period (through follow-up). Hormonal contraceptives
        will not be considered sufficient forms of contraception for this study.

          -  Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥5000copies/mL (from CCR104627 protocol). There are no CD4
             cell count entry restrictions, however investigators must exercise clinical discretion
             regarding selection of appropriate study subjects, taking into consideration any local
             treatment practices or guidelines regarding CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA.

          -  Total prior antiretroviral experience of at least three months and documented
             genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one compound in each of the following
             classes of antiretrovirals: NRTIs (includes NtRTI TDF), NNRTIs, and PIs. Resistance
             mutations must be at least one major mutation according to the current International
             AIDS Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Group (refer to study reference manual
             [SRM]). Resistance testing may be current (e.g. screening results) and/or historical
             with verifiable documentation in source documents.

          -  R5-tropic virus according to viral tropism assessment at screening in CCR104627
             protocol.

          -  Current receipt of an unchanged &quot;pre-study&quot; ART regimen (i.e., unchanged medications
             and doses) for at least four weeks prior to screening in CCR104627 protocol; this
             pre-study regimen may be no ART. Subjects must remain on this regimen until
             randomization (Day 1).

          -  Subjects must be able to receive a RTV-boosted PI as part of their OBT regimen. Due to
             the possibility of randomization to the placebo arm, investigators should consider
             subjects for enrollment whose treatment history and resistance testing results suggest
             that an OBT regimen can be constructed which would be anticipated to provide the best
             possible virological response and clinical benefit for each subject. The drugs in the
             OBT regimen will be chosen from the locally available antiretrovirals and must consist
             of between three and six drugs, one of which must be a RTV-boosted PI. Use of
             investigational PIs which become available through expanded-access or similar programs
             during the conduct of this study must be authorized by the Sponsor prior to use in OBT
             regimen.

          -  Ability to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and
             protocol-stated restrictions.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to initiation of pre-baseline study
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in the CCR104456 protocol if any of the
        following criteria apply:

          -  Plasma sample tests as R5/X4 (dual or mixed)-tropic, X4-tropic only, or
             non-phenotypeable based on viral tropism assessment at screening in protocol
             CCR104627.

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at screening which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, should preclude the subject's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound. Any Grade 4 laboratory abnormality at screening will exclude
             a subject from study participation unless the investigator can provide a compelling
             explanation for the laboratory result(s) and has the assent of the Sponsor.

          -  Subjects that make any changes to their ART regimen during the period beginning four
             weeks prior to screening (protocol CCR104627) until Day 1.

          -  Significant blood loss (≥500mL) within 56 days prior to screening in CCR104627
             protocol.

          -  Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.

          -  Previous participation in an experimental drug and/or vaccine trial(s) within 30 days
             or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the experimental
             drug or vaccine - whichever is longer, prior to screening for the study.

          -  Subjects with any prior receipt of an investigational CCR5 or CXCR4 antagonist are
             excluded.

          -  Any clinically significant finding on screening or baseline ECG. Specifically,
             subjects with any repolarization delay (resting QTcB interval &gt;450msec at the
             screening or baseline [mean of triplicate values] visit) will be excluded. Subjects
             with a history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure,
             chronic and/or recurrent hypokalemia) will also be excluded.

          -  History of clinically relevant pancreatitis or hepatitis within the previous 6 months.
             Asymptomatic individuals with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             infection will not be excluded, however investigators should carefully assess if
             antiviral therapy specifically for HBV or HCV infection is required; subjects who are
             anticipated to require such therapy during the study should be excluded.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the
             subject's ability to comply with the dosing schedule and/or protocol evaluations
             (including alcohol or drug abuse) or which might compromise the safety of the subject.

          -  Any evidence of active CDC Class C conditions or opportunistic infections. Subjects on
             stable, anti-infective treatment or prophylaxis regimen are allowed in the study
             provided the therapy is not specifically prohibited.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug.

          -  History of a drug or other allergy which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates the subject's participation in the study or known hypersensitivity to
             any study medication or excipients.

          -  Treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 30 days
             of investigational product administration or anticipated need for such treatment
             during the study.

          -  Current severe illness, including liver and renal failure, major organ allograft,
             malignancy requiring parenteral chemotherapy that can not be discontinued for the
             duration of the trial, or any other conditions which would make the subject unsuitable
             for the study. Subjects with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of
             the cervix, or non-disseminated stable Kaposi's sarcoma may be included in the trial.

          -  Use of systemic immunosuppressants and/or immunomodulators within 30 days prior to
             study Day 1. Systemic corticosteroids at replacement doses (e.g. 10mg/day prednisone
             or equivalent) are permitted.

          -  Anticipated continued need for prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications that
             are on the prohibited medication list within 30 days prior to study Day 1.
