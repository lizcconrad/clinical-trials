  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether a single dose of intravenous lornoxicam is superior to intravenous
      placebo for management of post-operative pain in patients who have surgical removal of a
      bunion on the lower extremity. One-fourth of patients in this study will receive a single
      dose of intravenous ketorolac for management of pain and one-fourth of patients in this study
      will receive a single dose of an intravenous placebo.
