  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet has long been used as a way to provide enough nutrients to an individual in order to
      meet metabolic requirements. However, recent scientific advancements have suggested that
      beyond meeting nutrition needs, diet may also be health promoting through the modulation of
      various body functions. In a way, the role of nutrition has evolved from hunger satisfaction
      and maintenance of body integrity to the promotion of a state of well-being and prevention of
      important chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In
      recent years, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have attracted much attention as
      consumption of a n-3 PUFA rich diet has been reported to reduce CVD risk. However, n-3 PUFA
      are also highly susceptible to free radical damage and therefore could be unable to fully
      exert their health benefits under an oxidative stress condition. The general objective of the
      present application is to investigate the mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA improve cardiovascular
      health in abdominal obesity and explore the potential of dietary antioxidants to modulate
      these effects in individuals at high risk of oxidative stress. For that purpose, we plan to
      study the changes in fasting and postprandial plasma lipoprotein-lipid levels, markers of
      lipid and lipoprotein oxidation, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction following 12 weeks
      of n-3 PUFA supplementation with or without low-calorie cranberry juice cocktail (as a source
      of antioxidants) in a group of 160 men. We feel that the present study will broaden our
      understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of consuming
      unsaturated fatty acids and give further insights on the role of antioxidants in preserving
      and potentiating these cardiovascular health benefits.

             (e.g. statins, fibrates), endothelial function (hypotensive drugs). Use (ever) of
             anticoagulant drugs (e.g. warfarin) because of possible detrimental interaction with

             anti-inflammatory drugs Note: If for any reason, a subject would have to go an any of
             these drugs during the protocol, they would be automatically dropped from the study.
