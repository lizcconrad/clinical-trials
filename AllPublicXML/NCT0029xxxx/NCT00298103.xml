      The purpose of this study is to review patients with E. coli infections at UPMC from January
      1, 2004 to December 31, 2005 to determine if these infections have arisen in the community
      rather than in hospitals or nursing homes. The occurrence of such resistant isolates could be
      devastating if they were associated with bloodstream infection, such as sometimes accompanies
      urinary tract infection, since antibiotic resistant E. coli is not suspected in isolates
      coming from the community.

      The following variables will be followed: age, sex, hospital location at the time of positive
      culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), prior hospitalization or nursing home admission, receipt
      of outpatient dialysis or other regular medical care (eg, outpatient chemotherapy), presence
      of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics, including their type and whether they were
      adequate for the resistance profile of the organism, prior positive microbiologic cultures.

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ll patients with E. coli infections during the time period of the study will be
             reviewed. A community-associated E. coli isolate will be defined as one which was
             recovered from a clinical culture from a patient at UPMC-P who had no established risk
             factors for infection with an antibiotic resistant organism.

        Established risk factors are defined as:

          -  Isolation of the organism two or more days after admission for hospitalization OR A
             history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a long-term care
             facility within one year before the culture date

          -  OR The presence of an indwelling catheter or percutaneous medical device (eg,
             tracheostomy tube, gastrostomy tube, or Foley catheter) at the time of the culture

          -  OR Previous isolation of an antibiotic resistant organism
