      The purposes of this study is to determined the effects of instrument applied spinal
      manipulative therapy upon dual-task performance involving complex postural and cognitive
      task.

      This study sought to determine whether a 2-week regimen of spinal manipulative therapy could
      improve postural control under 2 conditions. Condition one was a complex postural task which
      consisted of a shoulder width stance on a compliant surface with eyes closed to remove visual
      input. Condition 2 was as above with the addition of visio-spatial cognitive task (serial 7s
      subtraction). These tasks were performed on a force-place designed to capture center of
      pressure data. Data was captured prior to the onset of therapy and then again after 6
      treatment sessions (2-week period). Data was also collected 1 week post treatment to note any
      lasting effects following therapy. This pilot study utilized a repeated measures designed
      with no control group.
