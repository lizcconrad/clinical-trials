  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with the antiepileptic drug Oxcarbazepine often develop syndrome of
      inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone(SIADH)We want to test the hypothesis, that
      these patients have a higher reabsorption of water during the Aquaporine2 water channels,a
      higher concentration of Vasopressine (AVP), and a lower clearance of water.This situation
      will tend to normalize, when the patients are treated with fluid restriction
    </textblock>

      The purpose of the study is to determine the amount of Aquaporine2(AQP2)in the urine in
      patients treated with the antiepileptic drug Oxcarbazepine before and after the
      administration of fluid restriction
