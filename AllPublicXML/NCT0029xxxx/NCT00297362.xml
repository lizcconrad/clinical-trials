  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of galantamine
      hydrobromide in patients with Alzheimer's disease who have not received or have not responded
      to treatment with medication similar to galantamine hydrobromide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Galantamine hydrobromide is a medication that is approved for the treatment of symptoms of
      Alzheimer's disease. In accordance with international guidelines, studies are conducted after
      a drug is marketed to continue to evaluate and expand the knowledge regarding its safety.
      This is a multi-center, open-label (all people involved know the identity of the
      intervention), observational study (individuals are observed or certain outcomes are measured
      - no attempt is made to affect the outcome) to collect information regarding the safety and
      effectiveness of galantamine hydrobromide in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Patients who
      have been prescribed galantamine hydrobromide as initial treatment with this type of
      medication for their Alzheimer's disease or who have failed previous treatment with similar
      medication of this type for their Alzheimer's disease will receive galantamine hydrobromide
      for 6 months. The individual physicians responsible for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
      will administer galantamine hydrobromide at doses appropriate for each patient and will
      continue to oversee their care. No medication will be supplied by the sponsor of this study.
      Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical exams, vital signs and laboratory
      tests) will be performed throughout the study. Effectiveness will be determined using
      standard tests and rating scales to assess mental status, functioning, thinking, behavior,
      judgment and language (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, [NPI], Mini Mental Status Exam [MMSE] and
      Clinical Global Impression-Caregiver [CGI-Caregiver]). Assessments will be conducted monthly
      for the first 3 months and at the end of 6 months of treatment. Galantamine hydrobromide
      treatment should be discontinued if there is no further indication of effectiveness. At the
      end of the study, the treating physician may continue treatment with galantamine hydrobromide
      in responding patients as appropriate. The study hypothesis is that galantamine hydrobromide
      will be effective in treating the symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease and is safe
      and well-tolerated. Observational study -No investigational drug administered

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used to screen for cognitive impairment. A score greater than or equal to 25 points is effectively normal (intact). Below this, scores can indicate severe (â‰¤9 points), moderate (10-20 points) or mild (21-24 points) cognitive impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 40-item DAD scale assesses functional abilities in activities of daily living in patients with dementia and other cognitive impairments. Higher scores indicate less disability while lower scores denote more difficulties.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI assesses psychopathology in dementia patients. It evaluates 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. Both the frequency (from rarely to very often) and the severity (from mild to severe) of each behavior are determined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a patient. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in Cornell Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Cornell Scale assesses signs and symptoms of major depression in patients with dementia. Each item is rated for severity on a scale of 0-2 (0=absent, 1=mild or intermittent, 2=severe). The item scores are added. Scores above 10 indicate a probable major depression. Scores above 18 indicate a definite major depression. Scores below 6 as a rule are associated with absence of significant depressive symptoms.</description>
