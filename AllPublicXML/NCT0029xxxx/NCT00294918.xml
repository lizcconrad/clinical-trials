  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, parallel-group, maintenance trial of
      Serostim® in subjects who have completed a prior Serostim® Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus-associated Adipose Redistribution Syndrome (HARS) trial (Study 22388). The subjects,
      who encountered toxicity during the antecedent protocol, will be assigned to a 1 milligram
      (mg) dose. All other subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio, to receive up to 2 mg or 4 mg
      of Serostim®, beginning from Day 1 of Week 1. Doses will be adjusted downward in subjects
      weighing less than 55 kilogram (kg). Serostim® therapy will be continued at the assigned
      doses through Week 12 (Period 1). Subjects, who will encounter toxicity during Period 1, will
      be assigned to the 1 mg group for Period 2. All other subjects will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive up to 2 mg or 1 mg of Serostim® on a weight adjusted basis. Period 2 therapy
      will begin on Day 1 of Week 13, continuing through Week 36. Study visits are required at
      Screening (that is, Final Visit of the antecedent trial), Day 1 of Week 1 (Baseline), and at
      Weeks 2, 6, 12, 14, 24, 30 and 36.

    <description>Serostim® will be administered subcutaneously at a dose of 1 mg to subjects who had encountered toxicity during the antecedent protocol (Study 22388) whereas, other subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio, to receive either 2 milligram (mg) or 4 mg (on a weight adjusted basis) daily, starting from Day 1 of Week 1 up to Week 12 (Period 1). During Period 1, subjects who encounter toxicity will receive 1 mg Serostim® subcutaneously, daily for Period 2, starting from Day 1 of Week 13, whereas other subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 2 mg or 1 mg (on a weight adjusted basis) up to Week 36.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Complete all treatments prescribed by the antecedent protocol (Study 22388)

          -  Be able and willing to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study,
             including concomitant therapy restrictions

          -  Have given written informed consent

          -  If female, be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using adequate contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Experienced a protocol defined toxicity or any other adverse event, which caused
             premature withdrawal from the antecedent study (Study 22388)

          -  Withdrew from the antecedent study or was discontinued prematurely for any other
             reason

          -  Based on the Final Visit evaluations from the antecedent trial, would be required to
             withdraw from the antecedent protocol, if (theoretically) the antecedent trial
             continued beyond the Final Visit

          -  Based on the Final Visit evaluations from the antecedent trial, would be required to
             temporarily stop or reduce the dose of study drug, if (theoretically) the antecedent
             trial continued beyond the Final Visit. This does not apply to subjects whose study
             drug was temporarily stopped or whose study drug dose was reduced prior to the Final
             Visit (Screening), provided they continued in the antecedent protocol and are stable
             at the time of the Final Visit (Screening)
