  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most cases of travelers' diarrhea are caused by bacterial pathogens which respond slowly to
      antibiotic treatment.The study was designed to determine the value of rapidly acting
      loperamide (imodium) combined with curative dose of the poorly absorbed rifaximin in
      travelers' diarreha treatment.

      During short-term study, adult U.S. students in Mexico (n = 310) with acute diarrhea (â‰¥ 3
      unformed stools with enteric symptoms) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized trial
      wherein they were given rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days (R) (n = 102),
      loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool not to exceed 8 mg/day
      for 2 days (L) (n = 104) or both drugs in the same dosage schedule (L/R) (n = 104). The major
      outcome parameter was time from initiation of therapy until passage of the last unformed
      stool before becoming well (TLUS).
