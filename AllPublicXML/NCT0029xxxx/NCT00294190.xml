  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed phase II trial will investigate weekly topotecan at a higher dose than was used
      in the previous trials in an attempt to achieve improved response rates and disease control
      without added toxicity. To help ameliorate the fatigue, planned rest weeks will be
      incorporated into the schedule. This trial will be the first clinical trial to evaluate a
      higher dose of weekly topotecan in the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive weekly topotecan.

      Topotecan 6mg/m2 IV weekly x 6 consecutive weeks followed by a 2 week break. Cycles are
      repeated every 8 weeks, for 3 cycles. Restaging studies will be performed every cycle (or 8
      weeks.)
