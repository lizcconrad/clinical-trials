      Primary

        -  pharmacokinetics of single dose nevirapine

        -  the effect of single dose carbamazepine on the pk of single dose nevirapine

        -  resistance against nevirapine before and after.

        -  follow-up on HIV status newborns

        -  relation between nevirapine levels in cord blood and plasma

      Secondary

      * safety of single dose nevirapine and nevirapine/carbamazepine

      Hypothesis:

      Single dose carbamazepine decreases development of resistance to nevirapine in HIV positive
      pregnant Tanzanian women by decreasing nevirapine half-life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Without the use of preventative measures, the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of
      HIV-1 is estimated to vary between 25 and 48%. The regimen of single dose of nevirapine to
      the mother just before delivery and a single dose of nevirapine to the newborn within 24 - 72
      hours after birth reduces the risk of MTCT by 50%, is affordable in many situations and is
      therefore standard of care in many African countries, like Tanzania. Recent studies, however,
      have shown that this single dose to the mother can induce the occurrence of nevirapine
      resistance in a large number of mothers. The mechanism of occurrence of nevirapine resistance
      already after a single dose is most likely related to the long elimination half-life of the
      drug. The subtherapeutic plasma levels present the perfect environment for the occurrence of
      resistance as the concentrations are subinhibitory for several days.
