  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies of labour induction with misoprostol used doses higher than 25mg and intervals
      of 3-4 hours. We studied a low-dose regime of 25mg misoprostol and compared its efficacy as
      single dose or double dose with dosing interval of 6 hours to our current regime of 3 mg
      dinoprostone pessary.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      171 women with singleton term pregnancies and modified Bishop score (mBS) ≤ 5 were recruited
      and randomized into 3 arms: current dinoprostone regime, double dose misoprostol or single
      dose misoprostol. The primary outcome was the number of women who achieved favourable mBS&gt;6
      or active labour by Day 2. Secondary outcomes were time interval from insert to active labour
      or delivery, abnormal uterine activity, delivery method and adverse neonatal outcome.
