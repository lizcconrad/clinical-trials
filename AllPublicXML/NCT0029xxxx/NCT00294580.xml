  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A trial was conducted in the 1980s to compare two strategies for control of malaria in young
      children aged 3-59 months: treatment with chloroquine versus treatment combined with
      fortnightly chemoprophylaxis with Maloprim. The impact on mortality and morbidity was
      assessed at the time, and their cognitive abilities and educational outcomes were assess 14
      years later in 2001. The hypothesis was that the chemoprophylaxis would reduce morbidity and
      mortality and would improve cognitive abilities and educational outcomes in the long term

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two drug strategies for the control of malaria in children aged 3-59 months have been
      compared in a rural area of The Gambia - treatment of presumptive episodes of clinical
      malaria with chloroquine by village health workers, and treatment combined with fortnightly
      chemoprophylaxis (pyrimethamine/dapsone) which was also given by village health workers.
      Treatment alone did not have any significant effect on mortality or morbidity from malaria.
      In contrast, treatment and chemoprophylaxis reduced overall mortality in children aged 1-4
      years, mortality from probable malaria, and episodes of fever associated with malaria
      parasitaemia. A high level of compliance with chemoprophylaxis was obtained and no harmful
      consequences of chemoprophylaxis were observed. Chemoprophylaxis was offered to all children
      at the end of the trial.

      14 years after the end of the trial, participants cognitive abilities and educational
      attainment were assessed. Associations have been found between malaria infection and poor
      cognitive ability but causality has not yet been demonstrated through preventative trials and
      the long-term impact of malaria has not been investigated. 1190 children who had participated
      in the original trial for at least one year were targetted for follow-up. 579 were traced.
      Those who had received chemoprophylaxis attended school for 0.52 years more than the placebo
      group (p=.069). There was no overall effect on cognitive abilities but there was a
      significant treatment effect for cohorts that had not received chemoprophylaxis at the end of
      the trial or who had received less than one year of post-trial prophylaxis
