  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was performed to evaluate the safety of G-CSF based stem cell therapy and to
      compare outcome of intracoronary infusion of mobilized PBSCs between patients with AMI and
      OMI.

    <textblock>
      The MAGIC Cell-DES trial was designed as a randomized, controlled trial to recruit 100
      patients with AMI and OMI. Patients who were successfully revascularized with DES in the
      culprit lesion were eligible for enrollment. After revascularization, patients were
      randomized by use of a randomization table. After randomization, study processes were not
      blinded.

      In the cell infusion groups after successful PCI, PBSCs were mobilized by daily subcutaneous
      injections of G-CSF (Dong-A pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea) at 10 ÔÅ≠g/kg body weight for three
      days. At day 4, mobilized PBSCs were collected with COBE spectra apheresis system (COBE BCT.
      Inc., Lakewood, CO, USA) using the mononuclear cell collection methods and infused
      selectively to infarcted myocardium via over-the-wire balloon catheter.

      The primary end point to evaluate efficacy was the change in LVEF, measured by MRI. The
      secondary end points were changes in LV volume, myocardial perfusion measured by coronary
      flow reserve (CFR), and the development of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; death, new MI,
      revascularization, hospitalization due to aggravation of ischemia or heart failure).
