      The purpose of this study is to study resistance to current malaria treatments and affordable
      alternatives for uncomplicated malaria. Resistance occurs in areas where these treatments are
      used frequently. This study may help prevent future resistance. About 150 residents in
      Buenaventura, Colombia will participate. They will have uncomplicated malaria and they will
      be followed for 28 days after treatment. Physical exams and blood draws are included in study
      visits.

      Drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a major threat to global public health and new
      strategies are needed to deter spread of resistance to available and forthcoming antimalarial
      drugs. This study seeks to contribute to understanding the molecular basis of spread of drug
      resistance in a setting with low level of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) treatment failure.
      The objectives of this study are to compare the prevalence of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)
      and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) point mutations associated with SP resistance before and
      after SP treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria episodes and to measure
      parasite infectivity to Anopheles mosquitoes of post-treatment gametocytes with and without
      DHFR and DHPR mutations. Patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria will receive a
      standard SP regimen and will be closely followed for 28 days. This study will add new
      knowledge of the understanding of ways in which resistance is spread and is expected to
      provide a sound basis for the future clinical evaluation of antimalarial drug combinations
      designed to prevent transmission of drug-resistance malaria.
