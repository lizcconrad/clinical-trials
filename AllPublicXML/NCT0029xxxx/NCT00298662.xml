      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a combination of
      interferon beta 1-b (Betaseron®) and tacrolimus (Prograf®) in patients suffering from
      multiple sclerosis (MS) who have failed treatment with currently approved drugs for MS

      Prograf is an immunosuppressant that weakens the immune reactions responsible to protect the
      organism against infections. It is currently available on the market for patients who have
      received an organ transplant, to prevent rejection. Because of its effect on the immune
      system, theoretically, Prograf should exert a significant effect in MS. It has been tried in
      a small number of MS patients at a lower dose than the one used in organ transplant, however
      the results of the study did not allow to draw definite conclusions on its safety and
      efficacy in MS.

      Betaseron is approved in Canada for the reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients
      with relapsing-remitting MS and for the slowing of progression and reduction of the frequency
      of relapses in patients with secondary-progressive MS. The combination of Betaseron and
      Prograf may result in an additive effect or an increase in the actions of the drugs. However,
      the combination of the two drugs has never been studied.

      The aim of this study is to see how well the combination of Betaseron and Prograf is
      tolerated by patients with MS. The side effects of the treatment, if any, will be followed.
      In addition, the efficacy of the combination will be evaluated.
