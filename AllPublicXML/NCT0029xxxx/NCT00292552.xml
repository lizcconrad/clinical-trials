    <textblock>
      This is a 3 year longitudinal study to identify novel endpoints and compare these with
      standard measures such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) for their ability to
      measure and predict COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) severity and its progression
      over time. Control subjects (smokers and never smokers) will be recruited as comparators with
      the COPD subjects.

          -  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years (number of pack
             years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked e.g., 20
             cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years).

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained prior to participation

             disease as determined by history, physical examination and screening investigations

          -  Baseline (post-bronchodilator) FEV1 &gt;85% of predicted normal. FEV1/FVC ratio &gt;70%

          -  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years (number of pack
             years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked e.g., 20
             cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years).

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained prior to participation.

          -  Able to comply with the requirements of the protocol and be available for study visits
             over 3 years
