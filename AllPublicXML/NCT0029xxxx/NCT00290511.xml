      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if chemotherapy given with rituximab,
      followed by Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), and then followed by rituximab can help to
      control lymphoma. The safety of this treatment schedule will also be studied.

      Objectives:

        1. To assess whether the time to progression for these high-risk patients can be prolonged
           to a median of 36 months, compared to the historical expectation of approximately 24
           months.

        2. To assess the tolerance and efficacy of Y2B8 (Zevalin) after R-FND (rituximab,
           fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone) in patients with high-risk stage III-IV
           follicular lymphoma

        3. To assess overall response, failure-free survival, and survival of this strategy
           compared to our historical experience with FND (fludarabine, mitoxantrone,
           dexamethasone) alone or R-FND

        4. To assess the tolerance and efficacy of maintenance therapy with rituximab.

        5. To maximize the 12-month molecular remission rate for patients with high-risk stage
           III-IV follicular lymphoma

        6. to correlate the results of quantitative PCR assay with classical PCR and with clinical
           outcome

      The treatments used in this program include several standard chemotherapy agents
      (fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone). Also, immune therapy agents will be given,
      including rituximab (a monoclonal antibody that attacks B-cells, which is what this type of
      lymphoma is made of), and Ibritumomab tiuxetan (another similar monoclonal antibody, which
      delivers radiation to the lymphoma cells to strengthen the attack).

      You will receive rituximab on Days 1 and 8 of the first cycle, and on Day 1 only of Cycles
      2-4 of the monthly cycles of chemotherapy, called R-FND. R-FND includes rituximab and
      fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone. Fludarabine will be given for 3 days,
      mitoxantrone for 1 day, and dexamethasone for 5 days of each 28-day cycle (FND). After 4
      cycles of R-FND, you will receive Ibritumomab tiuxetan. After the Ibritumomab tiuxetan, you
      will receive rituximab every 2 months for 1 year. All are given by vein. Sometimes
      dexamethasone can be given in pill form.

      During the study, you will have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons), sometimes every week.
      Every 2 cycles, you will have a chest x-ray and CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. Bone
      marrow samples will be taken. Heart function tests will be done as needed.

      If you desire, it may be possible for you to receive some of your study treatment at home
      (from your home doctor). Your study doctor will discuss this possibility with you. If this is
      the case, your home doctor will receive a letter telling him about this study and asking him
      if he wishes to participate in your treatments. He will be asked to provide the study doctors
      at M. D. Anderson specific information about your treatments and any side effects you may
      have. All communications between your home doctor and your study doctors will be included as
      part of your M. D. Anderson medical record.

      After the study ends, you will return for checkups every 3 months in the first year, every 4
      months in Years 2 and 3, and every 6 months in Years 4 and 5. After that, checkups will be
      needed once a year. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and bone marrow samples will be taken at
      these visits.

      This is an investigational study. Ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab are approved by the FDA
      for commercial use. The other drugs used in the study are also approved for commercial use by
      the FDA. About 50 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D.
      Anderson.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with high-risk Ann Arbor stage III-IV follicular lymphoma. High-risk is
             defined by advanced stage (III or IV), plus any 2 of the following features: age 60 or
             greater; elevated LDH; Hgb &lt; 12; or number of involved nodal sites 5 or more .

          2. Patients will be previously untreated.

          3. Adequate organ function.

          4. Follicular lymphoma, grade 3 (follicular large cell lymphoma): If eligible for a
             current large cell lymphoma protocol, that alternative protocol is recommended,
             particularly grade 3b or FLCL patients characterized as large non-cleaved cell.
             However, both FND and rituximab have established efficacy in FLCL, so if a patient is
             not eligible for a protocol for aggressive lymphoma (e.g., because of SCCL in the
             marrow), then registration on this trial is permitted.

          5. Biopsy or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) material is strongly recommended for bcl-2
             studies to verify rearrangement status of all patients who are designated &quot;germline&quot;.
             (see section 6.4). For other patients, tissue availability is desirable but not
             mandatory.

          6. Patients must have a performance status of Zubrod 3 or better

          7. Patients must have adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine &lt; 2mg%; bilirubin &lt;
             2 mg%). Patients with renal or liver dysfunction due to organ infiltration by lymphoma
             may be eligible after discussion with the study chairman.

          8. Patients may not receive other concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
             immunotherapy.

          9. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of the hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are unable or unlikely to be able to adhere to the treatment plan or to
             return to Houston for follow-up visits because of geographical, economic, emotional,
             or social considerations are not eligible for this study. Note: some follow-up care
             may be provided by outside physicians as long as the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)
             protocol for outside physician participation is strictly adhered to.

          2. Patients with an absolute peripheral granulocyte count of &lt; 1,000 and platelet count &lt;
             100,000 unless due to marrow infiltration or hypersplenism.

          3. Patients with organ dysfunction, including bilirubin of &gt; 2 mg% or serum creatinine
             level &gt; 2 mg%, unless the alteration is due to lymphoma.

          4. Patients with HIV infection should not be registered on this protocol.

          5. Patients with an antecedent malignancy whose prognosis is poor (&lt; 90% probability of
             surviving for 5 yrs).

          6. All patients should have a cardiac ejection fraction of 50% or more by
             echocardiography or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA).

          7. Patients who will not accept transfusions of blood products or supportive care
             measures such as antibiotics are not eligible for this study.

          8. Female patients must not be pregnant or lactating, and men and women of reproductive
             potential must follow accepted birth control methods.

          9. Patients who have received prior murine antibody therapy will be excluded.

         10. Patients with evidence of active or prior infection of Hepatitis B are excluded.
             (Note: Persons vaccinated for Hepatitis B who have + antibodies are not excluded).
