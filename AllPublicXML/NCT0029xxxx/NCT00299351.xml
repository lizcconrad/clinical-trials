  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of extended treatment with depsipeptide in patients
      who have at least demonstrated stable disease on prior Gloucester-sponsored depsipeptide
      clinical trials, and in the opinion of their physician/ investigator might benefit from
      continued treatment with depsipeptide

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Written informed consent/ authorization Patient has completed 6 cycles of therapy in a
        prior Gloucester-sponsored depsipeptide clinical trial Patient has immediate past
        participation (not to exceed 21 days from Day 15 of cycle 6 in the previous study) in a
        prior Gloucester-sponsored depsipeptide clinical trial Patient has demonstrated stable
        disease, partial response or complete response as best overall response in their prior
        Gloucester-sponsored depsipeptide clinical trial and such response must be ongoing at the
        time of enrollment Patient must have serum potassium levels &gt;4.0mEq/L and serum magnesium
        levels &gt;2.0mg/dL Negative urine or serum pregnancy test on females of childbearing
        potential Sexually active females of child-bearing potential must be willing to practice
        reliable methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy after entering the trial Sexually
        active males must be willing to practice reliable methods of birht control after entering
        the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients wiht known cardiac abnormalities such as

          -  congenital long QT syndrome

             define whether or not CAD is present Patients who have had a myocardial infarction
             within 12 months of study entry. Patients with an ECG recorded at screening showing
