      Primary objective:

      To assess the effect of rimonabant on visceral fat area over a period of 12 months when
      prescribed with a mild hypocaloric diet in abdominally obese patients with metabolic syndrome

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of rimonabant over a period of 12 months on:

             -  Liver fat content using CT scan (Computed Tomography scan)

             -  Anthropometric measures (weight, waist circumference, body composition using Dual
                Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA))

             -  Lipid, lipoprotein profile

             -  Glycemia, insulinemia and HbA1c

             -  Adipokines, inflammatory and hemostatic markers

        -  To evaluate the percentage of patients with metabolic syndrome at 12 months

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of rimonabant in these patients

      In four selected US sites the effect of rimonabant at 12 months will be also assessed on:

        -  Basal lipolysis and insulin suppressed lipolysis (euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp).

        -  Resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation at rest using indirect calorimetry.

        -  Adipose tissue histology and expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid
           metabolism (superficial adipose tissue biopsy).
