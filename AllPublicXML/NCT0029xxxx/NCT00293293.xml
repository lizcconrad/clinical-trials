      RATIONALE: Chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Hypnosis, massage therapy, and healing touch may improve the quality of life of patients who
      are undergoing chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well giving hypnosis, massage therapy
      and healing touch changes outcomes in women receiving chemotherapy for newly diagnosed
      epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cavity cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether quality of life is improved in patients with epithelial ovarian,
           fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cavity cancer receiving hypnosis, massage therapy,
           and healing touch and standard chemotherapy as compared to patients receiving standard
           chemotherapy alone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine changes in immunologic response markers, chemotherapy side effects, and
           complication rates in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (standard therapy): Patients undergo standard chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian,
           fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Arm II (standard therapy with complementary alternative medicine): Patients undergo
           chemotherapy as in arm I. Patients also undergo massage over approximately 30 minutes
           and healing touch therapy over approximately 30 minutes with each course of chemotherapy
           1-6 and hypnosis over 30-60 minutes during courses 1, 2, and 4.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during courses 3 and 6 of chemotherapy, and then 6
      months after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months.

    <description>Measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Ovarian (FACT-O) questionnaire was used to assess patients' quality of life before each chemotherapy cycle. It is a standardized self-administered questionnaire measuring many aspects of quality of life (0 to 4; Not at all, A little bit, Some-what, Quite a bit, Very much) as related to patients with ovarian cancers. The quality of life measures include the total FACT-O score (minimum value 0, maximum value 200). Questionnaires are recoded in the final analysis phase so that a higher score reflected more adverse effects on quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Mental Health Inventory (MHI) Questionnaire Results - Average for Chemotherapy Alone vs. Chemotherapy Plus CAM</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to Cycle 1 (Day -2 to +1), Every 3rd cycle (1 cycle = approx 21 days) and 6 Months Post Chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The MHI asks questions about how the consumer is feeling and coping with usual life activities. It provides measurable information about the consumer's wellbeing (anxiety, depression, loss of emotional control, general positive affect and emotional ties). A single score based on all items designed as high level summary index of the person's mental health status. High scores on the Mental Health Index indicate greater psychological well being and relatively less psychological distress (range is 38-240).</description>

Patients received either intravenous paclitaxel and carboplatin on an every 3 week basis, or a combination of intravenous and intraperitoneal paclitaxel and cisplatin.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Analysis was conducted as intent-to-treat. All randomized patients were included, regardless of number of courses of chemotherapy, CAM therapy or survival. All women in the CAM arm of the trial received all prescribed CAM interventions. No investigational drugs were administered as a part of this protocol.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Quality of Life Comparison - Average FACT-O Scoring in Chemotherapy Alone vs. Chemotherapy Plus Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM)</title>
        <description>Measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Ovarian (FACT-O) questionnaire was used to assess patients' quality of life before each chemotherapy cycle. It is a standardized self-administered questionnaire measuring many aspects of quality of life (0 to 4; Not at all, A little bit, Some-what, Quite a bit, Very much) as related to patients with ovarian cancers. The quality of life measures include the total FACT-O score (minimum value 0, maximum value 200). Questionnaires are recoded in the final analysis phase so that a higher score reflected more adverse effects on quality of life.</description>

        <description>The MHI asks questions about how the consumer is feeling and coping with usual life activities. It provides measurable information about the consumer's wellbeing (anxiety, depression, loss of emotional control, general positive affect and emotional ties). A single score based on all items designed as high level summary index of the person's mental health status. High scores on the Mental Health Index indicate greater psychological well being and relatively less psychological distress (range is 38-240).</description>
