      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and prednisone,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others
      find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving
      bortezomib together with cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and rituximab may be an effective
      treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      bortezomib when given together with cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and rituximab and to see
      how well it works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when given in combination with
           rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (R-CP) in patients with relapsed or
           refractory indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders or mantle cell lymphoma. (phase
           I)

        -  Determine the frequency and duration of complete and partial responses in patients
           treated with two different treatment regimes. (phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the progression-free survival, event-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen. (phase II)

        -  Evaluate the toxicity profile of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II
      randomized, multicenter study. Patients in phase II are stratified according to disease
      (mantle cell lymphoma vs indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder vs transformed
      lymphoma).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and rituximab IV on day 1, oral prednisone
           on days 2-6, and bortezomib IV on days 2 and 7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and rituximab IV on day 1, oral
                prednisone on days 2-6, and bortezomib IV (at the MTD determined in phase I) on
                days 2, 5, 9, and 12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the
                absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and rituximab IV on day 1, oral
                prednisone on days 2-6, and bortezomib IV (at the MTD determined in phase I) on
                days 2 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of
                disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 4 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months thereafter.
