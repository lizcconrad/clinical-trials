      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab before
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or
      without trastuzumab in treating breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is comparing two different regimens of combination
      chemotherapy given together with or without trastuzumab to see how well they work in treating
      patients with stage II or stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare 2 neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens (docetaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and
           cyclophosphamide [TAC] vs doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel and
           carboplatin [ACAC]), in terms of toxicities and effectiveness as defined by the
           pathological complete remission rate, in patients with non HER2/neu overexpressing stage
           II or III breast cancer.

        -  Evaluate the probability of achieving a pathological complete remission when adding
           trastuzumab (Herceptin®) to ACAC in the subset of patients with HER2/neu overexpressing
           stage II or III breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Identify prognostic and predictive markers of outcome, recurrence, and targets of
           therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients with non HER2/neu overexpressing tumors are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with HER2/neu overexpressing tumors are
      assigned to arm III.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and docetaxel
           IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1;
           treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses. Patients then receive carboplatin IV on
           day 1 and paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15; treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel
           repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm II. They also receive trastuzumab
           (Herceptin®) IV weekly, beginning with the first doses of paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      Within 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab (Herceptin®), all
      patients undergo surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 105 patients will be accrued for this study.
