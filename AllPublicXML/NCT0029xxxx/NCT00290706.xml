      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Giving gemcitabine together with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when
      given together with gemcitabine and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory B-cell or T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial remission) in patients with relapsed
           or refractory aggressive B- or T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride and bortezomib.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure, duration of response, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II,
      open-label study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and bortezomib IV
           over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 9 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) OR the dose that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience DLT.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and bortezomib as in phase I at the
           MTD.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
