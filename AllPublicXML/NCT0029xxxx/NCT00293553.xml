  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the surgical treatment of choice
      for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis, ulcerative colitis with dysplasia
      or cancer, and patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis, an inflammatory
      process of the ileal pouch, is the most common long-term complication. Increased stool
      frequency, abdominal pain, and pelvic discomfort are suggestive of pouchitis, approximately
      40% of patients with these symptoms have no or minimal inflammation of the pouch or rectal
      cuff on endoscopy and histopathology. These patients have a condition resembling irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), which we termed the irritable pouch syndrome (IPS). The RATIONALE and
      FEASIBILITY for the proposed study are: 1) IPS occurs in a substantial number of patients
      with IPAA, significantly affecting the quality of life. However, IPS is rare in the general
      population, and is considered an orphan disease. Studies such as those we propose can only be
      conducted in centers with a large number of patients with IPAA. The Cleveland Clinic has
      maintained the world's largest ileal pouch registry, with a total of more the 2,500 patients;
      2) a series of investigations on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with inflammatory or
      functional diseases of IPS, notably the initial study of IPS, have been conducted by our
      team; 3) In contrast to IBS, the pathophysiology and treatment of IPS have not been studied.
      Our HYPOTHESES are that 1) similar to IBS, visceral hypersensitivity may play a role in the
      pathogenesis of IPS, and 2) amitriptyline, a safe and effective agent for patients with IBS,
      will be more effective than placebo in alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life in
      patients with IPS. The AIMS of the study are to 1) investigate visceral hypersensitivity
      using barostat examination of the pouch; 2) conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial evaluating the use of amitriptyline in IPS.
