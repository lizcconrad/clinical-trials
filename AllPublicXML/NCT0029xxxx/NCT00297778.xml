  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinsons Disease (PD) is caused by a decrease of dopamine in a particular part of the
      brain. Dopamine is a messenger substance (neurotransmitter) that is used by the cells of the
      brain (nerve cells) to control and harmonize muscle movements. Consequently, the main
      manifestations of the disease affect movement and include tremor, muscular rigidity, slowness
      in performing movements and loss of balance.

      However, the disease affects also other, non motor functions and may cause other disorders,
      such as depression. Depression may be a reaction to the disability caused by the disease, but
      many studies show that depression is more common in PD than in other chronic debilitating
      illnesses. Moreover, there is also a biological explanation for the phenomenon: dopamine is
      also used in brain circuits involved in the experience of pleasure, and loss of pleasure in
      daily physical or social activity is one of the key manifestations of depression.

      The objective of the study is to assess whether pramipexole, at doses approved for the
      treatment of PD symptoms, is more effective than placebo in resolving depressive symptoms in
      PD patients.

      Also data on the safety of the product in the disease will be collected.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life Scale (EUROQOL (EQ)-5D) Overall Index Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>This is a 5-item patient reported measure of health status developed for use in evaluating health and healthcare. It produces a numeric score for health status on which full health has a value of 1 and death has a value of 0. Euro-QOL describes health status in terms of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D measures health status on a continuous scale ranging from 0 (dead) to 1 (full health)</description>

        <description>The VAS is a method used for the measurement of pain. The patient is asked to place a mark on an uncalibrated (usually 0 – 10 cm) line representing the patient’s degree of general pain. The two extremities of the line were taken to represent ‘no pain’ and ‘unbearable pain’, respectively. VAS pain scores could range from 0 (no pain) to 100 (unbearable pain).</description>
