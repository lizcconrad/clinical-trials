      This study is being done to measure the functions of the stomach after eating a meal and to
      develop a new method that will simultaneously measure both gastric emptying and the
      relaxation of the stomach after a meal using nuclear medicine testing. This would make the
      testing more convenient for patients and will also offer better understanding of these two
      gastric functions.
