      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      intravenously administered MEDI-545 compared with placebo, over a dose escalation range of
      0.3-30 mg/kg, in adult patients with SLE and who are receiving 20 mg/day or less of
      prednisone orally or an equivalent dose of another oral corticosteroid.

          -  Current background treatments may include the following medications prior to
             randomization: acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and
             antimalarials, such as hydroxychloroquine ≤ 600 mg/day, and prednisone ≤ 20 mg daily
             (or an equivalent dose of another oral corticosteroid) for at least 28 days

          -  Sexually active females, unless surgically sterile or at least two years
             post-menopausal, must use an effective method of avoiding pregnancy (including oral,
             injectable, transdermal, or implanted contraceptives, IUD, female condom, diaphragm
             with spermicide, cervical cap, abstinence, use of a condom by the sexual partner or
             sterile sexual partner) for 28 days before the first dose of study drug, and must
             agree to continue using such precautions through the study period of 84 days.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible
             physician. Sexually active males, unless surgically sterile, must likewise use an
             effective method of birth control (condom or abstinence) and must agree to continue
             using such precautions through Study Day 84.

          -  Ability to complete follow-up period of 84 days as required by the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Weight ≥ 120 kg

          -  Use of cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil or
             cyclosporine within 28 days before study entry

          -  Use of doses of corticosteroids higher than the equivalent of prednisone 20 mg/day (or
             an equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) within 28 days before study entry

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, a likelihood of requiring initiation of
             immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., prednisone &gt;20 mg daily (or an equivalent dose of
             another oral corticosteroid), azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine,
             methotrexate, or dapsone) within the 28 days after study entry. Antimalarial dosing
             must be held constant during the study, but analgesics and NSAIDs may be varied.

          -  Current treatment with coumadin

          -  Treatment with immunoglobulin or blood products within 28 days before entry into the
