    <textblock>
      The principle aim is to determine the efficacy of eplerenone in patients with diastolic heart
      failure to reverse cardiac remodeling and to improve diastolic function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single center, double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial enrolling a
      minimum of 80 patients designed to determine the efficacy of eplerenone in subjects with
      diastolic heart failure. Prior to administration of study medication, a medical history,
      physical exam, blood draw, electrocardiogram, 2D echocardiogram, and cardiomyopathy
      questionnaire will be performed. Subjects will then be randomized to receive either
      eplerenone 25 mg once daily or placebo for 2 weeks. At the Week 2 visit all patients will be
      titrated up to the next dose (50 mg eplerenone once daily or placebo). Each study arm will
      have 40 subjects who will participate for 9 months. Follow-up assessments will be completed
      at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months.

      Starting at the Month 1 visit, any subjects with uncontrolled blood pressure will be
      administered add-on therapy of HCTZ (starting dose of 12.5 mg daily, that may titrate up to
      25 mg daily) and/or amlodipine (starting dose at 5 mg daily, that may titrate up to 10 mg
      daily). Any subject who receives add-on therapy must have their blood pressure checked within
      2 weeks. Uncontrolled blood pressure may be treated by either increasing the add-on therapy
      dose or increasing the add-on therapy regimen to include both add-on drugs. Changes in add-on
      therapy require blood pressure checks within 2 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment
        into the study:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female (if female, either post-menopausal, or if of child-bearing
             potential, using adequate contraception e.g. hormonal or barrier methods, or
             surgically sterile, and not lactating)

          2. Age &gt;/= 18 years of age

          3. Present or prior history of symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue) consistent
             with diagnosis of diastolic heart failure, following optimized medical therapy
             including blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors and/or beta-blockers for 2 weeks
             or over.

          4. Echocardiographic evidence of preserved left ventricular systolic function (LVEF &gt;/=
             45%) and evidence of diastolic dysfunction (by transmitral inflow, pulmonary venous
             flow, color M-mode and/or tissue Doppler).
