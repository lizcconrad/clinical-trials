  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transvaginal ultrasound of the cervix has become a common tool to evaluate patients who are
      at risk for preterm delivery. A shortened cervical length has been associated with an
      increased risk of preterm delivery. Dynamic cervical change is visible shortening(&gt;6mm) of
      the cervix seen during the ultrasound examination. Prior studies have shown that the presence
      of dynamic change in patients with a shortened cervical length(&lt;3cm) is not independently
      predictive of preterm delivery. However, a subset of patients with normal initial cervical
      length(&gt;3cm) and dynamic change did demonstrate an increased rate of preterm delivery.
      Because this was a small sub-group, the present study was designed to obtain a larger sample
      size for further evaluation. The second focus of this study involves patients with a dilated
      cervix and whether cervical length adds predictive value to gestational age at delivery.

      Patients presenting to with symptomatic preterm labor(vaginal pressure or uterine
      contractions), who consent to the study, will undergo the standard evaluation for preterm
      labor(described in detail below.) The only additional evaluation is a prolonged transvaginal
      ultrasound of approximately 10 minutes to evaluate for the presence of dynamic change during
      a contraction.

      Null hypothesis:

      Symptomatic preterm labor patients, with normal initial cervical length(&gt;3cm), who exhibit
      dynamic cervical change deliver at a gestational age equal to those without dynamic change.

      Alternative hypothesis:

      Symptomatic preterm labor patients, with normal initial cervical length(&gt;3cm), who exhibit
      dynamic cervical change deliver at an earlier gestational age than those without dynamic
      change.
