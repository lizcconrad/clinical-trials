      RATIONALE: Antibiotics, such as daptomycin and vancomycin, may be effective in treating
      bacteria in the blood. It is not yet known whether daptomycin is more effective than
      vancomycin in treating bacteria in the blood in patients with neutropenia caused by
      chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying daptomycin to see how well it works
      compared with vancomycin in treating bacteria in the blood in patients with neutropenia
      caused by chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the safety of daptomycin vs vancomycin in cancer patients with
           chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and gram-positive bacteremia.

        -  Compare the efficacy of these drugs, in terms of fever resolution, bacteremia
           resolution, inflammation indicators reduction, implanted catheter salvage, and reduced
           need for antifungal therapy, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive daptomycin IV over 30 minutes once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vancomycin IV over 60 minutes twice daily. Treatment in both
           arms continues for approximately 7-14 days or until microbiologic failure,
           unsatisfactory clinical (symptomatic) response, or fever and neutropenia is resolved
           (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm^3 on ≥ 2 consecutive days). Patients may be
           removed from the study if the isolate is found to be sensitive to the original
           antibiotics or resistant to either of the study drugs.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
