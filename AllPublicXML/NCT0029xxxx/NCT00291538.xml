  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label randomised phase I trial, bortezomib will be administrated to 2 groups of
      10 patients with MM who have inclusion criteria use the extended 2nd line indication, either
      intravenously (group 1 = 10 patients) or subcutaneously (group 2 = 10 patients). The schedule
      of administration of bortezomib will be the following : 1.3 mg per square meter of
      body-surface area twice weekly for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week without treatment, for up to
      eight cycles, either IV (group 1) or SC (group 2).

      The primary objective is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the 2 routes of
      administration.

      The secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacodynamics (20S proteasome inhibition
      in whole blood), toxicity, including cardiac safety, and efficacy of the 2 routes of
      administration.
