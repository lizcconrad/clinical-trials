      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with anti-IL-5 antibody has a
      prednisone-sparing effect in patients with symptomatic eosinophilic bronchitis (with or
      without asthma).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic bronchitis, which is identified by quantitative sputum cell counts (eosinophils
      greater than 2%) is responsive to corticosteroid treatment. It occurs alone or in association
      with asthma or in some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In most
      patients the eosinophilic bronchitis responds to treatment with inhaled steroids but in some
      it requires a minimum dose of prednisone to keep it controlled. At present, there is no
      outstanding drug which can have a prednisone-sparing effect.

      Interleukin (IL)-5 is a cytokine specifically focused on the development, differentiation,
      recruitment, activation and survival of the eosinophil. The specificity of IL-5 has raised
      the possibility that blocking it's activity, using humanized monoclonal antibodies, may be
      useful therapy for eosinophilic bronchitis. Such an antibody (SB-240563) has been introduced
      for clinical trial. The investigators will compare its effect versus placebo in patients with
      prednisone-dependant symptomatic eosinophilic bronchitis (with or without asthma) before and
      after a reduction in prednisone dose to identify if it has a prednisone-sparing effect.

      The study is divided into 3 sequential study periods. Period 1: symptomatic eosinophilic
      bronchitis (with or without asthma) on the same dose of prednisone for 6-weeks or more.
      Period 2: standardized prednisone reduction (and inhaled steroid if prednisone is
      discontinued during the study treatment) at intervals of 4-weeks until there is a clinical
      and eosinophilic exacerbation or bothersome steroid withdrawl effects. Period 3: washout.

      The patients will be seen every 2 weeks. Intravenous injections of SB-240563 750mg or placebo
      will be given at weeks 2,6,10,14 and 18. Doses of prednisone will be reduced in a standard
      way.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients, aged 18-70 years, who have been followed as an outpatient and who have
             been found to require a minimum dose of prednisone treatment (in addition to high-dose
             inhaled steroid treatment) to prevent frequent exacerbations associated with induced
             sputum eosinophilia.

          2. Patients will be enrolled if, at screening and baseline visits, they demonstrate
             sputum eosinophilia and symptoms. The symptoms may effect activity and sleep but
             should not, in the opinion of the treating physician, be severe enough to be of
             concern.

          3. While FEV1 after withholding bronchodilators appropriately, before and after inhaled
             salbutamol (200 mg), and methacholine PC20 will be measured, these need not be
             abnormal since the prednisone is required for the control of eosinophilic bronchitis
             and any clinical consequences of this, and because the bronchitis can occur without
             these features of asthma.

          4. On the same doses of corticosteroids for a least one-month.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy, breast-feeding or lack of effective contraception in females of
             childbearing potential or females who are postmenopausal &lt;1 year.

          2. Baseline FEV1 before bronchodilator of 40% or less of predicted. This lower FEV1 is
             acceptable since chronic airflow limitation secondary to the eosinophilic bronchitis
             or asthma is not an exclusion criteria. Neither is current or ex-cigarette smoking
             providing that the best FEV1 in these patients has been &gt;60% predicted normal or the
             best FEV1/VC ratio has been &gt;60% in the past two years.

          3. Exposure to a relevant seasonal environmental allergen, known to worsen asthma
             control, during the study period.

          4. Respiratory tract infection in the 4-weeks before the baseline visit.

          5. Clinical exacerbation requiring extra prednisone treatment in the 4-weeks before V1.

          6. Other cardiac, pulmonary, renal or systemic diseases that in the investigator's
             opinion may interfere with the study results or compromise subject's safety.

          7. Previous participation in any study using anti-monoclonal drug.
