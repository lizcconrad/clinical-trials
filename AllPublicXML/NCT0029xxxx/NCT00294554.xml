  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of memantine, compared to placebo
      (sugar pill), for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with idiopathic
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia. Memantine is used as a safe and effective treatment
      for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive impairment includes concentration and memory
      difficulties. We will look at how well this medication helps your cognitive impairment, how
      well you tolerate this medication (including its effects on your motor symptoms of PD) your
      activities of daily living, your emotions, and any medical conditions you might have. We will
      interview a person you choose as your &quot;informant&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, double-blind 24-week prospective study of
      memantine at the dosage range 5-20 mg/day in 20 outpatients with idiopathic PD and dementia
      secondary to PD. Using the dosage escalation regimen approved for Alzheimer disease, subjects
      will start memantine or comparable placebo at 5 mg daily and advance 5 mg/week to 20 mg /day
      by week 4, with dosing at 10 mg bid. Subjects will undergo 7 clinical visits over the 6-month
      trial (Screen, Baseline/Week 0, and Weeks 4, 8, 14, 20, and 24). The dosage can be titrated
      downward in increments of 5 mg to a minimum dose of 5 mg/day in the event memantine is not
      tolerated at the scheduled dosages. This broad dose range is being used because 1)a favorable
      cognitive response may be evident at lower doses of memantine than recommended for AD and
      2)adverse effects could emerge when typical AD dosing recommendations are used, as has been
      observed when treating PD patients with cholinesterase inhibitors. Subjects will remain on a
      stable dose of memantine/placebo after Week 8, unless precluded by adverse events. Ten
      subjects will be assigned to each treatment group. Randomization will be stratified according
      to whether subjects are taking a concomitant cholinesterase inhibitor. This will enable
      secondary group comparisons of treatment groups. Results from this initial small study will
      be used to evaluate the appropriateness of devising a larger-scale multi-site study of
      memantine for treatment of dementia in PD.

      The proposed assessment schedule was designed to represent use of memantine in general
      clinical practice and to minimize the burdens to caregivers and patients, who have impaired
      mobility as well as cognitive function.

    <description>The DRS is comprised of: Attention (ATT, 8 items); Initiation-Perseveration (I-P, 11 items); Construction (CONST, 6 items); Conceptualization (CONCEPT, 6 items); and Memory (MEM, 5 items). For this study, only the memory subscore was used, with score possibilities ranging from 0-5, with 5 meaning memory was perfect, 0 being no ability to recall. A negative score indicates a decrease in memory from baseline to 24 weeks.</description>

    <measure>CIBIC-Plus Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CIBIC-Plus is based upon clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial. It relies on both direct examination of the patient and interview of informants. It takes into account a subject's overall function in the cognitive, behavioral and functional activity domains. Scoring is based on an interview with the caregiver and examination of the patient by an independent evaluator, without consulting other information such as cognitive test results. It requires the assessor to consider a number of cognitive, functional, and behavioral areas prior to providing an overall &quot;global&quot; assessment of clinical change. 7-point categorical scale that provides a single global rating of change from baseline.A score of 1 indicates marked improvement;and a score of 7, marked worsening.</description>

          <title>NART (Full Scale IQ)</title>
          <description>The National Adult Reading Test (NART) consists of 50 words with irregular phonetic spelling and pronunciation. Score ranges from 0-50, based on the number of words correctly pronounced. The NART score can be used to estimate IQ. Calculating the full scale IQ is done as 127.8-0.78(number of errors on NART). The higher the score, the higher the IQ.
IQ Scores:
Over 140 - Genius or near genius. 120 - 140 - Very superior intelligence. 110 - 119 - Superior intelligence. 90 - 109 - Normal or average intelligence. 80 - 89 - Dullness. 70 - 79 - Borderline deficiency.</description>

For this study, only the memory subscore was used, with score possibilities ranging from 0-5, with 5 meaning memory was perfect, 0 being no ability to recall. A negative score indicates a decrease in memory from baseline to 24 weeks.</description>

        <title>CIBIC-Plus Score</title>
        <description>CIBIC-Plus is based upon clinicians’ observations of change in the patient’s cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial. It relies on both direct examination of the patient and interview of informants. It takes into account a subject’s overall function in the cognitive, behavioral and functional activity domains. Scoring is based on an interview with the caregiver and examination of the patient by an independent evaluator, without consulting other information such as cognitive test results. It requires the assessor to consider a number of cognitive, functional, and behavioral areas prior to providing an overall “global” assessment of clinical change. 7-point categorical scale that provides a single global rating of change from baseline.A score of 1 indicates marked improvement;and a score of 7, marked worsening.</description>
