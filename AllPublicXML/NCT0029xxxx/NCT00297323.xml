  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the safety of topiramate in adults and
      children with epilepsy (or seizures) who have not received or have not responded to treatment
      with previous antiepileptic medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is a medication that is approved for the treatment of seizures. In accordance with
      international guidelines, studies are conducted after a drug is marketed to continue to
      evaluate and expand the knowledge regarding its safety. This is a multi-center, open-label
      observational safety study to collect information regarding the dosage, tolerability and
      effectiveness of topiramate in adults and children with epilepsy (or seizures). Patients who
      have not received previous treatment for epilepsy or for whom previous treatment was
      ineffective or intolerable will receive 6 months of treatment with topiramate. Topiramate
      will be given at low doses initially and gradually increased as needed for each patient to
      control seizure activity. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events and laboratory
      tests) and assessment of patient health status will be performed throughout the study.
      Effectiveness will be evaluated by recording the frequency of seizures occurring during the
      study. Patient and physician satisfaction with topiramate treatment will also be recorded. At
      the end of the study, the treating physician may continue treatment with topiramate in
      responding patients as appropriate. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will be effective
      in achieving and maintaining control of seizure activity and is well-tolerated. Observational
      study - No investigational drug administered.

        In this study a total number of 75 patients will be enrolled. Adults and children over 2
        years of age who are eligible according to the approved SmPC of topiramate and their
        seizures are not manageable. Patients with new exposure to an AE treatment for epilepsy or
        lack of response to the previous treatment. Patients who will agree to sign the written
        informed consent for the anonymous and confidential use of their medical data with their
        participation in the study or a relative or a legal authorised representative.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not received previous treatment with antiepileptic medications or
             patients who did not respond to previous treatment with antiepileptic medications,
             defined as a lack of effectiveness of the medication(s), or the inability to take the
             medication(s) due to adverse effects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not suffering from epilepsy, whose seizures are due to other causes including
             disease, exposure to harmful substances, active infection or tumor and are manageable

          -  Patients with a hypersensitivity to topiramate or to some of its components

          -  Patients who should not take Topiramate for reasons listed in its approved Summary of
             Product Characteristics (printed information about a medication that describes its
             actions, side effects and intended patients)

          -  Patients who are uncooperative or for whom obtaining compliance with study visit
             schedules and procedures and information required by the study would be difficult
