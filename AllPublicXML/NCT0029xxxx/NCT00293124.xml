    <textblock>
      The rationale is to assess the clinical and biological activity of Imatinib and to compare
      the data with historic data.

      Additionally this study has been designed to gain more experience with the treatment of GIST
      in several Central and Eastern European Countries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter open label clinical trial to be performed in patients with incurable
      malignant GISTs that are unresectable or metastatic. Approximately 150 patients will enter
      the trial.

      Patients will receive Imatinib 400 mg p.o./day for a period of up to 24 months provided that
      in the opinion of the investigator the patient is benefiting from treatment with Imatinib,
      and in the absence of any safety concerns.

      Treatment after completion of the 24 months study is at the discretion of the investigator.
      Imatinib should be increased to 600 mg p.o./day and then to 400 mg b.i.d if the patient is
      progressing on the respective dose level.
