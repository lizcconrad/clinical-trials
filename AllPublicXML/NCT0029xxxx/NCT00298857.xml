  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the blood levels of valproic acid in subjects with
      different body weights and to evaluate whether the pharmacokinetic parameters of this drug is
      altered in the obese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many pharmacologic agents are dosed based on the weight of the patient, and studies are
      conducted to determine the appropriate doses of drugs for patients with different weights in
      order to find the safest and most effective dose for various weights. Valproic acid is a
      commonly used agent for the treatment of epilepsy, as well as migraine headaches and
      psychiatric disorders. This prospective study is designed to evaluate the effects of obesity
      on the pharmacokinetic parameters of valproic acid when compared to individuals at their
      healthy weight.
