  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients having cardiac surgery to correct their heart disease may suffer a decline in mental
      and neurologic abilities. Passage of small particles of fat, tissue waste and air bubbles to
      the brain while on the heart-lung machine is thought to be one cause for decline in mental
      and neurologic abilities (the function of brain) after surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if replacement of cardiotomy suction (one part of
      the heart-lung machine) with the cell-saver (a different part of the heart-lung machine)
      during surgery will help to prevent a decline in mental and neurologic abilities after
      surgery. investigating 312 patients over 2 years,patients will be assigned randomly to either
      cardiotomy suction or cell-saver group. Patients will be given questionnaires before surgery,
      6 weeks and 1-year after surgery. These questionnaires will assess memory, attention span,
      the ability to concentrate and the quality of life. Patients will also have a brief
      neurologic exam (physical examination to check mental state, reflexes, strength, and balance)
      before surgery, 3-5 days after surgery, 6 weeks and 1-year after surgery to determine any
      changes. Cell-saver separates red blood cells from tissue waste products and fat prior to
      returning blood back to the patient and may reduce the negative effects of particles of fat,
      tissue waste and air bubbles have on the brain. Potential benefits of cell-saver device when
      used during surgery may prevent the decrease in memory, attention span, and the ability to
      concentrate resulting in improved quality of life after surgery.

      Objectives: The primary aim is to determine the effect of continuous flow cell-saver on short
      and long term neurocognitive function after cardiac surgery, measured by precise preoperative
      and postoperative psychometric and neurologic testing. Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis:
      Continuous flow cell-saver reduces postoperative neurocognitive decline following cardiac
      surgery. Methodology: 312 informed and consenting patients, age &gt; 65 years, scheduled for
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery will be prospectively enrolled over a 2-year period.
      Patients will be randomly allocated to either the continuous flow cell-saver or conventional
      cardiotomy suction (controls). Neurological history and physical exam will be completed
      preoperatively, discharge, 6-weeks and 1-year after surgery. Transcranial Doppler scanning
      will be used for intraoperative monitoring of cerebral embolic load. Transesophageal
      echocardiography and epiaortic scanning will be employed to account for the severity of the
      aortic atheroma scores. Neurocognitive testing and quality of life assessment will be
      conducted preoperatively , 6-weeks and 1-year after surgery. Significance: The utilization of
      continuous flow cell-saver may reduce the negative effects of fat particles, tissue waste and
      air emboli have on brain.
