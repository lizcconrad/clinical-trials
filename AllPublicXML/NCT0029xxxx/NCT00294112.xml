      Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), derived from healthy adult volunteer human donors, can
      be obtained from bone marrow donation and cultured in the laboratory. MSCs have shown the
      ability to find injured tissue, reduce and control inflammation, and assist in tissue repair.

      Prochymal™ MSCs will be infused into patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.
      Infusions will occur on two separate days, 7-10 days apart. Patients will be monitored for
      reduced Crohn's disease symptoms.

             enrollment.

               -  The dose of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) must have been stable for at least 4
                  weeks prior to enrollment.

               -  The dose of steroids must have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to
