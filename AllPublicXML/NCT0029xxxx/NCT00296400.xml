    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>797 patients entered the study with moderate proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia and were receiving stable treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for 3 or more months prior to Visit 1. The study was conducted at 114 participating centers in 11 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>237 patients [pts] completed the 8-week lead-in period and were randomized. The most common reasons for discontinuation during the lead in period included incorrect enrollment (466 pts), development of study-specific discontinuation criteria (41 pts), and voluntary discontinuation (29 pts). 189 patients completed the study.</pre_assignment_details>
