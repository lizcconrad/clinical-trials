      This Phase IIb study will be conducted at centres in several European countries according to
      a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind design. It will provide information
      about the clinical and immunological efficacy and the tolerability of GSK 249553 when this is
      administered to patients with stage IB, II NSCLC. The study treatment will be administered by
      intramuscular injection; first administration will take place 4-6 weeks after surgery. The
      Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent has been obtained prior to surgical tumour resection and
             prior to the performance of any other protocol-specific procedures.

          -  At least 18 years of age at the time of resection.

          -  Pathologically proven, surgically staged squamous or non-squamous IB, IIA or IIB
             NSCLC, and complete surgical resection.

          -  The operative technique for resection of the patient's tumour involves at least a
             lobectomy or a sleeve lobectomy, conforming to all of the following criteria:

               1. Removal of all gross disease with negative resection margins, by lobectomy,
                  sleeve resection, bilobectomy or pneumonectomy, based on intra-operative
                  findings.

               2. The level of nodal sampling is at least as follows:

        Levels 4, 7, 10 in both right upper and right middle lobes Levels 4, 7, 9, 10 in right
        lower lobe Levels 5, 6, 7 in left upper lobe Levels 7, 9, 10 in left lower lobe. or at the
        maximum defined as systematic radical mediastinal lymphadenectomy: all ipsilateral and
        easily accessible lymph-node levels must be removed, independently of the location of the
        primary tumour. The level of nodal sampling is as follows: Levels 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 in
        right-sided tumours, Levels 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in left-sided tumours

          -  Tumour shows expression of MAGE-3 antigen.

          -  Recovered from surgery for at least 4 weeks and not more than 6 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 1 at the time of randomisation.

          -  Laboratory criteria (all of the following must be fulfilled): adequate bone marrow
             reserve, adequate renal function, adequate hepatic function, serum bilirubin within
             normal range, negative HIV antibody test, negative HBV antigen test, negative HCV
             antibody test.

          -  (For females): EITHER not of child-bearing potential OR sexually abstinent OR all of
             the following: negative urine/serum β-HCG pregnancy test, use of adequate
             contraceptive precautions for 30 days before first vaccination. Agree to continue such
             precautions for 2 months after completion of the course of vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received any anti-cancer specific treatment including radiotherapy, prior to surgery,

             or carcinoma in situ of the cervix (see exclusion criterion no. 10).

          -  Candidate for post-surgery radiation therapy or any kind of anti-cancer-specific
             treatment.

          -  Pregnant/lactating.

          -  Received a major organ allograft.

          -  Malignancies at other sites (except (i) basal and localised squamous-cell skin
             carcinoma that has been successfully treated, and (ii) carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix).

          -  Concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, that would
             significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to
             unacceptable risk.

          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure or hypertension.

          -  Unstable heart disease or uncontrolled arrhythmia at the time of enrolment.

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise ability to give informed
             consent, or to comply with the trial procedures.

          -  Any evidence of residual tumour after surgery.

          -  Require concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids, or any other
             immunosuppressive agents.

          -  Received chemotherapy, immunotherapy related to NSCLC.

          -  Need home oxygenation.

          -  Received any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study
