    <textblock>
      A single arm, open-label phase II is appropriate to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dose
      - dense combination of paclitaxel with cisplatin supported by pegfilgrastim for neo-adjuvant
      chemotherapy in this patient population.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm Phase II study of dose-dense regimen with paclitaxel and
      cisplatin supported by pegfilgrastim as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable
      stage II, IIA NSCLC.

      Paclitaxel will be administered via intravenous infusion over approximately 3 hours at dose
      of 175mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Cisplatin 75mg/m2 will be given via intravenous
      infusion on day 1 (after paclitaxel) according to institutional guidelines.

      Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) fixed dose of 6mg (0.6mL of a 10mg/mL solution) as a single
      subcutaneous injection on Day 2 of each study cycle.

      All drugs will be given in 2-weekly cycle. Three cycles of pre-operative chemotherapy are
      planned.
