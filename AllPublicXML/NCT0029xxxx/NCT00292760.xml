      This is a phase II open label study for patients with p53-deleted CLL who require treatment.
      Both untreated and previously treated patients are eligible for study entry.

      The trial consists of giving continuous alemtuzumab and cyclical high-dose
      methyl-prednisone.Alentuzumab is given intravenously during the first 4 weeks of treatment to
      ensure that adequate serum levels are achieved quickly. The drug will be administered daily
      during the first week, commencing at a dose of 3mg, and increasing to 10mg and then up to the
      target dose of 30mg as tolerated.Thereafter alemtuzumab will be given at a dose 30mg thrice
      weekly. From week 5, alemtuzumab will be given at the same dose but by the subcutaneous route
      of administration.

      Methlyprednisolone will be given for 5 consecutive days at a daily dose of 1.0g/m2, starting
      on Day 1 and repeating the cycle every 28 days.

      Treatment will be given for 16 weeks (i.e 4 cycles of methylprednisolone). Treatment will be
      discontinued if there is no response after 8 weeks, or if toxicity becomes unacceptable.
