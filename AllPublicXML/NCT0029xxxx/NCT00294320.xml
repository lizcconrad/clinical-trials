  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of two techniques to monitor the
      clearance of AK lesions when treated with Aldara 5% cream.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each technique will be assessed by comparison of lesion counts (clinical and sub-clinical)
      revealed by the techniques, at start and end of the study and those demonstrated during
      treatment. In addition a qualitative assessment of each technique will be made for
      performance and ease of use.
