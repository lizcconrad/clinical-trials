      (child, parents) after a road traffic accident shall be examined in a sample of 100 children
      and adolescents. After a baseline assessment 7-10 days after the accident participants are
      randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. Both are re-assessed at 2 and 6
      months after the accident by means of standardized questionnaires assessing posttraumatic
      stress symptoms, depression, and behavior.
