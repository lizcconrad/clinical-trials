  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is complicated by considerable cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality, at least partly due to hypertension. Nocturnal hypoxia, hypercapnia and acidosis
      stimulate chemoreceptors and presumably increased secretion of vasoactive hormones which
      might be responsible for hypertension in these patients.

      The aim of this study is to measure the secretion of vasoactive hormones at night and to
      analyse the relationship between vasoactive hormones, oxygen saturation and the blood
      pressure at night.
