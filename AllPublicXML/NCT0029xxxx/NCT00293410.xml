    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of clofarabine and
      cyclophosphamide in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, chronic
      myelogenous leukemia, or myeloproliferative disorders.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and tolerability of administering clofarabine and fractionated
           cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, chronic
           myelogenous leukemia, or high-risk myeloproliferative disorders

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine and fractionated cyclophosphamide in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of these drugs in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Obtain preliminary data of biologic and pharmacodynamic effects of this regimen on
           marrow and circulating leukemic blasts in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to age (adult vs
      child).

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day 0. Patients then receive clofarabine
      IV over 2 hours and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 1-3 and 8-10. Treatment with
      clofarabine and cyclophosphamide repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of clofarabine and cyclophosphamide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 10 patients
      are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
