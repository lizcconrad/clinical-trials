  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mixed cancer vaccines, CHP-HER2 protein and CHP-NY-ESO-1 protein, are to be studied to
      evaluate the safety and immune responses in patients who are positive either or both
      antigens. Nine patients will be enrolled, who are refractory to standard therapies for cancer
      or at high risk to relapse. CHP-HER2 and CHP-NY-ESO-1 are subcutaneously given on bimonthly
      basis, together with OK-432(Picibanil) as an immunoadjuvant. Six doses will be given.
      Toxicity profiles will be monitored, and antigen specific humoral anad T cell responses will
      be described.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological confirmation of cancer.

          2. HER2 expression in tumor cells scored as 1+ or more which should be confirmed by IHC
             using at least two antibodies (archived issue; see Appendix 1 and Reference 1 for
             methodology).

             or NY-ESO-1 expression by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

          3. Patients must

               1. are at high risk of recurrence, more than 25% of probability, after complete
                  resection or even after post-operative adjuvant treatment, and effective adjuvant
                  therapy is not available or refused; or

               2. have metastatic disease, and treatment has failed, or in the situation where
                  effective therapy is not available, or has been refused.

          4. Complete recovery from surgery (at least 4 weeks).

         11. Concomitant treatment with steroids. Topical or inhalational steroids are permitted.

         12. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent
             within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

         13. Pregnancy or nursing .

         14. Refusal, by women of childbearing potential, to use medically acceptable means of
