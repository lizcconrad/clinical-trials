      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing.
      Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the blood flow to the tumor and keeping
      chemotherapy drugs near the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well chemoembolization using doxorubicin works
      in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the feasibility of chemoembolization with GelSpheres™ beads
           mixed with doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo catheterization of the hepatic artery followed by chemoembolization
      comprising an infusion of GelSpheres™ beads mixed with doxorubicin hydrochloride into the
      target hepatic artery. Patients may receive up to 3 chemoembolization treatments.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 1
      year, and then every 3 months during year 2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
