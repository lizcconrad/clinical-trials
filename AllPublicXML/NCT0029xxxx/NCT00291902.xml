          -  Planned PCI with multi-vessel stenting.

          -  Planned PCI with additional revascularization procedures staged at different days
             during the study period.

          -  Planned PCI of any bypass graft.

          -  History of CABG surgery.

          -  Planned cardiac or major non-cardiac surgery within the study period.
