  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2000, a pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine (PCV) was licensed for use in children and is now part of the routine childhood
      vaccine schedule. PCV is known to reduce invasive disease and protect against nasopharyngeal
      (NP) acquisition of vaccine serotype pneumococci; it also results in an increased risk of
      nonvaccine serotype carriage. This study proposes to assess the longterm impact of vaccine on
      NP carriage in a setting where there is intense antibody pressure on the ecology of the
      pneumococcus. A cross sectional study of pneumococcal NP colonization among American Indian
      children will be combined with surveillance for invasive disease in the same population. The
      purpose is to determine the impact of community wide PCV use on NP colonization and the
      relationship with invasive disease. This longterm safety issue needs to be assessed to fully
      evaluate the impact of vaccine on NP ecology and invasive disease.

      There are four specific aims for this study: (1) to determine the overall and serotype
      specific prevalence and incidence of pneumococcal carriage among children and adults at high
      risk for carriage and disease in the era of routine pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) use
      compared with those measures in the same population prior to use of PCV vaccine; (2) to
      characterize the intrafamilial NP transmission of clones among those living with children
      less than 8 years of age; (3) to determine the immune correlates of protection from serotype
      specific pneumococcal carriage among individuals immunized and not immunized with PCV; and
      (4) to determine the relative invasiveness of serotypes of pneumococcus during an era of
      widespread PCV use and compare this to the relative invasiveness of serotypes prior to
      routine use of PCV.
