  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with chronic renal disease show a loss of the nocturnal decline of blood
      pressure (non-dipper). However, the mechanism is not yet fully understood. We evaluate
      24-hour blood pressure in patients with chronic renal disease using an ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring device (A &amp; D TM2425). We also analyze the power spectrum of heart rate
      variability as an index of autonomic cardiovascular modulation using the same device.

      The ratio of lower frequency (LF) and higher frequency (HF) heart rate rhythmic oscillations
      is expressed as an index of sympathovagal balance. Patients with chronic renal disease
      participate in the study. Blood pressure and power spectrum of heart rate variability for 24
      hours are measured when they receive no medication for at least 1 week. The mean waking and
      sleeping time systolic and diastolic blood pressure are calculated. LF/HF ratios in the
      chronic renal disease are evaluated to calculate the waking/sleeping ratio for LF/HF.
