      Participants were

        -  administered study medication approximately 28 days after initial surgery for ovarian
           cancer

        -  received the study treatment regimen of up to one year unless there was disease
           progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, participant refusal, or treatment delay
           beyond the time frame permitted for each treatment

      Participants were followed for survival for a minimum 3 years from the date of enrollment

    <measure>Twelve-month Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate in Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months following treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments were performed by Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to evaluate disease progression based on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Disease progression was recorded as any one of the following:
appearance of a new lesion
symptomatic deterioration
progression of target or nontarget lesions
death
Participants who did not die or show show disease progression achieved PFS. PFS rate is the percent of participants who achieved PFS.</description>

    <measure>Twenty Four-month Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate in Participants</measure>

    <description>Tumor assessments were performed by Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to evaluate disease progression based on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Disease progression was recorded as any one of the following:

symptomatic deterioration

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 1300 days following treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Time to PFS was the interval from the date of registration to the earliest date of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first.
Time of PFS was censored
on the last available tumor assessment date for participants leaving the study prior to disease progression or death; and also for participants requiring off-study medication or additional debulking surgery (where assessment date used was the one prior to off-study medication or surgery),
at Day 1, for living participants with no post-baseline tumor assessments.
Median PFS was estimated from a Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>

    <measure>Tumor Response Rate Based on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months following treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Tumors were assessed by CT and MRI. Tumor response was evaluated by GOG RECIST in which:
Complete response (CR) was the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with no evidence of new lesions
Partial response (PR) was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all measurable target lesions
Participants with a response (CR or PR) were to have the initial response confirmed by tumor imaging in 4-6 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Twelve-month Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) Rate in Participants With Non Measurable Disease at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months following treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with Recurrence-free survival (RFS) were participants with a non-measurable disease at baseline, who had not achieved disease progression nor had died.
Disease progression included the following:
the appearance of a new lesion
symptomatic deterioration
progression of non-target lesions
a predefined serum CA 125 increase.
RFS rate was the percent of participants in the non-measurable disease subgroup who achieved RFS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) in Participants With Non-measurable Disease at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 1500 days following treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The time to RFS was programmatically defined as the interval from the date of registration to the earliest date of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first.
Participants were
censored on the last available CA 125 biomarker blood draw date if
left the study prior to disease progression or death
they received off-study anti-tumor medication
underwent debulking surgery
censored at Day 1 if they were alive had no post baseline CA 125 biomarker blood draw.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CA-125 Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>A CA-125 response was considered at least a 50% reduction in the level of the biomarker, CA-125, from a pretreatment level, which was confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days.
The overall CA-125 biomarker response rate was defined as the number of participants in the measurable disease subgroup who met the above criteria at least once within the study treatment period +21 days, divided by the number of evaluable participants in the disease subgroup.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to up to approximately 1700 days after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Survival was the observed length of life from entry into the study to death or the date of last contact.
The overall survival rate (percentage of participants showing survival) at 12 and 24-months is reported here.</description>

          <description>Ovarian cancer staging at diagnosis was based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO).
Stage I is the least severe, where the tumor is restricted to the ovaries.
Stage II involves both ovaries and the pelvis.
Stage III involves the ovaries and has microscopically confirmed peritoneal metastasis outside the pelvis and/or regional lymph node (also includes liver capsule metastasis).
Stage IV involves distant metastasis beyond the peritoneal cavity.</description>

          <description>Tumor assessments were performed by Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to evaluate disease progression based on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Disease progression was recorded as any one of the following:
appearance of a new lesion
symptomatic deterioration
progression of target or nontarget lesions
death
Participants who did not die or show show disease progression achieved PFS. PFS rate is the percent of participants who achieved PFS.</description>
