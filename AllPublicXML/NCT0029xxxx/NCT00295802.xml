  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the substantial equivalence of the Ablatherm high
      intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as compared to cryotherapy for the treatment of low risk,
      localized prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hypothesis of this clinical investigation is that HIFU with the Ablatherm Integrated
      Imaging is non-inferior to minimally invasive cryosurgery as an effective treatment method
      for low risk, localized prostate cancer.
