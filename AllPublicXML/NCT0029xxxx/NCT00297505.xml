  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence continues to be a significant public health problem, for which there is no
      FDA approved pharmacotherapy. This study is a 12-week, double blind, placebo controlled trial
      of citalopram for cocaine dependence. The primary outcome measure is benzoylecgonine positive
      urines. Secondary measures of side effects and craving are also examined.
