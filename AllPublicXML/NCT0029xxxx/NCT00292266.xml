  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, comparative, and parallel-group study
      comparing the therapeutic effects of two interferon-beta-1a regimens in relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis (MS). The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of Rebif® 44
      microgram (mcg) subcutaneous injection given three times a week (132 mcg per week) to that of
      Avonex® 30 mcg intramuscular injection given once a week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 18 and 55 years

          -  Clinically definite or laboratory-supported definite relapsing-remitting MS according
             to Poser's criteria

          -  Two or more relapses within the preceding 24 months

          -  Clinical stability or improving neurological state during the 4 weeks before Study Day
             1

          -  Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.5, inclusive

          -  Two or more lesions consistent with MS on a Screening proton density/T2-magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan to be performed 28 plus/minus (+/-) 4 days before the
             Study Day 1 MRI

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study

          -  Written informed consent given before any study-related procedure not part of the
             subject's normal medical care, with the understanding that the subject can withdraw
             consent at any time without prejudice to future medical care

          -  For female subjects, lack of childbearing potential must be satisfied by either being
             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or using a hormonal contraceptive,
             intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide or condom with spermicide for the
             duration of the study. Subjects should neither be pregnant nor breast-feeding;
             confirmation that the subject is not pregnant will be established by a negative serum
             human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test within 7 days of Study Day 1 (the
             pregnancy test will not be required of subjects who will be post-menopausal or
             surgically sterilized)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary progressive MS, primary progressive MS or progressive relapsing MS

          -  Prior use of interferon

          -  Treatment with oral or systemic corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
             within 4 weeks of Study Day 1 or within 7 days before the Screening MRI

          -  Psychiatric disorder that is unstable or will preclude safe participation in the study

          -  Significant leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 0.5 times the lower limit of
             normal) within 7 days of Study Day 1

          -  Elevated liver function tests (Alanine transaminase [ALT], Aspartate transaminase
             [AST], alkaline phosphatase or total bilirubin greater than 2 times the upper limit of
             normal) within 7 days of Study Day 1

          -  Prior cytokine or anti-cytokine therapy or glatiramer acetate within the 3 months
             before Study Day 1

          -  Immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy within the 12 months before Study Day 1,
             including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin, methotrexate,
             azathioprine, linomide and mitoxantrone

          -  Previous use of cladribine or total lymphoid irradiation

          -  Allergy to human serum albumin, mannitol or gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentacetic
             acid (DTPA)

          -  Intravenous immunoglobulin or any other investigational drug or procedure in the 6
             months before Study Day 1

          -  Systemic disease that can interfere with subject safety, compliance or evaluation of
             the condition under study, such as insulin-dependent diabetes, Lyme disease,
             clinically significant cardiac disease or infection with human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) or Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, Type-1 (HTLV-1)
