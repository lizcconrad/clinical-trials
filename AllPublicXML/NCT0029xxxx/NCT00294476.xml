      This study is a one arm, open label, multi-center, phase II study. Its aim is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of IVIG administered as treatment for metastasis solid tumors. IVIG was
      proven as affecting the growth of tumor metastasis in animals’ models.

      Study population is including male or female, 18 and older, diagnosed as having a primary
      tumor (colon, melanoma or prostate) with measurable metastasis (according to the RECIST
      criteria) in soft tissues and/ or tumor markers in prostate cancer, for which there is no
      better alternate treatment.

      The patients receive the IVIG calculated as 1g/kg/bodyweight per cycle (defined as every 21
      days) until progression disease is noted. All patients are being followed for a period of 6
      months after patient’s withdrawal.
