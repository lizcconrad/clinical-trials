      This study is designed to investigate the difference in speed and degree of symptom
      resolution between daptomycin and vancomycin in subjects treated for cellulitis or erysipelas
      by evaluation of the following parameters:

        -  Time to erythema margin cessation to progress

        -  Time to defervescence

        -  Time to hospital discharge following relief of the presenting cellulitis or erysipelas

        -  Degree of improvement of the following signs and symptom of cellulitis or erysipelas
           including

        -  Degree of improvement of cellulitis-related pain and swelling as reported by subjects

      Additionally, the difference in frequency of Adverse Events between daptomycin and vancomycin
      will be described.

          3. If female of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test is required;

          4. Primary diagnosis of cellulitis/ erysipelas

               1. with onset of signs or symptoms within 3 days of 1st dose of study medication

               2. requiring hospitalization, and severe enough to warrant IV antibiotics

               3. temperature &gt;37.5°C (99.5° F) oral or &gt;38° C (100.2° F) rectal, documented within
                  48 hours prior to enrollment, and

               4. anticipated treatment to be limited to medical (NOT surgical) interventions

               5. at an anatomical location that allows of a clear assessment of the erythema
                  margin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating female;

          2. Conditions where required surgery (in and of itself) constitutes curative treatment of
             the infection or removal of infected site (e.g., amputation);

          3. Conditions requiring emergent surgical intervention at the site of infection (e.g.,
             progressive necrotizing infections);

          4. Previous systemic antimicrobial therapy exceeding 24 hours duration, administered
             anytime during the 72 hours prior to the first dose of study drug unless on previous
             antibiotics for at least 72 hours and without any clinical improvement;

          5. Cellulitis associated with a wound infection or ulcer requiring incision and drainage
             or debridement

          6. Perirectal abscess or hidradenitis suppurativa or third degree burn infections

          7. Buccal cellulitis, facial cellulitis, perianal cellulitis, or periorbital cellulitis;

          8. Known or suspected osteomyelitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, endocarditis, or urinary
             tract infection;

          9. Known to be allergic or intolerant to study medications;

         10. Subjects with a Creatinine Clearance (CLCR) &lt;30 mL/min;

         11. Requirement for non-study systemic antibiotics;

         12. Requirement for systemic steroids from enrollment through stabilization of cellulitis;

         13. Rhabdomyolysis;
