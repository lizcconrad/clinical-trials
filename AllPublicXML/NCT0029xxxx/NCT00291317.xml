  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise is strongly recommended to help maintain a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately,
      children and young adults with damaged spinal cords may not be able to exercise regularly.
      However, there is an exercise bike specially designed for persons with damaged spinal cords
      that enables them to pedal by directly stimulating the muscles in their legs. Our study is
      designed to determine the benefits of exercise for Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) patients using
      this bike.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inability to walk due to spinal cord dysfunction has profound effects on patients, both
      physiologically and psychologically. Complications associated with walking upright include
      loss of muscle mass from atrophy, reduction in bone mineral density (osteoporosis),
      compromised cardiovascular endurance, loss of sense of well-being, etc. Functional Electrical
      Stimulation (FES) of the lower extremities has been found to reverse many of these
      complications. We propose to examine the use of FES in children who have suffered from spinal
      cord injury (SCI). We plan to examine the effect of FES bike therapy on bone mineral density
      and psychological well-being.

    <measure>Change in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 (PedsQL 4.0)Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>pre- and post-intervention; time frame among participants ranged from 4 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL™ 4.0 is a modular instrument for measuring health-related quality of life in children and adolescents. The questionnaire asks how much of a problem each item has been during the past month, using a 5-point response scale. This study used the Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning modules. Scores on these three modules are combined to yield a Psychosocial Health Summary Score (range = 0-100 with 100 being the maximum positive outcome). Pre- and post-intervention scores were compared to determine improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Bone Mineral Density Measured Via DEXA Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>At entry until completion (range 4-14 months) (One participant's DEXA scan was obtained late due to illness)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scans using a GE LUNAR system. DEXA has been used in patients with loss of ambulation due to SCI to monitor changes in body composition over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise in preventing or reducing the disease-related complications of SCI. It was used in the present study to determine BMD in the right distal femur at baseline; after 3 months of intervention; after 6 months; and for children who biked for the full duration of the study, at the completion of 9 months of intervention.</description>

Children were scheduled to attend three cycling sessions per week on non-consecutive days for up to 30 minutes per session over a 9 month period. The intervention was provided at Children's Specialized Hospital in Mountainside, and families were required to provide their own transportation. During the study, the participants continued to participate in their standard, primary rehabilitation program.</description>

          <description>Participants exercised using functional electrical stimulation cycling (FES) using the RT 300 FES cycle (Restorative Therapies, Baltimore, MD). Stimulation rpm (45-50), pulse duration (250 μs), and frequency (33.3 Hz) were fixed. Amplitude ranged from 70-120mA, and average stim ranged from 16.50-29.7 μC. Participants were monitored for autonomic dysreflexia during training. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during the initial evaluation and the first session of cycling. Once it was established that there were no adverse physiological responses, ongoing blood pressure and heart rate monitoring did not continue for subsequent sessions. No participant experienced a dysreflexive episode in response to electrical stimulation during this study. Children were scheduled to attend three cycling sessions per week on non-consecutive days for up to 30 minutes (plus a 2 minute warm up and 30 second cool down) per session over a 9 month period.</description>

        <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scans using a GE LUNAR system. DEXA has been used in patients with loss of ambulation due to SCI to monitor changes in body composition over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise in preventing or reducing the disease-related complications of SCI. It was used in the present study to determine BMD in the right distal femur at baseline; after 3 months of intervention; after 6 months; and for children who biked for the full duration of the study, at the completion of 9 months of intervention.</description>

          <title>FES Cycle Exercise</title>
          <description>Participants exercised using functional electrical stimulation cycling (FES) using the RT 300 FES cycle (Restorative Therapies, Baltimore, MD). Stimulation rpm (45-50), pulse duration (250 μs), and frequency (33.3 Hz) were fixed. Amplitude ranged from 70-120mA, and average stim ranged from 16.50-29.7 μC. Participants were monitored for autonomic dysreflexia during training. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during the initial evaluation and the first session of cycling. Once it was established that there were no adverse physiological responses, ongoing blood pressure and heart rate monitoring did not continue for subsequent sessions. No participant experienced a dysreflexive episode in response to electrical stimulation during this study. Children were scheduled to attend three cycling sessions per week on non-consecutive days for up to 30 minutes (plus a 2 minute warm up and 30 second cool down) per session over a 9 month period.</description>
