      60 female that care for pain control during second stage of delivery, will choose between
      epidural or systemic analgesia. Continuous ECG (3 lead)monitoring will be recorded during the
      second stage for 10 minutes. 30 minutes after administration of either pain relief, a second
      recording of maternal ECG will take place for 10 minutes.

      Population 60 female during second stage of delivery

        -  Inclusion criteria : all parturients requiring pain relief will choose between systemic
           or epidural analgesia.

        -  Exclusion Criteria: all parturients with cardiac disease, neurological disease,
           endocrine disease, diabetes, hypertension or any parturients being treated with
           medications that might effect the cardiovascular autonomic system.

        -  Method: A 10 minute recording of a 3 lead ECG will be performed during the second stage
           of the delivery (3-7 CM opening).

      the parturient will be lying on her left side for that period.

        -  30 minutes after administration of either epidural or systemic Meperidine for pain
           relief, a second recording of maternal ECG will take place for 10 minutes.

        -  estimated duration of the procedure about one hour per woman.
