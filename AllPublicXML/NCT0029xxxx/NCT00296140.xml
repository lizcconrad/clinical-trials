    <textblock>
      Post Stroke Depression(PSD)is a high volume condition with negative impact on patient
      recovery after stroke. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      system intervention to improve the proportion of Veterans screened and started on treatment
      for PSD.

      The secondary aim is evaluate whether a patient-based self-management intervention provides
      any additional benefit compared to usual care.

      Objective:

      The investigators' immediate objective is to test a system intervention to evaluate which
      aspects of the intervention are critical to improving the quality of care for veterans with
      PSD, and to refine it to prepare for the investigators' long-term objective: a multi-site
      study across multiple facilities and VISNs. To address the immediate objective, the
      investigators will evaluate two specific study aims using a quasi-experimental design
      comparing improvement in depression screening and treatment in veteran stroke survivors
      receiving care at two facilities receiving the intervention.

      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a system intervention to
      improve the proportion of veterans screened and treated for PSD. The system intervention is
      based on extending the use of the current depression performance measure that mandates yearly
      depression screening in VA primary care clinics to target veteran stroke survivors
      following-up in VA Primary Care or Neurology clinics within six months of stroke. The primary
      outcome is the effect of the intervention on depression screening and treatment rates. The
      secondary aim of the study is to evaluate whether a patient-based self-management
      intervention provides additional benefit beyond the system intervention alone in improving
      patient depression symptoms, quality of life, and self-efficacy compared to usual post-stroke
      care. Subjects for the secondary aim will be recruited from the two intervention sites and
      will be randomized, stratified by site, to the patient intervention or usual care.

      Hypotheses/Key Research Questions:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine whether the system implementation intervention improves a)
      detection, and b) guideline-adherent treatment of PSD. Aim 1 Hypotheses: Compared to the base
      rate of PSD screening and treatment at the two intervention facilities, the system
      intervention will result in at least a 25% increase in: a) The proportion of Veterans
      screened for PSD in the first six months after stroke, and b) The proportion of Veterans with
      PSD that receive guideline-adherent depression treatment.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of a patient self-management intervention in
      improving a) guideline-adherent treatment of PSD, and b) patient-centered outcomes after
      stroke. Aim 2 Hypotheses: Compared to Veterans receiving usual post-stroke care, Veterans
      receiving the self-management intervention will have: a) fewer depression symptoms, and b)
      improved quality of life and reduced health-related fears.

      Research Plan:

      Specific Aim 1: The investigators developed clinical teams at the two intervention
      facilities, and worked with these front-line providers to develop two depression reminders: a
      screening reminder used by clinic intake personnel, and a provider reminder triggered by any
      positive screen. The reminders were tailored to the clinical system at each site. The
      investigators are gathering administrative and chart review data on Veterans with ischemic
      stroke hospitalized at any of the VISN 8 or 11 VAMC facilities during the 18-month cohort
      enrollment period. These data allow us to identify patients who follow up in either Primary
      Care or Neurology, identify whether they were screened and the screening result, and identify
      actions taken in response to a positive screen. Chart review allows us to examine depression
      screening and treatment that takes place even if the screening reminder is not used. The
      investigators will compare these data during the study period to chart review data for the 12
      months prior to study initiation in both Primary Care and Neurology clinics at each site and
      to administrative data for all VISN 8 and 11 facilities (estimated number of patients in both
      VISNs is 822). For Specific Aim 2, the investigators are recruiting hospitalized Veterans for
      ischemic stroke at the Indianapolis or Gainesville VAMC, age 18 or older, able to speak and
      understand English, no severe cognitive impairments, access to a telephone, willing to
      follow-up at VA outpatient care, willing to participate in interviews, and life expectancy of
      at least six months. For Aim 2, the investigators plan to recruit 75 stroke patients into the
      Aim 2 self-management cohort.

      Methodology:

      Aim 1: All data will be obtained from chart review and from the VA administrative databases
      that are part of the usual clinic care of the patients (VISTA and PBM data). These data
      include ICD-9 codes extracted from Patient Treatment File main as well as basic demographics
      (i.e., age, gender, race, ethnicity, depression screening results, antidepressants
      prescribed, and number and type of outpatient follow-up appointments in the six months after
      stroke). All outcome data for this aim will be collected from electronic medical records

      Aim 2: Data for the self-management program will be collected via patient interviews during
      the course of the study. The baseline interview will take place prior to hospital discharge
      or within two weeks of discharge. Two other interviews for outcome assessment will be done by
      phone at three and six months post-stroke.

      Intervention patients will also receive a self-management program over the first six months
      post-stroke. The program consists of six sessions delivered either in person or by phone and
      four additional follow-up calls to assess goal-setting, behaviors, and study outcomes. Based
      upon the investigators' earlier work, patients have expressed an interest in the following
      topics: expectations after stroke, negative/positive thinking, fears, creating a daily
      schedule, follow-up care, communication with providers, adapting/coping with disabilities,
      community resources and communication with caregivers. These topics will be addressed in the
      six sessions.

      Control patients will get baseline, three, and six-month interviews with the same outcome
      assessments. They will be provided American Stroke Association printed literature about
      stroke risk factors, warning signs, and community resources. They will receive one individual
      session prior to discharge or within two weeks of discharge focusing on stroke symptoms and
      risk factor education. They will receive the same number of calls at similar frequency to the
      intervention patients but the calls will generically cover how they are doing since their
      stroke and will not address goal setting, post-stroke behaviors, or self-management
      strategies.

      The primary outcome for the patient self-management intervention is depression symptoms
      (PHQ-9 score). Secondary outcomes include depression treatment, quality of life (measured by
      the Stroke-specific Quality of Life scale), self-efficacy, fear of injury, and stroke
      outcomes (patient-reported modified Rankin scale).
