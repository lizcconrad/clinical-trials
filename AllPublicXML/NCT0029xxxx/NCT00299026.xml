    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation is an international, prospective, double-blind, randomized safety
      and efficacy study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of
      the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent (1.0µg/mm2 of paclitaxel incorporated into slow- and
      moderate-release formulation of a triblock copolymer carrier system)in patients who present
      for stenting of de novo lesions of a native coronary artery.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of coronary
      artery stenting with the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent (1.0µg/mm2 of paclitaxel
      incorporated into slow- and moderate-release formulation of a triblock copolymer carrier
      system) for the treatment of de novo lesions in native vessels. Patients in 2 sequential
      cohorts will be randomised to receive either the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent or the
      uncoated control stent. In cohort 1, the slow-release formulation NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated
      Stent will be studied. If the safety profile is acceptable, the moderate-release formulation
      NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent will be studied in Cohort 2. In each f the 2 cohorts, 133
      patients will be treated with the NIRx(TM) paclitaxel-Coated Stent and 133 with the uncoated
      control stent (1.1 ratio), for a total of 532 patients in study.
