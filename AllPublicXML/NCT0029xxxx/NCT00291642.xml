      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy comparability of cetirizine and
      levocetirizine, by comparing the effects of single intake of the two drugs to placebo in
      reducing symptoms of SAR in ragweed sensitive adult subjects exposed to ragweed pollen in an
      Environmental Exposure Unit.
