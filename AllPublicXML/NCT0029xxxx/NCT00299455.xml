  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled one-center study carried
      out in primary care setting of the health center of City of Turku, Finland. The study
      patients will be allocated to one of the two parallel treatment groups
      (amoxicillin-clavulanate or placebo). The hypothesis is that the symptoms and signs of acute
      otitis media are resolved more effectively with antimicrobial treatment than with placebo.
      Furthermore, this study aims at finding out prognostic factors that could help to direct
      antimicrobial treatment for correct subgroups of young patients.

    <description>Amoxicillin clavulanate 40 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses for 7 days. Capsules will be produced by pulverizing amoxicillin clavulanate tablets (Augmentin 875 mg; manufacturer Glaxo SmithKline Beecham; ATC Code: J01CR02) and mixing that with lactose monohydrate. Each capsule will contain Augmentin tablet powder 68 mg and lactose monohydrate 572 mg. This means amoxicillin 40 mg and clavulanate 5,7 mg respecting the dose per 2 kg.</description>
