      The purpose of this study is to compare the sealing efficacy and safety of TachoSilÂ®
      (hereafter referred to as TachoSil) versus standard surgical treatment as the secondary
      management of intra-operative pulmonary air leakage after a lobectomy in subjects with lung
      malignancies with or without metastases.
