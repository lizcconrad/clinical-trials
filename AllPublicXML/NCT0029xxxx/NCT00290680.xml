      RATIONALE: Bortezomib and celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving bortezomib together with celecoxib may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib and
      celecoxib in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib and celecoxib in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall pattern of toxicities associated with this combination, including
           the emergence of any cumulative toxicities, during multiple courses of this regimen.

        -  Describe the response rate and duration of response or disease stability during therapy
           in the subset of patients with measurable disease.

        -  Assess changes in plasma/serum sphingosine-1-phosphate, ceramide, and other markers of
           the apoptotic pathway before and during therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 or days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and oral
      celecoxib twice daily on days 1-21 or 1-42. Courses repeat every 21 or 42 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are evaluated every 2 courses.
      Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of therapy beyond CR.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib and celecoxib until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
