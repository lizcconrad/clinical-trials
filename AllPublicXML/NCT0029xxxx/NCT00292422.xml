    <textblock>
      This Phase 2a study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple
      subcutaneous (SC) doses of BG9924, administered in a cohort dose-escalation fashion, in
      patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to therapy
      with disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and who may have undergone anti-TNF
      therapy. This study will assist with dose selection for further planned Phase 2 studies.
