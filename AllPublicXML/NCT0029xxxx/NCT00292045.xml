      This is an open-label, fixed-dose study of immunization with NY-ESO-1 protein combined with
      CpG as adjuvant in patients with high-risk stage D1 or advanced prostate cancer

      Eligible patients will receive vaccinations consisting of 100µg NY-ESO-1 protein combined
      with 2.5mg CpG administered intradermally every 3 weeks for 4 doses.

      This is an open-label, fixed-dose study of immunization with NY-ESO-1 protein combined with
      CpG 7909 as adjuvant in patients with histopathologically confirmed metastatic cancer of the
      prostate, who have progressive disease under hormonal and/or chemotherapeutic treatment
      (duration of treatment &gt; 3 months).

      Eligible patients will receive vaccinations consisting of 100µg NY-ESO-1 protein combined
      with 2.5 mg CpG 7909 administered intradermally every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Twelve (12)
      patients will be enrolled into this study.

      Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, prior to the second, third and fourth injection
      and three weeks after the fourth injection for clinical hematology, biochemistry and immune
      response assessments. Blood samples for antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-dsDNA will be
      collected at baseline and end of each study cycle.

      A tumor sample, resected prior to immunization, will be tested to determine NY-ESO-1 and/or
      LAGE-1 expression.

      DTH testing will be performed with NY-ESO-1b in HLA-A2+ patients and with NY-ESO-1 DP4 in
      HLA-DP4+ patients at baseline and at the 3-week visit following the second and fourth
      vaccinations.

      NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 specific antibodies will be assessed in all patients by Western Blot
      and ELISA. NY-ESO-1 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells will be assessed by ELISPOT analysis in
      all patients.

      Disease status will be assessed at baseline and 3 weeks after the fourth vaccination in
      patients with measurable disease.

      Patients who demonstrate stable disease, minor response, partial response, or complete
      response on week 13 may continue to receive vaccinations until disease progression. In
      patients with mixed response, single progressive lesions may be resected and vaccination may
      be continued.

      Resected metastases should be typed for NY-ESO- and/or LAGE-1 expression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have high-risk stage D1 or metastatic prostate cancer (D2), confirmed by
             review of histology.

          2. Patients must have fully recovered from surgery.

          3. Patients must show stable or progressive disease as assessed by X-ray, ultrasound,
             and/or CT scans under hormonal and/or chemotherapeutic treatment, that had been
             administered for at least three months.

          4. Any pretreatment with chemo- or radiotherapy must have been discontinued for at least
             four weeks prior to first dose of study agent. Hormone therapy is allowed before and
             throughout the study.

          5. Patients must have an expected survival of at least three months.

          6. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of 70% or more.

          7. Within the last 2 weeks prior to study day 1, vital laboratory parameters should be
             within normal range, except for the following laboratory parameters, which should be
             within the ranges specified:
