  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer are commonly treated with surgery to remove their
      thyroid gland followed by radioiodine ablation to destroy any remaining parts of the thyroid
      gland that may have been missed during surgery. It is thought that ablation with radioiodine
      destroys normal remaining thyroid tissue as well as cancerous cells either in the thyroid
      area or at other sites.

      Following successful treatment, patients are then monitored by their physicians at regular
      intervals with testing to detect any recurrence of thyroid cancer throughout the body. If
      thyroid cells are detected by these follow up tests, the physician will decide the best
      method to re-treat the patient.

      In 2001-2003 Genzyme conducted a clinical study to test if Thyrogen® can be used to
      accomplish radioiodine ablation treatment. This study aimed to determine that the success
      rates of radioiodine ablation were comparable when patients were prepared for ablation with
      Thyrogen® while being maintained on their normal thyroid hormone therapy, or, alternatively,
      by thyroid hormone withdrawal. Thyroid hormone withdrawal commonly causes uncomfortable side
      effects for patients, and these might be avoided by the use of Thyrogen.

      Eight months after the initial Thyrogen plus radioiodine treatment to achieve ablation, all
      patients in both groups were given Thyrogen® to test for any remaining thyroid tissue. The
      results of this testing showed that all patients (in both groups) had successfully achieved
      remnant ablation and had no detectable thyroid tissue remaining.

      In order to confirm these remnant ablation results we will conduct follow up testing in this
      study for all patients that were enrolled in the previous study and we also will determine if
      their thyroid cancer has recurred. Only patients who completed this previous Thyrogen
      ablation study are eligible for entry into this study.

    <description>No reference therapy was given. All patients in this follow-up study received Thyrogen. Thyrogen 0.9 mg was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the buttock on 2 consecutive days.
For WBS and static neck imaging, each patient received 4 mCi (148 MBq) ± 0.4 mCi 131I PO.</description>
