  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to isolate macrophages by using bronchoalveolar lavage
      (BAL) for different in vitro experiments.

      Therefore, following a baseline BAL, allergen, endotoxin, and saline will be instilled into
      three different lung segments during the first bronchoscopy. After 24 hours during a second
      bronchoscopy, BAL fluid will be collected in these challenged segments to harvest invaded
      cells for in vitro experimentation. In addition, segmental bronchial biopsies will be taken
      to assess the degree of local inflammation.

          -  Age 18-55 years

          -  Nonsmoker (&gt; 5 years)

          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt; 70% of the predicted value

          -  A positive skin prick test for grass mix or D. pteronyssinus at or within 12 months
             prior to the screening visit

          -  Informed consent

             electrolytes, liver enzymes, retention parameters)

          -  Subject is undergoing allergen desensitization therapy

          -  Permanent medication

          -  Systemic or inhaled corticosteroid use within the last month

          -  Anti-inflammatory medication within the last month

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Neurological or psychiatric disease or history of drug or alcohol abuse which would
             interfere with the subject's proper completion of the protocol assignment

          -  There is a risk of non-compliance with study procedures

          -  Participation in a clinical trial 30 days prior to enrolment
