      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in
      different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to
      them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may
      also block blood flow to the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of capecitabine
      when given together with irinotecan and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab and to see
      how well they work in treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal cancer
      or other solid tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.

      The study was originally intended to be Phase I/Phase II but it was terminated early because
      of toxicity of treatment and therefore never moved to the Phase II portion of the study.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of dose-dense and
           dose-intense capecitabine in combination with alternating full-dose irinotecan
           hydrochloride and oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or locally advanced
           unresectable solid tumors. (phase I)

        -  Characterize the safety of the MTD in patients ≥ 65 years of age treated with this
           regimen. (phase I)

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in patients ≥ 65 years of age. (phase
           I)

        -  Characterize the functional status of patients ≥ 65 years of age at baseline and after
           study treatment, in terms of performance status, independence in activities,
           comorbidities, risk of malnutrition, and underlying depression. (phase I)

        -  Characterize the neurological status of all patients, in terms of muscle strength and
           sensation, at baseline and after study treatment. (phase I)

        -  Determine the clinical antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen. (phase
           I)

        -  Determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to dose-intense capecitabine in
           combination with alternating full-dose irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin as
           first-line treatment leads to an improved response rate in patients with metastatic
           colorectal cancer compared to that of published results of fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin,
           fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan/bevacizumab, and fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan regimens.
           (phase II)

        -  Determine the toxicity of bevacizumab in combination with this regimen in patients with
           metastatic colorectal cancer. (phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I (all solid tumor patients): Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on
           days 1-7 and 15-21. Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on
           days 1 and 15 during course 1 and all subsequent odd-numbered courses and oxaliplatin IV
           over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 during course 2 and all subsequent even-numbered courses.
           Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine (during both
           odd- and even-numbered courses) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
           The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients (with
           at least 1 patient &lt; 65 years of age) experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6
           patients are treated at the MTD.

        -  Phase II (colorectal cancer patients): Patients receive capecitabine (at the MTD
           determined in phase I) in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (during odd-numbered
           courses) and oxaliplatin (during even-numbered courses) as in phase I. Patients also
           receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each course.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
