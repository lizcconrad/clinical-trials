      The purpose of this study is to gather information on how doctors program particular settings
      on cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardiac defibrillators (CRT-Ds), to analyze
      how these settings affect the amount of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) patients
      receive and to evaluate the therapy approach for converting abnormally fast heartbeats into
      normal heartbeats. There are no experimental devices or procedures involved in this study.
