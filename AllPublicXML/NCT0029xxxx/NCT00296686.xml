      for patients with Refractory Depression.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will recruit 40 patients with Major Depression and a history of at least two
      failed prior adequate somatic treatments. In addition to usual physical work-up, all patients
      will have extensive thyroid testing, and then will receive standard dose Tranylcypromine
      (i.e., max. 60 mg/d). Non-remitters will have dose increased to max. 120 mg/d if tolerated.
      Non-remitters to high dose Tranylcypromine will then have Dextroamphetamine added with
      frequent blood pressure monitoring to max. 40 mg/d. Non-remitters will have Triiodothyronine
      added to the Tranylcypromine.
