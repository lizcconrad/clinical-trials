  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multiple-dose, multicenter Pharmacokinetics drug-drug
      interaction study in patients with advanced solid tumors, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
      who are in need of anti-tumor therapy. In addition, the impact of omeprazole on the
      pharmacodynamics of VELCADE will also be evaluated.
