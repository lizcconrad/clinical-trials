  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare standard techniques used to control pain after knee surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that the fascia iliaca block is faster, safer and as good as or
      better than the femoral block, with or without a stimulating catheter.

      60 patients being treated for ACL repair or knee arthroplasties under regional anesthesia
      will be randomized to three groups: Fascia Iliaca Block (FIB), Femoral Block (FB) with
      stimulating catheter or FB without stimulating catheter. A catheter will be placed according
      to each technique, before the surgery. A bolus of local anesthetic will be given pre-surgery
      and at the end of the operation, in all groups. A continuous infusion will be started for 48
      hours. All patients receive a standard analgesia cocktail and rescue medication.

      Pain and level of activity, as well as side effects, will be evaluated.
