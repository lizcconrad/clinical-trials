Participants also received a stable dose of 10-25 mg/week of methotrexate and ≥ 5 mg/week folic acid for the duration of their participation in the study.
All participants entered a 48-week safety follow-up (SFU) period following the treatment period.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 511 participants were recruited and randomized between 27 Oct 2005 and 15 Nov 2006. Of these, 2 participants were randomized but received no infusions (one violated inclusion criteria and the other was randomized to rituximab 2 x 1.0 gram [g] + methotrexate [MTX] but failed to return). A total of 509 participants were treated.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 509 participants, one participant was randomized first to rituximab 2 x 1.0 g + MTX and then to rituximab 2 x 0.5 g + MTX. No assessments were recorded or medication given after first randomization and all data used in analyses was following the second randomization; hence, participant is included only in rituximab 2 x 0.5 g + MTX arm.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received placebo intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 15. From Week 16 onwards, participants could switch to receive rituximab 0.5 g (on Days 1 and 15) every 24 weeks for up to 5 years if they were not in clinical remission and safety criteria were met. Placebo and rituximab infusions were preceded with 100 milligrams (mg) intravenous methylprednisolone. Participants also received a stable dose of 10-25 mg/week of MTX and ≥ 5 mg/week folic acid for the duration of their participation in the study.
All participants entered a 48-week safety follow-up (SFU) period following the treatment period.</description>

        <description>To achieve an ACR20 required at least a 20% improvement compared with Baseline in both tender joint counts (68 joints assessed for tenderness) and swollen joint counts (66 joints assessed for swelling), as well as a 20% improvement in three of the following five additional measurements:
Physician's global assessment of disease activity (assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity (assessed using a 100 mm VAS);
Patient's assessment of pain (assessed using a 100 mm VAS);
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ; a patient completed questionnaire consisting of 20 questions, scored from 0-3);
Acute phase reactant: C-reactive protein (CRP) or, if CRP was missing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an ACR70 Response at Week 24</title>
        <description>To achieve an ACR70 required at least a 70% improvement compared with Baseline in both tender joint counts (68 joints assessed for tenderness) and swollen joint counts (66 joints assessed for swelling), as well as a 70% improvement in three of the following five additional measurements:
Physician's global assessment of disease activity (assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity (assessed using a 100 mm VAS);
Patient's assessment of pain (assessed using a 100 mm VAS);
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ; a patient completed questionnaire consisting of 20 questions, scored from 0-3);
Acute phase reactant: C-reactive protein (CRP) or, if CRP was missing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
Participants who withdrew prematurely from the study prior to Week 24, who received rescue therapy or had insufficient data in order to calculate a clinical response were considered to be non-responders.</description>

The percentage change from baseline at each post-baseline visit was calculated as:
[(post-baseline value minus baseline value) divided by Baseline value]*100.
A negative percentage change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</title>
        <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants choose from four response categories, ranging from 'without any difficulty' (Score=0) to 'unable to do' (Score=3). The overall score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability.
The percentage change from baseline at each post-baseline visit was calculated as:
[(post-baseline value minus baseline value) divided by Baseline value]*100.
A negative percentage change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Summary Scores (Physical and Mental Components)</title>
        <description>The SF-36 measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions split into two major components: physical health and mental health. Under physical health are the following four domains: physical health, bodily pain, physical functioning and physical role limitations. Under the mental health domain there are four domains; mental health, vitality, social functioning, and emotional role limitation. The individual domain scores are aggregated to derive a physical-component summary score and a mental-component summary score which range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better level of functioning.
The percentage change from baseline at each post-baseline visit was calculated as:
[(post-baseline value minus baseline value) divided by Baseline value]*100.
A positive percentage change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a self-administered patient questionnaire that consists of 13 questions designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants respond to the questions using a value in the range of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The scale score is computed by summing the item scores, after reversing those items that are worded in the negative direction. The FACIT-Fatigue subscale score ranges from 0 to 52, where higher scores represent less fatigue.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With DAS28-ESR Low Disease Activity Score and Clinical Remission at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is a composite score to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, derived from the following variables:
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count;
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale.
The DAS28 score ranges from zero to ten. DAS28 above 5.1 indicates high disease activity.
Low disease activity is defined by a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2. Remission is defined by a DAS28 score less than 2.6.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With DAS28-ESR Low Disease Activity Score and Clinical Remission at Week 24</title>
          <description>The DAS28 is a composite score to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, derived from the following variables:
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count;
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale.
The DAS28 score ranges from zero to ten. DAS28 above 5.1 indicates high disease activity.
Low disease activity is defined by a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2. Remission is defined by a DAS28 score less than 2.6.</description>
          <population>Intent to treat population with available data. DAS28 was calculated using last observation carried forward values for each of the component variables. If any of the components were missing then the DAS28 value will be missing. Number of participants analyzed = participants who were evaluable for this outcome.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HAQ-DI Improved, Unchanged or Worsened at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants choose from four response categories, ranging from 'without any difficulty' (Score=0) to 'unable to do' (Score=3). The overall score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A negative change from baseline score indicates an improvement.
Improved HAQ-DI is defined as a change from Baseline score less than or equal to -0.22.
An Unchanged HAQ-DI is defined as a change from Baseline score greater than -0.22 and less than 0.22.
A worsened HAQ-DI score is defined as a change from Baseline score of greater than or equal to 0.22.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response at Week 48</title>
          <description>A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity and an attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the DAS-28 score.
A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2.
A Moderate Response is defined as either:
an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or,
an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.
No Response is defined as either an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of less than or equal to 0.6, or an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of 5.1 or higher.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 is a composite score to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, derived from the following variables:
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count;
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale.
The DAS28 score ranges from zero to ten. DAS28 above 5.1 indicates high disease activity.
Low disease activity is defined by a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2. Remission is defined by a DAS28 score less than 2.6.</description>
