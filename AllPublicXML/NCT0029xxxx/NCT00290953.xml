  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate an increase in overall survival for patients with newly diagnosed extended
      stage small cell lung cancer when treated with SR48692 versus placebo, after an initial
      response (complete or partial response or stable) to first line cisplatin plus etoposide.

      Primary objective: comparison of overall survival between patients in the control arm and the
      meclinertant arm.

      Secondary objectives: comparison of the progression free survival, the time to progression,
      the clinical benefit, the quality of life, the toxicity and safety between patients in the
      control arm and the meclinertant arm.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathological diagnosis: Histologically or cytologically proven SCLC.

          -  Disease stage: extensive stage

          -  Measurable disease by the RECIST criteria is required. Lesions that are present in
             previously irradiated area are non-measurable unless they have appeared or progressed
             since completion of the radiation.

          -  Radiotherapy, if applicable, must have been completed at least 4 weeks before
             treatment under this protocol and the subject must have recovered from any acute
             toxicities of radiation.

          -  Recovered from any surgical procedure(s).

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 55 ml/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula: Cr Cl
             in ml/min = (140-age) X (weight in kg) X (1.0 for men or 0.85 for women) / (72 X serum
             Cr in mg/dl).

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; two times the upper limit of the normal range at the institution and
             SGOT/AST &lt; two times the upper limit of normal unless liver metastases are present.

          -  ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L and platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70% .

          -  Subjects with no prior malignancy, or subjects with cured malignancies other than SCLC
             if: a) they are alive without disease recurrence for at least 5 years from the date of
             pathological diagnosis, and b) clinical expectation of disease recurrence is &lt; 5% as
             documented in the medical record by the responsible physician, and c) they have not
             received any platinum-based therapy. Subjects with basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix may be eligible if adequately treated and clinical expectation
             of disease recurrence is &lt; 5% as documented in the medical record by the responsible
             physician.

          -  Infertile subjects or fertile subjects who use a medically acceptable contraceptive
             throughout the treatment period and for 3 months following cessation of treatment.
             Women of childbearing potential must have documentation of a negative, serum HCG
             pregnancy test. Subjects must be made aware, before entering this trial, of the risk
             in becoming pregnant or in fathering children.

          -  Signed written informed consent (approved by the Ethics Committee) obtained prior to
             study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Limited disease.

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases: a patient with brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases on
             computer tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan may be included only
             if he/she is asymptomatic on neurologic exam and is not receiving corticosteroid
             therapy to control symptoms.

          -  Concurrent active cancer, including cancer stable on adjuvant therapy.

          -  Prior immunotherapy, biological therapy or chemotherapy for SCLC.

          -  Radiotherapy: Prior radiation to non-symptomatic or non-life-threatening sites.Prior
             radiation therapy to all potential indicator lesions. Prior radiation therapy to some
             but not all indicator lesions is allowed.

          -  Class III or IV congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association
             Classification.

          -  History of allergic reactions to appropriate diuretics or antiemetics (e.g., 5-HT3
             antagonists) to be administered in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          -  Lactating or pregnant women.

          -  Received any investigational drug within 30 days before beginning treatment with study
             drug.
