  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and non-inferiority of a
      lipid-lowering medication regimen comprised of the medications ezetimibe and fenofibrate
      taken daily, versus atorvastatin daily in lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C)
      cholesterol. Additionally, other aims would include effects on other types of blood
      cholesterol and examining the safety of the ezetimibe and fenofibrate regimen, as compared to
      atorvastatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated in several previous primary and secondary studies that lowering
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with the use of medications such as
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors improves mortality and
      morbidity related to cardiovascular events in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Such
      inhibitors, which are known as 'statins', act to block the synthesis of cholesterol in the
      liver. These medications are generally well tolerated by the vast majority of patients, but a
      small number experience side effects, most seriously those of myopathies, rhabdomyolysis and
      elevated liver enzymes - recognition of this fact, that statins are not universally without
      problems, highlights the need for viable alternatives.

      Ezetimibe is a relatively new medication in Canada, approved for use in patients with
      cholesterol problems. It is an intestinal cholesterol binder that is known to be
      well-tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. Alone, it has a modest effect in the
      lowering of LDL-C. Fenofibrate is a medication that also works through the liver and has long
      been used to adjust blood lipid levels in patients with mixed lipid problems. Alone it also
      has a modest effect in the lowering of LDL-C. Recent study, however, has shown that the
      effect of ezetimibe and fenofibrate together in the lowering of LDL-C is greater than that of
      either drug alone. This combination, if as effective in this regard as atorvastatin, would
      prove a valid alternative to the use of the atorvastatin in the lowering of LDL-C, and a
      benefit for patients who have had problems tolerating statin therapy but still require
      medication for elevated cholesterol.
