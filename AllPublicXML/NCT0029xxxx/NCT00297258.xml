  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity and tolerability of pazopanib in
      subjects with advanced and/or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma who have relapsed following
      standard therapies or for whom no standard therapy exists and to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of pazopanib in this subject population.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival at week 12 is the number of participants who had a complete response (CR, all detectable tumor had disappeared) or a partial response (PR, a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum) or stable disease (SD, no change) 12 weeks from start of therapy, per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.0). Clinical progression is progression of disease without documented radiological evidence. Progressive disease (PD), a &gt;=20% increase in target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of therapy until death (up to approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from start of therapy until death. Participants who were still alive at the time of analysis were censored.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of therapy until progression (up to approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as the interval between the start of treatment and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause. Assessments of progression were made by the investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until either response or progression (up to approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response is the number of participants who had a best outcome of a complete response (CR, all detectable tumor had disappeared) or a partial response (PR, a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum) per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.0) at some point during the study. Progressive disease (PD), a &gt;=20% increase in target lesions. Clinical progression is progression of disease without documented radiological evidence.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological evidence of high or intermediate grade malignant soft tissue sarcoma, or
             cytological evidence in case of presence of multiple metastases. List of eligible and
             ineligible tumours are included in the protocol.

          -  Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumour blocks and representative H/E
             (haematoxylin/eosin) slides must be available for histological central review.
             Histological central review is not required before treatment start but is mandatory
             within 3 months of registration. Local histopathological diagnosis will be accepted
             for entry into the study.

          -  Presence of measurable disease (according to RECIST criteria).

          -  Relapsed or refractory disease incurable by surgery or radiotherapy.

          -  Evidence of objective progression within the last 6 months (RECIST) documented by
             measurements of disease,

          -  Patients must either not be eligible for chemotherapy (for instance because of age, or
             because of a biological condition, or because of patient-refusal) or must have
             received no more than one combination or two single agents chemotherapy regimen for
             advanced disease; (neo) adjuvant therapy is not counted towards this requirement.

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  WHO performance status 0 or 1

          -  Adequate bone marrow function

          -  Adequate hepatic function

          -  Adequate renal function

          -  PT / PTT less than 1.2 x UNL.

          -  LVEF above the lower limit of normal for the institution, based on ECHO or MUGA

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication

          -  Women should not be of childbearing potential and agree to use contraceptive methods
             (Oral contraceptives are not allowed).

          -  Absence of any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other
             condition (including lab abnormality) that could interfere with patient safety or
             obtaining informed consent.

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be assessed with the patient before registration in the trial.

          -  Written informed consent is given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations
             before patient registration/randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of leptomeningeal or brain metastases

          -  history of malignancies other than sarcoma (except for basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or the patient has
             been free of any other malignancies for greater than 3 years).

          -  Class II, III or IV heart failure (NYHA classification). A patient who has a history
             of class II heart failure and is asymptomatic on treatment may be considered eligible.

          -  Arterial or venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiac
             angioplasty or stenting within the last 3 months

          -  Uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension. Initiation or adjustment of BP
             medications is permitted prior to study entry, provided that patient has 3 consecutive
             BP readings less than 150 / 90 mm Hg each separated by a minimum of 24 hrs. These
             readings need to be collected prior to registration in the study.

          -  Women of childbearing potential, who are pregnant (negative serum pregnancy test at
             entry) or lactating.

          -  Therapeutic dose warfarin. Low molecular weight heparin and prophylactic low dose
             warfarin are permitted. PT/INR and PPT must meet the above inclusion criteria.

          -  Concurrent therapy with any specifically prohibited medication or requirement for
             using any of these medications during treatment with pazopanib

          -  Major surgery, hormonal therapy (other than replacement), chemotherapy or
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy or other investigational agent within the last 28 days
             and/or not recovered from prior therapy within the last 28 days. Use of erythropoietin
             is considered supportive care and is permitted. The patient should have recovered from
             prior surgery and have no open wounds.

          -  History of malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function or major resection of the stomach or small bowel that could affect
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of study drugs. No unresolved bowel
             obstruction or diarrhea.

        <description>Progression free survival at week 12 is the number of participants who had a complete response (CR, all detectable tumor had disappeared) or a partial response (PR, a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum) or stable disease (SD, no change) 12 weeks from start of therapy, per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.0). Clinical progression is progression of disease without documented radiological evidence. Progressive disease (PD), a &gt;=20% increase in target lesions.</description>
