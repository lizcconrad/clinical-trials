  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the effects on risk reduction and expense of 3
      approaches to the care of people with cardiovascular risk factors in a naturalistic primary
      care environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, smoking and other
      cardiovascular risks remain at epidemic proportions despite known efficacious treatments.
      Issues of both provider and patient behavioral non-adherence to guidelines and therapeutic
      regimes, respectively, are key factors in non-control. Few interventions aimed at reducing
      cardiovascular risk factors are based on sound theories of behavior change.

      Objective: To assess the effectiveness and expense of three approaches to the care of persons
      with known risks for cardiovascular disease. The three treatment approaches are usual care,
      usual care plus nurse telephone calls, and usual care plus clinic visits to a nurse and/or
      physician.

      Design: Patients will be randomized to a 1) specialized proactive, and holistic
      cardiovascular risk management clinic using principles of behavior change; 2) nurse telephone
      calls as an attention placebo, yet a low dose, health promotion intervention; and 3) usual
      primary care. A random sample of 670 patients with cardiovascular risks identified in the
      past five years will be selected. Patients will be excluded if they do not speak English, are
      cognitively impaired or live in a nursing home. Interview questionnaires will measure
      cardiovascular risk, intention to change, social support, depression, coping and health
      services use. In addition, patients will be required to give a blood sample to measure
      cholesterol and glucose levels. Patients will then be randomized to one of three treatment
      groups.

      Significance: The expected findings of this study is that the cardiovascular clinic, with
      nurse and physician, will be most effective at reducing cardiovascular risk and will pay for
      itself by averting hospital and emergency use for cardiovascular events.
