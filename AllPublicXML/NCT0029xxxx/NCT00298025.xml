    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the comparative safety and efficacy of Cetrotide® 3 milligram (mg) and
      Antagon™ in the inhibition of a premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in women undergoing
      ovarian stimulation with recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone/human menopausal
      gonadotropin (r-hFSH/hMG) prior to assisted reproductive technology (ART) and utilizing oral
      contraceptives pill (OCP) for cycle programming.
