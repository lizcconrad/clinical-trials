  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial intends to investigate, whether inspiratory muscle training in hypercapnic patients
      improves inspiratory muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance and endurance to walk
      within six minutes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle training is known to improve inspiratory muscle strength, inspiratory
      muscle endurance and walking distance within six minutes in patients with neuromuscular and
      thoraco-restrictive disease as well as in patients with COPD. Studies have only been
      conducted in patients without established respiratory failure. COPD patients with respiratory
      failure though are characterized by higher work rates of the inspiratory muscles and higher
      esophageal pressure swings compared to non-hypercapnic patients indication a discrepancy
      between muscle load and muscle capabilities. Therefore we hypothesize that for these patients
      training of their inspiratory muscles will be of benefit in terms of improvement of muscular
      and whole body endurance.

      During this investigation inspiratory muscle training will be applied in a randomized
      controlled fashion in 40 patients over a period of four weeks parallel to physical
      rehabilitation.
