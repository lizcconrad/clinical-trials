      RATIONALE: Nicotine may stimulate the immune system to kill Kaposi's sarcoma cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well the nicotine skin
      patch works in treating patients with Kaposi's sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of transdermal nicotine applied to lesions in
           patients with classic Kaposi's Sarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

      Patients apply a nicotine dermal patch to a selected lesion and a placebo patch to the other
      lesion, replacing the same type of fresh patch every other day, during the first 2 weeks,
      increasing the nicotine dose in week 3 and again in week 5 for a total of 15 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
