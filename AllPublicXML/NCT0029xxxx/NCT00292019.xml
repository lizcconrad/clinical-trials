      This is a pilot study to evaluate the role of RALRP in the management of localized prostate
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To establish a robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy programme at the
      University of Western Ontario/London Health Sciences Centre and to critically evaluate the
      role of this programme in the management of localized prostate cancer in surgical candidates
      Details of surgical procedure, operative outcome, patient outcome including quality of life
      will be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed Consent

          2. Locally confined, stage T1a, T2a or T2b prostate cancer

          3. Aged 40-65 and judged by the study doctor to be a suitable candidate for a radical
             prostatectomy.

          4. Serum prostate specific antigen equal to or less than 10mg/ml

          5. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          6. Gleason score equal to or less than 7

          7. Life expectancy of greater than 10 years.

          8. Prostate size on TRUS measurement less than 40 grams

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have undergone prior hormone therapy.

          2. Patients with a previous transurethral resectioning of the prostate (TURP)

          3. History of other cancers other than basal cell carcinoma.

          4. Patients with any prior abdominal surgery.

          5. Any condition, or history of illness or surgery than, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to the
             patient (eg significant cardiovascular conditions)

          6. Patients with a large median lobe of the prostate. -
