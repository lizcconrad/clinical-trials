      Study hypothesis: that a standardized course of Eastern practices (Breath Water Sound Course
      -BWS) will significantly relieve PTSD and depression in tsunami victims. Further, that a
      client-centered exposure treatment (Traumatic Incident Reduction- TIR) would provide
      additional, significant relief of PTSD and depression in tsunami victims.

      180 tsunami victims in Southern India will be divided into three groups: those that only
      receive BWS course, those that receive the BWS course and TIR and a wait-list control. They
      will be pretested with the PCL-17 (PTSD scale), the Beck Depression Inventory and the General
      Health Questionaire. These scales will also be administered post-service as well as five
      weeks post pre-testing and at three and six month intervals.
