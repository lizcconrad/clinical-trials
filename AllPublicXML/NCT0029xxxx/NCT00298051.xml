  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to determine whether delayed umbilical cord clamping, as compared to
      early umbilical cord clamping, improves infant iron status at 6 months of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In developing countries, up to 50% of children become anemic by 12 months of age. Risk
      factors for iron deficiency (ID) include low birth weight, maternal prenatal ID, and male
      sex. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) during infancy and childhood is of particular concern
      because of the potentially detrimental effects on development, some of which may be
      irreversible even after treatment to correct the deficiency. Delayed umbilical cord clamping
      is an intervention that increases the infant's iron endowment at birth and has been shown to
      increase hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration at two months of age. We determined whether a
      two-minute delay in the clamping of the umbilical cord of normal-weight, full-term infants
      significantly affected infant iron and hematological status through 6 months of age. In
      addition, we determined whether the effect of delayed cord clamping was significantly
      enhanced in subgroups of infants at higher risk of developing iron deficiency.
