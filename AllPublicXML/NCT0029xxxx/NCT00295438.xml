  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the concordance of diagnosis of injuries in
      thoracoabdominal trauma using two different echographic methods. The first method is a
      robot-based tele-echography performed by radiologists in a remote location. The second is
      bedside echography performed by emergency physicians according to the FAST (Focussed
      Assessment by Sonography of Trauma) examination.

      1. Principal objective: to evaluate the concordance of diagnosis of injuries in
           thoracoabdominal trauma using two different echographic methods (robot-based
           tele-echography performed by radiologists in a remote location vs bedside echography
           performed by emergency physicians according to the FAST examination).

        2. Objective 2: after the realization of a gold standard method, if there is a concordance
           between the two different echographic methods, sensitivity and specificity are
           estimated. If not, the evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of each method with
           analysis of their discordance is performed.

        3. Objective 3: qualitative evaluation of each echographic method by the patient and the
           physicians.

        4. Material and methods: This therapeutic, mono-centre, prospective, randomized,
           cross-over, open, controlled trial is being conducted in 70 patients. All the patients
           will have the two different echographic methods in a sequential but randomized way. The
           robot-based tele-echography is performed by a radiologist in the North University
           Hospital of Grenoble. The bedside echography is performed by the emergency physicians in
           the trauma center in the South University Hospital of Grenoble.

  <why_stopped>
    No diagnosis of visceral lesion was placed on 18 included patients. The study is thus stopped
    prematurely for ethical reasons.
