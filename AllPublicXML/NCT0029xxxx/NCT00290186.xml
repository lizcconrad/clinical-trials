  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the effectiveness of hyperbaric treatments and the potential
      longer-term effects in children between the ages of 3 and 8 years with spastic cerebral palsy
      (CP). One group will receive 100% oxygen and the other group will receive the equivalent of
      21% oxygen (room air). The children will receive pre-treatment testing (baseline). After 40
      experimental treatments are completed, the children will be retested at 0, 3, and 6 months to
      evaluate any changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study proposed herein is a randomized, double blind study to evaluate the therapeutic
      effectiveness of HBO in children (ages 3-8 years) with a diagnosis of spastic CP. Ninety-four
      children will be randomly assigned to either a hyperbaric oxygen treatment group or
      hyperbaric air treatment (HBA) group. Each group will receive 40 dives of 60 minutes duration
      each at 1.5 atmospheres of pressure (ATA) (the HBO group receiving 100% oxygen, and the HBA
      group receiving an air mixture containing 14% oxygen, which simulates 21% oxygen at 1.5 ATA).

      Neurological testing (Gross Motor Function Measure, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability
      Inventory, and the Test of Variables of Attention) will be performed at baseline, immediately
      after experimental treatment #40, and at 3 and 6 months after experimental treatment #40.
      Statistical analysis will be performed on these test data to determine any changes from
      baseline, or between group differences, in the functional capabilities of the study subjects.

    <description>GMFM-88: total percent score on 88 items (I) of motor function grouped into 5 dimensions: A) lying and rolling (17 I), B) sitting (20 I), C) crawling and kneeling (14 I), D) standing (13 I), E) walking, running, jumping (24 I). Each item scored on 0-3 scale: 0 = does not initiate, 1 = initiates, 2 = partially completes, 3 = completes. Scores in each dimension determined by dividing score obtained by maximum possible score for that dimension, and multiplying by 100. Range is 0-100% for each: the higher the percent score, the greater the functional ability.

             palsy.

          -  No documented evidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Hypoxic-ischemic
             encephalopathy (HIE) is not one of the major causes of CP.

          -  Able to pass pretest screening exercise. Each child will undergo the following
             screening exercise to determine the likelihood of being able to participate in the
             study: In order to assess ability to tolerate the placement of the oxygen hood in the
             hyperbaric setting, a hyperbaric oxygen hood will be placed upon the shoulders, or
             body of your child (depending upon size of your child) and with encouragement and
             comforting by you and study nurse, the child will be asked to maintain the placement
             of the hood for 15 minutes. Each child will be asked to blow through a straw, blow the
             nose, drink through a straw, or to swallow on command.

             shortness of breath.

          -  Optic neuritis.

          -  Diabetics requiring insulin therapy.

        <title>The Difference Between Groups (HBO Minus HBA) in Change in Score (Post-treatment Minus Pre-treatment) on Gross Motor Function Measure Total Score (GMFM-88).</title>
        <description>GMFM-88: total percent score on 88 items (I) of motor function grouped into 5 dimensions: A) lying and rolling (17 I), B) sitting (20 I), C) crawling and kneeling (14 I), D) standing (13 I), E) walking, running, jumping (24 I). Each item scored on 0-3 scale: 0 = does not initiate, 1 = initiates, 2 = partially completes, 3 = completes. Scores in each dimension determined by dividing score obtained by maximum possible score for that dimension, and multiplying by 100. Range is 0-100% for each: the higher the percent score, the greater the functional ability.
Dimension scores and total GMFM-88 score calculated as:
A) lying and rolling: (score achieved/51)x100 B) sitting: (score achieved/60)x100 C) crawling and kneeling: (score achieved/42)x100 D) standing: (score achieved/39)x100 E) walking, running, and jumping: (score achieved/72)x 100 GMFM-88 = (%A+%B+%C+%D+%E)/number of dimensions GMFM-66: [(total score on subset of 66 items/198)x100]</description>

          <title>The Difference Between Groups (HBO Minus HBA) in Change in Score (Post-treatment Minus Pre-treatment) on Gross Motor Function Measure Total Score (GMFM-88).</title>
          <description>GMFM-88: total percent score on 88 items (I) of motor function grouped into 5 dimensions: A) lying and rolling (17 I), B) sitting (20 I), C) crawling and kneeling (14 I), D) standing (13 I), E) walking, running, jumping (24 I). Each item scored on 0-3 scale: 0 = does not initiate, 1 = initiates, 2 = partially completes, 3 = completes. Scores in each dimension determined by dividing score obtained by maximum possible score for that dimension, and multiplying by 100. Range is 0-100% for each: the higher the percent score, the greater the functional ability.

Each item scored on 0-3 scale: 0 = does not initiate, 1 = initiates, 2 = partially completes, 3 = completes. Score in Dimension C determined by dividing score obtained by maximum possible score for that dimension (42), and multiplying by 100.

        <description>One of 4 parts of the TOVA, a computerized continuous performance test that measures attention and impulsivity in visual mode. Measures the number of times a target is correctly selected when it appears on a screen. Score ranges from 0-160; higher scores represent greater number of correct responses.</description>

          <title>The Difference Between Groups in Change in Scores (Post-treatment Minus Pre-treatment) on the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA): Number of Correct Responses.</title>
          <description>One of 4 parts of the TOVA, a computerized continuous performance test that measures attention and impulsivity in visual mode. Measures the number of times a target is correctly selected when it appears on a screen. Score ranges from 0-160; higher scores represent greater number of correct responses.</description>
          <population>The TOVA was only administered to patients who were 4-8 years old, not visually impaired, and able to complete a practice test. Analysis included all eligible participants who completed baseline assessments (within 1-week of start of treatment), 40 hyperbaric treatments, and post-treatment assessments (within 1 week of ending treatment).</population>
