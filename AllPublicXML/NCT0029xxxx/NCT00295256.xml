  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of high-risk pregnancies require substantial use of medical resources. Our
      goal is to determine the effectiveness of a nurse case management program in which case
      managers are assigned to patients with high-risk conditions.

      Our hypothesis is that women with diabetes in pregnancy or hypertension who are assigned a
      nurse case manager will have lower glucose levels and lower blood pressure levels

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit 50 women for each arm of the study. We we conduct a stratified randomization
      (by disease) in which women are randomized to a nurse case manager who provides on-going
      face-to-face contact compared to women who are assigned to a case manager with telephone
      contact only.
