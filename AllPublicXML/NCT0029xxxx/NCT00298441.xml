      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the frequency of intravenous iron
      administration has an effect on anemia correction and oxidative stress formation in
      hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients who are on chronic hemodialysis (HD), anemia is a major complication and is
      associated with poor clinical outcomes. Consequently, management of anemia by recombinant
      erythropoietin is reported consistently to improve outcome measures in HD patients. Because
      iron is essential for hemoglobin formation, as is erythropoietin, most patients routinely
      receive iron intravenously (IVIR) for anemia correction. Although IVIR has been shown to
      improve both survival and quality of life of HD patients, it has been suggested that IVIR may
      enhance the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the body through the inflammation process and
      the Fenton reaction. Previously we demonstrated that that serum albumin is highly oxidized in
      HD patients and that IVIR on these patients significantly increased the oxidation status of
      albumin.

      In 2004, the committee on the guidelines of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT)
      published the original Japanese &quot;Guidelines for Renal Anemia in Chronic Hemodialysis
      Patients&quot;. In the JSDT guidelines 2004, the committee recommended two IVIR schedules for iron
      deficient patients; 1) administer 40 mg of IV iron at the end of dialysis session 3 times a
      week for 4 weeks (total 520 mg of iron), 2) administer 40 mg of IV iron at the end of
      dialysis session once a week for 3 months (total 520 mg of iron). Both administration
      schedules are effective for the correction of iron deficiency and consequently for the
      amelioration of anemia. However, the effect of IVIR frequency (three times a week vs. once a
      week) on the oxidative stress formation has not been investigated before.

      Comparison: the two IVIR schedules recommended by the JSDT guideline 2004 will be compared by
      measuring both hemoglobin and oxidized albumin in chronic HD patients.
