      To compare three formulations of Hib-MenAC vaccines mixed with Tritanrix™-HepB vaccine with
      that of Tritanrix™-HepB vaccine concomitantly administered with GSK Biologicals’ Hiberix™
      vaccine and Tritanrix™-HepB vaccine mixed with Hiberix™ vaccine and concomitantly
      administered with Wyeth Lederle’s meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (Meningitec™), with
      respect to antibody response to vaccine antigens (meningococcal serogroups A and C and PRP)
      after a three-dose primary vaccination course.
