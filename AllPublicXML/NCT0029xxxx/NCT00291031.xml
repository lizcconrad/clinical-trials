  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Imagery Rehearsal Therapy(IRT) is effective
      in the reduction of the number of nightmares and the nightmare distress in a population of
      patients with psychiatric disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the normal population 4-8% of the people suffer regularly from nightmares. Clinical
      observations show that nightmares are a common problem for patients who suffer from all kinds
      of psychiatric disorders, and not just for the patients diagnosed with PTSD. Often nightmares
      can lead to sleep disorders, which have a negative impact on emotional well-being and
      cognitive functioning during the day. As well as this a strong relationship between severity
      of nightmares and severity of psychopathology has been found. This gives a strong argument
      for treatment of nightmares as a symptom, separate from the psychiatric disorder.

      A few controlled studies of the treatment of nightmares have been published, in which
      behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, exposure and systematic desensitization have been
      studied, all of which have shown positive results. But these techniques do not seem to reduce
      the number of nightmares in patients who suffer from PTSD. These last few years more
      controlled studies of a cognitive behavioral technique called 'Imagery Rehearsal Therapy'
      (IRT) have been published. With IRT patients have to change the script of their nightmares
      into a different outcome, and rehearse this new script using cognitive imagery a few times a
      day.

      Comparisons: treatment of nightmares with IRT compared to a waitlist control group who do not
      get IRT until 6 months later.

    <description>Imagery Rehearsal Therapy is given by psychologists, psychotherapists or psychiatrists. The IRT therapists are all trained by Annette van Schagen, principal investigator.
IRT consists of six 1-hour sessions. The six sessions are given in a period of three months. Each session is described in the IRT Manual. The IRT Manual is devised by the principal investigator Annette van Schagen in colaboration with Victor Spoormaker PhD. There is a patient version of the IRT manual available for the patients, which includes descriptions of the IRT sessions and homework assignments.</description>
