      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be performed in
      approximately 132 women with anovulatory/oligoovulatory infertility. The treatment duration
      will be approximately 4 weeks with pulsatile GnRH or placebo and 5 days with Clomiphene
      Citrate or placebo. All subjects will be screened based on inclusion/exclusion criteria,
      medical/infertility history and general safety assessments. Subjects that complete screening
      will be dispensed 100 mg of oral progesterone twice a day for 10 days to induce uterine
      bleeding. On Cycle Day 5 from the start of bleeding the subject will be randomly assigned to
      1 of 7 treatment groups. All subjects will be monitored weekly throughout the 4 week
      treatment period for ovulation and intercourse will be timed. All subjects will be required
      to return to the study center for a total of 8 visits. In addition, all subjects with a
      confirmed clinical pregnancy will be monitored until fetal heartbeat is confirmed at
      approximately 5-6 weeks gestation

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Females between the ages of 18 (or 19 in the State of Alabama) and 40 years.

          2. Infertile due to ovulatory dysfunction as described below:

          3. Positive progesterone withdrawal test following the screening visit.

          4. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels within normal limits for the clinical
             laboratory or considered not clinically significant (eg, secondary to exogenous
             thyroid medication) by the investigator

          5. Normal insulin sensitivity assessed as ratio of fasting blood glucose to fasting
             insulin &gt; 4.5 at Screening

          6. Male partner with recent (within 6 months prior to screening) semen analysis showing
             normalcy according to the local laboratory normal criteria. If screening semen
             analysis is borderline, the couple will be accepted into the study only if a second
             sample obtained prior to screening is adequate.

          7. Presence of both ovaries, without evidence of clinically significant abnormality, as
             detected by transvaginal ultrasound

          8. Normal transvaginal ultrasound with respect to uterus and adnexa (eg, no hydrosalpinx)

          9. Hysterosalpingography or hysteroscopy or sonohysterogram documenting a uterine cavity
             consistent with expected normal function and patency of the fallopian tubes within the
             previous 3 years prior to screening (within 1 year prior to screening there should be
             no pelvic infection, endometriosis or pelvic surgery).

         10. Negative serum pregnancy test (qualitative) prior to the progesterone test

         11. Desire to become pregnant

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Requires donor oocytes or sperm

          2. Previous and current use of infertility modifiers, including insulin-sensitizing drugs

          3. Primary amenorrhea/hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (eg, isolated gonadotropin deficiency
             or evidence of primary/premature ovarian failure)

          4. Presence of any clinically relevant systemic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus, pituitary
             tumor, anorexia nervosa).

          5. Surgical or medical condition which in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor may
             interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drugs to be
             used.

          6. Any pregnancy within last 3 months prior to Screening.

          7. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 at time of Screening

          8. Total testosterone and DHEA-S &gt;1.5 times the upper limits of normal laboratory range
             and prolactin &gt; 20 ng/mL

          9. Presence of abnormal uterine bleeding of undetermined origin.

         10. Active or prior history of substance abuse

         11. History of chemotherapy (except for gestational conditions) or radiotherapy

         12. Currently breast feeding, pregnant or contraindication to pregnancy

         13. Refusal or inability to comply with the requirements of the Protocol for any reason,
             including scheduled clinic visits and laboratory tests.

         14. Documented intolerance or allergy to any of the medications used including the study
             medication

         15. Participation in any experimental drug study within 60 days prior to Screening
