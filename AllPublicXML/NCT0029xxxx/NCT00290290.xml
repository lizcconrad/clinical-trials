  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most cases of infection of clean-contaminated wounds (wounds without gross spillage of
      organisms from the gastrointestinal tract) are thought to originate from the skin. Therefore,
      it is conceivable that application of an optimal antiseptic agent can reduce the rate of
      surgical wound infections. This trial is to compare the impact of disinfecting the skin with
      Chloraprep (2%chlorhexidine and 70% isopropyl alcohol) vs. Betadine on the rates of infection
      of clean-contaminated surgical wounds. The study will also assess the occurrence of adverse
      effects on the skin from either antiseptic agent and the cost-savings associated with the use
      of Chloraprep vs Betadine.

      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial. All adult patients, who are
      scheduled for a clean-contaminated surgical procedure of the alimentary, respiratory,
      reproductive or urinary tract will be asked to participate.

    <time_frame>during surgery and within the 30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of any surgical-site infection. Diagnosis of surgical-site infection was diagnosed by a blinded reviewer following criteria developed by the Center for Disease Control. The significance of difference between the two study groups in terms of patient characteristics was determined with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. For efficacy outcomes, we compared the proportions of patients in the two study groups who could be evaluated and who any type of surgical-site infection using Fisher's exact test and calculating the relative risk of infection and 95% confidence intervals. To determine whether the results were consistent across the 6 participating hospitals, a prespecified Breslow-Day test for homogeneity was performed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Adult patients who are scheduled for a clean-contaminated surgical
        procedure of the alimentary or respiratory tract will be eligible for participation. A
        clean-contaminated wound is one that is entered under controlled conditions without unusual
        contamination.

        Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be excluded form the study if: (1) they are unable or
        unwilling to give informed consent; (2) the patient is less than 18 years of age; (3) there
        is evidence of pre-existing infection at or adjacent to the operative site; (4) a break in
        sterile technique occurs; (5) the patient has a history of allergy to chlorhexidine,
        alcohol or iodophors.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients 18 years or older undergoing clean-contaminated surgery preformed without substantial spillage or unusual contamination were eligible for enrollment. Patients were excluded if they were allergic to chlorhexidine, alcohol, or iodophors, or had infection at or adjacent to operative site, &amp; if there was a perceived inability for a 30 days F/U</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There were no significant events prior to group assignment. Enrolled patients were immediately and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a study arm. To help match the two groups and address potential inter-hospital differences, randomization was stratified by hospital with the use of computer-generated randomization numbers without blocking</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>The Primary Objective of This Trial is to Compare the Impact of Disinfecting the Skin With Chloraprep vs. Betadine on the Rates of Infection of Clean-contaminated Surgical Wounds.</title>
        <description>The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of any surgical-site infection. Diagnosis of surgical-site infection was diagnosed by a blinded reviewer following criteria developed by the Center for Disease Control. The significance of difference between the two study groups in terms of patient characteristics was determined with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. For efficacy outcomes, we compared the proportions of patients in the two study groups who could be evaluated and who any type of surgical-site infection using Fisher's exact test and calculating the relative risk of infection and 95% confidence intervals. To determine whether the results were consistent across the 6 participating hospitals, a prespecified Breslow-Day test for homogeneity was performed.</description>

            <groups_desc>The average baseline rate of surgical-site infection at the six participating hospitals was 14% after clean-contaminated surgery with povidone-iodine skin preparation, and we estimated that substituting chlorhexidine-alcohol for povidone-iodine would reduce this rate to 7%. Therefore, we planned to enroll approximately 430 patients in each study group who could be evaluated in order for the study to have 90% power to detect a significant difference in the rates of surgical-site infection.</groups_desc>
