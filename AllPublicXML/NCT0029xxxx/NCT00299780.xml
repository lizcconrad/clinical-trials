  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of parathyroid hormone in combination
      with G-CSF when used as a stem cell mobilization regimen for patients who fail to mobilize
      sufficient progenitor stem cells after one or two attempts.

    <textblock>
      Patients will start treatment within 21 days of the determination of inadequate mobilization.
      PTH treatment will be given in 4 cohorts: 40 mcg, 60 mcg, 80 mcg, and 10 mcg. PTH will be
      given on day 1 and continue until stem cell collections are complete or a maximum of 20 days.
      G-CSF 10 mcg/kg will be given on days 10-14 and continue until stem cell collections are
      complete. Patients with inadequate CD34+ cells on Day 14 will meet off study criteria and not
      continue with PTH/G-CSF.
