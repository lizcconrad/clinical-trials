  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed to treat arthritis. The
      purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of flavocoxid, a plant-derived compound,
      for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in adults.

      Study hypotheses: 1) Flavocoxid has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile as
      determined by the Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) profile in patients with OA compared to
      identical placebo. 2) Flavocoxid will be more effective as a therapy for OA compared to
      identical placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OA is a leading chronic disease in older adults and is characterized by degeneration of
      articular cartilage of the joints in hands, spine, knees, and hips. In joints, tissue injury
      and pain are caused by the conversion of arachidonic acid to such inflammatory compounds as
      cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and -2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Conventional NSAIDs
      inhibit COX-1 and -2, but have little or no effect on 5-LO. NSAIDs provide relief from the
      pain of OA; however, NSAIDS are also associated with significant side effects, including
      gastrointestinal bleeding, venous thrombosis, and nephrotoxicity. Novel alternative therapies
      with increased safety and efficacy with fewer or no side effects are desirable; plant-derived
      substances might be useful alternatives to NSAIDs. Flavocoxid, a botanical extract derived
      from two plants, Scutellaria baicalensis and Acacia catechu, has been shown to inhibit COX-1
      and -2 as well as 5-LO. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      flavocoxid in relieving the symptoms of knee OA in adults.

      This study will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.
      Group 1 participants will receive daily flavocoxid; Group 2 participants will receive
      placebo. There will be 5 study visits: study entry and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Joint pain,
      tenderness, and swelling will be assessed at each study visit. A 30-foot timed walking test
      will also be performed at all visits. A physical exam and blood collection will occur at
      study entry and Week 12. Other study assessments will include safety monitoring,
      patient/physician global disease ratings, quality of life measures, depression and anxiety
      ratings, and measures of efficacy as determined by the Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC)
      OA index.
