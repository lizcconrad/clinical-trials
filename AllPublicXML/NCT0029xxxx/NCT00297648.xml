    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in CDEIS (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity) Score at Week 10 Using Local Non-blinded Assessments</measure>

    <description>The CDEIS (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity) score provides a measure of mucosal inflammation. Generally, scores range from 0-30. A higher score indicates more severe mucosal inflammation, thus a negative change from Baseline (i.e., Week 10 score minus Baseline score) indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The CDEIS (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity) score provides a measure of mucosal inflammation. Generally, scores range from 0-30. A higher score indicates more severe mucosal inflammation, thus a negative change from Baseline (i.e., Week 10 score minus Baseline score) indicates improvement.</description>

        <population>Of the 89 patients in the Intent to Treat Population, 78 patients had data at both Baseline and Week 10, and are included in this summary. Change from Baseline has been calculated as the Week 10 score minus the Baseline score, thus a negative Change from Baseline indicates improvement.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Patients With Endoscopic Remission (Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) Score Below 6) at Week 10 Using Local Non-blinded Assessments</title>
        <description>The CDEIS (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity) score provides a measure of mucosal inflammation. Generally, scores range from 0-30. A higher score indicates more severe mucosal inflammation.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
        <population>Of the 89 patients in the Intent to Treat Population, 78 patients had data at Week 10, and are included in this summary. Percentage of patients is calculated by dividing the number of patients with a CDEIS score &lt;6 at Week 10 by the total number of patients with CDEIS data at Week 10, multiplied by 100.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Patients Achieving Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Remission (Defined as a CDAI Score Less Than or Equal to 150) at Week 10</title>
        <description>Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI) responders are patients achieving clinical response (a reduction in CDAI score of at least 100 points from Baseline). CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of Crohn’s disease. A score of 150 or below indicates remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
        <population>The 89 patients from Intent to Treat Population are included in this summary. In case of missing CDAI score, patients are counted as remitters. Percentage is calculated by dividing the number of patients with a CDAI less than or equal to 150 points at Week 10 by the total number of patients in the Intent to Treat Population, multiplied by 100.</population>
