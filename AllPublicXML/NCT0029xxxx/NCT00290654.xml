      RATIONALE: Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor
      to kill tumor cells. Giving internal radiation therapy using a special radiation therapy
      device may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well internal radiation therapy after lumpectomy
      works in treating women with ductal carcinoma in situ.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate in women with ductal carcinoma in
           situ undergoing lumpectomy followed by brachytherapy using the MammoSite^® Radiation
           Therapy System.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the early and late complication rates and cosmetic outcome in these patients
           after treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo lumpectomy. Patients with negative tumor margins* (no ink on tumor)
      undergo placement of the MammoSite^® Radiation Therapy System at the time of lumpectomy or
      within 4 weeks after surgery.

      NOTE: *If positive margins are present, the surgeon may elect to resect the positive margins
      and then insert a new MammoSite® device if all other eligibility criteria are met.

      Beginning 2-5 days after placement of the MammoSite^®, patients undergo brachytherapy through
      the MammoSite^® twice daily for 5 days (a total of 10 fractions).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for ≥ 5 years.

    <description>The following items will be evaluated by comparing the treated breast with the untreated breast: overall cosmetic result; appearance of the surgical scar; breast size; breast shape; nipple position; and shape of areola.

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 45 subjects were enrolled. Four subjects did not receive accelerated partial breast irradiation because the minimum distance from the skin to the internal radiation device was &lt;5mm and is associated with poor cosmetic results.</pre_assignment_details>
