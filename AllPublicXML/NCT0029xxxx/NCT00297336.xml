    <textblock>
      A 6-month, observational, post authorization safety study for the collection and evaluation
      of additional safety data on topiramate as a prophylactic treatment for migraines in adult
      patients. According to current European and international guidelines the safety and efficacy
      of drugs will be continuously monitored even after their approval and market circulation.The
      applicable methods of monitoring include: Observational studies, voluntarily reported adverse
      events, clinical trials of IV phase and Post Authorization Safety Studies ( PASS). Post
      Authorization Safety Studies (PASS) during the use of a product are a significant source of
      information regarding the action of the drug or a therapeutic method under the circumstances
      of every day clinical practice.

      Previous studies have shown that topiramate is effective in preventing migraine headaches.
      This is a 6-month observational study to evaluate additional safety data of topiramate in the
      prevention of migraine in adult patients. The study duration is 6-months, with 5 study visits
      during the study. Administration of topiramate should be according to current Summary of
      Product Characteristics (SmPC) and daily clinical practice. The decision to prescribe
      topiramate is decided by the Health Care Professional and it is independent of the protocol.
      Based on the investigator's judgement, patients who enter the study should fulfill the
      criteria for administration of prophylactic treatment. In this study a total number of 80
      patients with diagnosed migraine according to the criteria of the International Headache
      Society HIS (Cephalalgia 1998; 8 (Suppl7) :1-98) will participate. Patients who will be
      enrolled should be either male or female over 18 years of age, fulfilling the above mentioned
      criteria and who will agree to sign the written informed consent for the anonymous and
      confidential use of their medical data with their participation in the study. Methods of
      evaluation include tolerability, laboratory tests, vital signs and Body Weight and Body Mass
      Index (BMI). Efficacy by assessing migraine attacks, symptomatic medications and Headache
      Impact Test (HIT-6). Observational study - No investigational drug administered.
