        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent in accordance with GCP and local regulatory requirements prior
             to trial participation.

          2. HIV-1 infected males or females &gt;= 18 years of age.

          3. History of NNRTI based HAART &gt;= 8 weeks and at least one, but not more than 3
             NNRTI-associated resistance mutations by current genotype

          4. TPV/r or LPV/r susceptible

          5. CD4+ T lymphocyte count &gt;= 100 cells/?l.

        7. HIV-1 viral load &gt;= 2000 copies/mL at screening. 8. Karnofsky score &gt;= 70 9. Based on
        the antiviral resistance profile of the patients virus, the investigator must be able to
        construct a background HAART treatment regimen (OBR) such that the patient will receive 3
        effective ARV drugs, in addition to his study medication.

        10. Acceptable screening laboratory values (Visit 1) that indicate adequate baseline organ
        function. Laboratory values are considered to be acceptable if the following apply:
        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;750/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 g/dL Platelet count &gt;99,000/mm3
        AST, ALT , and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5xULN &gt;= DAIDS Grade 1) Total bilirubin &lt;2.5xULN
        Serum amylase &lt;1.5xULN 11. Acceptable medical history, as assessed by the investigator,
        with chest x-ray results and ECG within 1 year of study participation.

        12. Willingness to abstain from ingesting substances which may alter plasma study drug
        levels by interaction with the cytochrome P450 system 13. A prior AIDS defining event,
        excluding mycobacterial and invasive fungal infections, is acceptable as long as it has
        resolved or the subject has been on stable treatment (e.g. opportunistic infection) for at
        least 12 weeks before screening (Visit 1). Note that prior oral thrush, candida esophagitis
        and cutaneous candida is acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The following resistance mutations demonstrated at any time prior to starting trial
             therapy: V106A and/or Y188L

          2. Female patients of child-bearing potential who:

             have a positive serum pregnancy test at screening or during the study, are breast
             feeding, are planning to become pregnant, are not willing to use a barrier method of
             contraception.

          3. Active Hepatitis B or C disease defined as HBsAg positive or HCV RNA positive with
             AST/ALT &gt; DAIDS Grade 1

          4. Acute/previous mycobacterial or invasive fungal infection requiring therapy or
             prophylaxis with drugs interfering with or significantly affected by the cytochrome
             P450 system

          5. Use of investigational medications within 30 days before study entry or during the
             trial.

          6. Use of concomitant drugs that may significantly reduce plasma levels of the study
             medications.

          7. Use of immunomodulatory drugs within 30 days before study entry or during the trial
             (e.g. interferon, cyclosporin, hydroxyurea, interleukin 2).

          8. Patients currently treated with systemic ant-cancer chemotherapy

          9. Inability to adhere to the requirements of the protocol, including active substance
             abuse, as defined by the investigator.

         10. In the opinion of the investigator, likely survival of less than 12 months because of
             underlying disease.
