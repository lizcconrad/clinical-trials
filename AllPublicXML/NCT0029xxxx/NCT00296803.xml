          3. Subject must meet 3 of the 5 National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment
             Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) criteria for the classification of metabolic syndrome:
             triglycerides &gt;/= 150 mg/dL; blood pressure (BP): systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;/=
             130 mmHg/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 85 mmHg; fasting glucose &gt;/= 110 mg/dL;
             waist circumference: men - &gt; 101.6 cm (40 in)/women - &gt; 88.9 cm (35 in); high-density
             lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: men - &lt; 40 mg/dL/women - &lt; 50 mg/dL.

          4. Subject has high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels of &gt;/= 2.0 but &lt;10.0
             mg/L at the Screening Visit (Week -2).

          5. Current medication regimen must be stable for six (6) weeks, i.e. no initiation of new
             prescription medication nor change in dosage of any previously initiated medication
             within three months of entering this study.

          6. Subject is normally active and judged to be in good health, based on medical history,
             routine safety laboratory tests (Screening Visit, Week -2), and a brief physical
             examination (Week -2).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Intolerance or contraindication to the use of clopidogrel or aspirin.

          2. Thrombocytopenia as defined by platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3.

          3. Current use or use within the past 3 months of oral anticoagulants, or dipyridamole or
             thienopyridine (ticlopidine or open-label clopidogrel) or oral glucocorticoids.

          4. Daily aspirin in excess of 81 mg, or chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             agents.

          5. Use of oral hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives including transdermal
             patch.

          6. History of pathologic bleeding (i.e., peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage).

          7. History of chronic inflammatory disease or any recent medical event(s) resulting in
             tissue injury, infection, or inflammation.

          8. Myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, or angioplasty within the 6
             months prior to Screening.

          9. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;/= 180 mmHg or diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;/= 100 mmHg) at Screening.

         10. History or presence of cancer in the past 2 years, except for successfully resected
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

         11. Recent history (within the past 12 months) for alcohol or substance abuse.

         12. Currently taking another investigational study medication or has taken investigational
             study medication within 30 days prior to Screening Visit.

         13. Any condition the Investigator believes would interfere with evaluation of the
             subject, or which could put the subject at undue risk.
