  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite many available treatments, there are patients with major depression who remain
      treatment refractory and chronically disabled. For these severely ill patients, several
      neurosurgical procedures are available where brain lesions are made that interrupt white
      matter tracts linking orbital frontal cortex to the striatum, resulting in significant
      therapeutic benefit for many patients. In this study, we will test the safety and efficacy of
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)--a reversible method used to modulate brain activity--as an
      alternative to the standard subcaudate tractotomy (SCT). The physiological consequences of
      this procedure will be mapped longitudinally using positron emission tomography (PET)
      measures of brain glucose metabolism. Patients will be clinically monitored for 1 year with
      longitudinal psychiatric, neurological, neurosurgical, neuropsychological and PET imaging
      examinations to assess treatment efficacy and side effects.

      Study Design Subjects: Ten patients will be enrolled in this pilot study. Eligibility
      criteria: (i) age 30-70 years old, (ii) diagnosis of refractory unipolar major depression,
      (iii) recurrent illness with a minimum four major depressive episodes, (iv) current episode
      duration of no less than twelve months; (v) current episode treatment failure to a minimum of
      four treatment classes-including serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), other novel agents,
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), tricyclics; somatic treatments such as ECT or vagus
      nerve stimulation (VNS); some form of psychotherapy. Exclusion criteria (i) previous brain
      surgery (ii) neurological disorder of any type, (iii) significant psychiatric comorbidity as
      defined by DSM IV diagnostic criteria (such as schizophrenia, panic disorder) (iv) serious
      medical conditions or contraindication for surgery such as cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator or
      other implanted devices. Full medical records from a treating psychiatrist will first be
      reviewed by Dr. Kennedy. Eligible patients will then undergo a full psychiatric, neurological
      and neuropsychological evaluation (Appendix 1 and 2). Final selection will be made by
      consensus of the investigative team in collaboration with a senior independent psychiatrist
      Robert Cooke, MD with expertise in intractable mood disorders. Informed consent will be
      obtained prior to entering the study.
