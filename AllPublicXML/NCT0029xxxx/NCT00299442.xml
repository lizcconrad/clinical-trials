  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will introduce a self-help parent training programme for families on National
      Health Service (NHS) waiting lists for child mental health services. It will examine whether
      access to treatment can be increased by providing an intervention that requires fewer
      resources and by releasing clinician time for more serious cases. This intervention will be
      tested in a randomised, controlled trial in which 35 subjects will receive treatment
      immediately and 35 will receive treatment after waiting for 10 weeks. All families will also
      complete questionnaires before and after the 10 week study period in order to measure changes
      in child behaviour, parenting, and parental mental health. Cost-effectiveness of this
      programme will also be analysed. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Families on waiting lists and child and adolescent mental health services clinics with
             children aged 2−5.

          -  Scores in the clinical range on a standardised measure of child behaviour problems.

          -  At least one parent in each family must be literate, fluent English speakers to
             participate because the self-administered intervention will primarily consist of
             written instructions and information in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clients whose children score below a clinical cut-off score on a standardised measure
             of child behaviour problems. This is to ensure that participants are appropriate for
             an intervention aiming to reduce behaviour problems.

          -  Non-English speakers or those who are unable to read cannot be included because
             reading English is required to complete the self-administered intervention.

          -  Children or parents with severe disabilities and children with a developmental
             disorder (e.g., autism) will be excluded because the version of the parent training
             programme that will be implemented is not designed for families with these types of
             problems.

          -  Children who live with a temporary caregiver will be excluded because the intervention
             is designed for full-time parents and follow-up will be after one year.

          -  Children or parents who are currently receiving treatment for psychological problems
             will be excluded because outcomes may be influenced by interventions not affiliated
             with this project.
