  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the safety, effectiveness and tolerability of
      using Pegasys with Copegus in people who have both the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and
      HIV who continue taking HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) to those who discontinue
      taking HAART.

      Canadian guidelines recommend that both HIV and HCV should not be treated at the same time as
      the medications needed to treat these two diseases may interact and that which disease to
      treat first is dependent on the CD4 count. In this study, the CD4 count must be over 350
      cells and one must be stable on HAART before starting the study medication Pegasys in
      combination with Copegus.

    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), liver disease
      secondary to HCV infection has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV/HCV
      co-infection. The influence of HCV co-infection on the progression of HIV has been less clear
      and the results have been conflicting. Studies conducted in the pre-HAART era did not find
      that HIV/HCV co-infection influenced the progression of HIV-induced immunodeficiency or
      death. Of four large studies conducted after HAART was introduced, two suggested a faster
      progression of HIV disease in the presence of HCV co-infection and two found no influence of
      HCV co-infection on overall mortality or progression of HIV disease. HCV may also negatively
      influence HIV disease in indirect ways, such as making the discontinuation of antiretroviral
      treatment more frequent because of an increased risk of liver toxicity.The morbidity and
      mortality resulting from the rapid progression of HCV infection in HIV-co-infected patients,
      particularly given the advances in HIV treatment that have improved the life expectancy of
      HIV-infected patients, support treating HCV infection in these patients.
