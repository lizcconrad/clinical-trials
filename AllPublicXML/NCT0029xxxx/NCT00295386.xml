      The present study examines the short- and long-term clinical efficacy of cognitive-behavior
      therapy and pharmacological treatment in patients suffering from late-life primary insomnia.
      46 subjects suffering from chronic primary insomnia were randomized into either
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT, n=18), hypnotics (7.5 mg Zopiclone, n=16), or placebo
      treatment (n=12). All active treatments lasted 6 weeks with follow-ups conducted at 6 months.
      Ambulant clinical polysomnography (PSG) and sleep diaries were used on all three assessment
      points.
