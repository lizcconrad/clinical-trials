  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide an in vivo measure of the activity of lapatinib. To assess the antiproliferative
      effects of lapatinib in breast cancer, ie how much lapatinib slows down the growth of cancer
      cells by measuring K167 (a marker of proliferation) in breast tumours before and after a
      short treatment with lapatinib.

    <description>In order for patients to take their study medication for 14 days only, treatment should commence on the 14th day prior to the day before scheduled surgery (i.e. if surgery is scheduled for the 15th of the month, tablets should be taken from the 1st to the 14th of that month).
Lapatinib tablets are dispensed as 250mg tablets. Patients should be advised to take all 6 tablets at once as one dose (total daily dose 1500mg). Tablets should be taken on an empty stomach either one hour before or one hour after a meal at the same time each day and according to the instructions on the bottle.</description>

Lapatinib-placebo tablets will be composed of lactose, cellulose, starch, magnesium stearate, and coated with Opadryl orange and look the same as the active treatment. The patients should take all 6 tablets at once as one dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have a histological or cytologic diagnosis of primary breast cancer with a
        tumour size adequate for multiple core biopsies Informed signed consent Scheduled for
        primary surgery Expected to be compliant for duration of study Age&lt;80 ECOG performance
        status 0-2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%) Cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of
        normal as measured by echocardiogram or MUGA scan Eligibility of patients receiving
        medications known to affect, or with the potential to affect the activity or
        pharmacokinetics of lapatinib will be determined following review by the Trial Coordinator
        The effects if lapatinib on the developing fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
        childbearing potential must agree to use adequate non-hormonal contraception for the
        duration of study participation.

        Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with prior diagnosis of malignancy except in situ disease or basal cell carcinoma
        of the skin.

        Patients may be receiving any other investigational agents or receiving concurrent
        anticancer therapy. In addition, all herbal (alternative) medicines are excluded.

        Evidence of metastatic disease. Use of hormonal therapy such as oral contraceptives or
        hormonal replacement therapy within 4 weeks of study entry.

        Regular use of steroid hormones or other agents that could influence study endpoints
        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
        composition to GW572016.

        Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/ social situations that would limit compliance with
        study requirements.
