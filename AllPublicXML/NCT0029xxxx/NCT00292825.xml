  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to prevent syncope in patients with recurrent syncopal episodes caused by
      malignant vasovagal faints and bradycardia. Patients are treated by a special pacemaker
      (closed loop stimulation [CLS]) which can potentially identify an incipient attack and
      prevent syncope by pacing.

    <textblock>
      The treatment of patients with recurrent syncope of vasovagal origin, not precipitated by
      usual vasovagal factors, and not associated with structural heart disease, is unsolved. The
      limitations of the conducted 5 pacemaker studies are a significant placebo effect of
      pacemaker treatment, underpowering and lack of double blinding. The pacemaker intervention
      has been accelerated dual chamber pacing at the time of bradycardia, which may be too late.
      However, a pooling of all data indicate a beneficial effect of pacing.

      Vasodilatation is an obligate element of all vasovagal syncopal episodes and in many also an
      early sign associated with the hyperkinetic empty left ventricle which triggers the reflex
      wave. The principle in closed loop stimulation (CLS) is a continuous surveillance of the
      impedance in the right ventricle which correlates highly with myocardial contractility. When
      contractility is increased significantly atrial pacing with prolonged AV delay is commenced.
      This principle has been used in chronotropic incompetent patients and in one small study of
      patients with vasovagal syncope with a positive outcome. The hypothesis is that the CLS will
      potentially identify an incipient vasovagal attack and be able to prevent the drop in cardiac
      output and bradycardia by early accelerated pacing.

      Patients will be treated 12 months with active pacing (CLS) and then crossed over to 12
      months with passive pacing (VVI, 30 bpm).

      The study will be double blinded, only a technician will know the status of the pacemaker.
