    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, fixed-dose, multicenter study of MDX-060 in patients with ALCL
      who have relapsed or refractory disease. There will be 3 phases of this study: Induction,
      Maintenance, and Follow-up. Patients will be required to attend all protocol-required visits
      in the 4-week Induction Phase, in which administration of MDX-060 will occur, as well as
      other testing. Patients who complete the Induction Phase may be eligible for additional
      MDX-060 treatment ever 2 months for 1 year in the Maintenance Phase. Patients who complete
      the Maintenance Phase with a response of stable disease or better will be followed every 2
      months for 1 year or until disease progression. The purpose of this study is to determine
      objective response rate at Day 50 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic systemic
      ALCL or primary cutaneous ALCL treated with MDX-060. Other objectives will be evaluated.

      This study is an open-label, fixed-dose, multicenter study of MDX-060 in patients with ALCL
      who have relapsed or refractory disease. There will be 3 phases of this study: Induction,
      Maintenance, and Follow-up. Patients will be required to attend all protocol-required visits
      in the 4-week Induction Phase, in which administration of MDX-060 will occur, as well as
      other testing. Patients who complete the Induction Phase may be eligible for additional
      MDX-060 treatment ever 2 months for 1 year in the Maintenance Phase. Patients who complete
      the Maintenance Phase with a response of stable disease or better will be followed every 2
      months for 1 year or until disease progression.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) at Day
      50 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma
      (csALCL) or primary cutaneous ALCL (pcALCL) treated with MDX-060. The ORR will be based on an
      adaption of the NCI Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) for patients with
      csALCL and will be based on the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) for patient with pcALCL.

      Secondary objectives include 1) characterizing progression-free survival (PFS); 2)
      determining response duration (RD); 3) characterizing the effect of MDX-060 on health-related
      Quality of Life (QoL); 4) evaluating patients with pcALCL using an adaption of the NCI
      Response Criteria for NHL; 5) characterizing the immunogenicity of MDX-060; 6) characterizing
      the safety of MDX-060; and 7) determining the best objective response rate (BORR) during the
      Maintenance Phase of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  signed informed consent

          -  confirmed diagnosis of ALCL

          -  patient with csALCL must be confirmed CD30+

          -  patients with csALCL must have failed or relapsed following second line (i.e. salvage)
             chemotherapy or relapsed or failed following autologous stem cell transplant.

          -  patients with pcALCL must have progressed after treatment with local radiation therapy
             or surgical excision or failed systemic therapy with a single agent or multi-agent
             regimen.

          -  patients with pcALCL must be confirmed CD30+

          -  ECOG performance of 0 to 2

          -  at least 12 years of age

          -  life expectancy 12 weeks or greater

          -  must meet screening laboratory values

          -  men must agree to the use of male contraception for the duration of the study

          -  patients on corticosteroids must be tapered off the medication 2 weeks prior to the
