  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability in &quot;real-world&quot; clinical
      practice, of adjunctive zonisamide treatment in adult patients with developmental
      disabilities and epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While a number of randomized double-blind controlled trials have demonstrated the value of
      zonisamide in the treatment of seizures, such studies lend limited insight into the efficacy
      and tolerance of zonisamide in real-world clinical practice. Furthermore, randomized trials
      tend to inquire about negative effects, such as adverse reactions, while positive effects
      such as improvement in mood, or sense of well-being are not similarly categorized. In
      addition, there is little information about experience with zonisamide specifically in adult
      patients with mental retardation (MR) / developmental disabilities (DD). Anecdotal experience
      suggests that zonisamide is exceptionally well-tolerated, and is associated with an improved
      general sense of well-being and quality of life in non-DD patients. In patients with MR/DD,
      observational studies that promote awareness of such distinguishing features and other
      aspects of efficacy are essential for guiding decision-making when prescribing antiepileptic
      drugs.
