    <textblock>
      Tibolone, a tissue-selective compound with a combination of estrogenic, progestogenic and
      androgenic properties, is used as an alternative for estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone
      hormone therapy for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause and osteoporosis. The
      current study compares endometrial histology, biochemistry (hormone levels) and
      gene-expression profiles after short-term (21-days) treatment with tibolone, to the findings
      after treatment with estradiol-only (E2) and E2+Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) in healthy
      postmenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for endometrial prolaps.

      Since short-term tibolone use results in increased spotting and bleeding but long-term
      treatment with tibolone has been shown to lead to an atrophic endometrium our hypothesis is
      that tibolone first displays a more estrogenic mode of action, which over time, is
      counterbalanced by tibolone's progestagenic properties

      Effects of estrogen deficiency in women are climacteric symptoms and bone loss, which can
      efficiently be treated by substituting with estrogens (1). Unopposed estrogen treatment,
      however, increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent carcinoma. For example
      in the HOPE study (Women’s Health, Osteoporosis, Progestin, Estrogen study (2, 3)), after two
      years of treatment with conjugated equine estrogens (0.625mg/day CEE) the rate of hyperplasia
      went up to 27,7%. When the treatment was combined with MPA (2.5 mg) the incidence of
      hyperplasia completely disappeared. Thus, the addition of progestagens is necessary for
      endometrial safety. Progestagen addition (in continuous combined estrogen plus progestin
      therapy), however, also causes negative side effects like withdrawal bleeding and an
      increased breast cancer incidence that was recently documented in the Women’s Health
      Initiative (4) and Million Women Study (5).

      Tibolone is a tissue-specific compound used for treatment of climacteric complaints and
      prevention of osteoporosis and does not stimulate the endometrium like estrogens (6). It is
      converted by steroid metabolizing enzymes in the liver and intestine into three active
      metabolites: two hydroxy-metabolites: 3a-hydroxy-tibolone and 3b-hydroxy-tibolone (exerting
      estrogenic effects and in vivo present in significant amounts) and the delta-4-isomer
      (exerting progestagenic and androgenic effects, and in vivo present in circulation for a
      relatively short period of time (7)). The estrogenic metabolites are responsible for the
      effects on hot flushes, vagina and bone.

      Tibolone’s effects on the endometrium have been studied by a number of investigators (8-14)
      using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and histology in biopsies after long-term treatment.
      With ultrasound it was observed that after 6 years of treatment endometrial thickness was
      slightly increased (p &lt; 0.05, (8)) in tibolone-users compared to controls. Dőren et al. (9)
      confirmed that tibolone treatment results in a slight increase in endometrial thickness,
      which was not different from estrogen + norethisterone acetate treatment (E2+NETA). Histology
      data after tibolone use for more than 3 months, show no change in 90% of the subjects and
      only in a few cases an endometrial profile was shown which was comparable to the early
      follicular phase of a normal cycle (15). Even after two years of tibolone use hyperplasia
      rarely occurs (10).

      In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, Hammar (16) showed that the bleeding and/or
      spotting episodes in tibolone users in the first months of use were significantly lower than
      in E2+NETA users, and the authors hypothesized that this was due to a higher progestagenic
      activity of tibolone on the endometrium compared to the combined treatment. Our in vitro
      studies show indeed that tibolone can exert a progestagenic effect and that the balance
      between the progestagenic properties and the estrogenic properties of tibolone takes effect
      through a different set of genes acting in the same genetic network (17, 18).

      In order to investigate whether our cell line data on tibolone action could be confirmed in
      vivo, and because relatively short-term effects of tibolone and other hormonal treatments in
      patients have never been described, postmenopausal women were treated for 21 days with
      tibolone, estrogen-only, or estrogen together with progestagen (estrogen+progestagen). From
      these women sera were obtained and endometria were removed in order to assess the
      histological and immunohistochemical, biochemical (hormone levels) and molecular (gene
      expression) effects of relatively short-term tibolone use (21-days). The overall results may
      help us to obtain insight in the mechanism of action of tibolone on the human endometrium
      compared to reference preparations.

      Subjects:

      This study was designed as a controlled clinical trial. Patients who visited our clinics
      (Amphia Hospital Breda, Albert Schweitser Hospital Dordrecht, Erasmus University Medical
      Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands) to undergo vaginal hysterectomy for treatment of prolapse,
      were eligible to participate in this study. A description of the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria of the current experiments were documented earlier (19).

      The trial was performed in the period before the scheduled surgery. After informed consent,
      the patients were sequentially assigned to one of the following treatment groups:
      Control-group (no hormonal treatment); Tibolone-group (2.5 mg tibolone (Livial, N.V. Organon,
      Oss, The Netherlands) administered orally every day, starting 21 days prior to surgery); E2
      group (2 mg of estradiol administered orally every day, starting 21 days prior to surgery);
      E2+MPA-group (2 mg estradiol + 5 mg MPA administered orally every day, starting 21 days prior
      to surgery). The investigators were kept blinded to the patient treatments during the
      analysis. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committees of the participating
      hospitals.
