  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury that can produce significant functional
      sequelae and ongoing disabling symptoms. Predicting who will have an uncomplicated recovery
      and who will suffer ongoing symptoms is difficult. This protocol evaluates the use of
      neuropsychologic testing after mild TBI in injured patients to attempt to objectively
      establish predictors of long term disability and functional recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are hospitalized and who have suffered mild TBI (loss of consciousness or
      post-traumatic amnesia; Glasgow Coma Score 13-15; admitted within 24 hours of injury; able to
      read, speak, and understand English) who do not have pre-injury dementia or significant
      cognitive impairment will undergo computerized neuropsychologic testing using a previously
      validated tool that has been effective in sports-related mild TBI. Sequential testing will be
      performed during recovery and patients who report disabling symptoms and/or functional
      impairment will be compared to patients who recover uneventfully. Goal is to identify those
      parameters that predict early who may suffer long term sequelae or functional impairment and
      therefore benefit from early cognitive rehabilitation. Secondary goals are to establish
      objective parameters for functional recovery after mild TBI.
