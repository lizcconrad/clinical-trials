  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many thousands of trauma patients are seen in Canadian emergency departments each year. On
      rare occasions, such patients have a broken neck (cervical spine fracture) but in 98 percent
      of cases the xrays ordered by the doctors are normal. The total cost of inexpensive but high
      volume tests such as neck x-rays adds considerably to rising health care costs. In addition,
      these patients are often immobilized with uncomfortable backboards and collars for many
      hours, tying up valuable space and time in our crowded emergency departments.

      This research group recently developed and tested a highly accurate and reliable guideline
      called the Canadian C-Spine Rule to help physicians be much more selective in their use of
      neck x-rays and to minimize the period of immobilization. This research project will evaluate
      the true effectiveness of the Rule when implemented with simple and inexpensive measures.
      This study will involve 14,000 patients in 12 busy emergency departments across Canada.

      This Canadian C-Spine Rule is designed to allow physicians to be much more selective in their
      use of neck xrays without the risk of missing a fracture or dislocation of the neck and to
      reduce the length of time of immobilization. Widespread use of the guideline could lead to
      large savings for our health care systems without jeopardizing patients and could greatly
      expedite care of trauma patients in our crowded emergency departments.

      Background: Physicians in Canadian emergency departments (EDs) annually treat 185,000 alert
      and stable trauma victims who are at risk for cervical spine (c-spine) injury. Only 0.9% of
      these patients have, however, suffered a cervical spine fracture. Current use of radiography
      is not efficient. More than 98% of c-spine radiographs are negative and there is considerable
      variation among hospitals and physicians in radiography use. C-spine radiographs are little
      ticket items, low cost procedures that significantly add to health care costs due to high
      volume. In addition, alert and stable trauma patients are often immobilized on a backboard
      with a rigid collar and sandbags for many hours. This leads to considerable patient
      discomfort and unnecessary use of valuable time and space in our crowded EDs. This renewal
      application builds on previous MRC/CIHR grants to determine feasibility (phase 0, MRC
      GR-13304D, 1995-96), develop a decision rule for c-spine radiography (phase I, MRC MT-13700,
      1996-99, N=8,924), and prospectively validate this Canadian C-Spine Rule (phase II, CIHR
      MT13700, 1999-2002, N=8,000), all part of the University of Ottawa Group Grant in Decision
      Support Techniques (CIHR 2000-143). The Canadian C-Spine Rule is comprised of simple clinical
      variables (Figure 1) and allows physicians to be much more selective in ordering radiography
      (JAMA 2001). In the recently completed prospective validation (phase II), we confirmed the
      accuracy and reliability of the rule.

      Objectives: The goal of phase III is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an active
      strategy to implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule into physician practice. Specific objectives
      are to: 1) Determine clinical impact by comparing the intervention and control sites for: a)
      C-spine radiography rates, b) Missed fractures, c) Serious adverse outcomes, d) Length of
      stay in ED, and e) Patient satisfaction; 2) Determine sustainability of the impact; 3)
      Evaluate performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, with regards to: a) Accuracy, b) Physician
      accuracy in interpretation, and c) Physician comfort and compliance with use; 4) Conduct an
      economic evaluation to determine the potential for cost savings with widespread
      implementation.

      Methods: We propose a matched-pair cluster design study which compares outcomes during 3
      consecutive 12-month before, after, and decay periods at 6 pairs of intervention and control
      sites (Figure 3). These 12 hospital ED sites will be stratified as teaching or community
      hospitals, matched according to baseline c-spine radiography ordering rates, and then
      allocated within each pair to either intervention or control groups. During the after period
      at the intervention sites, simple and inexpensive strategies will be employed to actively
      implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule: a) physician group discussion and consensus, b)
      educational initiatives (lecture, posters, pocket cards), and c) a process-of-care
      modification with a mandatory reminder of the Rule at the point of requisition for
      radiography. These outcomes will be assessed: 1) Measures of clinical impact will compare the
      changes from before to after between the intervention and control sites: a) C-spine
      radiography ordering proportions (the primary analysis); b) Number of missed fractures; c)
      Number of serious adverse outcomes; d) Length of stay in ED; e) Patient satisfaction. 2)
      Performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule: a) Accuracy of the rule; b) Physician accuracy of
      interpretation; c) Physician comfort and compliance. 3) Economic evaluation measures: a)
      Radiography rate after discharge; b) Length of stay in ED and hospital; c) Hospital
      admission; d) Operative repair. During the 12-month decay period, implementation strategies
      will continue, allowing us to evaluate the sustainability of the effect. We estimate a sample
      size of 4,800 patients in each period in order to have adequate power to evaluate the main
      outcomes.

      Importance: This implementation study (phase III) is an essential step in the process of
      developing a new clinical decision rule guideline for health care practitioners. Phase I
      successfully derived the Canadian C-Spine Rule and phase II confirmed the accuracy and safety
      of the rule and, hence, the potential for physicians to improve care. What remains unknown is
      the actual change in clinical behaviour that can be effected by implementation of the
      Canadian C-Spine Rule and whether implementation can be achieved with simple and inexpensive
      measures. We believe that the Canadian C-Spine Rule has the potential to significantly reduce
      health care costs and improve the efficiency of patient flow in busy Canadian EDs.

        Inclusion Criteria:All alert, stable adults presenting to the study hospital EDs after
        sustaining acute blunt trauma to the head or neck will be eligible and consecutive eligible
        trauma patients will be entered into the study. Patient eligibility will be determined
        based on these criteria at the time of arrival in the ED. a) &quot;Trauma to the head and neck&quot;
        will include patients with either: i) neck pain with any mechanism of injury (subjective
        complaint by the patient of any pain in the posterior midline or posterolateral aspect of
        the neck), or ii) no neck pain but all of: some visible injury above the clavicles, has not
        been ambulatory at any time, and associated with a high risk mechanism of injury (motor
        vehicle collision including motorcycle, pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle, bicycle
        collision, fall greater than or equal to 3 feet or 5 steps, diving, or contact sport with
        axial load to head and neck). b) &quot;Alert&quot; is defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale103 score of 15
        (converses, fully oriented, and follows commands). c) &quot;Stable&quot; refers to normal vital signs
        as defined by the Revised Trauma Score24 (systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater and
        respiratory rate between 10 and 24 breaths per minute). d) &quot;Acute&quot; refers to injury within
        the past 48 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:a) Patients under the age of 16 years, b) Patients who do not satisfy
        the definition of &quot;trauma to the head and neck&quot; as defined above (for example, patients
        with neither neck pain nor visible injuries above the clavicles will be excluded), c)
        Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 15, d) Patients with unstable vital signs
        (systolic BP &amp;lt; 90; respiratory rate less than 10 or more than 24), e) Patients whose
        injury occurred more than 48 hours previously, f) Patients with penetrating trauma from
        stabbing or gunshot wound, g) Patients with acute paralysis (paraplegia, quadriplegia), h)
        Patients with known vertebral disease (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal
        stenosis, or previous cervical spine surgery), or i) Patients who return for reassessment
        of the same injury.
