      Background and aims:

        -  In the Netherlands most patients with diabetes mellitus that are treated with insulin,
           use an insulin pen for insulin administration. The injection technique can influence the
           absorption rate of insulin.

        -  The aim of this study is to compare the effect of insulin injections using a 5 mm
           insulin needle with insulin injections using a longer needle, on HbA1c, bloodglucose
           levels, hypoglycaemic events, bleeding, bruising, insulin leakage and pain perception.

        -  Study Hypothesis: 'Insulin injected with needles of 5 mm can be given without a
           skinfold. The length of the needle will not influence HbA1c levels and bloodglucose
           levelsâ€™.

      -  In this randomised, clinical trial with cross-over design, 52 patients with Diabetes
           type 1 and 2 using a 8 or 12 mm needle, are randomised into two groups.

        -  Group I starts using 5 mm needles for insulin administration, after 13 weeks group I
           returns to their previously used 8 or 12 mm needle

        -  Group II continues using their own 8 or 12 mm needle, after 13 weeks group II starts
           using 5 mm needles for insulin administration.

        -  During each visit the HbA1c level is measured and a copy is made of the logbook of the
           patient with the blood glucose measurements.

        -  Insulin doses and number of experienced hypoglycaemic events are registered at each
           visit.

        -  The opinion and experiences of the patients regarding the different needles are obtained
           by using a questionnaire.

        -  Within-group analyses are computed, using the Wilcoxon signed Ranks Test. Between-group
           analyses are computed using the Mann-Whitney U test.
