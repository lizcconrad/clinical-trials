  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of the Reflux Disease
      Questionnaire (RDQ) as a diagnostic test for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptom
      evaluation by the RDQ will be compared with other established approaches to the diagnosis of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in a primary care patient population with symptoms
      thought to be of upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract origin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who seek medical advice at their family doctor (primary care physician) for
             symptoms thought by the primary care physician to arise from the upper GI tract

          -  The symptoms thought to pertain to the upper GI tract must have been present for at
             least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 and to have occurred at least twice a week during that
             period

          -  The symptoms thought to pertain to the upper GI tract must have been of at least mild
             severity for a minimum of 3 days during the week prior to Visit 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Upper GI endoscopy performed within a year prior to Visit 1

          -  Previous anti-reflux surgery, surgery for peptic ulcer or any form of upper
             gastrointestinal resective surgery

          -  Contra-indication to the Bravo™ procedure such as subjects with a history of bleeding
             diathesis, strictures anywhere along the GI-tract, esophageal varices, obstructions,
             or subjects equipped with a pacemaker, an implantable cardiac defibrillator or an
             implantable neurostimulator (NB: subjects with severe esophagitis (grade D) confirmed
             by endoscopy at Visit 2 can continue the study without performing the Bravo™
             procedure)
