      The purpose of this study is to assess the time for patients to relapse when switched from an
      oral antipsychotic to one of two doses of long-acting risperidone injection (shots).
      Risperidone has been used successfully to treat schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

      Results from studies of older long-acting injectable antipsychotics (not risperidone) show
      that patients tend to relapse (which means start having symptoms again) when they are given
      low doses. However, increasing the dose may cause more side effects. This study will measure
      the time to relapse during a 52-week period in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder who are switched from an oral antipsychotic (one taken by mouth) to one of two doses
      of long-acting risperidone injections (shots). The patients will be assigned to a dose of
      either 25 or 50 milligrams per injection every 2 weeks. Patients continue to take their usual
      oral antipsychotic medications up to 3 weeks following the first injection. After this 3-week
      period, they will receive the injectable risperidone only. Patients will be asked questions
      at each visit to help determine the effectiveness of the drug as assessed by the Clinical
      Global Impression Scale and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The safety of the drug
      will be based on patient signs and symptoms assessed according to the Extrapyramidal Symptom
      Rating Scale and self-reported treatment-emergent adverse events. Long-acting risperidone
      injection, 25 or 50 milligrams per injection, every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. Patients will
      continue to take their current oral antipsychotics for up to 3 weeks following the first
      injection of risperidone.
