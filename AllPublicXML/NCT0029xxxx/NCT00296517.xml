    <description>The 7-point Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) measures the severity of psychiatric symptoms. The following scores can be given: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

    <description>The CGI-I assesses the investigator's impression of the patient's current illness. The time span is the week before the rating and the score ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Responders are subjects that have a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the CGI-I.</description>

Individual items are rated on a scale of 0-4, 0-3, and 0-2 with total HAM-D score range from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill). Remitters are defined as subjects with HAM-D total score ≤ 7.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impressions - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Scale at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 and 12</title>
          <description>The 7-point Clinical Global Impressions–Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) measures the severity of psychiatric symptoms. The following scores can be given: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill patients.</description>
