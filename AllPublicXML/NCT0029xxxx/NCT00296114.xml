  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively collect serum and DNA samples from subjects with pancreatic cancer,
      pancreatitis, liver disease, and from healthy and at-risk volunteers in order to identify
      novel biomarkers for early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, stage, natural history of the
      disease, response to treatment, and to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions.
      In particular:

      -  To establish a central pancreatic cancer specimen repository to serve as a resource for
           current and future scientific studies.

        -  To utilize the PCRT clinical data base to perform clinicopathologic correlation with the
           results of those studies.

        -  To test new hypotheses as they emerge.
