        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult males and non-pregnant, non-lactating females

             resting supine for about 3 minutes. Normal BP is defined as less than 140 mm Hg
             systolic and less than 90 mm Hg diastolic. Normal baseline HR is 50 to 90 bpm without
             symptoms.

          -  Body mass index between 18 and 29 kg/m**2 or, if out of range, not clinically
             significant (within 15% of their ideal body weight).

          -  Be able to verbalize understanding of the consent form, provide written informed
             consent and verbalize willingness to complete study procedures

             contraindication for participating in the study. This would include documentation of
             any abnormal movements suggesting neurological pathology and ECG tracings to document
             an abnormalities in cardiac conduction

          -  If female, have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and urine pregnancy test
             on pre-admission and admission, or be postmenopausal, or have had a hysterectomy, or

          -  Have any clinically important physical findings, laboratory abnormalities, or
             histories of Rx or OTC drug use that may, in the judgement of a study investigator,
