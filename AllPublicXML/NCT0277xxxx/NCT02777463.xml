       11. Three correlation between high ADC value/low ADC value/the ratio of
           posttreatment/pretreatment ADC value and decreasing rate of CA19-9 value.

       12. The correlation between tumor's limb sign in diffusion MRI and the rate of tumor cell
           destruction more than 10%.

    <description>Diffusion MRI Patients undergo MRI within 3 weeks before start of neoadjuvant therapy/ 5 weeks after the last dose. The setting of MRI scans for b-values is 0, 50, 800 s/mm2. The same MRI (the MRI system/scanner Intera Achieva 1.5T from Philips Medical Systems) in the independent institution is used for all patients analyzed on this study. The region of interest is determined by consensus between two experienced MR radiologists in a largest diameter based on images of abdominal CT scans avoiding the vascular area on the image of ADC map. The mean ADC values for each tumor are automatically calculated on the image of ADC map using a tomographic software program.</description>

        The coefficient of correlation (Peason's r) was r=0.94 in the pilot study(Transl Oncol.
        2014;7:644-9.) in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. To comfirm the producibility,
        population correlation coefficient would be expected more than 0.85. At the setting of
        90%confidential interval as 0.2, the number of case is estimated as 26. Considering
        unexpected situation, 28 cases is enough to analyze the correlation.
