      It has been suggested that augmenting repetitive task practice with the use of box (mirror)
      therapy (BT) can enhance the benefits of task practice and may provide stroke survivors an
      opportunity to engage in self-directed practice outside of normally scheduled therapy
      sessions. However, the dosage of BT to be used in clinical practice is unclear. In order for
      practitioners to begin integrating BT into clinical practice situations more information is
      needed to determine what defines a therapeutic dose. The aim of this study is to
      differentiate between two dosages of self-directed BT added to treatment as usual for
      decreasing arm and hand motor impairments, improving activity level, and increasing
      self-directed participation after stroke. Forty-five subjects from the Stroke Rehabilitation
      Unit at Helen Hayes Hospital (HHH) will be randomly assigned into three groups: treatment as
      usual plus 30 minute dosage of self-directed BT 5x/week; treatment as usual plus 60 minute
      dosage of self-directed BT 5x/week; treatment as usual plus 30 minutes of self-directed sham
      BT 5x/week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year, and stroke is
      considered a leading cause of long-term disability. Impairments in arm and hand function are
      common after stroke and limit engagement in daily life activities, which impacts the overall
      quality of life of stroke survivors. It has been found that incomplete upper limb recovery
      predicted health related quality of life in stroke survivors at one year post-stroke in four
      (self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, &amp; anxiety/depression) out of five domains
      measured on the EuroQol-5D questionnaire. Thus, evidence-based interventions that improve arm
      and hand function after stroke are needed. In fact, a recent study identified &quot;treatments for
      upper extremity recovery&quot; to be one of the top ten research priorities relating to life after
      stroke according to stroke survivors, caregivers, and health professionals. Evidence suggests
      task-oriented training interventions such as Repetitive Task Practice (RTP) are effective at
      improving upper extremity (UE) function and activity, and therapy participation in stroke
      survivors.

      Recently, it has been suggested that augmenting RTP with the use of cognitive strategies,
      such as Mirror Box Therapy (BT), can enhance the benefits of task practice and may provide
      stroke survivors an opportunity to engage in self-directed practice outside of normally
      scheduled therapy sessions. During BT, a person engages in motor activities with the
      unimpaired limb while watching its mirror reflection superimposed over the (unseen) impaired
      limb; this process creates a visual illusion whereby activities performed by the unimpaired
      limb are attributed to the impaired limb. While generating this visual illusion is a common
      ingredient in published BT effectiveness trials, the actual treatment protocols differ
      considerably. One important protocol difference seen across published trials relates to the
      dosage of BT. For instance, the minutes of BT provided range from 10 minutes to 60 minutes
      per session; session frequencies range from 1 to 7 sessions per week, and the length of the
      intervention ranges from 3 to 6 weeks. Thus, the dosage of BT to be used in clinical practice
      is unclear. In order for practitioners to begin integrating BT into clinical practice more
      information is needed on the effective dosage, as this may vary according to multiple factors
      (e.g., stage of recovery, the survivor's current functional limitations, or environment in
      which services are rendered).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Action Research Arm Test:</measure>
    <time_frame>pre and post intervention up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test examines hand and arm motor function. It consists of 19 movement tasks divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale, ranging from 3 (performs test normally) to 0 (can perform no part of test). Totaled scores range from 0-57 with higher scores indicating higher functioning. Normative data for stroke has been published for this tool (Beebe &amp; Lang, 2009; van der Lee et al., 2001). This tool has been found to be a valid measure (Platz et al., 2005; van der Lee et al., 2001). This test has excellent test-retest reliability (Platz et al., 2005), as well as inter-rater reliability (Nijland et al., 2010). Minimally clinically important difference (MCID) for this test has been established for both acute (Lang et al., 2008) and chronic stroke survivors (van der Lee et al., 2001).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Stroke Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>pre and post intervention up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire including questions regarding whether the stroke has resulted in physical problems, problems with memory and thinking, changes in mood and emotions, problems with communication, daily living skills, mobility, and hand function. Normative data has been published for stroke survivors (Duncan et al., 2002). Several authors have established the validity of this tool (Doyle et al., 2007; Duncan et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2010; Kwon et al., 2006). This measure has adequate to excellent test-retest reliability depending on the domain (Duncan et al., 1999), as well as intra-rater reliability (Carod-Artal et al., 2009).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Functional Independence Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>pre and post intervention up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This provides a measurement of a subject's disability based on the International Classification of Impairment, Disabilities and Handicaps, and it indicates how much assistance the individual will need to carry out common basic activities of daily living. It contains 18 items that are rated on a seven point ordinal scale from total assistance to complete independence, and totaled scores range from a low of 18 to a high of 126, with higher scores indicating higher functioning. Normative data has been published for stroke survivors (Inouye et al., 2001). The validity of this measure has established (Inouye et al., 2001; Denti et al., 2008; Hsueh et al., 2002). This test has been found to have excellent test-retest reliability (Pollak et al., 1996; Hobart et al., 2001).</description>

    <measure>Score on Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke (arm/hand section)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre and post intervention up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test examines a variety of reaching patterns, wrist and hand function, quality of movement, sensation, and reflexes. Items are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale from 0 (cannot perform) to 2 (performs fully). The domains assessed include: Motor function (UE maximum score = 66), Sensory function (UE maximum score = 12), and Joint pain (maximum score = 24). This tool is one of the most widely used quantitative measures of motor impairment after stroke (Gladstone et al., 2002). Multiple authors have documented the validity of this tool (Malouin et al., 1994; Mao et al., 2002; Shelton et al., 2001). It has excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability (Duncan, 1983). It has been found to be a strong predictor of motor function (Duncan, et al., 1992).</description>

    <description>The BT intervention will be delivered in 15 minute increments via a self-directed program. The subject will sit comfortably at a table or desk in front of a box, which will be positioned in the mid-sagittal plane. The subject will place his or her affected arm inside the box so that it is out of view. The subject will then place his or her unaffected arm on the table and will be instructed to focus their attention on the mirror reflection of the unaffected arm throughout the intervention. The 15 minute intervention will consist of the following movements/tasks: active range of motion (AROM), functional tasks with objects, and object manipulation.</description>
