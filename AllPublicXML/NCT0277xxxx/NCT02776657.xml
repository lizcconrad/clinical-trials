  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine whether blood
      clots can be identified within the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart in patients
      with angina and who have recently suffered a heart attack.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of heart attacks are caused as a result of small blood clots forming within the
      blood vessels supplying blood to the heart, obstructing blood flow to the heart muscle.
      Research has also shown that blood clots may form in the blood vessels of the heart without
      causing a heart attack. At present, blood clots may be identified by techniques used during
      invasive coronary angiography, but we wish to determine whether a non-invasive test (MRI
      scanning) can be used to detect small blood clots within the blood vessels supplying blood to
      the heart muscle.
