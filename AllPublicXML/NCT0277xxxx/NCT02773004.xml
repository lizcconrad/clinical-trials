  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial population of this study is composed of women aged more than 18, who have developed
      a newly node-negative (or pN1mi), Estrogen Receptor (ER)-positive, Her2-negative invasive
      breast cancer with uncertainty on the indication of adjuvant chemotherapy using standard
      assessments.

      Obtaining material for test is at no risk as done from the surgery material. Tumor molecular
      EndoPredict (EP)clin analysis will allow to obtain information on the expression of 8 breast
      cancer related genes and will provide important prognosis indications. Clinical validation
      studies have demonstrated that molecular assays are useful for stratifying patients into risk
      categories and helpful in making clinical treatment decisions in ER+/node-negative breast
      cancer patients.

    <description>Once the patient is registered, the most representative block of the primary tumor from surgery (or 10 paraffin slides) are sent to the central analysis platform for EP clin testing. The EPclin method is based on analysis of tumour genes in combination with the classical prognostic factors of nodal status and tumour size.</description>
