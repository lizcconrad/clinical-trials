  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban) are the very top cause
      of serious drug-related harm. More than 7 million prescriptions are dispensed annually for
      oral anticoagulants (OAC) in Canada, with more than 340,000 recipients in Ontario Drug
      Benefit Program alone. Because of their very high and chronic utilization, their large
      benefit in lowering important clinical events (stroke, embolism, death) and their high
      potential for major harm (primarily bleeds, which can be fatal), OACs are the highest
      priority for improving medication safe and effective use. The early period after hospital
      discharge is clearly high risk, with three times the usual rate of major bleeds compared with
      later. Since healthcare has been declared unsustainable in its current delivery form, it is
      time that Hamilton hospitals took the lead in finding more cost-effective ways to improve
      anticoagulation safety. The investigators will do this by structuring discharge medication
      assessment, with formal handover to telehealth coordination and communication with patients
      and their providers, to extend access and reduce the cost of expert anticoagulation guidance.
      This innovative study will rigorously and efficiently address whether a focused care
      coordination intervention targeting the highest priority medication safety topic
      (anticoagulants), delivered by telehealth experts already providing other services for
      Ministries of Health, can improve outcomes and reduce costs of care. The rigorous research
      design tests whether high quality, easily scalable, teletriage coordination can be effective
      in preventing anticoagulation-related adverse events during the most risky time period of
      therapy - transition from hospital to home.

      Background Work: Before the RCT commences, investigators are working on three areas: Current
      rates of thromboembolic and bleeding events in the early post-discharge period in Ontario;
      Review of current practices, barriers and facilitators to optimal anticoagulation care and
      management; Finalization of OAC-focused medication reconciliation, workflow management
      diagrams and scripts, outcome assessment tools.

      Design: Randomized controlled pilot trial, two parallel groups, blinded outcome assessment.

      Participants: Patients discharged from any of the three Hamilton acute care hospitals with a
      discharge prescription for an oral anticoagulant intended to be taken for at least 4 weeks.
      Patients will be excluded if they are less than 16 years of age, expected lifespan is less
      than 6 months, if they are to be followed post-discharge by the Thromboembolism service, if
      they are unable to provide consent, or refuse consent. Patients will be stratified according
      to new users and persistent users of anticoagulants.

      Intervention: Formal discharge medication reconciliation organized similar to current
      discharge bundle processes, adapting the LHIN CCAC discharge medication reconciliation
      templates; hand-overs to care team including telehealth coordinator; telehealth coordination
      of patient, family caregiver, family physician, specialist(s), community pharmacist, home
      care, using an Oral Anticoagulant Monitoring Checklist. Expert clinician back-up by
      telemedicine is complemented by a) best evidence (internationally renowned ACCP
      Antithrombotic Guidelines led by experts including the applicants, Thrombosis Canada
      guidelines which update the ACCP AT9, and decision aids for patients and their family to
      assist in anticoagulant knowledge, decisional conflict, adherence, and b) best practices
      regarding discharge medication reconciliation, coordination of care with clear
      accountability, and teletriage where situations require medical intervention, c) most
      scalable and sustainable coordinator type (a teletriage clinician who is already working in
      the Ontario Ministry of Health's Telehealth Ontario, a system in place for more than a decade
      offering confidential advice on chronic illnesses and symptoms with specific algorithms for
      triage to acute medical care).
