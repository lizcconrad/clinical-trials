    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 Parts. The purpose of this study is to measure how much of
      apremilast is found in the blood when administered as a once daily tablet compared to a twice
      a day tablet, when given as multiple doses (Part 1) and when administered as a single dose
      under fasting and fed conditions (Part 2). Information on the safety and tolerability of
      apremilast will also be obtained. In addition, the effect of apremilast on certain biomarkers
      in the blood will be evaluated in 16 assigned subjects (Part 1 only). Biomarkers are
      substances such as proteins that tell us how the study drug is working in your body.

      Part 1: This is a multi-center, phase 1, open-label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence,
      crossover study in healthy subjects. The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline
      phase, two treatment periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each Period will be ten days in
      duration (Day 1 through Day 10) for dosing and sample collection for up to 72 hours post Day
      7 morning dose of Periods 1 and 2. There will be a washout between Period 1 and Period 2.
      Part 2: This is a single center, open-label, randomized, four-period, four-sequence crossover
      study to evaluate the PK and exposure of apremilast following single dose administration of
      different formulations of apremilast. Part 2 will consist of a Screening phase, Baseline,
      four Treatment periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each Period will be four days in duration
      (Day 1 through Day 4) for dosing and sample collection for up to 72 hours post Day 1 of
      Period 1, 2, 3, and 4.

      Study Objectives

      Part 1 Primary Objectives To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and exposure of apremilast
      following multiple-dose administration of a QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID
      reference IR tablet under the fed condition with a standard meal.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a QD apremilast formulation
      and the BID reference IR tablet.

      Exploratory Objective To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of apremilast following
      multiple-dose administration of the QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID reference
      IR tablet under the fed condition with a standard meal.

      Part 2 Primary Objectives To estimate the PK and exposure of apremilast following single dose
      administration of a QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID reference IR tablet under
      the fasting condition To estimate the effect of food on the PK of a single oral dose of a QD
      apremilast formulation.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a QD apremilast formulation
      and the BID reference IR tablet.

        administration (exception, FCBP may use hormonal contraception).

        4. Use of any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral
        supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration.

        metabolism and excretion, eg, bariatric procedure, colon resection, irritable bowel
        syndrome, Crohn's disease, etc. Subjects with cholecystectomy and appendectomy may be
        included.

        6. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days prior to the
        first dose administration or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever
        is longer). 7. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration
        to a blood bank or blood donation center.

        8. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and
        Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before dosing, or a positive drug screen
        reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.

        9. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) within 2 years
        before dosing, or a positive alcohol screen.

        (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab), or have a positive result to the test for human
        immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening.
