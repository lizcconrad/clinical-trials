  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, using modalities such as parenchymal
      pressure transducer or external ventricular drain (EVD), provides an ICP waveform that
      encapsulates valuable diagnostic and monitoring clinical information.

      HS-1000 device, a proprietary new non-invasive ICP monitor, is expected to display an ICP
      waveform safely and accurately with minimal discomfort to patients, compared to standard
      invasive ICP monitoring procedures used at the participating institutions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study will be conducted on 100 patients who undergo invasive ICP measurement due to
      suspected ICP elevation, regardless to etiology. Each enrolled patient will be monitored with
      the HS-1000 device and data will be collected throughout the entire procedure. Once the data
      collection is done, results of the non-invasive measurements will be analyzed accordingly.
      The end-point of the study is to collect at least half an hour of measurements for each
      participant.
