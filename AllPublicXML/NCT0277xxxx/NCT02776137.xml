      This is a non-randomized, phase II, open label study of postoperative concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel for high-risk squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck(HNSCC).The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel in HNSCC patients.
