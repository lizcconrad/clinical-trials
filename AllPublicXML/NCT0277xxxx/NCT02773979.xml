      This phase I trial of the replication-intact PfSPZ Challenge vaccine given under CQ cover
      will enroll 28 healthy volunteers to receive PfSPZ or placebo, as well as suppressive doses
      of chloroquine (CQ)on varying schedules. 10 weeks post 3rd immunization subjects will be
      subjected to controlled human malarial infection. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge
      administered by DVI on varying schedules to healthy malaria-na誰ve adults taking suppressive
      doses of CQ (PfSPZ-CVac).

      This phase I trial of the replication-intact PfSPZ Challenge vaccine given under CQ
      (PfSPZ-CVac) cover will randomize 28 healthy adult participants to one of three cohorts.
      Group 1 (n=12) will be randomized to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 51,200
      sporozoites or normal saline placebo on Days 3, 10 and 17. Group 2 (n=4) will be randomized
      to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 102,400 sporozoites or placebo on Days 3, 10,
      and 17. Within both groups, placebo will be assigned 1:3, with blinded allocation to the two
      treatments within each group. All subjects in Study Groups 1 and 2 will receive, by directly
      observed treatment (DOT), oral chloroquine (CQ) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at a suppressive
      dose of 600 mg base on Day 1 and 300 mg base on Days 8, 15 and 22. Subjects in Group 3 (n=9)
      will receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 102,400 sporozoites per administration,
      with vaccine given on a Day1, 6, and 11 schedule. Subjects in Group 3 will receive, by DOT,
      oral CQ, with a suppressive dose of 600 mg base on Day 1 and a dose of 300 mg base on Days 6,
      11, and 16. At 10 weeks after the third administration of study vaccine or placebo, all
      subjects will receive PfSPZ Challenge by direct venous injection at a dose of 3,200 P.
      falciparum sporozoites to assess vaccine efficacy against controlled human malarial infection
      (CHMI). The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge administered by DVI on varying schedules to
      healthy malaria-na誰ve adults taking suppressive doses of CQ (PfSPZ-CVac)..
