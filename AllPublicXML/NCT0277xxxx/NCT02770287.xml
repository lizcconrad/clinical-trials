      The study will confirm that the Freeze Diamond polar applicator is safe for treating the Mons
      pubis and Labia, and will result in improvement in general skin appearance including an
      improvement in skin irregularities and skin laxity.

      This is a single-center, open-label, prospective study. Ten (10) subjects that meet the
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled from the site's pool of patients. Subjects should be a
      female at the age of 25-65, and have a suitable treatment area (e.g. skin irregularities
      and/or unwanted skin laxity in the Mons pubis, Introitus and/or Labia area).

      Subjects will receive three treatments with the study device, at four week intervals,
      followed by one month follow-up visits after the last treatment.

    <description>The Venus Freeze Diamond Polar is a non-invasive dermatological treatment system combines Multi Polar Radiofrequency and Pulsed Magnetic Fields. The radiofrequency energy penetrates the skin and results in tissue heating that has known effect on skin laxity, the magnetic field that is simultaneously induces increases fibroblast collagen production through non thermal mechanism and contributes to the clinical effect of skin laxity improvement. Only the Diamond Polar applicator will be used in this study for the treatment of the Mons pubis, vaginal introitus and Labia. Minor modification to the hand-piece for operator and/or patient comfort may occur mid-study, however no change in range of energy modality or amount of energy delivered will occur at any point during the study.</description>
