    <textblock>
      This prospective one group cohort study seeks to investigate the effects of sacral
      neuromodulation on urinary urgency, frequency and urge incontinence are maintained after the
      simulator device is temporarily turned off for a period of four weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence are very common symptoms, affecting up to
      one in three adults in the United States. The total economic cost of these disorders was
      estimated to be above $12 billion in the year 2000, with the vast majority being for women.

      Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) has become a popular and successful treatment option for people
      who suffer from these conditions. Sacral neuromodulation device delivers electrical pulses to
      an area near the sacral nerve.

      There has been some data published which showed that for patients with fecal incontinence,
      symptom relief can persist for significant time periods despite having the stimulator device
      turned off. Based on their findings, potential exists to prolong battery life if patients can
      cycle the on and off periods for their device while keeping their symptoms stable.

      The typical battery life of the implantable pulse generator (IPG) is approximately 5 years
      depending on the system settings. When the IPG is at the end of its battery life, a new IPG
      must be implanted. The cost of replacing the IPG ranges from $13,952 to $16,470. IPG
      replacement must be done in the operating room and requires the patient to undergo anesthesia
      and its associated risks.

      This study will investigate whether the symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and urge
      incontinence remain stable in patients with SNM with the device turned off for a period of
      four weeks.

      Current Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates (CUA) patients who are currently being
      successfully treated with sacral neuromodulation for the primary diagnosis of urinary urge
      incontinence or urgency and frequency who elect participate in the study will have the device
      turned off for four consecutive weeks. Their symptoms will be monitored during this time
      period.
