  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate PPI as a surrogate for clinical signs of peripheral
      perfusion in patients in septic shock and after cardiac surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate PPI as a continuous, objective measurement of peripheral
      perfusion indicated by clinical sings of tissue perfusion in patients with septic shock.
      Furthermore, PPI shall be compared to the perfusion of solid organs evaluated by ultrasound
      of liver, kidney and gut. In a group of healthy volunteers the investigators will determine
      normal values in ambient temperature and after cooling of an extremity. Another group of
      patients after cardiac surgery, where usually a poor tissue perfusion without metabolic
      failure is present will serve as another &quot;control&quot; population in their post-surgery
      stabilization period. The values from healthy volunteers and cardiac surgery patients will be
      compared to those of patients in septic shock.
