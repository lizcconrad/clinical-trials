  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), negatively influencing their quality of life,
      treatment response and survival. Loss of muscle protein is generally a central component of
      weight loss in CHF and COPD patients, but patients also have reductions in fat mass and bone
      density, independent of the severity of the disease state. The purpose of this study is to
      provide detailed insight in disease related gut function by obtaining information on gut
      permeability, digestion and absorption of glucose, fat and protein in CHF and COPD patients
      compared to matched healthy controls. This will provide required information that is
      necessary to implement new strategies to develop optimal nutritional regimen in CHF and COPD.

      General aims:

        -  To study the whole-body protein anabolic effect of several dosages of a high-quality
           protein sip feeding in COPD and CHF subjects as compared to healthy controls.

        -  To investigate the anabolic threshold in subjects with COPD and CHF as compared to
           healthy controls.

      Purpose and objectives: Although the Researchers' previous study supports the concept of
      supplementing high-quality milk proteins in chronic wasting diseases i.e., COPD and CHF, the
      dose-response anabolic effects of proteins with high EAA levels are still unclear.
      Furthermore, there is no insight in the actual protein requirements in COPD and CHF. The
      knowledge gained from this study will benefit insight in terms of promotion of protein gain
      after feeding in COPD and CHF subjects. Based on the obtained data of protein behavior
      (protein kinetics) the Researchers will be able to further refine and personalize nutritional
      supplementation in COPD and CHF subjects in order to stop and even restore progressive muscle
      wasting.
