      The aim of this study is to test whether MotivATE can increase attendance at assessment. This
      will be done using a single-consent Zelen randomised control trial, with all non-emergency
      adult clients referred to the Kimmeridge Courte Eating Disorder Service over a one year
      period being randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus access to the MotivATE
      intervention prior to their assessment appointment.

      MotivATE is a web-based intervention intended to be delivered at the point of referral to an
      Eating Disorder (ED) service. The intervention focuses on managing expectations of
      assessment, addressing ambivalence and increasing users' motivation and confidence to attend
      their initial appointment. This is achieved through the use of information, motivational
      tools, interactive activities and stories from other individuals with EDs spread across four
      15-20 minute modules. These modules have been evaluated by service-users who have an ED.

      The aim of this study is to test whether MotivATE can increase attendance at assessment. This
      will be done using a single-consent Zelen randomised control trial, with all non-emergency
      adult clients referred to the Kimmeridge Courte Eating Disorder Service over a one year
      period being randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus access to the MotivATE
      intervention prior to their assessment appointment.

      Routine audit data will be collected to compare the number of people who attend their
      assessment appointment in the MotivATE group verses the control group. Usage data generated
      by the intervention will also be assessed. Twenty participants from the MotivATE group will
      be invited to give qualitative feedback about their experience of the intervention.
