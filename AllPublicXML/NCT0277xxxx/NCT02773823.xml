    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of comprehensive behavior on cardiovascular
      health among obese schoolchildren. The intervention methods include dietary instruction and
      exercise intervention. The main outcomes are weight, body mass index, blood pressure, lipids
      and glucose.

    <textblock>
      Two public primary schools of a similar size were selected. They were allocated either to the
      intervention or control group. Children in Grade 4th and 5th in each school were invited to
      participate in the physical examination (height and weight measures).Obese children based on
      Chinese BMI cut-off points were included in this study.Children in the intervention group
      were encouraged to take healthy diet habits and increased their physical activity.After eight
      months healthy behavior intervention, Children's height, weight, waist, hip, blood pressure,
      cardiorespiratory fitness will be measured. Fasting blood will be taken to measure lipids and
      glucose levels.

    <description>Body weight will be measured with light clothes using a scale to the nearest 0.1 kg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body mass index of study children</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index is defined as the individual's body weight divided by the square of his or her height (height is measured using a non- stretchable tape suspended from the wall is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist circumference of study children</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference will be measured using a tape around his or her bare abdomen to the nearest 0.1 cm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured three times by auscultation method with appropriate cuff size after 20 minutes of rest.The average of the blood pressure measurements is defined as hypertension if it was &gt;95th percentile according to their age, gender and height percentile.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood lipids</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be obtained in the morning by venipuncture after an overnight fast. Serum lipid profiles (total cholesterol ,triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein) will be measured using routine enzymatic methods.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples is obtained in the morning by venipuncture after an overnight fast. The glucose oxidase method was used in the determination of blood glucose levels.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>cardiorespiratory fitness of study children</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiorespiratory refers to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity. It is measured by 20 meter shuttle-run test.</description>
