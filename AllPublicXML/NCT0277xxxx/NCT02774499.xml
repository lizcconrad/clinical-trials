  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral medications like gabapentin and acetaminophen are commonly given to patients prior to
      surgery to provide balanced anaesthesia. Intravenous methadone has been shown to decrease
      postoperative pain as well as postoperative nausea and vomiting, which are known barriers to
      discharge. Oral methadone would be a convenient alternative to give as a preoperative
      medication with its bioavailability approaching 80%. No clinical trials to date have explored
      the utility of oral methadone as a preoperative analgesic to improve postoperative outcomes.
      Current literature shows preoperative IV methadone reduces opioid consumption in the
      perioperative period for cardiac surgeries; therefore, investigators hypothesize that
      preoperative oral methadone will also reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption in
      patients undergoing sternotomy for cardiac surgery.

      Investigators propose a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to
      investigate the effects of preoperative oral methadone on postoperative pain. The trial will
      be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and University of
      Saskatchewan Research Ethics Committee principles using an intent-to-treat model. The primary
      endpoint will be postoperative pain in the ICU, and secondary outcomes will include morphine
      requirements as measured by Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA). Secondary endpoints include
      opioid consumption at 15 minutes and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours post extubation.
      Other secondary endpoints include the following: pain with cough (using a 0-10 verbal pain
      scale) measured at the time of extubation then daily until post-op day three. Secondary
      outcomes that will be recorded from nursing assessment records include: incidence of nausea
      and/or vomiting requiring antiemetics, pruritus, hypoventilation (respiratory rate less than
      8 breaths/min), hypoxemia (oxygen saturation less than 90%), time to extubation, and sedation
      (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of -4 or -5).

      Patients will receive a dose of either oral methadone or placebo prior to entering the
      operating room. The dose given will be 0.3 mg/kg (to a maximum of 30 mg) or equivalent volume
      of placebo. An blinded research assistant will receive an envelope the morning of surgery
      outlining if the patient is in group A or B as well as their weight in kg. For the methadone
      arm the research assistant will prepare the appropriate amount of methadone, which is
      dispensed as 10 mg/mL, and dilute it to a total volume of 5 mL in sugary syrup to mask its
      taste. For the placebo arm a similar volume will be mixed at a 0.3 mg/kg volume and diluted
      to a total volume of 5 mL of sugary syrup. The methadone or placebo will be given to the
      researcher in a syringe. The researcher will give syringe to the patient and the patient will
      administer the solution to themself orally prior to entering the operating room.
