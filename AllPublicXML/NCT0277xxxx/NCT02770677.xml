  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD patients will be recruited and randomly assigned into one of each group: 1) Control
      group or 2) Yoga group. In Yoga groups, subjected will be asked to participate in Modified
      Dantien Yoga training for 12 weeks (3 times/week, 60 min/time). The subjects will be
      evaluated their pulmonary function, functional fitness performance, dyspnea score, and
      quality of life at baseline and after 12 wk training.
