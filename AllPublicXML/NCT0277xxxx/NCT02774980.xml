  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with depression are frequently treatment resistant. Clinical manifestations of
      depression are various, but cognitive dysfunctions are commonly present. Many factors are
      involved in treatment resistance. As no biological marker is available, clinical markers
      could be considered in predicting response to antidepressive treatment.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between the cognitive changes and the
      remission of depressive symptoms in patients with recurrent depression (Stage 2 of Thase and
      Rush classification).

      To explore the dynamics of cognitive dimension associated to clinical and functional
      remission, the investigators will observe neurocognitive functioning before and after
      introducing a new antidepressive therapy.
