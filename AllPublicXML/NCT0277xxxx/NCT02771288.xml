  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety and long-term vascular remodeling after bioresorbable vascular
      scaffold (BVS) implantation for stenotic or occluded lesion in children or young adults with
      Kawasaki disease (KD).

      Background: KD occurs worldwide, most prevalent in Japan and East Asian countries. Coronary
      artery lesion is the predominant determinant of KD outcome in the long-term. Children with KD
      with aneurysms at least 6 mm in maximal diameter had a greater than 50% chance of developing
      a clinically significant stenotic lesion during follow-up. They are at risk of myocardial
      infarction-related sudden death or congestive heart failure as young adults. Bypass surgery
      could be the reasonable strategy but the long-term patency of the graft remains
      unsatisfactory. Percutaneous angioplasty with drug-eluting stents (DES) implantation is the
      alternative. However, metallic stenting remains problematic in several aspects mainly due to
      the restriction of vessel expansive remodeling. The novel BVS has the potential to be free
      from the limitation due to scaffold degradation.

      we will conduct a single-center, single-group prospective study with safety and imaging
      endpoints. A total of 10 KD children or young adults with indication of revascularization are
      enrolled, and BVS will be implanted for stenotic or occluded lesions. QCA and optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) are used to evaluate the baseline lumen area, plaque
      characteristics, and BVS expansion or eccentricity after deployment. At 12 months, scaffold
      restenosis is evaluated by multislice computed tomography. At 30 months, patients will
      receive follow-up by angiography and OCT to evaluate lumen area, neoplaque characteristics,
      and side branch conditions. Otherwise, the composite endpoint including cardiac death,
      myocardial infarction, and ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation are assessed at
      30 days, 6 and 9 months, and 1, 2, 3 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. In the single-group prospective study with safety and imaging endpoints, a total of 10
             KD patients &lt; 18 years will be enrolled.

          2. The diagnosis of KD was made based on clinical criteria for KD.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction or unstable arrhythmias, or those
        who has severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 35%), intrastent
        restenotic lesions, lesions located in the left main coronary artery, and tight lesions
        which could not be well dilated even after rotational atherectomy are excluded. Those with
        chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl) are also excluded due to the limitation
        of OCT (optical coherence tomography) use.
