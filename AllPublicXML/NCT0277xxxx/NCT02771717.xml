  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a low exhaled nitric oxide reading (&lt;27ppb)
      is a good predictor of a negative response to inhaled steroid treatment for patients with
      symptoms suggestive of asthma.

      At the first visit, which will take place at either at the GP surgery or the Nottingham
      Respiratory Research Unit (NRRU) informed written consent for the study will be obtained. The
      patients will then have an exhaled NO measurement, spirometry, venepuncture (for Full Blood
      Count and research blood - if consent obtained) taken and complete an Asthma Control
      Questionnaire (ACQ), Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (MRC) and Leicester Cough
      Questionnaire (LCQ). All procedures will be carried out by the NRRU research nurse.

      The investigators may use the NRRU existing database of research volunteers to recruit as
      necessary and also the respiratory clinics held at the NUH. If patients from clinics are
      recruited they will be initially approached by their usual care doctor and an information
      sheet will be sent / given to them accordingly.

      If all the inclusion criteria are met and none of the exclusion criteria, the patients will
      be randomised to receive either a placebo inhaler, to be taken one puff twice daily, or a low
      dose inhaled steroid treatment, Budesonide 200mcgs via Turbuhaler one puff twice daily, for 3
      months. Dr Tim Harrison will be prescribing the inhalers and they will be dispensed from the
      Nottingham City Hospital Clinical Trials Pharmacy and delivered/given to the patient by the
      research nurses.

      Participants will be asked to return for follow up visits at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks
      following randomisation. At these follow up visits, exhaled NO, spirometry and the 3
      questionnaires will be repeated.
