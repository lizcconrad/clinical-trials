  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC)
      initiates autonomic nervous system response and affects the prognosis in patients with acute
      ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) has proven effective in reducing the
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. But the defensive mechanism of RIPostC still unclear. Stroke is
      frequently associated with autonomic dysfunction. Heart rate variability (HRV) represents the
      autonomic nervous system activity.This study aims to investigate whether RIPostC correlates
      with autonomic function and thus predicts prognosis of stroke.

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability.The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.0 - No symptoms.1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.6 - Dead.</description>

    <measure>Barthel Index(BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>at the time points of baseline and 7,30 and 90 days after treatments</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index scale is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Each performance item is rated on this scale with a given number of points assigned to each level or ranking.It uses ten variables describing ADL and mobility. A higher number is associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence following discharge from hospital.The ten variables addressed in the Barthel scale are:presence or absence of fecal incontinence;presence or absence of urinary incontinence;help needed with grooming;help needed with toilet use help needed with feeding;help needed with transfers (e.g. from chair to bed) help needed with walking;help needed with dressing;help needed with climbing stairs;and help needed with bathing.</description>
