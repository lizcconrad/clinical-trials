  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male or female subjects, 18 years and above, undergoing hip, knee or spinal surgery with an
      expected hospital stay for 4 days or more will be included in the trial. Individual trial
      duration will be for 7 days (follow-up). Two hundred subjects will be included in the trial,
      i.e. 100 subjects per arm. The treatment arm (either new or standard wound dressing) will be
      assigned by randomization stratified by type of surgery (i.e. hip, knee or spine).

    <description>The comfort, conformability and the acceptability of the dressing were measured on all visit in the study, by a study nurses. The patient had to answer questions regarding, the size of the dressing, shape of the dressing, Visibility beneath the dressing, ease of the application of the dressing, ease of removal of the dressing, overall experience of the use of the dressing, notice any pain at dressing change, Comfort of their dressing, overall experience of their dressing. The patient could chose between 1 Good, 2 Very good, 3 Excellent.In most cases, the patient chose very good to excellent for both hip and knee surgery</description>
