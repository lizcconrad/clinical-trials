    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Successful history of silicone hydrogel or other soft contact lens wear (except for
             daily disposable lenses) in both eyes during the past 3 months and history of at least
             5 consecutive days of successful DAILY wear in both eyes at Visit 1;

          -  Best spectacle corrected distance visual acuity greater than or equal to 0.8 (decimal
             visual acuity) in each eye;

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             preclude safe administration of the investigational products or affect the results of
             this study;

          -  Need to wear contact lenses on an extended wear basis (ie, overnight) during the
             study;

          -  Monocular (only 1 eye with functional vision) or fit with only 1 lens;

          -  Use of a daily cleaner and/or enzyme cleaner to care for lenses at least 7 days prior
             to Visit 1 (use of lens rewetting drops is acceptable);

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational
             products;

          -  Unwilling or unable to abstain from use of all over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed
             topical ocular medications (except for rewetting drops) within 7 days prior to Visit 1
             and for the duration of the study;

          -  Moderate (grade 3) or severe (grade 4) corneal edema, corneal staining, injection
             (limbal hyperemia, bulbar conjunctival hyperemia), tarsal abnormalities, or &quot;other&quot;
             findings;

          -  Corneal vascularization that is mild (grade 2) or higher;

          -  Conjunctival or structural lid abnormalities or abnormal corneal opacities at Visit 1;

          -  Current or history of ocular infection, severe inflammation or disease within 6 months
             prior to Visit 1;

          -  Any systemic disease (including allergies, respiratory infections or colds) that may
             affect the eye or be exacerbated by use of contact lenses or contact lens solutions;

          -  Use of systemic medications that may contribute to adverse ocular effects unless on a
             stable dosing regimen for a minimum of 30 days prior to Visit 1;

          -  Ocular or intra-ocular surgery and/or ocular trauma within the last 12 months
             (excluding placement of punctal plugs);

          -  Participation in any investigational clinical study within 30 days of Visit 1;

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.
