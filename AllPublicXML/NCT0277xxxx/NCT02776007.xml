  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Libre- flash glucose monitoring system is an episodic real-time data on demand device.
      This means that patients can measure their glucose level when they choose by scanning the
      device, while at the same time a sensor automatically measures and continuously stores
      glucose readings day and night. Every scan shows the current glucose reading and the last 8
      hours of glucose. There are no alarms and the system does not require calibration.

      In the present study we aim to evaluate treatment satisfaction and comfort using the Libre
      flash glucose monitoring system compared to conventional Self Measurement of Blood Glucose
      (SMBG) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes that discontinued using continuous glucose
      monitoring.

      The second aim of the study is to evaluate the rate of use and the impact of Libre use
      compared to Self-Measurement of Blood Glucose among adolescents who are sub-optimally
      controlled and stopped using Continuous Glucose Monitoring. The study is an investigator
      initiated study, single-center, randomized, parallel study of 12 weeks with an optional
      cross-over 12 weeks extension period .
