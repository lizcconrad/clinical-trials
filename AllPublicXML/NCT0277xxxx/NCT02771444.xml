  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate image quality of a low-dose tomosynthesis system versus a
      comparator. Subjects will undergo a four-view tomosynthesis examination with the comparator
      and with the study device, and images will be assessed by several radiologists by comparing
      details in the images from the two systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tomosynthesis is a relatively new technology to acquire mammographic images where images are
      acquired over several projection angles, giving 3d information that can help radiologists
      assess images.

      The aim of the study is to see whether a new low-dose tomosynthesis system has comparable
      image quality at a lower x-ray radiation dose to a comparator.
