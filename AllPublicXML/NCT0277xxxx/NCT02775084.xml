  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
      supplementation on subjects' pan CD4+ T cell function, cognition, and muscle function. Half
      of the participants will receive fish oil, while the other half will receive a placebo (olive
      oil).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generalized inflammation has been consistently associated with aging and metabolic diseases,
      often characterized by reduced muscle and cognitive function. Although much of the
      aging-associated inflammation has been attributed to chronic activation of the innate host
      defense system, activated CD4+ T cells have been shown to contribute directly to the
      pathogenesis of several other inflammatory diseases. In humans, dietary n-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),
      have anti-inflammatory properties and reduce disease symptoms, in part, through suppression
      of CD4+ T cell activation. Therefore, the Researchers' overall hypothesis is that dietary
      supplementation with DHA and EPA in humans will ameliorate inflammatory symptoms, in part, by
      suppressing CD4+ T cell activation, positively affecting muscle and cognitive function.
