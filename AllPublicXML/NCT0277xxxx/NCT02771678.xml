  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to estimate the quality of life for people with asthma and
      specifically the loss in quality of life associated with an asthma-related crisis event
      (accident and emergency (A&amp;E) attendance or admission).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a serious respiratory condition which causes shortness of breath, chest tightness
      and wheezing. Quality of life can have an impact on asthmatics due to such symptoms. Previous
      studies capture quality of life at specific time points (e.g. baseline, 1 month, 3 months),
      and the assumption of a steady improvement is made. However, these assumptions and time
      points could miss an asthma event in between. Therefore, the investigators aim to provide a
      more accurate estimation of the loss in quality of life by following participants over an 8
      week period from when the participants have attended A&amp;E or been admitted to hospital
      following an asthma attack. This will be done by using different quality of life methods, and
      analysed by calculating the difference between the quality of life scores from A&amp;E attendance
      / hospital admission and follow-ups.
