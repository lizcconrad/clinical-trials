    <textblock>
      A dose escalating study with 3 different dosing regimens of the studied vaccine (IPOVAC-
      POLYVAC-Vietnam) and a licensed vaccine (IMOVAC-Sanofi Pasteur- France) is conducted in
      Vietnamese children, aged 2 months and above to assess the safety and immunogenicity. Two
      hundred and forty children are enrolled and placed randomly into 4 groups (60
      children/group), each of which receive 3 doses of vaccine subcutaneously, at 4 week interval.
      Safety issues included immediate reaction at the site of injection and systemic reaction
      within 30 min of administration, within 7 days after each dose, unexpected event occur within
      30 days of each dose, SAE (from start of dose 1 to 30 days after dose 3), blood cell count,
      urea, ALT,AST. Immunogenicity outcomes include seroconversion of neutralising antibodies for
      each of vaccine serotypes.

    <textblock>
      The use of oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) in Vietnam expanded immunisation program has
      resulted in successful eradication of polio in Vietnam. However due to the concern of
      OPV-related poliomyelitis cases occurred worldwide, WHO has recommended the countries to
      gradually change to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). In Vietnam, POLYVAC has been approved
      and sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology to produce IPV under Japanese
      technology. The vaccine consisting of 3 serotypes (Serotype 1,2 and 3) has been proven safety
      in volunteer adults.

      In this study, a dose escalating study with 3 different dosing regimens of the studied
      vaccine (IPOVAC) and a licensed vaccine (IMOVAC-Sanofi Pasteur- France) is conducted in
      Vietnamese children, aged 2 months and above to assess the safety and immunogenicity. Two
      hundred and forty children are enrolled and placed randomly into 4 groups (60
      children/group), each of which receive 3 doses of vaccine subcutaneously, at 4 week interval.
      Safety issues evaluated include immediate reaction at the site of injection and systemic
      reaction within 30 min of administration, within 7 days after each dose, unexpected event
      occur within 30 days of each dose, SAE (from start of dose 1 to 30 days after dose 3), blood
      cell count, urea, ALT,AST. Seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies for each of
      vaccine serotypes are to be assessed.
