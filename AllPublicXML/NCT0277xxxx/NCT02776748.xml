  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the magnitude and extent of infant exposure to daily
      emtricitabine (FTC) /tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) via maternal breastmilk when taken
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by lactating HIV-uninfected women. The primary outcome is the
      steady state concentrations of emtricitabine and tenofovir in the infant plasma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, short-duration, open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose, pharmacokinetic
      study of daily FTC/TDF PrEP among HIV-uninfected lactating mother-infant pairs. PrEP will be
      administered to women through daily directly observed therapy for 10 consecutive days -
      sufficient to reach steady-state but discontinuing thereafter. No drug will be administered
      to the infant directly. Co-formulated FTC and TDF were dosed at 200 mg daily and 300 mg
      daily, respectively. The overall goal is to quantify the magnitude and degree to which
      breastfeeding infants are exposed to FTC/TDF when used as PrEP by HIV-uninfected lactating
      women. Maternal blood and breastmilk samples will be obtained concurrently (i.e., within 30
      minutes of each other) regardless of the timing of food intake (i.e., non-fasting) on the 7th
      and 10th day. Peak samples will be obtained 1-2 hours after the maternal directly observed
      PrEP and trough samples were obtained at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 23 to 24 hours
      after directly observed PrEP dose). A single infant blood sample will be obtained after the
      maternal 7th directly observed PrEP dose.

      We will conduct quantitative measurements and analyses of infant plasma drug concentrations,
      infant-plasma to breastmilk and breastmilk to maternal plasma drug concentration ratios to
      characterize FTC and TDF transmission to breast feeding infants. Tenofovir and emtricitabine
      concentrations in plasma and breastmilk will be quantified via previously validated liquid
      chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) methods in accordance with the
      recommendations included in the US Food and Drug Administration, Guidance for Industry,
      Bioanalytical Method Validation guidelines.
