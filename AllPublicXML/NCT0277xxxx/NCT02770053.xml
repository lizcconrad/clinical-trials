    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether enlarging the apical foramen causes
      postoperative pain in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foraminal enlargement (FE) is an intentional procedure that enlarges the cement canal.
      However, some RCTs indicate that enlarging the FE causes postoperative pain, flare-up, and
      destroy the apical constriction, whilst some RCTs pointed out there is no difference in terms
      of pain when a FE has been performed. The investigators, therefore, would like to conduct a
      RCT to increase both sample size and the number of published studies to do a systematic
      review for this topic.

    <description>Endodontic treatment will be performed in teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical periodontitis. Local anaesthesia will be provided (2% Novocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine), isolation with rubber dam and standard access cavity preparation will be done.Using 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite, canal negotiation will be done. Foraminal enlargement will be achieved with #35 K-files in foraminal enlargement group after determining working length. Coronal flaring with # 2 and #3 Gates-Glidden drills will be done. The canals will be obturated with gutta-percha and epoxy resin sealer. The treatments will be carried out in single-visit.</description>
