      The purpose of this study is to determine whether multiple-dose administration of nebicapone
      affects the pharmacokinetics of warfarin.

      Study design and methodology:

      This was a single-centre, open-label, randomised, two-way crossover study in healthy young
      male and female volunteers. The study consisted of 2 treatment periods separated by a washout
      period of 14 days or more. In one period, subjects received nebicapone 200 mg thrice-daily
      (tid) for 9 days, and a warfarin 25 mg single-dose concomitantly with the morning dose of
      nebicapone on Day 4. In the other period, a warfarin 25 mg single-dose was administered
      alone. Warfarin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were characterised following
      warfarin dosing.
