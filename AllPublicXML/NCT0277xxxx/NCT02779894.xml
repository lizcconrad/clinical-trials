      This project develops a new form of management of subjects with suspected SAHS and different
      sleep disorders by applying Information and communications technologies (ICT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a prevalent disease with significant morbidity
      resulting in long waiting lists and high health care costs. Therefore, alternative
      cost-effective approaches are urgently needed. A possible procedure is telemedicine based on
      ICT.

      The design of the study is prospective, randomized, controlled, open and parallel.

      A ICT-based out of hospital management of SAHS is implemented to be compared with the
      classical in-hospital management.

      The main objectives were the evaluation of both groups and the analysis of efficacy and cost
      effectiveness of two SAHS management programs.

      This is a 3 month randomized, with parallel groups study. Participants will be patients with
      suspicion of SAHS derived to the Investigators' Sleep Unit.

      Patients are randomized in two groups; 1) classical in-hospital group: polysomnography or
      home respiratory polygraphy (HRP), CPAP titration and treatment and hospital follow-up; and
      2) ICT group: 3 consecutive HRPs, automatic CPAP treatment and control by phone/video
      conferences and data transmission by using a custom designed platform.

    <description>Patients referred to the sleep unit and randomized to Hospital group. Participants will be diagnosed in the hospital either by Polysomnography , Respiratory Polygraphy or one night Home Respiratory Polygraphy. In case of requiring CPAP treatment, the titration and adjustment of patient's will be accomplished at the hospital. This patient's will be monitored during 3 months of the study at the hospital.</description>

    <description>Patients referred to the sleep unit and randomized to intervention group. Participants will be diagnosed at home by 3 night Home Respiratory Polygraphy. In case of requiring CPAP treatment, the adjustment will be performed at the CPAP supplier center, titration will be performed at home and patient's compliance and treatment will be controlled via remote. During the 3 months of the study patient's will be controlled via phono/video conferences and with a platform designed for the study.</description>
