  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research protocol to determine the feasibility of assessing lead levels in
      hunters who use lead projectiles. This study will determine if it is possible to perform an
      interventional double-blind placebo-controlled study of lead levels in hunters using lead or
      lead-free projectiles following consumption of self-harvested wild game. The hypothesis for
      the subsequent study is that minute lead particles from shrapnel dispersed through the animal
      during harvest are ingested and result in increased lead serum levels. This current
      observational study establishes if this conclusive interventional study is possible through
      establishing if hunters using lead projectiles in New Zealand have elevated lead levels after
      eating animals harvested with lead projectiles. This study will be conducted in compliance
      with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice Standards, associated regulations and institutional
      research requirements.

      This study aims to assess if hunters eating meat shot with lead projectiles experience
      elevated lead levels. Hunters will be asked to provide blood samples 2-4 days after they eat
      meat harvested with lead bullets and provide a subsequent sample when they have abstained
      from eating wild game harvested with lead bullets. We have chosen to use deer as the species
      for this study to reduce variation and New Zealand is the ideal place to conduct this study
      because of year-round hunting of deer. This design will allows paired testing of subject lead
      levels.
