  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at testing whether use of a new index to measure risk for HIV in the
      context of HIV testing and counseling will increase demand for safe male circumcision (SMC)
      services among HIV-negative non-muslim men in Rakai. We will also study whether use of the
      index leads to positive sexual behavioral modifications among men. The study will also
      measure acceptability of the index among men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three randomized trials, one of which was conducted in Rakai, Uganda, have shown that safe
      male circumcision (SMC) reduces HIV acquisition in men by approximately 60%. Recommendations
      from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme (UNAIDS)
      emphasize that SMC should be considered an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention in
      countries and regions with heterosexual epidemics, high HIV and low male circumcision
      prevalence.

      In Sub Saharan Africa, 14 countries including Uganda have been selected to scale up SMC, for
      these countries the target is to achieve 80% circumcision prevalence by 2015 and maintain it
      till 2025. The scale up would avert more than 20 percent of new infections among men and
      women. However SMC programs are faced with the challenge of low uptake of SMC by older
      sexually active men who might be at higher risk of HIV. The need to increase SMC coverage
      among men at high risk of HIV requires tools to measure individual HIV risk.

      Rakai Health Sciences Program has received funding to carry out an individual randomized,
      unblinded, two-arm 1:1 trial comprising a total of 968 men (484 men per study arm) from Rakai
      Community Cohort Study (RCCS) to assess whether HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT), enhanced
      with measurement and communication of HIV risk (eHCT), increases uptake of SMC and leads to
      behavior modification among HIV-negative sexually active men aged 15-49 years in Rakai
      District, Uganda.

      The study is using a risk nomogram developed from the Rakai Community Cohort Study data to
      measure individual HIV risk in the intervention group and standard HCT in the control arm.
      All men enrolled will be followed at six months to ascertain circumcision status and collect
      brief information on sexual behaviors such as number of sex partners, use of alcohol with
      sex, detailed data on their sexual partners etc.The study will also measure acceptability of
      the index among men.
