    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is conducted within the research project 'Computerized Lung Sound
      Analysis'. The research goal is the development of a system enabling the automatic
      classification of lung sounds, which will result in a decision support system for physicians.

      The objective of this trial is to create a small lung sound corpus, enabling the development
      of a prototype of the described system. Therefore, investigators record lung sounds with
      several lung sound transducers distributed on the posterior chest of human test subjects.

      In this clinical trial investigators record lung sounds over the posterior chest of human
      test subjects. The subjects are either lung-healthy (control group) or subjects with
      pneumothorax condition or pulmonary fibrosis. The lung sounds are recorded in supine position
      on an examination table. A foam pad with several lung sound transducers is placed under the
      back of the subjects. During the recording the subjects wear a nose clip and hold a
      pneumotachograph with both hands. The subjects are instructed to breath at a certain airflow
      rate during inspiration, with natural breathing during expiration. For each subject
      investigators simultaneously record 30 seconds of the airflow signal and the lung sounds from
      16 lung sound transducers.

    <description>The lung sounds are recorded over the posterior chest in supine position on an examination table. A foam pad with several lung sound transducers is placed under the back of the subjects. During the recording the subjects wear a nose clip and hold a pneumotachograph with both hands. The subjects are instructed to breath at a certain airflow rate during inspiration, with natural breathing during expiration. Therefore, they receive a real-time feedback for the airflow rate. The airflow signal and the lung sounds from 16 lung sound transducers are recorded simultaneously for 30 seconds.</description>
