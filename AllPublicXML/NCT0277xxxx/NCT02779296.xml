    <textblock>
      Surgical Site Infections (SSI) represents a significant complication in plastic surgery.
      Infections can result in a prolonged recovery and impair long-term cosmetic appearance. One
      potential method to reduce infection is by applying a thin layer of dermal glue over the
      sutures at the site of incision immediately after the surgery. Conventional closures, such as
      sutures or staples, leave the site vulnerable until epithelialization occurs in 24 to 48
      hours. In contrast, dermal glue provides an instant, waterproof barrier and it has been shown
      to have intrinsic bacteriostatic properties. The glue is supplied as a liquid enclosed in a
      vial and when applied, polymerizes rapidly in an exothermic reaction in the presence of
      moisture to form a solid adhesive. 2-Octylcyanoacrylate (2-OCA)-based glue is formulated to
      be more flexible than previous preparations. The application of dermal glue is rapid, simple
      and requires no specific follow-up as it naturally sloughs off overtime. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if 2-OCA-based glue can reduce the rate of surgical site infection
      following surgery. Patients undergoing breast surgery will be recruited and randomized to
      either a group receiving a layer of glue over sutures following surgery or no treatment.
      Patients will be followed up at 30 days and at 8 months for signs of infection, additional
      complications and the visual appearance of the scars. The cost of treating and infection will
      be calculated to determine if using dermal glue to prevent infection is economically
      feasible. This research has the potential to find a method to reduce surgical site infection,
      which can be applied to other surgeries.
