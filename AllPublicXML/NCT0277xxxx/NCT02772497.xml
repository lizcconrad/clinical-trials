      The purpose is to show the 3-month efficacy and safety in diabetic macular edema treated with
      intravitreal ziv-aflibercept.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multi-studies have shown that Intravitreal aflibercept (Eylea) is effective and safe in
      diabetic macular edema (DME) treatment and has gained FDA approval but it is expansive where
      ziv aflibercept (ZALTRAP) has the same molecule but with high osmilar buffer solution which
      is FDA approved for colon rectus cancer treatment and it is cost effective.

      Studies have shown that intravitreal ziv aflibercept is safe and nontoxic despite the high
      osmolarity and even has short term effect in wet age related macular degeneration.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with central diabetic macular edema

          -  Best corrected visual acuity is 20/25 or less

          -  Central macular thickness more than 250 microns

          -  Patients who are able to come for all follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          -  Myocardial infarction, other acute cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 4
             months prior to randomization

          -  For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 3 years.

          -  Macular edema is present that is considered to be related to ocular surgery such as
             cataract extraction

          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more

          -  History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, scleral buckle, any intraocular
             surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or anticipated within the next 6 months following
             randomization.

          -  Exam evidence of severe external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis,
             chalazion, or substantial blepharitis
