  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to examine whether an intervention to increase physical
      activity using a body-worn sensor affects cognitive (thinking) processes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall duration of participation in this research study is approximately 4 months.
      During this time, three study visits will be required. The first visit is for informed
      consent and screening, the second visit is for baseline fitness and cognitive testing, and
      the third visit is for follow-up fitness and cognitive testing after a 12-week physical
      activity monitoring program. Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms, a
      physical activity monitoring arm and a flexibility and balance arm. Both study arms involve
      wearing a physical activity sensor and monitoring physical activity for a duration of 12
      weeks.

    <description>Participants will wear a physical activity sensor on the hip or waist with a belt. They will be instructed to increase their physical activity level to at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. They will be asked to follow guidelines in the &quot;Go4Life&quot; brochure, website, and/or videos by the National Institute on Aging. Participants will receive weekly phone calls to monitor their progress, to provide feedback, and to suggest example exercises.</description>
