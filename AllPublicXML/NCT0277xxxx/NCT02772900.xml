  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging has been associated with reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial
      dysfunction. Beetroot consumption, a nitrate-rich food, has been associated with increased NO
      bioconversion, which may promote beneficial effects on vascular health. The present study
      evaluated the effects of a beetroot-based nutritional gel (BG) on vascular function, arterial
      stiffness and blood pressure in the elderly at cardiometabolic risk. Twenty elderly
      individuals were submitted to BG and nitrate-depleted gel (PLA) interventions. Brachial
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD), blood flow velocity (BFV), peak wave velocity (PWVβ),
      augmentation index (AI), stiffness parameter (β), pressure-strain elasticity modulus (Ep),
      arterial compliance (AC), muscle oxygenation and function were measured 90 min after
      interventions. Urinary nitrate, nitrite, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured at baseline, 90 min and 150 min after
      interventions.
