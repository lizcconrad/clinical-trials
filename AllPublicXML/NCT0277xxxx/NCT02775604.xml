  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and potential impact of video analysis
      of footage taken with a GoPro camera video in comparison to a homeowner checklist or gold
      standard home assessment as a means of detecting home fall hazards.

      Investigators hypothesize that the assessment of homes for fall hazards with a GoPro camera
      will be better than a homeowner paper checklist in hazard identification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 community-dwelling adults will be recruited from clinics and the community through posters
      and advertising (n = 20 in the 50-60 years age group; n = 20 in the 75 years and above age
      group).

      Participants will be randomly allocated to a homeowner paper checklist or a GoPro video
      assessment and then cross-over to the opposite intervention.

      To assess accuracy, a gold standard home assessment will be completed by a trained evaluator,
      after the homeowner checklist and GoPro video assessment.

      Upon completion of the data collection, the evaluator will conduct their assessment (gold
      standard); review the findings from the GoPro &quot;playback&quot; with the participant, and conduct a
      semi-structured interview on their prior awareness of fall hazards, perceptions about the
      different methods of detecting fall hazards in their home; and intentions to remediate
      identified hazards.

They will navigate through their home wearing the GoPro camera, recording images about their home and their usual activities and use a talk-aloud approach to describe what they are doing and seeing.
