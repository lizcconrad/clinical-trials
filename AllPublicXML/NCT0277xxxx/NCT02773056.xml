  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine if the Dynamic Socket and
      Sub-Ischial alternative interface designs improve socket comfort, residual limb health,
      increase function and be preferred over the standard of care Ischial Ramus Containment (IRC)
      interface for the military and veteran living with transfemoral limb loss.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin Temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Accommodation with new prosthetic sockets is approximately 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous skin temperature measurement (Celsius) will be taken during treadmill walking at self-selected comfortable speed</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perspiration</measure>
    <time_frame>Accommodation with new prosthetic sockets is approximately 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Perspiration will be measured by tare weight (grams) following treadmill walking.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vertical Interface Movement (Pistoning)</measure>
    <time_frame>Accommodation with new prosthetic sockets is approximately 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Pistoning will be defined as the numerical difference of interface to skeletal movement (cm) between simulated swing (lifting the prosthetic side) and stance (single support on the prosthetic side) as measured by coronal X-Ray.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance and Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Accommodation with new prosthetic sockets is approximately 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The gold standard test of standing balance is the sensory organization test (SOT) administered on the Neurocom Equitest platform. The SOT score is a unitless number. Subjects stand on a pair of platforms that record force data and tilt in the sagittal plane during 6 varying conditions that challenge the visual, vestibular and somatosensory systems. With compromised ability to use an ankle strategy for balance, a hip strategy is routinely adopted, therefore higher interface trim lines could adversely affect performance on this test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Accommodation with new prosthetic sockets is approximately 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Socket Comfort Score (rated on an 11-point 0-10 scale) will be used to assess patients' comfort in the respective sockets.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Accommodation with new prosthetic sockets is approximately 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked which socket they preferred.</description>
