  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With aging population, total knee arthroplasty is performed with increasing frequency.
      Although the surgery is successful in general, significant number of patients suffers
      persistent pain and disability. Traditional risk assessment tool have been focused on single
      organ systems. Our investigators have found that mobility, assessed by the Mobility
      Assessment Tool short form (MAT-sf), is a simple and accurate method to predict postoperative
      outcome, including length of stay, postoperative complications, and nursing home placement
      for older patients. Prehabilitation is the process of enhancing a person's functional
      capacity to withstand an incoming stressor. Although multiple studies have tested
      prehabilitation before joint replacement surgery, results have been mixed. The investigators
      hypothesize that patients with limited mobility are most likely to benefit from
      prehabilitation. The investigators plan to use individualized aquatic exercise as a
      prehabilitation tool to enhance compliance; the resistance of water strengthen muscle and
      increasing energy expenditure; the buoyancy of water provides environment where the joints
      are not weight bearing. The aims of the study are: 1) To evaluate the feasibility of
      prehabilitation using 6-8 weeks of aquatic exercise in 40 geriatric patients who are
      scheduled for total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis; 2) To examine the effects of 6-8
      weeks of aquatic exercise on mobility, pain, stiffness, physical function, cognitive function
      and depression; inflammatory markers and 3) To estimate the effect of prehabilitation on
      postoperative outcomes. The investigators plan to enroll 40 patients age &gt;50, who are
      scheduled for elective primary total knee replacement. Investigators will screen patients in
      the Preoperative Assessment Clinic and enroll patients who have decreased mobility, measured
      by MAT-sf. Patients will be randomized into either a prehabilitation group or a usual care
      group. All the participants will undergo extensive assessment on their pain, stiffness, and
      physical function, depression, balance and cognitive function using the Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the expanded Short Physical Performance
      Battery (eSPPB), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Serum inflammatory markers will be
      assessed at the baseline. The prehabilitation group will undergo 6-8 weeks of individualized
      aquatic exercise in a heated pool (60 min/session, 3 times per week). Aquatic equipment maybe
      used to challenge balance and trunk stabilization. All participants will be reassessed
      immediately before surgery and 4 weeks after the surgery using WOMAC, eSPPB, MoCA and MAT-sf.
      Serum inflammatory markers and body composition will be reassessed at the same time points.
      The primary outcome of interest is will be postoperative complications, length of stay,
      Intensive Care Unit length of stay, and institutionalization. If successful, investigators
      will have sound pilot data for several critical health outcomes with which to support an
      external proposal for a larger-scale study.
