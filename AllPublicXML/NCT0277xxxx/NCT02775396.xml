  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing reliance on tablet computers and smartphones in daily life, it is
      important to determine whether and how the prolonged usage of these handheld digital devices
      influences the working habits and refractive status. This study aimed to determine the
      effects of wearing conventional single-vision lenses vs. new progressive addition lenses on
      the working distance and refractive status while playing interactive video game in Chinese
      pre-presbyopic adult computer users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chinese adult computer users were recruited from two age cohorts. They were prescribed, in
      random order, with conventional single-vision lenses and progressive addition lenses designed
      for handheld digital display devices (iPad). Basic ocular parameters were measured through a
      comprehensive eye examination at the baseline visit. Working distance and refractive shift
      were measured immediately after delivering the lenses and after one month of lens wear.
      Working distance were recorded with an automatic ultrasound sensor while the participants
      were playing a 30-minute video game. Refractive-error shift before and after playing the
      video game were measured with an open-field autorefractor in both eyes and averaged.

    <time_frame>Change in near working distance after one month of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Near working distances were measured continuously over a 30-minute interval while the participant was playing computer games using an iPad tablet computer. The mode of the accumulative working distances was analyzed for each 30-minute interval collected immediately after the lens delivery and one-month after the lens wear. Absolute and relative changes in the working distances were analyzed and compared between two lens designs.</description>

    <measure>Change in refractive status measured by an automatic refractometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in refractive status shift after one month of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Refractive status was measured before and after the participant played a 30-minute computer games using an iPad tablet computer. The refractive status shift (post-task refractive status minus pre-task refractive status) was calculated for each 30-minute game play immediately after the lens delivery and one-month after the lens wear. Absolute and relative changes in the refractive shirt were analyzed and compared between two lens designs.</description>

    <description>Wearing a spectacle lens design with corrective prescription power while playing computer game using an iPad tablet computer. Two lens designs were prescribed for each participant: the conventional single-vision lens and a new progressive addition lens designed for handheld digital device. Primary outcome measures were performed immediately after each lens delivery and one-month of lens wear.</description>
