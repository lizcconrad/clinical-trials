    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the within-woman effect of oral micronized progesterone
      (Progesterone 300 mg at bedtime) on semi-quantitative menstrual flow measured by the DivaCup®
      (menstrual cup with volume indicators at 7.5, 15 and 30 ml) or by counting the number of
      soaked normal-sized sanitary products such as normal-sized tampons or pads as well as length
      of flow and frequency and severity of menstrual cramps (on a 0-4 scale) in women with hot
      flushes and night sweats who are qualified to enroll in the primary perimenopausal hot flush
      trial stratified by whether they are in Early or Late Perimenopause.

      The study will be a double-masked, placebo-controlled 28-day (4 week) baseline, 84-day (12
      week) experimental trial, with a maximum number of 125 potential enrollees, with stratified
      random therapy assignment by Early or Late Perimenopause. Participants who meet the inclusion
      criteria for the original Progesterone for Perimenopausal Vasomotor Symptoms Study will be
      invited to join this additional sub-study. As part of the primary trial they will be randomly
      assigned into either the Progesterone or placebo group on a 1:1 basis. Primary and secondary
      data will be collected continuously throughout the study by completion of the Daily
      Perimenopause Diary-flow starting at baseline and continuously throughout the study.

    <description>The dose of 300 mg of Progesterone is a physiological one that maintains the serum progesterone at or above the luteal (normal post-ovulatory) threshold for 24 hours. This duration of action is important because Progesterone is not safely taken during waking hours because of its soporific effects.</description>
