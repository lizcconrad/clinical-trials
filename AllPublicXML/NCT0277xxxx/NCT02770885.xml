  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon like Peptide -1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are well known to stimulate
      glucose-induced insulin secretion and to reduce energy intake. Recent findings from animal
      and human studies suggest a role of GLP-1 in regulating water and salt homeostasis. GLP-1 has
      been shown to reduce fluid intake after an oral salt load or during a meal - pointing to a
      hypodipsic effect. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether these putative hypodipsic
      properties of GLP-1 might be of advantage in persons with an exaggerated thirst perception as
      is the case in patients with primary polydipsia.

      GLP-1 analogues are currently used for the treatment of hyperglycaemia associated with type 2
      diabetes mellitus and given his properties as a natural satiety hormone, the GLP-1 analogue
      liraglutide was recently approved by the FDA for weight management.

      In studies related to the influence of GLP-1 and -analogues in controlling food intake a
      concomitant reduction of fluid consumption has been observed.

      The investigators hypothesize that GLP-1 analogues not only modulate appetite and provide
      satiety but also reduce fluid intake and thirst sensation in humans - especially in those
      with excessive thirst perception (patients with primary polydipsia). In view of future
      therapeutic options for these patients we aim to investigate the influence of the long-acting
      GLP-1 analogue dulaglutide on fluid intake, thirst perception and quality of life in patients
      with primary polydipsia compared to placebo.
