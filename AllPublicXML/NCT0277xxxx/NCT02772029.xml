  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the lethal human cancers worldwide and its incidence
      matches mortality, reflecting the poor prognosis of this disease. The surgical resection rate
      of HCC is low, and the prognosis is poor. Although transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is
      the main treatment for HCC patients who are not candidates for surgical resection, it is not
      considered a curative procedure. For HCC, poor TACE efficacy or TACE failure may be related
      to tumor angiogenesis of the residual disease. Among the many regulatory factors in tumor
      angiogenesis, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) play vital roles in this process.

      Sorafenib is the first systemic treatment drug, which has been approved by the FDA for
      advanced HCC. In order to find an new VEGFR-inhibitor with better effect and lower toxicity,
      Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd. developed Apatinib, a high-performance VEGFR-2 tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor. Apatinib plays anti angiogenic effect in the treatment of malignant tumor
      mainly through inhibition of VEGFR-2, in vivo and in vitro experiments showed good tumor
      growth inhibitory activity on glioma, this study aims to further verify the efficacy and
      safety of Apatinib for first-line treatment failure hepatocellular carcinoma patients, the
      primary endpoint is time to progression(TTP).
