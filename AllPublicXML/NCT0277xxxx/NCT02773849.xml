  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous multi-dose Phase I and Phase II clinical studies have demonstrated that INSTILADRIN
      (nadofaragene firadenovec) is a safe and effective treatment for BCG-refractory and recurrent
      NMIBC. This Phase III study is designed to expand those observations using a high dose of
      INSTILADRIN in patients that are &quot;BCG Unresponsive&quot; which refers to patients with high-grade
      NMIBC who are unlikely to benefit from and should not receive further intravesical BCG.

    <textblock>
      Recombinant IFN alpha2b has pleiotropic effects that contribute to antitumor activity in
      Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). INSTILADRIN is a non-replicating adenovirus
      vector harboring the human IFN alpha2b gene. When combined with the excipient Syn3,
      intravesical administration of the rAd-IFN results in transduction of the virus into the
      epithelial cell lining in the bladder. The IFN alpha2b gene is incorporated into the cellular
      DNA resulting in the synthesis and expression of large amounts of IFN alpha2b protein.
      Clinical studies have confirmed that IFN alpha2b protein can be measured in the urine of
      patients treated with INSTILADRIN within 24 hours after dosing.

             persistent high-grade recurrence within 12 months after BCG was initiated, and those
             who despite an initial complete response (CR) to BCG, relapse with high-grade CIS

             high-grade Ta/T1 NMIBC within 6 months of their last intravesical treatment with BCG.
             The following criteria define the patients who may be included in the study:

             indicated by no evidence of upper tract tumor by either intravenous pyelogram,
             retrograde pyelogram, computed tomography (CT) scan with or without urogram, or MRI
             with or without urogram performed within 6 months of enrollment

          9. Patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance at low risk for progression,
             defined as Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) &lt; 10 ng/dL, Gleason score 6 and clinical
