      Temozolomide may delay progression in sequence with chemotherapy. This open-label,
      randomized,multicenter phase II trial was designed to evaluate the role of Temozolomide
      following 4 or 6 cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy in patients with newly
      diagnosed estensive-stage SCLC.

    <description>Patients in the study will receive the following for the duration of the study:First-line chemotherapy according to the NCCN guidelines. The study will consist of 21-day cycles, to a maximum of 6 cycles of therapy for the first-line chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was allowed. Follow-up until disease progression.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive platinum-based first-line chemotherapy according to the NCCN guidelines. The study will consist of 21-day cycles, to a maximum of 6 cyclesfor the first-line chemotherapy. After first-line treatment, temozolomide will be given alone as maintenance therapy in all patients who have achieved study entry hematologic criteria and who do not have progressive disease or severe toxicity. During temozolomide maintenance therapy, patients will receive temozolomide at 150mg/m2/d for 5 days of a 28-day cycle orally daily. Temozolomide maintenance therapy will continue until progressive disease or irreversible toxicity occurs.
Re-staging will be performed every 2 cycles (every 8 weeks) during the study, radiotherapy was allowed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cytologically and/or histologically confirmed small-cell lung cancer with
             extensive-stage disease

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, this can include brain metastases

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1

          -  Adequate bone marrow function, as defined by: absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
             &gt;1,500/µL; platelets &gt;100,000/µL; hemoglobin &gt;=9.0 g/dL

          -  Normal organ function, defined as follows: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST and ALT
             &lt;=5 × the ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy; total
             serum bilirubin &lt;=1.5 × the ULN; serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 × the ULN

          -  the time interval from the data of the last chemotherapy to random must be between 3
             and 7 weeks

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must
             agree to use a form of birth control that is acceptable to their physician to prevent
             pregnancy during treatment

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign an
             informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Patients receiving other investigational agents

          -  Patients with leptomeningeal involvement

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition or
             HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy. However, HIV testing is
             not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from
             this protocol is necessary because these patients are at increased risk of lethal
             infections when treated with marrow- suppressive therapy. Excluding patients on HAART
             is necessary due to the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with temozolomide.
