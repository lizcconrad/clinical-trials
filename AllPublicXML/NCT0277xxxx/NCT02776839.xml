    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is two fold, first to explore the potential of context sensitive
      intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms, second
      to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on smart phone sensor information to
      identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level.

    <textblock>
      To conduct a very first pilot trial, a monocentric, single-arm clinical study is conducted.
      The study is approved by the local ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich in Switzerland
      and the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products. It is conducted in full accordance with the
      Declaration of Helsinki, with all subjects providing their electronic informed consent prior
      to participation. As the main interest lies in a proof of concept of the proposed MOSS app,
      emphasis is put on real life conditions. A range of different recruitment channels is used to
      attract subjects from the general public; they include physical flyers, online posts on
      relevant online bulletin boards and the Google Play Store.
