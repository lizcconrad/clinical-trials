    <textblock>
      Local lyophylized food extracts are available useful in skin prick test and atopy patch test
      to confirm food allergy. However, the investigators want to know the duration that the
      investigators can keep the extracts for the usage in this purpose.

    <textblock>
      Food allergy incidence increases world wide. The diagnosis mostly depends on history. Skin
      prick test and atopic patch test are useful in finding the causative foods in some cases. The
      local food extracts have been shown to be at least as effective as commercial ones. From
      previous study the investigators keep the extract at 2-8 degree Celsius for 1-3 months for
      the usage. The investigators want to evaluate the duration that the extracts are still useful
      in diagnosis food allergy
