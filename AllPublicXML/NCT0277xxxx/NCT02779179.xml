    <textblock>
      Although RA pathomechanisms remains incompletely understood, periodontitis and RA share
      pathogenic features : genetic and environmental influences, chronic inflammatory disease,
      immunoregulatory imbalance, bacterial factors, persistence of antigen/peptide and clinical
      factors (conjunctive and hard tissues destruction). Several hypothesis can be evocated : Gram
      negative bacterial systemic spreading, inflammatory transmitter substance systemic spreading
      (IL1, IL6, IL17, PGE2), systemic spreading of bacterial degradation products (LPS for
      example).

      Currently Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) might be a susceptibility factor to RA because PG has
      an enzyme, the peptidylarginine deiminase leading to auto antibodies creation and RA
      increasing. As periodontitis, RA is chronic disease with a cyclic increase evolution, needing
      a complex pluridisciplinary treatment approach. Recent studies have reported an increased
      prevalence of RA patients with periodontal disease. Others studies show that periodontal
      treatment induces a significant decrease of the sedimentation rate and of the DAS28.
      Periodontitis is suspected to be an independent, aggravating factor in patients with RA
      (given the definition from NIH : an aggravating factor is something that makes a condition
      worse). So periodontal treatment cannot be considered as a RA treatment per se. But it is
      hypothesised that treating periodontitis in RA patients showing signs of periodontitis could
      result in improvement in RA disease activity. To date the role of periodontitis as an
      aggravating factor in these patients remains unclear, and only RCT designs can reasonably be
      used to test this causal hypothesis. There still remains some RA patients who have persistent
      symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite specialist care and continuous treatment, so
      results of treating aggravating factors are needed. As the majority of patients will benefit
      from a systematic evaluation and treatment of aggravating factors, the periodontal treatment
      strategy need to be tested.

      The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness of periodontal
      treatment for rheumatoid arthritis patients.

      To assess the effectiveness of periodontal treatment to reduce the severity of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA), in patients suffering from both periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The
      hypothesis is that periodontal treatment reduce the severity of rheumatoid arthritis.
