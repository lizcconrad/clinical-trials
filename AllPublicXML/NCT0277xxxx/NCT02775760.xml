  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to examine how regular exercise affects brain function,
      spatial memory, and virtual navigation. Participation in this research study will take
      approximately 4 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are examining the effects of exercise and cardiovascular fitness on
      cognitive processes. Specifically, the investigators are examining if exercise improves brain
      function in a brain area known as the entorhinal cortex. Together with the hippocampus this
      brain area is important for memory formation and spatial navigation. Participation in this
      research study will take approximately 4 months. During this time, participants will make
      three initial study visits. The first visit is for informed consent and screening, the second
      visit is for baseline fitness testing, and the third visit is for cognitive testing and a
      functional MRI exam. Functional MRI is a brain imaging technique that uses a magnetic field
      to &quot;take pictures&quot; of the brain while a person performs a cognitive task. It will take up to
      approximately three weeks to complete these initial three study visits. Following the three
      initial study visits, the exercise-training program will begin. Participants will be
      randomized to one of two training programs: a cardiovascular endurance-training program
      (aerobic exercise) and a strength, balance, and flexibility training program (non-aerobic
      exercise). The exercise training program will last 12 weeks. There will be three one-hour
      exercise sessions per week. After completion of the exercise-training program, participants
      will attend two follow-up study visits. The first follow-up visit is for fitness testing. The
      second follow-up visit is for cognitive testing and an MRI exam.
