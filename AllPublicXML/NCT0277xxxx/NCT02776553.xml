      The primary aim of this study is to improve both physical fitness and sarcopenia of patients
      with ESLD who are potentially eligible for liver transplantation through a 12-week physical
      training program. Secondary aims will focus on changes in anthropometrics, body composition,
      quality of life, and metabolic profile. This is a randomized clinical trial including 50
      patients, with half allocated to the active group (physical training program) and half to
      standard of care.
