      Linezolid, primary treatment for MDR-TB combination therapy anti. Until it is the dose of 600
      mg x1 / day, rather sensible for most patients is more, which was unanimous. It is true that
      if a dosage is consensus, it goes without saying, because of the interindividual variability,
      marked moreover to linezolid, a therapeutic monitoring assay of plasma levels is
      indispensable for most pharmacological treatments. This therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)
      often gives rise, as known, to dosage changes. It turns out that at present no real STP on
      the basic objectives PK / PD is really made in France in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB)
      and the bibliography remains rather poor recommendations, and yet all the elements are there:
      indeed linezolid is an antibiotic whose activity is purely &quot;time-dependent&quot;. So one should
      fulfill 2 PK / PD objectives whose precise boundaries are sometimes still to be determined:

      -% T&gt; MIC, or percentage of time spent with plasma concentrations above the minimum
      inhibitory concentration of linezolid (LNZ) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In practice, the
      residual concentration before the next shot must be&gt; MIC (0.125 to 1 mg / l)

        -  A fortiori it must also take into account the concentration preventing the appearance of
           resistant mutants, amounting to 1.2 mg / l

        -  AUC / MIC&gt; 80, or ratio of the area under the curve (AUC, Area under curve) of plasma
           concentration versus time and CMI LNZ Until then, and without real bibliographic
           support, and for the sake of kindness to patients coupled with an economic advantage,
           the STP consisted of 2 samples, a peak 1:30 after taking (Cmax) and a residual before
           taking (C min) , after all, to 600mg x1 / 24 correlates well with the AUC (55% peak and
           75% for the residual).

      Following an observation that 25 to 30% of patients had a C min &lt;1.2 mg / L, and even
      frequently &lt;0.2 mg / L to 600 mg x 1, with some low peaks and leaving presage an AUC may be
      insufficient well.

      This study is therefore more imperative to be a pharmacological streamlining and ensuring
      adequate therapeutic monitoring involves both maximum and minimum toxicity efficiency. And in
      the light of what has already been practiced for other molecules such as mycophenolate for
      example which is carried AUC or miniAUC for example. It would therefore be in the achievement
      of AUC in all patients treated with LNZ for TB MDR / XDR for over a week. Achieving this
      requires AUC obtaining 7 blood samples given day instead of two samples taken at present.
      Indeed one must have in mind that the peak of rational / residual has become blurred in this
      context, and that one of the two goals PK / PD is now filled (Cmin&gt; MIC / CMP) but it should
      not be that not at the expense of the second (AUC). The benefits, direct and indirect are
      multiple and obtaining them is ensured through this protocol. The study by analyzing
      individual data will confirm the accuracy of the dose fractionation 300mgx2 / day and at a
      time to highlight a potential new dosage adjustment that would need to achieve for further
      study, so a substantial gain in terms of efficacy and toxicity via a suitable therapeutic
      monitoring. Secondly, determine which collection points, in these patients, these doses will
      be most interesting to take later in the routine of STP in order to collect less points (eg
      miniAUC MPA) retaining same statistical power to estimate kinetic parameters, mainly the AUC
      (eg aminoglycoside also). Finally in a third phase construction on the basis of these
      individual kinetics of a population pharmacokinetic model with highlighting of population
      parameters and especially co-related variables explaining the high pharmacokinetic
      variability and allowing for following patients to determine the individually tailored dose
      immediately before the first shot and the first assays.

      Primary objective :

      Determination of the AUC / MIC and% T&gt; MIC for each patient to confirm the appropriateness,
      in light of the peak and residual, and the interest of the split doses more frequently
      performed in case of too low residual toxicity or secondary objective: Determination of
      points of privileged samples in this context for maximum statistical power and minimal stress
      for the patient.

      - Outlook: Development of a population PK model and determination of co-variables of interest
      and individualized dosages immediately for the next patients

      Methodology :

      Prospective, multi-center, non-interventional type of routine care Study duration: 1 day /
      patient, maximum total duration of recruitment: 6 months, aim 30-40patients included

      Acquisition of data:

      Additional media (Informed consent, sampling protocol, collection form of biological,
      clinical and pharmacological patient and treatment)

        -  Statistical analysis by a software suitable pharmacokinetic

        -  Anonymity of data: an identifier for each subject will be awarded (first name and
           surname / number) and the data will be entered in a computer file that will be retained
           by the sponsor on the GHPSJ site for the realization of determinations of AUC and
           optimal dosages.

      Development of the study:

        -  Performance of the study

        -  Expected duration of patient recruitment: up to 6 months

        -  Number of patients to recruit 30 to 40 patients, limited by the number of hospitalized
           patients in the recruiting center (sanatorium Bligny), combining both MDR-TB and
           treatment with linezolid

        -  Duration of the study for each patient: 12 to 24 hours the time for the 7 samples.

        -  Regarding the iterative sampling and prevention of potentially associated pain, most
           patients already have a KT or a PAC in place for administering IV drugs (amiklin,
           augmentin or vitamins in particular), it is therefore on these it is planned to take
           samples. For the few patients with no system in place for use, it will be explained and
           proposed the establishment of a device Catelon and a patch Emla, the decision on the
           matter will be up to the patient.

      Destruction of samples: the samples will not be retained after being used for the study. They
      will be destroyed in accordance with the rules of good practice research laboratories.

      Data: Data include clinical and biological, bacteriological patient. The GHPSJ guarantee that
      the biological material will be digitally encoded and will not involve direct identifying
      information of subjects participating in research. The shipment will be made by the
      sanatorium Bligny staff under the supervision of the investigator within the department (Dr
      Mathilde Jachym and Damien Le Du).

      Ethical aspects: After notification of the CPP Ile de France II, the project will be
      classified as &quot;research in routine care.&quot; The opinion of the CPP Ile de France II will be
      requested at the meeting of June 2015. The manager research center will be the hospital group
      Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ). The latter will contract with the SHAM (usual insurer GHPSJ for
      care and clinical research) to ensure the risk of the blood sample.

      The research information will be issued and the signature of the Circular will be collected
      from the patient. An agreement will be made between institutions, and the GHPSJ Bligny
      Medical Center, including the logistics of transport and harvest management.
