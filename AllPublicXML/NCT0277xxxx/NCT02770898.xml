  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluating the impact of probation on probationers is necessary for both effective practice
      of probation officers and their assessment of the success of their work. At present, there
      are limited studies that have evaluated the impact of probation services on probationers and
      their family. There are even fewer studies that have examined interventions on probationers'
      well-being and family relations in a Chinese society. Compared with the general population,
      probationers are associated with poorer mental (e.g., depression, lower levels of
      self-esteem, high level of stress) and physical health, and often experience higher levels of
      family conflict, and poorer quality of family relationships. Given the vulnerabilities, there
      is a need to strengthen and promote healthy lifestyle and enhance individual and family
      well-being among probationers. As part of the FAMILY project, the current study focuses on
      &quot;FAMILY Holistic Health&quot; which emphasizes a comprehensive approach to improving physical,
      mental, and social health and well-being. This project will be conducted as a pilot project
      in the Social Welfare Department (SWD) in the Eastern District of Hong Kong. Interventions
      will be delivered to promote and enhance probationer's wellbeing, as well as enhancing FAMILY
      3Hs (Happiness, Health, and Harmony). Training programs will be provided to probation
      officers and/or workers of SWD in order to equip them with knowledge and skills in
      implementing health-related family intervention programs.

      To enhance individual and family well-being among probationers, family life and health
      education, including the skills and knowledge for physical exercise, healthy family
      functioning, strong communication skills, healthy interpersonal relationships, and positive
      self-esteem, should be strengthened and promoted. Based on the strong foundation of the
      FAMILY projects conducted by our research team in the past years, this project seeks to
      promote &quot;FAMILY holistic health&quot; for targeted families (i.e. probationers). The holistic
      health interventions are interactive and designed for behavioral changes to enhance
      individual well-being and encourage positive and sustainable health actions among family
      members. Thus, it is expected ultimately that the participants and their family members could
      enhance their family happiness, health, and harmony (3Hs). In sum, the project has the
      following contributions:

        1. Strengthen evidence-based practice Hong Kong probation-related topics are scarcely
           studied. There is a need for rigorous studies to build and strengthen evidence-base for
           probation services. This study will be one of the first studies to evaluate the
           effectiveness of probation services on individual well-being and family well-being
           utilizing a mixed-methods approach.

        2. Stakeholder engagement Stakeholders will be engaged throughout the research process.
           This promotes co-learning and empowering process, builds on strengths and resources
           within the community, and integrates knowledge and intervention for the mutual benefit
           of all partners.

        3. Train-the-trainer program Training will be provided to probation officers and/or workers
           at the Social Welfare Department. The result of this train-the-trainers program is that
           front-line service workers will increase and enhance their knowledge and skills to
           independently and effectively carry out interventions. Probation officers will act as
           role models for probationers and continue to implement our knowledge and techniques in
           their future interventions.

    <description>The brief intervention is individual focus and consists of three main components, which include enhancing the individual personal attributes such as participant's knowledge, values, and behaviors related to physical exercise. Second, the intervention will promote changes in behavioral attributes by providing opportunities and experience in goal setting, skills development in physical exercise and self-monitoring. Finally, the brief intervention promotes family relations and well-being by encouraging individuals to share their knowledge and increase physical activities with other family members. The brief intervention will be delivered by the probation officer during regular monthly consultation.</description>
