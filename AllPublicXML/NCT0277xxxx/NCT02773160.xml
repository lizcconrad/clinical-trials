  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large subgroup of patients with chronic non-specific low back pain have motor control
      impairments. During motor control exercises, different forms of external feedback can be used
      to support training. This randomized controlled trial will investigate the effectiveness of
      different forms of external feedback during the learning phase of a motor control task for
      the lumbar spine in healthy subjects and patients with chronic non-specific low back pain
      (CNSLBP). Both healthy subjects and patients with CNSLBP will be randomized into three
      groups: one group will receive feedback from motion sensors, one group from a mirror and one
      group will receive no feedback (control group). A single session intervention with
      measurements at baseline and immediately post-intervention will be used.
