  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A biomarker cohort study design is proposed to study whether specific airway microbiota
      alterations are associated with pulmonary Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) disease. In a
      cohort of 200 subjects suspected of having pulmonary NTM disease, the investigators will
      evaluate the airway microbiome using an aliquot of the induced sputum and upper airway
      samples. Since induced sputum may reflect different regions of the upper/lower airways, the
      investigators will evaluate the upper and lower airway microbiome in a subgroup (case-control
      group) of patients using samples obtained through upper airway sampling and bronchoscopy,
      respectively.

    <description>Investigators will use sputum samples and brushed samples from areas of the upper airway from a cohort of 200 subjects with chronic cough and pulmonary infiltrates or airway abnormalities in whom NTM disease was suspected. Cultures positive for NTM (cases) will be compared to those with culture negatives (controls). Bacterial load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) will be used to characterize microbiome by high throughput sequencing looking for microbial biomarkers associated with NTM disease.</description>
