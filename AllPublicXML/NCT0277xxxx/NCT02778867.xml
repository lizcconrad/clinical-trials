  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this interventional study is to test and compare the effectiveness of two
      elimination diets—the 1-food elimination diet (1FED, milk only) and the 6-food elimination
      diet (6FED, milk, egg, wheat, soy, tree nut/peanuts, and fish/shellfish). The study will also
      test the effectiveness of swallowed glucocorticoid therapy in some of the study participants
      for whom diet therapy was not effective.

      This study will consist of two phases, plus a screening period. During the screening period,
      subject eligibility for the study will be determined. During Phase 1, qualified participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two elimination diet therapies--the 1FED or the 6FED.
      Participants will remain on the assigned dietary therapy for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks
      of therapy, esophageal biopsies from participant's standard of care (i.e. normal, routine
      care) endoscopy will be evaluated to determine disease status. Participants whose EoE is in
      remission (i.e. &lt;15 eos/hpf) will be done with the study.

      Participants whose EoE is still active (i.e. ≥15 eos/hpf) will continue into Phase 2 of the
      study. During Phase 2, participants who were on 1FED in Phase 1 will receive 6FED therapy for
      6 weeks, and participants who were on 6FED during Phase 1 will receive swallowed
      glucocorticoid therapy for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks of therapy, esophageal biopsies
      from participant's standard of care (i.e. normal, routine care) endoscopy will be evaluated
      to determine disease status.

             ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or
             interpretation of the data obtained from the study.
