  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Hepatitis B is the most common cause of chronic viral liver disease worldwide
      afflicting 350 million persons, leading to significant morbidity and mortality due to liver
      disease and HCC in 20-40% of infected persons. With the advent of nucleoside analogues, this
      rescued patients with significant risk of disease progression, but in most circumstances,
      therapy was needed long term as HBsAg seroclearance was an uncommon occurrence, and stopping
      therapy was associated with relapse of disease and hepatitis B flares. The use of pegylated
      interferons showed increased HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg seroclearance rates compared to
      nucleoside analogues , however combination nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy has been quite
      disappointing. However a recent showed that the combination of telbivudine and tenofovir in a
      response guided therapy design, had a remarkable 6% HBsAg seroclearance at week 52 in
      patients. Such results require further confirmation. There is currently an unmet need for the
      large number of patients on long term nucleoside analogue therapy who have not achieved HBeAg
      seroconversion or HBsAg seroclearance. Such patients are seeking alternatives to long term
      therapy hence an exploration of other therapeutic strategies is attractive. An additional
      benefit of telbivudine has been the surprising improvement in renal function and this study
      seeks to examine whether this can improve the renal impairment that may be seen with
      tenofovir. Our study proposes to examine if the combination of tenofovir and telbivudine can
      improve endpoints. Patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to
      tenofovir or tenofovir and telbivudine (1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint will be a qHBsAg
      reduction of &gt;1log at week 96, which may predict future HBsAg seroclearance, which is also a
      secondary endpoint. An additional primary endpoint is increase in eGFR in the combination arm
      compared to the monotherapy arm. The study aims to enroll 146 patients randomized 1:1 ratio
      (73:73) patients. Multivariate analysis will be performed of baseline and on-treatment
      factors that predict the primary outcome.

      Each subject must sign and date a study-specific informed consent form (ICF) prior to their
      participation in any screening activities. Prospective subjects should be screened no more
      than 28 days prior to administration of the first dose of study drug on Day 1. Screening
      evaluations will be used to determine eligibility of each candidate for study enrollment.
      Subjects meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria as
      determined during screening will be eligible for the study. Candidates who fail to meet
      eligibility criteria by screening evaluations may be re-screened one time. Eligible patients
      at the end of screening will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to experimental (combination) arm
      versus control (mono therapy) arm.

      Randomisation will be performed by computer generated random codes (performed by Singapore
      Clinical Research Institute) with a masked allocation sequence. There will be no blinding of
      therapy and the study will be conducted as an open label study since the outcomes are
      objectively measurable.

      After randomisation patients will be monitored 12 weekly for the first 24 weeks, then every
      24 weekly until the last visit at 96 weeks.

      At each visit, patients will have a clinical evaluation and have a panel of laboratory tests:

        -  Hematology: Full blood count, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio

        -  Chemistry: Sodium, potassium, creatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, -aspartate
           transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, creatine
           phosphokinase, alphafetoprotein,

        -  Urinalysis: Urine dipstick (Appearance, color, leucocytes, nitrite, urobilinogen,
           protein, PH, specific gravity, ketone, bilirubin and glucose).

        -  Viral serology: HBeAg, anti-HBe, HBsAg, qHBsAg and anti-HBs
