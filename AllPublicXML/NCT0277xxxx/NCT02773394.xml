  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to describe: 1) the clinical profile, past and current management
      of participants with hepatitis C in Brazil reference centers; 2) the current situation about
      demographics characteristics, liver disease progression and clinical outcomes in Brazilian
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) participants naive, in treatment and previously exposed to antiviral
      treatment without sustained virological response (SVR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, non-interventional, cross-sectional, multicenter study to describe
      demographic characteristics, treatment performed and clinical outcomes of Brazilian
      participants with HCV chronic infection in about 12 Brazilian reference centers. It will
      expect that approximately 2000 participants will be enrolled in the study. Analysis set will
      consist of participants with HCV chronic infection who are registered at the Brazilian
      reference centers and meet all the inclusion criteria and have sufficient information to
      identify the diagnosis of chronic HCV infection with identification of genotype. The study
      related data will be collected from the medical records in the predesigned electronic Case
      Report Form (eCRF).
