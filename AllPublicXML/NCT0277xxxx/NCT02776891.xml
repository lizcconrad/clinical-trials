  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center feasibility imaging study in patients with diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL) or B-cell Lymphoma, Unclassifiable with features between DLBCL and Burkitt's
      (BCLU). Study participants will undergo PET/MRI of the whole body with 68Ga citrate.

      The study will include at least 5 patients with double hit lymphoma and 5 patients with DLBCL
      with an additional 5 more patients as expansion once the dose level has been established.
      Patients with DLBCL will be included once an optimal dose level for the resolution of cancer
      lesions has been established.

    <description>The patients will be organized into two cohorts. Cohort 1 will receive 10 mCi and will be imaged 4 and 6 hours post injection. Cohort 2 will receive 15 mCi and will be imaged 4 and 6 hours post injection. Cohort 2 will be imaged if the optimal protocol identified image quality from cohort 1 does not allow for the resolution of cancer lesions.</description>

    <description>Ga-68 citrate will be administered on an outpatient basis at the Center for Molecular and Functional Imaging at China Basin. It will be administered a single time point intravenously prior to PET imaging. The one-time nominal injected dose will be up to 15 mCi containing 10 - 25 μg Ga-68. A simultaneous MRI (PET/MRI) of the head will be used for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of gallium-68 citrate uptake and SUV calculation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed DLBCL or BCLU.

               -  Double hit lymphoma, defined by positive cytogenetic/FISH analysis for
                  translocations involving myc and bcl2 or a double hit score of 2 by
                  immunohistochemistry as described by Johnson et al.

               -  DLBCL without myc translocation or overexpression by the above methods

          2. Presence of palpable or radiographically measurable disease of at least 1.5 cm in
             longest dimension.

          3. Available prior CT or PET/CT scan done in the last 8 weeks for comparison

          4. Prior chemotherapy or radiation to the measurable lesion must be completed at least 14
             days prior.

          5. Adequate renal function with estimated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min (by the
             Cockcroft Gault equation)

          6. No contraindications to MRI (e.g. pacemaker, aneurysm clips, severe claustrophobia)

          7. Ability to sign a study-specific IRB-approved consent prior to study entry. Patients
             must be able and willing to consent and undergo study procedures.

          8. Age ≥18 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other medical
             condition that could interfere with subject's safety, provision of informed consent,
             or compliance with study procedures

          2. Body weight over 300 pounds

          3. Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          4. Prior MRI with gadolinium performed &lt;24 hours before the study scan
