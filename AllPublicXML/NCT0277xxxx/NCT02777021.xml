  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves intensive chemotherapy regimens
      that result in periods of profound neutropenia leaving patients susceptible to severe
      infectious complications. Infectious complications are the leading cause of treatment related
      mortality among AML patients, but there are little clinical data to inform whether management
      of neutropenia post AML chemotherapy should occur in an outpatient or inpatient setting.
      Further, no studies have been conducted that assess the impact of neutropenia management
      strategy on the quality of life of pediatric patients with AML and their caregivers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study, where the primary objective of this study
      is to compare patient and caregiver quality of life and other patient-centered outcomes for
      inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenia in children with AML.

      Local study investigators (pediatric oncologists and study coordinators) at each of the
      fourteen participating pediatric institutions will communicate on a weekly basis with their
      inpatient leukemia service to identify AML patients potentially eligible for study
      enrollment. Once identified, study personnel will review each patient for study eligibility
      criteria. Three visits with the patient and their caregivers will occur: a screening visit,
      initial survey visit, and a follow-up visit.

      Screening Visit: Patients interested in the study will be approached for consent during
      initiation of a course of chemotherapy. After informed consent/assent is obtained and after
      completion of that chemotherapy course, the eligibility criteria for participation will be
      confirmed prior to study inclusion.

      Visit 1 will occur prior to the last day of chemotherapy administration in the course. This
      visit will include:

        -  Brief survey to capture covariates unavailable in the medical record

        -  A baseline health-related quality of life (HRQOL) survey

        -  A baseline financial toxicity assessment

      Surveys will be administered via tablet computer and will last a total of 15-30 minutes per
      respondent. In the case that the child is 5 years of age or older, the child self-report and
      parent proxy-report scales will be separately administered to the child and caregiver,
      respectively. If the child is under 5 years of age, only the parent-proxy version will be
      administered. Only the caregiver completes the baseline financial toxicity assessment. We
      will provide a $25 gift card to each child-parent dyad upon completion of the baseline
      surveys

      Visit 2 will occur prior to the start of the subsequent course of chemotherapy. This visit
      will include:

        -  A follow-up HRQOL survey

        -  Patient-centered outcome survey developed previously from qualitative interviews of AML
           patients and their caregivers

        -  A follow-up financial toxicity assessment

      Surveys will be administered via tablet computer and will last a total of 15-30 minutes per
      respondent. In the case that the child is 5 years of age or older, the child self-report and
      parent proxy-report scales will be administered to the child and caregiver, respectively. If
      the child is under 5 years of age, only the parent-proxy version will be administered. The
      follow-up financial toxicity assessment and the patient-centered outcome survey are completed
      by the caregiver only. We will provide a $25 gift card to each child-parent dyad upon
      completion of the follow-up surveys.

    <description>Patients receiving or having received chemotherapy for AML who are discharged to outpatient management within 3 days after chemotherapy completion. Subjects will complete a health related quality of life (HRQOL) survey at baseline and again at the start of the next cycle of chemotherapy. Survey questions will collect information such as patient race and educational level.
HRQOL questions will be scored on a 5-point Likert response scale (0=never a problem to 4=almost always a problem). The total score includes a 23 item multidimensional core (physical, emotional, social and school functioning); an 18 item multidimensional fatigue scale (general, sleep/rest and cognitive fatigue) and a 27 item multidimensional cancer module (pain, nausea, anxiety, communication, and cognitive problems). Total score is calculated with a lower score representing a higher health related quality of life.</description>
