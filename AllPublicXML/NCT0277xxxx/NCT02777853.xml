  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to explore changes in peripheral/cerebrovascular function and
      insulin sensitivity after a 7-day combination of physical activity reduction (-50% steps per
      day) and overfeeding (+50% kcal per day, comprising 65% fat) in healthy male volunteers, and
      examine whether daily intake of tea can prevent such changes.

      The aim of this study is to explore the impact of a 7-day 'unhealthy' lifestyle that combines
      physical activity reduction (-50% steps per day) and overfeeding (+50% kcal per day,
      comprising 65% fat) on peripheral (conduit artery and skin microvessels) and cerebrovascular
      function and insulin sensitivity in healthy male participants. Moreover, the investigators
      will explore whether the detrimental impact of this lifestyle can be mitigated by daily tea
      consumption (equivalent to 6 cups/day). To explore this hypothesis, the investigators will
      perform measurements of these parameters before and after 7-days of reduced physical activity
      and overfeeding, with and without the combination of daily tea ingestion.

    <measure>Vascular function</measure>
    <time_frame>Post 7 day intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral vascular function will be measured via endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial and femoral arteries, with microcirculatory function being assessed using local thermal hyperaemia and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), in addition to full-field laser perfusion imaging (FLPI). Cerebrovascular function will be examined via transcranial Doppler.</description>
