      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of clarithromycin
      on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-438 and its metabolites in healthy male adult participants
      following a single oral dose of TAK-438.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. TAK 438 is being tested to assess the
      effect of multiple oral doses of clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-438.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 healthy adult male participants of non-Japanese
      origin. Participants will be assigned:

        -  TAK-438 40 mg

        -  Clarithromycin 500 mg

      All participants will be asked to take 2 tablet of TAK-438 20 mg orally, once on Days 1 and 8
      along with Clarithromycin 500 mg, tablets, orally twice daily from Days 3 to 9.

      This single center trial will be conducted in Europe. The overall time to participate in this
      study is maximum of 44 days. Participants will be confined to site for 10 days, and a final
      visit after 4 days after discharge from the unit for a follow-up assessment.

          4. Is aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and first study
             medication dose.

          5. Weighs at least 45 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m^2,

          7. Has clinical laboratory evaluations (including clinical chemistry, hematology, and
             urinalysis), within the reference range for the testing laboratory. Participants with
             evaluations outside the reference range that are deemed not clinically significant by
             the investigator may be included at investigator discretion unless these are
             specifically identified in the exclusion criteria.

          8. Is willing to abstain from caffeine and alcohol from 72 hours before first dose (Day
             1) until the Follow-up call.

          9. Is willing to abstain from strenuous exercise from 72 hours before first dose (Day 1)
             until the Follow-up call.

         10. Is willing to provide a sample for pharmacogenomic analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has received any investigational compound within 90 days prior to the first dose on
             Day 1.

             excipients.

          5. Has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol
             abuse within 5 years prior to the Screening Visit or is unwilling to agree to abstain
             from alcohol and drugs throughout the study.

         14. Has a positive alcohol breath test at the Screening or Check-in (Day -1).

         15. Has confirmed positive result for drugs of abuse at the Screening Visit or Check-in
             (Day -1).

         16. Has abnormal Screening or Day -1 laboratory values that suggest a clinically
             significant underlying disease or participant with the following laboratory
             abnormalities: has an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST) level which exceeds 3*upper limit of normal (ULN) set by the testing laboratory
             at the Screening Visit or Check-in (Day -1).

         17. Has poor peripheral venous access.

         18. Has donated or lost 450 mL or more of his or her blood volume (including
             plasmapheresis), or had a transfusion of any blood product within 90 days prior to Day
             1.

         19. Is unable to understand verbal or written English or any other language for which a
             certified translation of the informed consent and other material supplied for
             completion by participant is available.

         20. Has a Screening or Check-in (Day -1) abnormal (clinically significant)
             electrocardiogram (ECG). Entry of any participant with an abnormal (not clinically
             significant) ECG must be approved, and documented by signature by the principal
             investigator.

         21. Has a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (eg, repeated demonstration of a
             QTc interval &gt;450 ms) on ECG at the Screening Visit.

         22. Has a history of clinically significant inflammatory disease or allergy (eg, hay fever
             [hay fever sufferers who do not require medication may be permitted], asthma, eczema),
             autoimmune disease (eg, psoriasis, lupus), or history of chronic respiratory disease
             (eg, emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

         23. Has a history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (eg, heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome).

         24. Is considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable candidate for
