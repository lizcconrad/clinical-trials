  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects up to 14 million people and is among the
      top five leading causes of death worldwide. Although COPD is a disease of the lungs, recent
      evidence indicates that COPD is associated with multiple systemic consequences including
      vascular endothelial dysfunction. Recently, it has been suggested that more patients with
      COPD die from cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease than of direct pulmonary
      complications. Examination of the mechanisms that contribute to a reduction nitric oxide (NO)
      bioavailability resulting in vascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with COPD are
      important as endothelial dysfunction has been indicated to be an independent predictor of
      future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and events.

      Researchers have found a link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart
      disease; however, a link is all they have found. In a previously funded grant, using a double
      blind, randomized experimental design, the investigators explored the effect of an acute dose
      of Kuvan or an antioxidant cocktail (1000mg of vitamin C, 600IU of vitamin E, and 600mg
      alpha-lipoic acid) on vascular health in patients with COPD. Consequently, the investigators
      found in separate experiments, that a single dose of both antioxidants and Kuvan transiently
      improves vascular health in patients with COPD. The current project is an attempt to expand
      on the investigator's previous findings and explore the effects of sub-chronic use of
      antioxidants and Kuvan on sustaining the improvements in vascular health in COPD.

    <description>SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Analysis System (SphygmoCor, PWV Medical, Sydney, Australia), which uses applanation tonometry, will be used for accurate, non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness.

    <description>The laser imaging camera is a special camera that shines a low energy laser light on the surface of the skin to measure blood flow. The FLPI makes graphs, photos, and movies of skin blood flow. Acetylcholine, sodium nitropruside and L-NAME are vasoactive substances that will be used to increase and decrease skin blood flow. The amount of drug delivered is based on the amount of current being delivered. Using this technique with such a low level current, there should be no drug that enters the body.</description>
