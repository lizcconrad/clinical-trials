    <textblock>
      The study will test the efficacy of a hour long, one-on-one, active listening counseling
      session (called Change the Cycle or CTC) aimed at reducing behaviors among active people who
      inject drugs (PWID) that research has found to facilitate uptake of injection drug use among
      non-injectors. The study will involve ~1,100 PWID who will be randomized to CTC or an equal
      attention control intervention on improving nutrition. Participants will be recruited in Los
      Angeles and San Francisco, California and followed up at 6 and 12 months to determine changes
      in direct and indirect facilitation of injection initiation among non-injectors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the &quot;Change
      the Cycle&quot; (CTC) intervention. CTC is an hour long, single-session, one-on-one intervention
      that aims to reduce injection initiation by encouraging active PWID to not promote drug
      injection, model injection behavior, describe how to inject, or assist in injection
      initiations of non-injectors. CTC uses the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB)
      model to achieve changes among active PWID through seven short modules. Information and
      motivational domains are addressed in guided conversations about (1) their own first
      injection episode and consequences, (2) past experiences initiating injection-naive people
      and consequences, (3) health, legal, and social risks related to injection drugs, (4) health,
      legal, social risks of initiating people, and (5) identifying their own behaviors that might
      promote injection among others. The behavioral skills are addressed through (6)
      skill-building discussions and consideration of common initiation scenarios, and (7) safer
      injection education.

      Aim 1: To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of non-injectors initiated into
      injection (counts) by PWID. Hypothesis 1: PWID who receive CTC will report initiating fewer
      non-injectors into drug injection at 6 and 12 months as compared with PWID in the control
      condition.

      Aim 2: To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of times PWID are asked to initiate
      (counts) someone into injection. Hypothesis 2: PWID who receive CTC will report having been
      asked fewer times to initiate someone into drug injection at 6 and 12 months as compared with
      PWID in the control condition.

      Aim 3: To test whether injection initiation social learning risks (injecting in front of,
      describing injection to, and speaking positively about injection to non-injectors) act as
      mediational mechanisms for the efficacy of the CTC intervention on initiation and
      request-to-initiate outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Social learning variables will significantly
      mediate the association between the CTC intervention and episodes of initiating and being
      requested to initiate someone into drug injection at 6 and 12 months.

      To achieve these aims, active PWID (N=1,076) will be randomly assigned to receive CTC or an
      equal attention control condition in Los Angeles (LA) and San Francisco (SF), CA. Injection
      initiation and injection initiation social learning variables will be collected at baseline,
      6 months, and 12 months using computer-assisted personal-interviewing (CAPI). The equal
      attention control condition will focus on improving nutrition, specifically increasing fresh
      water intake and protein consumption, and will replicate CTC in length, theoretical
      foundation (IMB), and modality (1 on 1 personal session).

    <description>The nutrition equal attention control intervention is a single-session, 60- minute Information-Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) skills-based intervention addressing healthy eating. The healthy eating intervention uses a one-on-one guided conversation between the interventionist and the participant. The intervention addresses (1) information about current eating patterns and recommendations for healthy alternatives (20 minutes), (2) motivations for improving healthy eating by providing feedback to participants on personal responsibility, a menu of alternative change options, a decision balance exercise, and eating goal setting (10 minutes), and (3) Behavioral Self-Management Component (30 minutes) that covers eating scenarios, participant responses, and healthy alternatives to the scenario and the participants feedback.</description>

    <ipd_description>Using the National Addiction and HIV Data Archive program (NAHDAP), we will provide our datasets and codebooks to researchers in a format that facilitates data-sharing. After the completion of the study, the dataset will be de-identified and made available for secondary analysis on the NAHDAP website (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/). Researchers who request access will be given a password to access the data, documentation, and surveys. As part of the registration process, researchers will sign an agreement to adhere to the data coding guidelines that were developed for the project, will state their intentions for use, and will agree to inform the original investigators of their findings and publications for tracking purposes with acknowledgments to the granting agency. Because the respondents will be identified only by ID codes in the datasets, it will be impossible to identify individuals from the datasets.</ipd_description>
