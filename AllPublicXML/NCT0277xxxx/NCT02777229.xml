  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several reports indicate that treatment failure due to HIV resistance or to adverse
      event-related discontinuation could compromise the effectiveness of scaling-up antiretroviral
      treatment (ART), especially when lack of access to viral load is a concern. Combined with
      other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, Dolutegravir (DTG) is a very promising
      alternative to the current first-line non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based
      regimens.

      Initial evaluations of DTG conducted in high income countries showed excellent efficacy and
      safety and indicated high genetic barrier thus preserving second line treatment. As a
      consequence, DTG-based regimens have been recently included in the first-line options in the
      national guidelines for ART of several high-income countries. However, the clinical trials
      evaluating DTG-based regimens have been conducted in highly controlled conditions, including
      baseline resistance testing and regular viral load monitoring. Moreover, these trials
      included a high proportion of men with rare co-morbidities.

      There is need to evaluate how a DTG-based regimen will perform in real-world conditions
      within resources-constrained settings, where viral load monitoring is limited, and where the
      majority of HIV patients are women with important family planning consideration and NAMSAL
      trial is a randomized clinical trial which aims to evaluate efficacy and safety over 48 weeks
      of DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine versus Efavirenz (EFV) + tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine in 606 ART-na√Øve HIV-1-infected adults in Cameroon. A set of
      efficacy and safety endpoints will be compared over 48 weeks between the two arms including
      the proportion of patients with viral load &lt;50 copies/mL and incidence of severe adverse
      events.
