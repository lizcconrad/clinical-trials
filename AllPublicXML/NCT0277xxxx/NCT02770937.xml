  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective randomized controlled study to compare the proficiency of novices in
      acquiring laparoscopic suturing skills following either training in a virtual reality
      simulator or box trainer.

      Participants will be randomized into three groups by computer-generated sequence to the
      virtual reality simulator, box trainer and control groups. They will be shown a video
      demonstration and given simple instructions on laparoscopic suturing and intracorporeal knot
      tying at the beginning of the training. Both the virtual reality simulator and box trainer
      groups will be allowed a maximum of 4 hours of training (2 sessions of 2 hours each). The
      participants could terminate training at any time point during the 4-hour if they felt
      competent to perform the task.The control group will not receive any further training.

      They will then be asked to perform laparoscopic suturing (which would involve needle loading
      and insertion via 2 pre-marked circles, and knot tying which includes at least 2 single
      throws) on a box trainer. Participants will be asked to complete a modified GOALS
      questionnaire at the end (which will take around 5 minutes) to evaluate their experiences and
      assess their own proficiency. The procedure will also be recorded (with a number identifying
      the participant only) and assessment will be performed when the study is completed by 2
      experienced laparoscopic gynecologists blinded to the participants who will review the
      recorded procedure. The time to complete each task, total procedural time and proficiency
      will be assessed, which will be compared against the participants' own evaluation.
