  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine anhedonia as a potential moderator of treatment
      outcomes for Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD). Specifically, this study will investigate how
      anhedonia affects outcomes in contingency management (CM) treatment for CUD and whether
      anhedonia mediates the effects of adjunctive treatment with a dopaminergic (DAergic) drug,
      d-amphetamine, on outcomes in CM for CUD, as well as investigate the contribution of
      anhedonia to overall CUD severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that anhedonia is a key neurobehavioral dysfunction in Cocaine Use
      Disorder (CUD) that contributes to treatment outcomes. Anhedonia, defined here as lack of
      interest or pleasure in non-drug rewards, is frequently found in CUD and is related to neural
      deficits, such as low striatal dopamine and deficient activation to non-drug rewards in
      mesocortical circuits. Interestingly, not all individuals in CUD have these deficits.
      Preliminary data suggests that the presence of self-reported anhedonia predicts worse outcome
      in contingency management (CM) treatment of CUD. Moreover, low baseline dopamine predicts
      failure to attain abstinence in CM while medications that enhance DA increase CM success
      rates and responsiveness to rewards.

      This study specifically aims to test the contribution of anhedonia to overall CUD severity,
      the relationship of anhedonia to outcomes in CM treatment, and the mediating role of
      anhedonia in medication enhancement of CM in CUD. To accomplish these aims, individuals with
      CUD will be enrolled and will undergo 4 weeks of intensive CM treatment, either with or
      without treatment with the dopaminergic drug, d-amphetamine. A medication only group will be
      included to solely measure the effects of d-amphetamine. Anhedonia will be assessed using
      multi-modal subjective, psychophysiological and behavioral measures of reward functioning at
      baseline, and each week of treatment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures
      of reward functioning will also be taken at baseline and week 4 in a subset of participants
      (n = 24)
