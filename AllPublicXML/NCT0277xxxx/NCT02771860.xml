  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled one-site proof-of-concept study in
      subjects with erosive osteoarthritis (OA) of interphalangeal (IP) finger joints.

      A total of 100 subjects will be enrolled into the study: 48 weeks placebo controlled
      double-blind phase with denosumab 60mg every 12 weeks, followed by a 48-week open-label phase
      in which all subjects will receive denosumab.

  <detailed_description>

      Investigational therapy: denosumab 60mg subcutaneous injection every 12 weeks. All subjects
      will receive Calcium/vit D supplementation.

      Efficacy objectives:

      The primary objective is to assess the effect of denosumab on the reduction of radiographic
      erosive progression using GUSS (Ghent University Score System).

      The secondary objective is to assess the effect of denosumab on the reduction of radiographic
      erosive progression as defined by diminishing the appearance of new erosive IP finger joints.

      The exploratory objective is mainly to assess the effect of denosumab on clinical variables,
      as well as ultrasonography and DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) parameters.

    <description>A quantitative radiographic scoring system, the Ghent University Scoring System, GUSS, is a reliable method to score radiographic change over time in erosive IP OA and detects more progression over a shorter period of time than scored by indicating the proportions of normal subchondral bone, subchondral plate and joint space over time.</description>
