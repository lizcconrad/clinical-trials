    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that seafood proteins given in combination with carbohydrates with low GI
      are superior to seafood proteins in combination with carbohydrates with high GI and meat in
      combination with both carbohydrates with low and high GI in promoting energy expenditure and
      satiety. The overall objective of this study is to investigate the acute effects of meals
      containing fish versus meat proteins on energy balance (thermogenesis, appetite regulating
      hormones and appetite sensations), markers of glucose allostatis and amino acid metabolism.

    <measure>Differences in diet induced thermogenesis between the four test meals</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>In the following three hours after eating the test meal respiratory gas exchange will be measured 6x25 minutes with 5 minutes breaks in between each measurement. Diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) will be measured by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system. Each measurement will last for 25 minutes of which the last 20 minutes will be used for calculation of energy expenditure.</description>

    <description>In an attempt to measure spontaneous energy intake and macronutrient preferences in an experimental context, the participants will be given an ad libitum buffet lunch at noon. A cold and hot buffet-style lunch comprising a variety of foods (representing a wide selection of food groups) will be offered after the last measurement of gas exchange and the participants will be instructed to eat ad libitum.</description>
