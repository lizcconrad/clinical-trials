      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the Apatinib can improve the disease
      free survival (DFS) of gastric cancer patients in stage IIIB/IIIc, who had completed
      postoprative adjuvant chemotherapy. Meanwhile, the investigators also will evaluate whether
      the Apatinib can improve the overall survival (OS), estimate the quality of life of patients
      have taken the Apatinib and monitor the security of Apatinib.

      The investigators will recruit 40 gastric cancer patients who underwent D2 lymphadenectomy
      and histologically verified as stage ⅢB or ⅢC according to the seventh edition of the TNM
      classification for gastric cancer. When these patients have completed 8 cycles of Xelox as
      adjuvant chemotherapy without any recurrence, they will randomly assigned to group A or B.
      Each group possesses 20 gastric cancer patients finally. Patients in group A will receive the
      best supportive care，and take Apatinib 500mg/qd orally, 28 days as a cycle, till disease
      progresses. Patients in group B will receive the best supportive care. Through follow-up and
      statistics, the investigators will observe whether Apatinib can improve the disease free
      survival (DFS) of gastric cancer patients with stage IIIb&amp;IIIC. Meanwhile, the investigators
      also will observe whether the Apatinib can improve the overall survival (OS) and estimate the
      quality of life of patients have taken the Apatinib.

             0 to 2.

          3. All tumor tissues were histologically verified as advanced gastric cancer, and
             patients with no less than 15 dissected lymph nodes and stage of ⅢB or ⅢC according to
             TNM, were chosen.

          4. Gastric cancer patients underwent the curative gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy.
