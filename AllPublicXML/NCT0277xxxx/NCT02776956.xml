  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 120 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (including continuous and
      long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation) and 60 patients with paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation will receive radiofrequency ablation. Patients in each group will be randomly
      allocated into the statin treatment group and non-statin treatment group (allocation ratio,
      1:1). Left atrial appendage flow velocity of all patients are measured by Transesophageal
      Echocardiography(TEE) 24 hours before the operation. Real-time ultrasound examinations of
      left atrial function are carried out for all patients before the operation and after the
      operation. Blood samples are extracted in all patients before the operation and after the
      operation. This study will clarify whether the application of statin drugs can improve
      postoperative left atrial function. This study will identify the time course and influence
      factors of left atrial recovery of atrial fibrillation after the operation to guide the time
      and the degree of anticoagulation and effectively prevent thromboembolic events. At the same
      time, biochemical indicators are detected to analyze which indicators are related to the
      postoperative recurrence of atrial fibrillation, the incidence of postoperative thrombosis
      and the recovery of postoperative left atrial function. Furthermore, this study will
      investigate whether the application of statin drugs can improve postoperative left atrial
      function by affecting these indicators.
