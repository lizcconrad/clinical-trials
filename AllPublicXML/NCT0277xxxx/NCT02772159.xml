    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism and
      excretion of an investigational medication used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). The study drug will be tested in 6 healthy normal males. Dosing will include
      a single dose of study drug administered via an IV Infusion and an Oral Dose. There will be a
      28 day washout period between each of the 2 dosing routes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study in up to 12 healthy male subjects.
      The present study is designed to fully characterize the rates and routes of elimination of TD
      4208 using radiolabeled drug administered via the oral and IV route. This study will provide
      information regarding the metabolic fate of TD 4208, the need for evaluation of potential
      drug-drug interactions, the need for studies in special populations and the absolute oral
      bioavailability of TD-4208. The results from this study will allow a comprehensive comparison
      between animal and human routes of elimination and metabolic profiles of TD 4208.

      This study will be conducted in a small number of healthy male subjects (up to n=12) to
      minimize the number of individuals exposed to radioactivity. Each subject will receive the
      following treatments: Treatment A (Period 1): 20 μg IV infusion of [14C] TD-4208 administered
      in a fasted state over 30 minutes. Treatment B (Period 2): 200 μg oral solution of [14C]
      TD-4208 administered in a fasted state. Blood, urine, feces, and vomitus (if applicable) will
      be collected until the subject is released during Periods 1 and 2. In Periods 1 and 2,
      subjects may remain in the clinical research unit for a maximum of 15 days. Between the
      dosing in periods 1 and 2, there will be washout intervals of at least 28 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a body mass index 19 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive, and weigh at least 55 kg.

          2. Subject has normal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), measured after resting
             seated or supine for approximately 5 minutes. Normal BP is defined as 90 to 140 mm Hg
             systolic and 50 to 90 mm Hg diastolic. Normal HR is defined as 40 to 99 beats per
             minute.

          3. Subject is negative for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV antibodies.

          4. Subject has no clinically relevant abnormalities as determined by the investigator in
             the results of Screening or Day -1 laboratory evaluations.

             medical device) within 30 days (or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever
             is longer) prior to Screening, or are currently participating in another trial of an
             investigational drug (or medical device).

          3. Subject has a known hypersensitivity towards medications similar to TD-4208 or

          5. Subject regularly works with ionizing radiation or radioactive material.

          6. Subject has been exposed to ionizing radiations, within 1 year prior to the start of
             the study, as external irradiation (radiological examination including CT scan

             procedure) or have participated in a radiolabeled study in the last 12 months.

          7. Subject has had exposure to external and/or internal radiotherapy with open (i.e.,
             nuclear medicine) and sealed sources (i.e., brachytherapy) within the last 12 months.

          8. Subject, who, for any reason, is deemed by the investigator to be inappropriate for
             this study or have any condition which would confound or interfere with the evaluation
             of the safety, tolerability, PK of the investigational drug or prevent compliance with
             the study protocol.
