      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of insufflated bags for
      electromechanical power morcellation during laparoscopic hysterectomy and myomectomy for
      tissue removal and to observe the integrity of the bags throughout and after insufflation and
      power morcellation.

      The hypothesis is the bags will remain in tact without leakage from the bags during and after
      power morcellation using the described contained system, confirming the safety and efficacy
      of the systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) are non-cancerous smooth muscle tumors that can cause heavy
      menstrual bleeding, pain, and pressure. Common surgical treatment modalities are hysterectomy
      (removal of the uterus) or myomectomy (removal of the fibroid). Minimally invasive surgical
      techniques (laparoscopy) are generally recommended due to improved recovery time, decrease
      infection risk, decreased bleeding risk and overall decreased morbidity and mortality risks.

      In order to remove a large uterus or large fibroids laparoscopically, a power morcellator is
      often used to cut the specimen into smaller pieces that can be removed through small
      incisions. Due to the concern regarding spread of small amounts of tissue during power
      morcellation, many surgeons are advocating contained power morcellation, i.e. morcellation
      inside a specimen bag.

      This study will be evaluating the efficacy of contained morcellation using a specific
      specimen bag. Morcellation will be performed in the designated bag. The bag will then be
      removed evaluated for any egg albumin leakage. If there is no leakage, it can be inferred
      that there is no tissue is spread during the contained morcellation process using this bag.

    <description>Leakage of egg albumin from the EcoSac bags after isolated bag morcellation or apparent leakage of specimen from the EcoSac bags during isolated bag morcellation. After morcellation is complete, the bag will be removed from the patient and tested in a separate room. 100 milliliters of egg albumin combined with methylene blue will be placed into the bag and the bag will be insufflated. Visual inspection will be used to assess leakage from the bag with outcome measures of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;</description>
