      This project aims:

        -  to further explore the effectiveness of a novel sonified Neurofeedback management
           therapy for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

        -  to determine if balance control is different before and after therapy

      Once the informed consent of a parent or guardian has been secured, each child will be asked
      to provide informed assent. If the child elects to participate in the research project,
      he/she is enrolled in the study and assign to one of two groups: Active Comparator or Sham
      Comparator. If possible, his/her ability to maintain balance is then assessed using a
      standard extended mCTSIB protocol (standing for 25 seconds on a hard surface/4&quot; tall foam
      cushion with eyes open/closed and head neutral/turned right/left/flexed or extended) and
      his/her baseline qEEG and Galvanic Skin Response are recorded. A series of questionnaires
      will be administered to the child and/or his/her parents/legal guardian/caretaker.

      Afterward the child will be instructed to wear the prescribed device (either the Active
      Comparator (Mente Autism™) or the Sham Comparator (a device externally identical to Mente
      Autism™, providing binaural beats but not tailor-made neurofeedback binaural beats)) to use
      at home for 40 minutes a day for 12 weeks.

      After 6 weeks and at the end of the 12 weeks treatment period, the child will again be tested
      as at the beginning of the trial (posturography, qEEG, Galvanic Skin Response and
      questionnaires).

      At the end of the study, participants in the Sham Comparator group will be offered the option
      of receiving the full therapy.
