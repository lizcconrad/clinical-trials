    <textblock>
      The gold standard for the treatment of gingival recession, is the coronal repositioning of
      the flap associated with the subepithelial connective tissue graft. The acellular dermal
      matrix (ADM) has been used as a substitute a subepithelial connective tissue graft in
      periodontal plastic surgery and mucogengivais, and has achieved similar results. The use of
      ADM has the advantage of avoiding possible pre and postoperative complications, as well as
      overcome the limitations presented by autograft. The different surgical techniques used for
      root coverage seek predictability and success. For this, besides the type of incision
      placements flap and graft are of utmost importance because the healing benefit and outcome.

      The aim of this study is to compare two surgical techniques for root coverage and evaluate
      which one provides better cosmetic results and less morbidity . 20 adults , nonsmoking
      patients , showing multiple bilateral gingival recessions , class I or II Miller located in
      canine, first and second premolars are selected. Both techniques use the ADM as a graft.
      However , in one Quadrant partial flap will be held together with relaxing incisions through
      an incision intrasucular , ADM will be positioned 1 mm apical to the cementoenamel junction
      (CEJ) and the flap will be positioned 1 mm coronal CEJ. In the opposite quadrant a minimally
      invasive technique periosteal envelope above does not use relaxing incisions , preserves the
      buds will be held , as well as avoiding any scars, the graft will be used to ADM. The
      clinical parameters (probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing index,
      height and width of the gingival retraction and height and thickness of keratinized gingiva)
      will be evaluated 2 weeks after the basic periodontal therapy and after 6 and 12 months to
      surgical procedures. In addition, measurements of photographic gingival recession with the
      aid of software will be performed.
