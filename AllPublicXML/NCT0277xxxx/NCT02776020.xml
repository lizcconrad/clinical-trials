      The aim of this study is to determine efficacy of the &quot;CorrecDose&quot; device to continuously and
      non-invasively follow the changes in propofol concentrations in the participants' blood.

    <description>Women undergoing a short trans vaginal ovum retrieval (TVOR) will be sedated with propofol , and monitored non-invasively for changes in blood propofol concentration levels. Propofol dosages will be adapted according to patients vital signs and their reaction to noxious stimuli exerted during the trans vaginal ovum retrieval (TVOR) procedure, irrespective to the proposed study in which these participants undergo.Those changes of administered propofol dosages will be observed by the anesthetic drug monitor (ADM). Propfol is administered by the anesthesiologist in a routine manner and according to anesthesiologist discretion .</description>
