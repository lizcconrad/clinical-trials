  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study in participants with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who are
      undergoing surgical resection. Participants will have up to two magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scans with and without intravenous contrast. The MRI will be performed using either an
      extracellular contrast agent or using a macromolecular contrast agent. These contrast agents
      are routinely used in body MRI and are on formulary at this institution. Parameters will be
      compared to histopathology measures of mean vascular density and grade of fibrosis,
      respectively. The purpose is to establish a standard protocol for future clinical trials of
      treatments that would use MRI parameters as quantitative markers of treatment effect.

      This is a prospective cohort study of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), which includes
      diffusion weighted imaging (DWI-MRI) in participants with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who are
      undergoing surgical resection. Participants will have up to two MRI scans with and without
      intravenous contrast. The MRI will be performed using either an extracellular contrast agent
      or using a macromolecular contrast agent. These contrast agents are routinely used in body
      MRI and are on formulary at this institution. Quantitative parameters of volume transfer
      coefficient (Ktrans) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) will be calculated from the MRI
      sequences and each parameter will be compared to histopathology measures of mean vascular
      density and grade of fibrosis, respectively. The influence of the contrast agent
      (extracellular and macromolecular) on agreement between imaging parameters and histopathology
      will be assessed and agreement in Ktrans as derived from a one compartment and a
      two-compartment model will be assessed. The purpose is to establish a standard protocol for
      future clinical trials of treatments that would use MRI parameters as quantitative markers of
      treatment effect.

    <description>Normal volunteers with no pancreas mass or risk factors for pancreas cancer will be recruited for MRI protocol optimization and nothing more. No intravenous contrast will be given.

    <description>Participants with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who are planning to undergo surgical resection. Participants will undergo up to two MRIs with and without intravenous contrast. The first MRI will be performed using an extracellular contrast agent and the second 1-14 days later, with a macromolecular contrast agent. If patient cannot undergo the second MRI for any reason eg. not enough time before surgery, one MRI with either contrast agent will still be used for analysis .</description>
