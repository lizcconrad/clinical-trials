    <textblock>
      Prenatal anxiety and depression are distressing for the expectant mother and can have adverse
      effects on her fetus and child. This study aimed to determine whether listening to specially
      composed songs would be an effective intervention for reducing symptoms of prenatal anxiety
      and depression over a period of 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal anxiety and depression has negative implications for both the mother and the
      developing child, including developmental disorders, low birth weight, and altered immune
      function. It is therefore very important both to detect and to help ameliorate symptoms of
      anxiety and depression in pregnant women. Many women do not want pharmacological
      interventions at this time, and with less severe symptoms it may not be appropriate. Thus
      there is a need to find non-pharmacological methods of intervention. Psychological therapies
      such as cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy can be effective. But these
      are often not available for the large numbers of women who could benefit. Though there has
      been evidence that music has the ability reduce anxiety, no study has quantitatively measured
      prenatal anxiety and depression over a long period of time. Proof of efficacy could justify
      investment into music as an inexpensive, and non-stigmatizing method to reduce prenatal
      anxiety and depression and therefore benefit both the mother and child.
