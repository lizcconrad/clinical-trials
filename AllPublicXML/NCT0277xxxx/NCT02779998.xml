  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure is frequent during rhythmology procedure under light sedation in
      high risks selected patients. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) is recommended for acute
      cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and sleep apnea. The investigators will perform a monocentric,
      prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of NIV which associated
      pressure support ventilation (PSV: 5 to 15 cmH2O) and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP:
      5 to 10 cmH2O) with standard oxygen therapy in prevention of peroperative respiratory event.
      Our hypothesis is that peroperative use of NIV should reduce the incidence of apnea and
      hypoxia during procedure in rhythmology under light sedation.

      This study is an investigator-initiated, monocentric, two-arm parallel-group trial with
      electronic system based randomization. The study protocol was approved by a Central Ethics
      Committee (France) according to French law. Our teaching hospital have a long experience with
      peroperative use of NIV during light sedation and acute respiratory failure. This study is
      designed as a PROBE study (Prospective Randomized Open with Blinded Evaluation) : the
      investigators will provide a blinded analysis of peroperative computer collected data.
