  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is intended to use specimens (such as tissue) and medical
      information in the Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Oncology at the Van Andel Research Institute
      for laboratory research in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Small tissue samples of cutaneous
      neurofibromas will be collected as part of this research. The samples will help researchers
      learn more about cutaneous neurofibroma and help them better understand NF1. There are many
      different types of studies, both now and in the future, that can be done using the specimens
      they receive. These include using the specimens and information to look for new ways to
      diagnose and treat Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The specimens may be used to study how
      genes affect health and disease, or how genes affect the way a disease or condition responds
      to treatment. Some of these studies may lead to new products, such as treatments or tests for
      diseases. Through this study, we hope to find better ways to understand and treat NF1 in the
      future.

    <textblock>
      Skin tumors in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) are very common and diminish quality of life.
      Apart from surgery, very few treatment options exist. In comparison to other types of tumors
      in NF1, skin tumors receive less attention in the research world because they almost never
      turn into cancer. Under the microscope, skin tumors and plexiform tumors look similar,
      however they do not share the same growth potential, nor do they appear at the same time
      during development. These differences suggest that skin tumors are driven by different
      factors than plexiform tumors.

      In this study we will be harvesting CNFs from 3 groups of subjects in order to obtain a
      minimum of 18 tumors in three size categories: &lt;5mm, 5-10mm, and &gt;1cm. These sizes were
      selected based on the variable natural history of CNF progression where incipient lesions
      (typically &lt;5mm) are more numerous and demonstrate a less aggressive growth pattern, whereas
      the intermediate group (5-10mm) represent a transition state towards growth to larger (&gt;1cm)
      lesions. Interestingly, CNF growth tends to stall out at 3cm. We plan to do experiments that
      identify which factors are important to CNF progression, and then find matching drugs that
      can shrink the tumors.

    <description>The procedure to sample the cutaneous neurofibroma involves a skin incision and will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The tissue will be taken in the following way:
The skin area will be cleaned
The skin area will be numbed (by either a numbing cream or a tiny numbing shot)
Cutaneous (skin) Neurofibroma: will be taken via a small incision and removal of the neurofibroma whenever possible.
A small piece of normal (skin) tissue will be numbed as above and taken using a special skin biopsy device.
Afterward, the area will be cleaned and the skin put back together with medical super glue or 1 to 2 dissolvable stitches that will dissolve as the incision heals, they do not require removal. The purpose of taking this piece of skin is to compare normal skin with the skin of a cutaneous neurofibroma.</description>
