  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will test the impact of a modified Ramadan Fasting regimen on
      health and well-being. The 2016 Ramadan is around summer solstice in Germany making it one of
      the most challenging fasting periods for participating Muslims. The modified Ramadan Fasting
      consists of educational components around fasting, and advice for nutritional modifications
      in order to support health and well-being during Ramadan, while the control group will
      continue to fast as usual. The investigators will measure not only body weight/fat but also
      include measures of psychological well-being, and spiritual practice, and serum markers for
      blood lipids, and blood sugar. With this trial the investigators aim to determine, whether
      such modifications around Ramadan will be beneficial for health and well-being.
