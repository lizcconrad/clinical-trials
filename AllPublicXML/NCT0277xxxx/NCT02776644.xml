  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical outcome of advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma has been changed since
      targeted therapy being widely applied. This study will retrospectively analyse the clinical
      outcome of advanced renal cell carcinoma captured in Taiwan National Health Insurance
      Research Database.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeted therapy agents have significantly changed the clinical outcome of advanced /
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. However, the dosing pattern varied and might result in
      impact to duration of treatment. In Taiwan, National Health Insurance system has a coverage
      more than 90% of population and thus can serve as an appropriate database for further
      analysis on Taiwanese advanced renal cell carcinoma. This study will retrospectively analyse
      the clinical outcome of advanced renal cell carcinoma captured in Taiwan National Health
      Insurance Research Database.
