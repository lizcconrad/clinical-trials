    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female, ages 18-49 (inclusive) at the
             time of screening

          -  Have provided written informed consent before screening

          -  Free of clinically significant health problems as determined by pertinent medical
             history and clinical examination prior to entry into the study

          -  Available and able to participate for all study visits and procedures

          -  Females, if not abstinent, are known to be at least 1 year post-menopausal (defined as
             no menses for 12 consecutive months) or willing to use an effective method of
             contraception (eg, hormonal contraception to include oral and implantable options,
             diaphragm, cervical cap, intrauterine device, condom, or anatomical sterility [self or
             partner]) for the duration of study participation (from the date of screening) until
             at least 3 months after the last injection

          -  Negative hantavirus PsVNA test result at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or serologic evidence of prior infection with any hantavirus or prior
             participation in an HTNV or PUUV vaccine trial

          -  History of severe local or systemic reactions to any vaccination or a history of
             severe allergic reactions

          -  Ongoing participation in another clinical trial (subjects continuing through Day 365
             will not join other new studies until their final visit)

          -  Receipt of licensed vaccines within 14 days before or after immunization (30 days for
             live vaccines)

          -  Ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible injections sites (deltoid
             region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably obscured due to a
             physical condition or permanent body art

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or
             hepatic or renal functional abnormality as determined by the investigator based on
             medical history, physical exam, and/or laboratory screening test

          -  Pregnant or lactating female, or female who intends to become pregnant during the
             study period

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 120 days
             preceding study entry or planned administration during the study period Blood donation
             for human use (eg, American Red Cross or other similar blood drives) within the 56
             days preceding study entry or planned administration during the study period

          -  Any confirmed evidence of hepatitis B or C infection

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Administration of chronic (defined as more than 14 days) immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within 6 months of study entry

          -  For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than or equal
             to 0.5 mg/kg/day

          -  Intranasal, inhaled, and topical steroids are allowed (daily inhaled steroids for
             treatment of asthma are NOT allowed)

          -  Any chronic or active neurologic disorder, including seizures and epilepsy, excluding
             a single febrile seizure as a child

          -  Suspected or known current alcohol and/or illicit drug abuse

          -  Unwilling to allow storage and use of blood for future hantavirus-related research

          -  Any other significant finding that in the opinion of the investigator would increase
