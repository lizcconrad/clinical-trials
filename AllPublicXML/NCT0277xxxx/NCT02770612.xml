  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to use a shared decision making tool to allow women who
      have undergone cesarean delivery (CD) to choose the amount of oxycodone the participants will
      be prescribed at discharge, within a range from 0-40 tablets. The study investigators will
      document additional information from medical record abstraction (age, race/ethnicity, medical
      and obstetrical conditions, previous opioid use, date of CD, indication for CD, anesthetic
      management during CD, duration and complications of CD, length of stay, pain medication use
      and pain scores on each postoperative day between CD and discharge). The investigators will
      then follow up with the participants by telephone at two weeks after discharge to assess the
      amount of opioid used, frequency of prescription refill, disposition of unused medication,
      and participant satisfaction with their post-cesarean pain control. The investigators
      hypothesize that the use of a shared decision making tool will decrease the amount of opioid
      prescribed while still providing participants with satisfactory pain control.

    <description>Identify eligible women on post-operative day 3. A physician member of the study team will approach participants with study information and consent forms.
After informed consent is obtained, the participant will be taken through a 10 minute shared decision making session. The participant will then have the opportunity to ask questions, following which they will indicate the number of prescription opioid tablets to be discharged with.
The next contact will be at two weeks after discharge, at which time a member of the study team will contact the participant and administer a brief telephone survey with questions pertaining to perceived pain over time, pain management methods, opioid/pain medication consumption/disposal, and satisfaction with postoperative pain control.
A chart review will be performed by physicians in the research group on participants to gather additional information on demographics, indications for surgery, and other relevant variables.</description>
