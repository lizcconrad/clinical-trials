    <textblock>
      Our study the NSCLC harbors EGFR-mutation with Conmana combined with thalidomide as
      first-line treatment, is expected to improve further EGFR-Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
      response rate (ORR), prolong time to progression (PFS), improve patient survival.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy, survival and side effects of the combined therapy, and to evaluate
      the effectiveness and safety of thalidomide with Conmana in patients who harbors EGFR
      mutations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

          2. Patients be age &gt;18 years and &lt; 75 years. Patients must have a Life Expectancy of
             greater than 3 months.

          3. Patients must be NSCLC confirmed by Histological or cytological.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score standard: 0-2.

          5. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below, within two week
             prior to study: absolute neutrophil count&gt;1,500/mL platelets&gt;100,000/mL total
             bilirubin: within normal institutional limits Aspartate transaminase (AST)/Alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;2.5 times institutional upper limit of normal creatinine≤1.5
             times institutional upper limit of normal urine dipstick for proteinuria of &lt; less
             than 1+. If urine dipstick is &gt; 1+ then a 24 hour urine for protein must demonstrate
             &lt;500mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study.

          6. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for

             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with thalidomide, breastfeeding women are also excluded
             from this study.

          2. During the course of the treatment, the serious active infection of intravenous
             injection of antibiotics is required.

          3. Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to thalidomide and icotinib or other agents used in
             the study are excluded.

          4. A person who is not effectively controlled, has symptoms of brain metastases, or
             suffers from a mental disorder that is not easily controlled; has a severe mental or
             cognitive impairment.

          5. Congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke
             or transient ischemic attack in 6 months.

             skin basal cell carcinoma.

          7. Can not follow the test program or can not meet the follow-up of patients.

          8. The researchers think it is not appropriate to participate in this trial.
