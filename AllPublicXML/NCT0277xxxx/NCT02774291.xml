      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of anti-ESO (cancer/test antigen) murine
      T-cell receptor (mTCR)-transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes and combination
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate in treating patients with cancer
      that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and expresses the gene NY-ESO-1.
      Donor white blood cells that are treated in the laboratory with anti-cluster of
      differentiation (CD)3 may help treat metastatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more
      cancer cells. Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cells, including natural killer cells, to
      kill metastatic cancer cells. Giving anti-ESO (cancer/test antigen) mTCR-transduced
      autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes together with combination chemotherapy and
      aldesleukin may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the administration of anti-ESO (cancer/test
      antigen) mTCR (T cell receptor)-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (anti-thyroglobulin
      mTCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes) plus high-dose aldesleukin following
      a nonmyeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2
      positive patients with metastatic cancer expressing the ESO antigen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo survival of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene-engineered cells.

      II. Determine the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -7 to -6
      and fludarabine phosphate via intravenous piggy back (IVPB) over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1
      followed by anti-ESO (cancer/test antigen) mTCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood
      lymphocytes IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0 and aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes approximately
      every 8 hours on days 0-4. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, annually for 5
      years, and then periodically for 10 years thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Measurable metastatic cancer that expresses NY ESO-1 as assessed by one of the
             following methods: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on tumor
             tissue, or by immunohistochemistry of resected tissue, or serum antibody reactive with
             ESO

             Montefiore Medical Center

          -  Patients must have previously received systemic standard care (or effective salvage
             chemotherapy regimens) for metastatic disease, if known to be effective for that
             disease, and have been either non-responders (progressive disease) or have recurred

          -  3 or fewer brain metastases; Note: if lesions are symptomatic or greater than or equal
             to 1 cm each, these lesions must have been treated and stable for 3 months for the
             patient to be eligible

          -  More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients' toxicities must have
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo);
             Note: patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks,

             an anti-cancer immune response, including anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
             protein 4 (CTLA 4) therapy, at the time the patient receives the preparative regimen
             to allow antibody levels to decline; Note: patients who have previously received
             ipilimumab and have documented gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity must have a normal
             colonoscopy with normal colonic biopsies

                  treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system;
                  patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody;
                  if hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid
                  (RNA) negative

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; to 1.6 mg/dl

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; to 1.5 mg/dl, except in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must
             have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the

             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease

          -  Concurrent opportunistic infections (the experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system; patients who have decreased immune

             to its toxicities)

          -  Concurrent systemic steroid therapy

          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study
