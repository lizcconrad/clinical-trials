      Objective: The main target of this study was to research the correlation between the
      pulmonary function and the circulatory parameters of retrobulbar blood vessels in patients
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) without diabetic retinopathy (DR).

      Method: T2DM patients without DR were choose to research the correlation between the
      pulmonary function and the circulatory parameters of retrobulbar blood vessels. The primary
      endpoints were the pulmonary function parameters; The secondary endpoints were the HbA1c,
      FPG, 2hPG, WC, and BMI. The tertiary endpoints were the blood-fat; In addition, the
      retrobulbar circulation in the retrobulbar blood vessels were evaluated using color doppler
      imaging (CDI).

      Pulmonary function parameters (VC%, FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, MVV%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and
      DLCO/VA%); the retrobulbar circulation (PSV, EDV, RI);retrobulbar blood vessels (CRA, PCA,
      and OA);blood-fat(TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG).

      Pulmonary function was measured by spirometer which was provided by Jaska Corporation in
      Japan, model number: HI-101; The CDI recordings were taken using a Powervision SSA-380A
      (Toshiba, Japan) using a 7-MHz transducer.

        Investigators selected 60 patients (34 males, 26 females) with T2DM from the the diabetic
        outpatient clinic in Shenyang the Fourth Hospital of People, but only 48 patients (26
        males, 22 females) can be researched in our study. All patients were provided a diet and
        exercise program by professional nutritionists. The race ratio (all were Chinese Hans), age
        (range from 34 to 68 years), diabetes duration (range from 3 to 12 years), BMI (range from
        20 to 30 kg/m2), HbA1c [ range from 7.0 % (53 mmol/mol) to 10 % (86 mmol/mol) ]. Through
        the detecting, we excluded 6 patients (4 were in A1 stage, 2 was in A2 stage) because of
        DR. Finally, 48 patients (26 males, 22 females) completed the study.
