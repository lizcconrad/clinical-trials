    <textblock>
      Up to 180 patients with bone metastasis and requiring analgesic treatment will be followed
      during 4 to 10 weeks. All patients will continue to receive their cancer therapeutic
      treatments and be treated for pain relief exactly as they would normally be by the
      Investigator based on their needs. During their regular visits to the Investigator, patients
      will complete questionnaires and Clinical Pain Assessments.

    <measure>Patient's change from baseline of pain severity as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time zero equals baseline up to after at least 4 weeks of treatment (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The pain severity score of BPI is an arithmetic average of the 4 severity scores reported on an 11- point NRS going from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine).
The BPI severity questions are:
3. Your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours? 4. Your pain at its least in the last 24 hours? 5. Your pain on the average? 6. How much pain you have right now?</description>

    <measure>Patient's change from baseline of pain interference as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time zero equals baseline up to after at least 4 weeks of treatment (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The pain interference score of BPI is an arithmetic average of the 7 interference scores reported on an 11-point NRS going from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes)
The BPI interference questions are:
9. Pain has interfered in the last 24 hours with
General Activity?
Mood?
Walking Abililty?
Work?
Relations with other people?
Sleep?
Enjoyment of life?</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with bone tumors or bone metastasis from any primary cancer origin that is
             supported by histological or radiological investigations.

          -  Patients having been or being treated for their bone metastasis and/or their primary
             cancer.

          -  Patients will be required to score at least 4 on the WAPS 11-point NRS during the week
             preceding enrollment.

          -  Patients undergoing or not a radiotherapy program provided visit procedures are
             performed before any radiotherapy sessions if scheduled on the same visit days.
