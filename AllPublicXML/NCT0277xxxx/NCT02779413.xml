        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed consent obtained before any study-related activities (study-related activities
             are any procedure related to recording of data according to the protocol)

          -  The decision to initiate treatment with commercially available Tresiba® FlexTouch® has
             been made by the patient/Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR) and the treating

             study

          -  Male or Female, Age at least 12 months, at the time of signing informed consent with
             type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus and who is scheduled to start treatment with
             Tresiba® FlexTouch® based on the clinical judgment of their treating physician as
             specified in the Korean-Prescribing Information (KPI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in this study. Participation is defined as having given

          -  Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or cooperation. However, paediatric patients can be enrolled when the
             patient's primary caregiver (e.g. parents) or legally acceptable representatives (LAR)
             are capable of giving study specific signed informed consent. Any chronic disorder or
             severe disease which in the opinion of the investigator might jeopardise patient's
             safety or compliance with the protocol
