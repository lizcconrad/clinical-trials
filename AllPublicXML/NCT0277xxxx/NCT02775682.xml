      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with epilepsy exhibiting impaired
      dCA, which may contribute to subsequent stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between epileptic seizures and cerebrovascular disease is complex, ranging
      from mechanisms to clinical manifestation. Stroke is one of the most common causes of
      epilepsy in adulthood. It was also reported that patients with epilepsy exhibited a higher
      risk of stroke. But its potential mechanism was never fully understood. Dynamic cerebral
      autoregulation(dCA), a mechanism to maintain the cerebral bold flow, has been proved to be
      critical for the occurrence ,development and prognosis of ischemic neurovascular disease. In
      this study, we hypothesis that impaired dCA play a role in epilepsy and subsequent stroke.

    <description>A dynamic cerebral auto-regulation parameter derived from transfer function analysis.Continuous cerebral blood flow velocities of bilateral middle cerebral artery will be assessed noninvasively using transcranial Doppler. Spontaneous arterial blood pressure will be simultaneously recorded using a servo-controlled plethysmograph on the left or right middle finger with an appropriate finger cuff size. Transfer function analysis will be used to derive the autoregulatory parameters.</description>

        Consecutive patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy were recruited from the Department of
        Neurology, First Hospital of Jilin University, China. Patient was diagnosed with epilepsy
        by two neurologists according to the consequence of EEG.
