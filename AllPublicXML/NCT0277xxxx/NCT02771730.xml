  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test experimental human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines
      that use an adenovirus vector. The adenovirus vector may help the vaccines stimulate an
      immune response. Researchers want to see how the immune system will respond to these vaccines
      as well as if they are safe to give to people. Participants cannot get HIV from these
      vaccines. However, researchers also want to see if the vaccine's adenovirus is contagious.
      Adenoviruses cause cold symptoms or mild eye infections, therefore household and intimate
      contacts will be asked to participate as well.

             that a male partner has [1] documentation of azoospermia by microscopy, or [2] a
             vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity
             postvasectomy); or

                  1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal
                  ligation; or

               -  Be sexually abstinent.

         26. Volunteers who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through
             alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until
             after the last required protocol clinic visit

         27. Volunteers who were born female and are 21 years of age or older must report having
             had (or must be willing to undergo prior to enrollment) a Pap smear test. This is not
             required if the volunteer has had a documented Pap smear within the previous 3 -5
             years, depending on the volunteer's age and risk. The Pap smear result must be normal
             or ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) (see USPSTF
             guidelines).

         28. All volunteers must agree to practice abstinence (no intimate contact) for 28 days
             following each Ad4 vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             be tested for VISP.

          7. Participants who live in the same house or apartment with, have intimate contact with,
             or care for, any of the following:

         11. HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. (Not applicable to Group 2
             participants.) For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine

         12. Non-HIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine
             trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure
             by the FDA. For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an experimental
             vaccine trial, the HVTN 110 PSRT will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis.
             For volunteers who have received an experimental vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago,
             eligibility for enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 110 PSRT on a case-by-case
