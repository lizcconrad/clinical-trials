    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to ascertain if home-based therapy with monitoring via
      telemedicine can overcome many barriers to compliance and improve rehabilitation following
      ACL reconstruction. Patients undergoing ACL Reconstruction will be followed for 6 weeks
      during their outpatient physical therapy treatment. Subjects will undergo weekly physical
      therapy or weekly physical therapy paired with InterACTION.
