      -  This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study.

        -  The estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 status and Ki67 index of
           CNB specimen are critical biomarkers for making neoadjuvant therapy strategy in invasive
           breast cancer. The concordance of these biomarkers between CNB and surgical specimen was
           varied in previous retrospective reports. The aim of this study is to determine the
           discordance of these biomarkers between CNB and surgical specimen and the influence of
           making treatment strategy by the discordance.
