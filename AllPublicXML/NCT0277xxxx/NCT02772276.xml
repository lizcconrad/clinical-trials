    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot, safety, and pharmacokinetic study of MB-102 versus iohexol and the use
      of the non-invasive optical renal function monitor (ORFM) device in normal and compromised
      renal function participants with different skin color types.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is the first to assess pharmacokinetics and function of the ORFM device
      in participants with impaired kidney function. In addition, it will evaluate the impact of
      different skin color types on readouts by the ORFM prototype devices QuantumLeap and
      Radiance. These data will be used to further refine the algorithms used in the ORFM device
      for the pivotal trial and commercial development. Safety and tolerance of MB-102 will also be
      assessed in a larger population of subjects.

    <description>MB-102 and iohexol administered to participants with normal to chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 2 renal function, and fluorescence measured by the QuantumLeap ORFM device. Approximately half of the participants will be enrolled with Fitzpatrick Scale Type I, II or III, and half with Type IV, V and VI skin color type. In order to determine the optimal dose of MB-102, Cohort 1 subjects may receive different doses. The maximum dose of 4 µmol/kg has already been tested in 8 subjects in a prior clinical study (Pilot 1B) and found to be safe and well tolerated. Coefficient of Variation (CV) will be used as the criterion for selecting dose. The initial dose will be 4 µmol/kg, and the target CV will be 5%. MB-102 will be administered by IV injection over 30 seconds, followed by a 10 mL saline flush IV over 30 seconds. Iohexol will be administered to each subject following the MB-102 administration by IV injection over 30 seconds, followed by a 10 mL saline flush IV over 30 seconds.</description>
