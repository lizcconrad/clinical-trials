    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Apremilast Pregnancy Exposure Registry is to monitor planned and unplanned
      pregnancies exposed to apremilast and to evaluate the safety of this medication relative to
      specified pregnancy outcomes, and to evaluate potential effects of prenatal apremilast
      exposure on infant health status through one year of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Apremilast Pregnancy Exposure Registry (Registry) is a United States (U.S.) based
      registry designed to monitor planned or unplanned pregnancies exposed to apremilast when used
      to treat an approved indication in accordance with the current approved prescribing
      information, who reside in the U.S. or Canada.

      The goal of the Registry is to conduct an observational, controlled prospective cohort study
      that will involve follow-up of live born infants to one year of age.

      The primary objective of the Registry is to evaluate any potential increase in the risk of
      major birth defects, specifically a pattern of anomalies, in apremilast exposed pregnancies
      compared to the primary comparison group of disease-matched unexposed pregnancies. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the potential effect of exposure relative to the secondary
      comparison group of healthy pregnant women, and the effect of exposure on other adverse
      pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, preterm delivery, reduced
      infant birth size, a pattern of minor malformations, postnatal growth of live born children
      to one year of age, and incidence of serious or opportunistic infections or malignancies in
      live born children up to one year of age.

      The Pregnancy Exposure Registry is sponsored by Celgene Corporation and is conducted by the
      Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) Research Group and is administered
      by investigators at the coordinating site located at the University of California, San Diego.
      The study is planned for seven years.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of certain medications when used in the first trimester of pregnancy with respect to major structural birth defects in children of study participants. The study is analyzing the difference in the number of major malformations in children whose moms were exposed to apremilast compared to women without exposure to apremilast. Information will be collected from maternal interview and through medical records.</description>
