      Patients with newly diagnosed IPF are investigated for the diagnostic delay before a
      diagnosis of IPF is made.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary fibrosis can be secondary to connective-tissue disease, environmental exposure, or
      drug toxicity, but it can also appear sporadically without any known cause, i.e. idiopathic
      interstitial pneumonitis (IIP). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the commonest IIP and
      usually follows a rapidly progressive course with a short median survival time.

      IPF is often diagnosed after a long diagnostic delay, which also affects the prognosis. As
      new anti-fibrotic treatments have been approved, and awareness of IPF is rising, the
      diagnostic delay and its implications can be expected to be changing. Also, the new
      diagnostic guidelines of 2011 could change the diagnostic delay. In order to reduce the
      diagnostic delay, it is important to investigate the health care utilization and decisions
      made by healthcare professionals in the period before the final diagnosis is made.

      This study will prospectively include all patients at the two centres in Denmark where
      patients are treated for IPF and has thus a good opportunity to include the majority of
      incident cases of IPF in Denmark. Patients are included immediately after the diagnosis which
      reduces recall bias. The database will include both patient reported data and objective data
      from national registries and patient records. A main focus is the distribution of the
      diagnostic delay between patient and different health care providers, and the health care
      utilization by the patients before a diagnosis of IPF is made. Risk factors for a delayed
      diagnosis are investigated. The importance of the diagnostic delay for the prognosis and the
      course of the disease will also be investigated.

      The database created in this study will also be used for future research in IPF.
