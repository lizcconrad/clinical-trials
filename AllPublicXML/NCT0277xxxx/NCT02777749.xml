    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of adductor canal blocks versus
      periarticular bupivacaine injections for pain management in total knee arthroplasty. This
      randomized clinical trial will compare outcomes between adductor canal blocks, periarticular
      bupivacaine injections, and periarticular liposomal bupivacaine injections. Results from this
      study will help determine the most appropriate perioperative pain management strategy for
      patients undergoing a total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 600,000 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) are performed each year in the United States,
      with expectations for greater than 4 million/year by the year 2030. Since the onset of TKAs
      in the 1960's, there have been developments that have improved both functionality and patient
      satisfaction. In the last decade, a focus has been made on multimodal pain management
      protocols, more rapid functional recovery, reduced length of hospital stay, and minimizing
      side effects of treatment while maintaining function and durability. The widespread use of
      regional anesthesia has led to improvements in pain control, more rapid functional recovery,
      and reduced length of stay. In recent years many surgeons have transitioned from femoral
      nerve blocks (proximal femoral nerve) to adductor canal blocks (distal femoral nerve) to
      maintain a sensory block for pain control, while minimizing any motor blockade that is
      typically seen in proximal femoral nerve blocks, which would hamper rehabilitation, and
      increase risk of falls. In addition to regional blocks, which are typically performed in the
      preoperative setting, some surgeons favor an intraoperative periarticular anesthetic
      injection (PAI), typically with bupivacaine or the long acting form liposomal bupivacaine,
      either in conjunction with an adductor canal block, or independently. In theory, PAI has the
      advantage of a comparable sensory nerve block as an adductor canal block, without the
      disadvantages and risks, which include prolonged quadriceps weakness, fall risk, and
      neurologic dysfunction.

      The purpose of this randomized control trial is to compare the efficacy of adductor canal
      blocks versus periarticular bupivacaine injections for pain management in total knee
      arthroplasty.

    <description>Post-operatively, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores will be recorded two times/day from Post-Operative Day (POD) 0 through POD3. VAS Scores range from 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 being the &quot;Worst Pain&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activity Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Daily steps taken will be recorded. The more steps taken daily the better. Minimum is 0 steps, maximum is unlimited.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Total amount of opioid consumption post-operatively will be recorded. The less opioids consumed (mg) postoperatively the better. A morphine equivalence metric will be used for equianalgesic comparison. Minimum is 0 mg, maximum is unlimited.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Range of Knee Flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>POD0 through POD21</time_frame>
    <description>Range of knee flexion, for both passive and active motion, will be recorded prior to discharge, and at 3 week follow-up for all groups. The greater range of motion the better, with a good outcome considered at least 115 degrees of motion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of hospital stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Total length of hospital stay from time of surgery through time of discharge will be recorded. The shorter the length of stay (days) the better. Range 0 days to 5 days.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of patient disposition to home or home with health services</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>This is designed to evaluate the number of patients who go home or home with health services, which can be compared with the number of patients who go to outside institutions such as sub-acute rehabilitation or skilled nursing facilities. Disposition to home or home with health services is considered as the best outcome.</description>
