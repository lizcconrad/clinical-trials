  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to examine the effect of changes in body weight and related
      parameters associated with a commercially-available, low-carbohydrate diet plan. A parameter
      proposed to be studied here is the impact of fructose restriction and weight loss on serum
      uric acid concentrations and arterial stiffness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well know that consumption of a calorically-restricted diet helps people lose weight.
      Such a diet with low carbohydrate lowers the serum uric acid concentration which is a factor
      associated with obesity and also represents a particular metabolic risk in women compared to
      men. The present weight loss study will determine whether women benefit more than men to
      short-term weight loss occurring during restriction of simple sugars.

      Specifically, this study is designed to cause weight loss acutely through consumption of a
      diet that is restricted in calorie and simple sugars. Both men and women will be studied and
      their results compared to determine whether women benefit more with respect to arterial
      stiffness. Upon finishing the four-week diet intervention, body weight and blood lipids will
      be assessed two and four weeks later to compare the longer term effect on blood pressure.

    <description>Body weight is measured at baseline, 2 weeks after the start of controlled diet feeding, and subsequently, 2 weeks after consumption of self-prepared, calorie-restricted, low-carbohydrate diet. The third phase is a follow-up period in which subjects return at 2 weeks and 4 weeks for the blood pressure measurement after they finish the diet intervention. During these two follow-up visits, body weight will be recorded as well.</description>

    <description>The intervention of this arm is to use a &quot;Grab-and-Go&quot; meal plan. This meal plan provides Atkins shakes and bars for breakfast, lunch, and snacks for 2 weeks. For dinner the subject is given a freshly-prepared meal. Upon finishing the 2-week provided food phase, the subject will consume a self-prepared meal of similar nutrient composition at home for another 2 weeks. For the next four weeks while he/she is still enrolled in the study, he/she will have his/her options for food choices which are not controlled for the study.</description>

    <description>The intervention of this arm is to use a &quot;Jump Start&quot; meal plan. This meal plan provides Atkins frozen meals at breakfast, lunch and dinner for 2 weeks and these meals are supplemented with fresh salads and vegetables. Upon finishing the 2-week provided food phase, the subject will consume a self-prepared meal of similar nutrient composition at home for another 2 weeks. For the next four weeks while he/she is still enrolled in the study, he/she will have his/her options for food choices which are not controlled for the study.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Grab-and-Go&quot; meal plan will provide Atkins shakes and bars for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. For dinner, the participant will receive a freshly-prepared meal. There will be no difference in terms of calories or nutrient composition between &quot;Grab-and-Go&quot; meal plan versus &quot;Jump-Start&quot; meal plan.
The amount of weight loss caused by these two meal plans is not expected to differ.</description>
