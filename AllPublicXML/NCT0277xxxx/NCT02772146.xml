  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, prospective, non-randomized, clinical and first-in-human study. Each patient
      will be studied during a single treatment session of ten hours. The device will be connected
      to an existing, standard PD catheter that the patient will be using routinely prior to the
      study (i.e. a peritoneal dialysis catheter will not be specifically inserted for the study).
      The patient will be hospitalized for observation during the test day and during the night
      following the study session. Ultrafiltration volume, dialysate glucose concentrations, blood
      glucose concentrations as well the patient's acceptability and tolerance of the wearable
      device will be evaluated.

    <description>The purpose of CLS UF is ultrafiltration and drain of excess fluid in patients with congestive heart failure. The function of the device is to extra corporeally recirculate profiled glucose based PD fluid in a system and maintain glucose levels by adding extra glucose, to an adjustable and constant level, in order to maintain a stable ultrafiltration.</description>
