  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, a large number of studies have been conducted on how to improve the
      treatment of patients in the Emergency Room (ER) complaining of chest pains. Great advances
      have been achieved recently regarding diagnostic methods aided by coronary CT angiopraphy
      (CCTA) and sensitive troponins. However, various questions about these methods still remain
      obscure and there is no effective comparison between them in patients with intermediate risk.
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of sensitivity troponins
      in the detection of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain and the intermediate
      probability of ACS compared with CCTA.

      This will be a prospective and unicentric study with approximately 200 subjects recruited
      over a planned recruitment period of 24 months. Based on an alpha error of 0.05 and using a
      power of 0.8 for the primary outcomes, investigators calculated the number of individuals
      necessary for the study to be at least 141. All patients will be submmited to troponin
      measurements and CCTA. The commercial kit ADVIA Centaur® TnI-Ultra (Siemens Healthcare
      Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) is used for this in automated equipment of the same brand.
      It is measured at the central InCor laboratory. The 99th percentile value is 0.04 ng/ml. The
      CCTA used will be the 320-channel Toshiba Aquilium machine. If the CCTA result shows coronary
      stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, the patient will initiate the ACS treatment and be
      hospitalized to have coronary cineangiography. In case the CCTA shows lesions of less than
      50%, the patient will be discharged and monitored for 30 days by telephone. This conduct is
      already followed as a routine in the emergency unit at InCor for both situations. A second
      sampling of the troponin kit will be obtained from all patients three hours after the first
      collection in order to evaluate for an increase/decrease of troponin. This second troponin
      measurement, however, it is blinded to the main investigator, who will only have access to it
      after the evaluation of outcomes at the end of the study. All the data will be placed in a
      Microsoft Access database table and analyzed with the SAS Statview 5.0 software. The
      comparative analysis between the methods will be made using the area under the ROC curve and
      obtaining sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy.
