      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a combination of a QD
      regimen consisting on ritonavir boosted darunavir (FDC) and lamivudine versus ritonavir
      boosted darunavir (FDC) plus co-formulated tenofovir and emtricitabine or co-formulated
      tenofovir/lamivudine in naïve HIV-1 infected patients. Subjects will be ARV-naïve
      HIV-1-infected patients eligible to start ARV therapy according to current
      guidelines.Subjects will be adults ≥ 18 years of age who meet all of the inclusion criteria
      and none of the exclusion criteria.

    <description>The percentage of participants with Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48 will be assessed using Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), as codified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &quot;snapshot&quot; algorithm. This algorithm treated all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at Week 48 as nonresponders, Otherwise, virologic success or failure will be determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment in the snapshot window (Week 48 +/- 6 weeks).</description>

    <description>Clinical disease progression (CDP) was assessed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV-1 classification system. Category (CAT) A: one or more of the following conditions (CON), without any CON listed in Categories B and C: asymptomatic HIV infection, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, acute (primary) HIV infection with accompanying illness or history of acute HIV infection. CAT B: symptomatic CON that are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or that are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection; and not included among CON listed in clinical CAT C. CAT C: the clinical CON listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition. Indicators of CDP were defined as: CDC CAT A at Baseline (BS) to a CDC CAT C event (EV); CDC CAT B at BS to a CDC CAT C EV; CDC CAT C at BS to a new CDC CAT C EV; or CDC CAT A, B, or C at BS to death.</description>
