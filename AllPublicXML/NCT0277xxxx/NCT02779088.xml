      This cohort study will establish the urban elderly cohort, measure both physical and
      functional parameters, find the risk factors for aging, and validate the role of strength
      training for those sarcopenic patients. Investigators hope this study will be widely cited in
      related fields in the future.

      It is not easy to perform longitudinal cohort study in an urban area having high migration.
      WanHwa area, sitting at southwestern Taipei, has the properties of high elder population and
      low migration, and is suitable for cohort study. In the aging process, the elderly has
      decreased functional status resulting in frailty, immobility, and poor health-related
      fitness. Health-related fitness includes cardiovascular endurance, body composition, muscular
      strength and endurance, and flexibility. It has a strong relationship with good health, is
      characterized by an ability to perform daily activities. The functional status of old citizen
      declines during aging. Appropriate physical activity can reverse the process of
      deconditioning and related diseases. The screening of old citizens with health-related
      fitness can select the high risk population. However, the reports on the health-related
      fitness are scarce in Taiwan. The aims of this study are to establish the cohort of elder
      population based on parameters of health-related fitness, body compositions, blood
      biochemistry, balance, quality of life, and musculoskeletal ultrasonography; and to evaluate
      the association between fitness parameters and disease incidence with those data.
      Investigators expect to recruit 1200 adults who attend the annual health check-up in National
      Taiwan University, BeiHu Branch in 2016 and 2017, and to train those having sarcopenia with
      strengthening exercise. This cohort study will establish the urban elderly cohort, measure
      both physical and functional parameters, find the risk factors for aging, and validate the
      role of strength training for those sarcopenic patients. Investigators hope this study will
      be widely cited in related fields in the future.
