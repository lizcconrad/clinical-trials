  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelium is considered a real member, so it is contributing to determine the vascular
      homeostasis. The presence of endothelial dysfunction, evaluated in peripheral arteries by
      non-invasive study of the variation of gauge of the brachial artery as a result of
      post-ischemic hyperemia (FMD), is predictive of occurrence of major cardiovascular events.
      Several recent studies have shown that passive smoking is correlated with endothelial
      dysfunction and, therefore, non-smokers exposed subjects to passive smoking, have an
      increased risk of occurrence cardiovascular pathologies. From January 2008, a ministerial
      decree will ban smoking in bars, restaurants and nightclubs. The impact of exposure end to
      smoking in non-smoking subjects, as part of a prospective study and controlled, has never
      been evaluated.
