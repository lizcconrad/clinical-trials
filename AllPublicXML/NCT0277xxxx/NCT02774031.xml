  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low flow anesthesia (LFA) is used less than desirable, partly because one has considered that
      there might be danger of underdosing of anesthesia gas and thus risk of awareness under
      anesthesia.LFA has several advantages such as reducing loss of moisture and heat in the
      inhaled air under anesthesia and to reduce the consumption of anesthetic gas. A few
      anesthesia machines include an automatic gas control system: the Aisys machine, by GE
      Healthcare (Madison, WI, USA), and the Flow-i machine, by Maquet (Sweden).

      Since these machines were introduced, only a few studies have reported their functionality
      and effect on gas consumption. 20 to 55% reduction of gas consumption was found. The
      potential reduction may have been underestimated because in the majority of cases a FGF
      higher than 1 l/min was still used.

      In this study the consumption of anesthetic gas (desflurane) delivered by two different
      anesthesia machines (Aisys and Flow-i) will be compared, with and without gas control
      delivery systems. Gas consumption and the time needed to reach the target level of anesthetic
      gas concentration will be assessed. Data needed will be collected directly from the
      anesthesia machine, PICIS ( Electronic anesthesia record) and EPJ (Electronic patient
      journal). The results of this study are of interest for intraoperative ventilation and of
      economic and ecological interest
