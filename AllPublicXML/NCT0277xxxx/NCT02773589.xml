  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is an esophagus motor disability characterized by a lack of relaxation of the lower
      esophageal sphincter (LES) to deglutition. Myotomy is the gold standard surgical technique
      allowing to cure this pathology. In this study, investigators are using a new endoluminal
      technique of myotomy, innovative and less invasive, called POEM (PerOral Endoscopic Myotomy).
      This technique does not require any cutaneous incision.

      Mini-invasive surgery is more and more associated to endoscopy. The practice was initiated by
      the accession of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). In this context,
      the introduction of the POEM technique seems to be an original approach and a natural
      evolution to a new generation of surgical endoscopy.
