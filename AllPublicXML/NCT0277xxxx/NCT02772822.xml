      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficiency of SCT400 plus CHOP versus
      Rituximab plus CHOP in untreated CD20-positive DLBCL Patients.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of SCT400 plus CHOP, as well
      as the presence of human anti-chimeric antibodies (HACA).
