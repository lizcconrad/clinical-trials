    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on merestinib (standard meal and
      high-fat meal) compared to the fasted state. The study will also measure how much of the
      study drug gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. In
      addition, the tolerability of the study drug will be evaluated. Information about any side
      effects that may occur will also be collected. The study will last approximately 28 days.
      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.
