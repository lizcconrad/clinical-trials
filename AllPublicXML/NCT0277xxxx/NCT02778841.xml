    <textblock>
      Falling of the elderly as one of the greatest issues and major health problems among the
      elderly population has produced a further discussion among gerontologists and physical
      therapists. Moreover, they are considered as one of the major health problems among the aging
      population and by now around a third of 65-year-old adults fall as a minimum once a year
      while 6% of such falls cause fractures. Loss of the balance is the main reason for falling
      among the elderly. Proprioception is the sensory feedback regarding the joint position sense
      and movement which can accordingly lead to a decrease in the postural stability and
      steadiness of the elderly people. Proprioception has shown to be a risk factor for falls in
      older people. proprioception can be modified by physical training. Recently, exergaming, the
      playing of video games with body movements, has been proposed as effective strategy to
      deliver exercise.

      Aim of study: the current research investigates the effect of 8 weeks videogame game
      exercise, conventional balance exercise, and a combined of the two (mixed training) on knee
      proprioception, static balance, and mobility of elderly male. Methodology: The study was
      designed as a single-blinded, randomized, controlled intervention trial. Sixty-four male ages
      65 years and above were randomly assigned into an exergame group, a traditional balance
      exercise group, a mixed training group or a passive control group. After pretest all
      participant perform 8 weeks of exercise and measured the effects of the training regimens on
      proprioception and other functional outcomes as well as mood states in healthy older adults.

    <description>A Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer (Biodex 3, 20 Ramsay Rode, Shirley, New York) was used to assess the proprioception of the subjects. The knee joint proprioception was investigated at target angles 30°, 45° and 60° . participants' legs were passively moved to the target angles, their knees were held at the target position for 10 seconds, and then returned to the starting position (90˚). Then, the participants were asked to extend their knees by pushing the dynamometer lever arm toward the previously selected target angle.
