    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this 2-part drug interaction study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics (i.e., amount in the
           blood) of selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 (Part I).

        -  To evaluate the effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its
           metabolite ACT-333679 (Part II).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because non-clinical studies have shown that selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679,
      are substrates for cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8), the present clinical study aims at
      investigating the effect of a strong inhibitor (gemfibrozil) and a moderate inducer
      (rifampicin) of CYP2C8 on the pharmacokinetic of selexipag and ACT-333679 as recommended by
      the FDA's Guidance for Industry Drug Interaction Studies (FDA, 2012).
