  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SPI-1005 is a novel oral drug that contains a glutathione peroxidase mimetic (ebselen) that
      will be tested in subjects with a history of NIHL at risk for additional NIHL. The goal of
      this multi-center Phase 2b study is to determine whether SPI-1005 is effective in reducing an
      acute NIHL in this affected population. In this Phase 2b study subjects with prior NIHL will
      be enrolled and exposed to a calibrated sound challenge (CSC) that induces a slight acute
      NIHL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy study of oral SPI-1005 in
      adults with Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). All recruited subjects will have their
      severity of NIHL determined before the start of SPI-1005 treatment using otoscopy,
      tympanometry and audiometry. Subjects with &gt;15 and &lt;/= 40 decibel (dB) NIHL will be enrolled
      and randomized to either placebo or SPI-1005. Patients will be dosed with either placebo or
      SPI-1005 for 7 days, beginning 1 day before an acute NIHL. Patients will have audiometry and
      Words In Noise Testing (WINT) before and immediately after a calibrated sound challenge
      (CSC). The CSC involves listening to 4 hours of pre-recorded music (100 dBA SPL) through
      insert earphones. The CSC induces a slight acute NIHL. Follow-up audiometry and WINT will be
      performed at 1 and 7 days post-CSC. A total of four clinic visits will be required over 10-14
      days.
