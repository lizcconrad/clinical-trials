    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects referred for mitral valve surgery

          -  Presence of moderate to severe (3+) or severe mitral regurgitation (4+) as read on an
             echocardiographic study performed within 60 days prior to procedure. Assessment of
             mitral regurgitation will be performed by the investigational site echocardiography
             laboratory and confirmed by the Core Echocardiography Laboratory using an integrative
             method.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Estimated post-ePTFE neochordal implantation coaptation surface is adequate in the
             judgment of the operating surgeon and the patient eligibility committee

          -  Degenerative mitral valve disease

          -  Subject is able to sign informed consent and able to return for follow-up and is
             capable of participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation

          -  Women of child-bearing potential have a negative pregnancy test

          -  Able to sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Functional mitral regurgitation

          -  History of Mediastinal Radiation

          -  Inflammatory (rheumatic) valve disease

          -  Requirement for concomitant cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting
             (CABG), aortic valve surgery, etc.)

          -  Symptomatic coronary artery disease

          -  Cardiogenic shock at the time of enrollment

          -  ST segment elevation myocardial infarction requiring intervention within 30 days prior
             to enrollment

          -  Evidence of cirrhosis or hepatic synthetic failure

          -  Pregnancy at the time of enrollment (women of child bearing age should have negative
             pregnancy within 14 days of surgery)

          -  Severe pulmonary hypertension (PA systolic pressure &gt; 70 mmHg)

          -  Previous cardiac surgery, or surgery on the left pleural space

          -  Severe left or right ventricular dysfunction NYHA Class IV

          -  Renal insufficiency CKD stage 3b or worse (GFR &lt; 45 ml/min/1.73 m2)

          -  Patient is participating in another clinical study for which follow-up is currently
             ongoing. (Co-enrollment in an investigational device or interventional study)

          -  Patient with non-cardiac co-morbidities and life expectancy &lt; 1 year

          -  Patient has a condition or conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             preclude participation, including willingness to comply with all follow-up procedures
