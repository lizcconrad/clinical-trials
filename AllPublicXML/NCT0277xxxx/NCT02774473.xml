      Patients with a history of metastatic breast cancer who are candidates for participation in
      the companion therapeutic trial, UPCC 06115 &quot;A Phase I Trial of Ribociclib (LEE011) and
      Weekly Paclitaxel in Patients with Rb+ Advanced Breast Cancer&quot; may be candidates for this
      imaging study. Patients may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years of age,
      most participants will be receiving care at the clinical practices of the University of
      Pennsylvania. Patients that meet the eligibility criteria will be approached about study
      participation regardless of race or ethnic background.

      The investigators anticipate enrolling up to 20 participants with metastatic breast cancer
      who meet eligibility requirements for this study and for the companion therapy trial UPCC
      06115 &quot;A Phase I Trial of Ribociclib (LEE011) and Weekly Paclitaxel in Patients with Rb+
      Advanced Breast Cancer&quot;, Accrual will likely occur over approximately 4 years.

      Positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate proliferative activity
      in sites of metastatic disease using the investigational radiotracer [18F]fluorothymidine
      (FLT). Imaging will occur prior to starting therapy on the separate therapeutic protocol UPCC
      06115. Patients may undergo a second FLT PET/CT scan following a 3-day run of ribociclib
      (LEE011) (day -6 to -4) on Day -3 (Â± 1 day) and a third FLT PET/CT scan on cycle 1 day 1 (-1
      day) before starting treatment with Paclitaxel to compare changes in FLT uptake measures.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  History of histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer, any ER, PR or HER2
             status is allowed as long as it expresses the Rb protein.

          -  At least one site of metastatic breast cancer that is outside of the liver and bone
             that is identified by standard imaging (e.g. CT, MRI, FDG PET/CT, ultrasound, x-ray)
             and is measurable as defined by RECIST 1.1

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

          -  Patients must be candidates to receive treatment on the therapeutic trial UPCC06115, a
             Phase I study of ribociclib (LEE011) and weekly paclitaxel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant at the time of screening will not be eligible for this study,
             urine pregnancy test will be performed at screening in women of child-bearing
             potential.

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the
             study.

          -  Ineligible for the therapeutic trial UPCC 06115 Only individuals (aged 18 or over) who
             can understand and give informed consent will be eligible to participate in this
             study. Individuals who are considered to be mentally disabled will not be recruited
             for this study. All subjects must be able to give informed consent. We will not be
             using specific methods to assess decisional capacity. Economically disadvantaged
             persons will not be vulnerable to undue influence, patients will be informed that
             participation is voluntary. All individuals will be told that their choice regarding
             study participation will in no way change their access to clinical care. This should
             negate any undue influence or coercion. Children, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are
             not included in this research study. It is unlikely that the researchers will
             encounter a patient/study participant who is pregnant during enrollment because
             pregnant patients may not enroll on the parent treatment protocol, UPCC06115. However,
             menopausal status of the study participant will be reviewed during the screening
             process by examining the patient's medical record; women of child-bearing potential
             will have a urine pregnancy test at the time of screening.
