  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent epidemiologic studies are identifying a number of modifiable risk and protective
      factors that may influence in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the
      combination of an early detection of individuals at risk together with interventional studies
      targeted to the control of modifiable risk factors makes primary prevention programmes to
      become a new and real therapeutic strategy.

      In this scenario, the investigators have designed the ALFAlife study, a programme of control
      and intervention on the modifiable AD risk factors. Throughout this study, participants will
      be given a number of healthy lifestyle guidelines that are personalised depending on their
      specific risk profile. These guidelines refer to smoking and dietary habits and physical,
      cognitive and social activity. The investigators hypothesis is that the follow-up of these
      guidelines will favor a change of participants' lifestyle habits towards healthier ones. In
      addition, the investigators hypothesise that changes in these lifestyle habits will have an
      effect on objective physiological measures (such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels).
