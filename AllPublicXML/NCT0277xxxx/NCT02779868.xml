  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cachexia is a complex metabolic process affecting up to 80% of patients suffering from
      an advanced-stage cancer. Moreover, 20 to 40% of all cancer deaths are caused directly by
      cachexia. Recently, omega-3 fatty acids have gained interest for their beneficial effects in
      cancer cachexia. Moreover, nutritional supplementation enriched with omega-3 could
      potentially maintain body weight in cancer patients undergoing intensive treatment.

      The investigators aims in this study is to evaluate the effect of omega-3 supplementation on
      body composition, functional capacity, inflammatory profile and quality of life in cervix
      cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.
