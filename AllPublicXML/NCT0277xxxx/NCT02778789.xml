      Comparing the structural effects of TNFi and tocilizumab on the periarticular bone by
      performing a comprehensive analysis of the periarticular bone changes in RA patients treated
      with either TNFi or tocilizumab in a longitudinal Setting, using high-resolution peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), a very sensitive method for visualizing and
      quantifying bone microstructure in RA patients. Quantitatively assessing the changes of
      erosions volume, osteophytes size and the area of cortical fenestration in a group of
      TNFi-treated and a group of tocilizumab- treated RA patients.

    <textblock>
      Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and of interleukin- 6 receptor (IL-6R)
      emerged as highly effective cytokine blocking strategies in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) in the last years. Both, inhibition of TNF-α (TNFi) and of the interleukin-6
      receptor by tocilizumab ameliorate the signs and symptoms, reverse the elevated acute phase
      response and inhibit the progression of bone erosion in RA patients (1). Despite striking
      similarities with respect to their efficacy and safety in the treatment of RA, TNFi and
      tocilizumab are two entirely distinct approaches for targeting chronic inflammatory diseases
      in humans. This concept is highlighted by the differential response to TNFi and tocilizumab
      in other chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and
      spondyloarthritis, with clinical efficacy of the former but not the latter treatment modality
      (2). On the other hand, tocilizumab has a direct effect on the acute phase response and iron
      metabolism, which is not found with TNFi. Therefore, subtle differences may exist between
      TNFi and tocilizumab, which are relevant for the long-term treatment of RA patients.

        Patients (ages over 18 years) with the diagnosis of RA will be screened for the presence of
        erosions by Routine procedure with HR-pQCT. In case of a positive scan showing the presence
        of erosion in the wrist or the MCP Joints and after the decision of the treatment (if
        either Tocilizumab or TNF-Inhibitor), patients will be enrolled into the study.
