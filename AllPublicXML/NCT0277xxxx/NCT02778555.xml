      This study sought to develop and validate a brief, daily version of the Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS; 13 items; factors: rumination, helplessness,
      magnification) (Sullivan 1995) measures trait catastrophizing in the context of actual or
      anticipated pain. Currently, there is no validated tool for measuring pain catastrophizing at
      the daily level. Lack of a validated daily measure stands as a barrier for studies that aim
      to characterize mechanisms of pain treatment and how PC adaptation / change occurs.

    <description>The validation process involves identifying, of the original 14 PCS items, which items show the largest factor loadings to the underlying factor structure that fits the data best, using model fit indices that will determine appropriate fit of the statistical model to the data, as well as convergent validity with other relevant measures (pain intensity, depression, anxiety, anger), which is tested through the use of Pearson correlations.</description>

    <description>In Sample 1 (N=186), our 14-item Daily PCS was administered daily for 14 days to replicate the 3-factor structure at the daily level, and to select the ideal 5 items for a brief Daily PCS.</description>

    <description>In Sample 2 (N=209), the 5-item Daily PCS was administered daily for 14 days with short forms for PROMIS Pain Intensity, Depression, Anger, and Anxiety included on days 1, 7, and 14.</description>
