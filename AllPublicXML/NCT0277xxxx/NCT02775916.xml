  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary
      therapeutic efficacy of oral administrations of CDZ173, a selective PI3K Delta inhibitor, for
      12 weeks, in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. Data from this study will provide
      basis for further development of the compound for the treatment of primary Sjögren's
      syndrome.
