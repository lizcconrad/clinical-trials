      A one-arm exploratory clinical research program Study of Apatinib in Advanced Metastatic
      Renal Cell Carcinoma （mRCC） Patients.It`s arm to evaluate the treatment of advanced
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma in patients with objective response rate (ORR), disease
      control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life
      score (QoL) and safety.

      Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) (according to RECIST 1.1 Standard
      Edition)，progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life
      (QoL).Evaluation once every 8 weeks, If the efficacy results of the evaluation are complete
      response (CR) or partial response (PR), confirmed imaging efficacy at 4 weeks after the
      initial assessment ， efficacy evaluation time window of ± 7 days.
