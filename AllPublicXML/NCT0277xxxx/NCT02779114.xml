      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open, prospective, controlled, parallel-group
      intervention study in 318 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The study is composed of 3
      phases: a pre-randomization phase for up to 10 days followed by a 1-year randomized, open
      three arm treatment phase for each patient, followed by a 5-year observational phase for all
      patients still in remission.

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is characterized by progressive synovitis leading to degradation of
      articular cartilage leading to erosions in juxtaarticular bones driven by auto antibodies.
      Few clinical studies could show that quick and thorough control of inflammatory processes
      could stop degradation processes [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and had presumably better prognosis of
      remission than untreated and/or uncontrolled RA disease [20]. These studies aimed at low
      disease activity [20], often focused on early RA [18, 19], evaluating different therapy
      strategies, mostly escalating instead of deescalating medications [20, 21]. Real &quot;RA- in -
      remission&quot; or therapy reduction studies are missing up to now, even if first small trials
      focusing on one preparation showed promising results [16, 17].

      In this study all conventional medications in usual combinations are being evaluated for the
      treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis in different stages of disease duration. The study is
      scheduled as a 365-day (12-months), phase 3 multicenter, randomized, open, prospective,
      controlled, parallel-group intervention study in 318 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

      Based on the results of the clinical studies mentioned above, and the need for a guideline
      with therapy proposals for RA- patients in remission all current preparations will be
      evaluated in subjects under the controlled setting of a clinical study. The information
      obtained from this study will assess the formulation of new guidelines regarding patients
      with Rheumatoid Arthritis in remission.

             still under treatment
