  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the pregnancy rates of women (ages 18-50
      years) undergoing transfer of vitrified-warmed blastocysts (frozen at less than 41 years of
      age) as part of their IVF treatment are not different with respect to the administration of
      progesterone (Crinone® 8% vaginal gel versus intramuscular progesterone).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the type of progesterone administered (intramuscular
      progesterone or Crinone® 8% vaginal gel) does not affect implantation and clinical pregnancy
      rates in women receiving cryo-thawed blastocysts that were produced using their own eggs and
      frozen before age 41 years. Both intramuscular progesterone (25-100 mg compounded in oil) or
      vaginal progesterone (Crinone® 8% vaginal progesterone gel) are widely used for luteal phase
      support in patients receiving vitrified-warmed embryos. Crinone® 8% is FDA approved for
      progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology
      (ART) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency (FDA approval letter, 1997).
