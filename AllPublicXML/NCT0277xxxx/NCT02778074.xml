    <textblock>
      Purpose and aims Tailored internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (I-CBT) is a new
      innovative and person-centred method that is promising that may be used to decrease
      depression in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). In patients with CVD, depressive
      symptoms is a common co-morbidity leading to decreased wellbeing, and increased morbidity and
      mortality. Depressive symptoms are both underdiagnosed and undertreated in CVD patients.
      Earlier studies have demonstrated the efficiency of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for
      many psychiatric conditions, but few studies have evaluated CBT in patients with CVD.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the tailored I-CBT program on
      reducing depressive symptoms and other patient reported outcomes in patients with
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to explore factors related to implementation of the I-CBT
      program in clinical cardiac care.

      Aims of the study

        -  To evaluate the effects of the tailored I-CBT depression program on depressive symptoms,
           sleep, anxiety and quality of life.

        -  To evaluate factors that can influence the I-CBT programs effect on depressive symptoms.

        -  To gain knowledge about the I-CBT program, as perceived by patients and health care
           professionals.

        -  To explore facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the I-CBT program in
           clinical practice from the perspectives of patients, health care professionals and
           policymakers.

    <description>In this arm the participants are allocated to a non mandatory discussion forum for nine weeks. Evert week will participants discuss issues regarding their CVD. Themes discussed are suggested by the study team, and a new theme is added every week. A moderator from the study group act as a supervisor and checks that issues discussed are ok. After the nine week discussion forum the participants are offered the nine week CBT program.</description>
