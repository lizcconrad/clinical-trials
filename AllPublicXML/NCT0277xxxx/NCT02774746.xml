  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that delivery at 35 0/7- 35 6/7
      weeks in stable patients with gastroschisis is superior to observation and expectant
      management with a goal of delivery at 38 0/7 - 38 6/7 weeks. To test this hypothesis, we will
      complete a randomized, prospective, multi-institutional trial across NAFTNet-affiliated
      institutions. Patients may be enrolled in the study any time prior to 33 weeks, but will be
      randomized at 33 weeks to delivery at 35 weeks or observation with a goal of 38 weeks. The
      primary composite outcome will include stillbirth, neonatal death prior to discharge,
      respiratory morbidity, and need for parenteral nutrition at 30 days.

    <textblock>
      Gastroschisis is the most common congenital abdominal wall abnormality in which the
      intestines are herniated through the defect into the amniotic fluid. This is diagnosed by
      prenatal ultrasound at 18-20 weeks gestation. Gastroschisis occurs in 1 out of every 4000
      births and the incidence is increasing. The majority of patients with gastroschisis have an
      uncomplicated neonatal course and recover well after surgical repair. However, subsets of
      gastroschisis patients have more complicated courses due to loss of intestine or atresias.
      This may be due to exposure of the herniated intestines to the caustic effects of amniotic
      fluid or the narrowing of the abdominal wall defect over time causing constriction of the
      intestinal blood supply. Additionally, gastroschisis patients have an increased risk of
      in-utero fetal demise.

      The potential risk of pregnancy loss late in the third trimester has prompted some providers
      to deliver gastroschisis patients prior to term. This results in an increased chance of
      additional prematurity-related morbidity. There is no consensus about the ideal time to
      deliver a baby with gastroschisis and practice patterns vary widely. It is unclea4r which
      offers the fetus a chance at a better outcome: early delivery to mitigate risk of demise and
      intestinal injury versus delivery closer to term.

      Retrospective data published show inconsistent results on outcomes with early delivery or
      later gestational age delivery in gastroschisis. There has been one randomized, prospective
      trial with delivery at 36 weeks versus awaiting spontaneous labor. This included 42 patients
      rendering the study largely underpowered. There was a trend towards decreased length of
      hospital stay and earlier time to full enteral feeding in the early delivery group, but this
      did not reach statistical significance.

      Standard delivery times for uncomplicated gastroschisis are between 34 and 39 weeks
      gestation. As the current available literature does not adequately answer the question of
      optimal gestational age of delivery in patients with gastroschisis, the objective of this
      study is to investigate the hypothesis that delivery at 35 0/7 - 35 6/7 weeks in stable
      patients with gastroschisis is superior to observation and expectant management with a goal
      of delivery at 38 0/7 - 38 6/7 weeks. To test this hypothesis, we will complete a randomized,
      prospective, multi-institutional trial. Patients may be enrolled in the study any time prior
      to 33 weeks, but will be randomized at 33 weeks to delivery at 35 weeks or observation with a
      goal of 38 weeks. The primary composite outcome will include stillbirth, neonatal death prior
      to discharge, respiratory morbidity, and need for parenteral nutrition at 30 days. Secondary
      maternal outcomes include need and indication for cesarean section, whether the patient
      required induction of labor or had spontaneous labor, and values of antenatal testing
      including amniotic fluid index (AFI), bowel diameter, and estimated fetal weight. Secondary
      neonatal outcomes include differences in birth weight, need for respiratory support
      independent of the operating room, gastroschisis bowel prognostic score, intestinal atresia,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, central venous catheter days, length of respiratory support, need
      for caffeine, bacteremia, discharge weight, and length of stay.
