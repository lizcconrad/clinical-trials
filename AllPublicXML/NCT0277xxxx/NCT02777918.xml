  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an intervention study, aiming to increase protein intake, by increasing egg
      consumption in community dwelling older adults aged 55 years and over, by providing recipes
      to increase flavour and variety in egg dishes.

      Individuals will be randomized to either receive the intervention or to a control group,
      where the intervention group will receive 6 recipes every two weeks for a 12 week period, and
      at the start, after 12 weeks and after 6 months egg intake, protein intake, body protein
      status, and various functional measures of muscle function will be assessed in both
      intervention and control group.
