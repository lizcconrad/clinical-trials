      The purpose of this study was to evaluate that the tranexamic acid (TXA)Intravenous and oral,
      is equivalent oxytocin (OXY),intramuscularly, in reducing the blood loss in post partum
      period (mL) in patients at the end of pregnancy ( 37-42 w ) at low risk of post partum
      hemorrhage (PPH). The PPH means a blood loss equal to or greater than 500 ml after a vaginal
      delivery (the bleeding is defined severe if it exceeds 1000 mL). PPH is called &quot;primary&quot; when
      blood loss arose within 24 hours after birth.

      This trial includes three arms of treatment :

        -  arm A (IMP1Test): TXA 500 mg/ 2 vials (1 gr) slow intravenous infusion 1ml/min within 5
           minutes from the delivery(third stage af labor)

        -  arm B (IMP2Control): OXY 5 IU/ml/ 2 vials (10 International Unit) intramuscularly within
           5 minutes from the delivery (third stage af labor) The clamping of the umbilical cord
           will be executed immediately after birth.

      The randomization 1:1 (block design), generated by the computer.

      Primary outcomes: assessment of total blood loss expressed in mL:

        -  immediately after delivery

        -  two hours after delivery

      The measurement of the overall blood loss at delivery (ml) will be performed by the graduated
      bag, immediately after birth.

      The measurement two hours after delivery will be performed by weighing of the adsorbent
      material [ N.ml = N. gr indicated by the balance - dry weight of the sanitary napkin]. The
      overall loss in blood measured (ml) two hours of delivery will then be performed by adding
      the two collections.
