    <textblock>
      Bedside ultrasound in the emergency department is useful for quick assessments of patients.
      One growing use is to measure the optic nerve sheath diameter of patients for whom increased
      pressure in the head is a concern. This study will look at the optic nerve sheath diameters
      of a specific population of pediatric patients with shunts that drain extra fluid from their
      heads.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The particular interest of this study is the use of ultrasound to evaluate a child's optic
      nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), or the size of the covering around the nerve behind the eye.
      This covering expands when there is a higher than normal pressure inside the head. The group
      of interest on which this study focuses is the children with cerebrospinal shunts that drain
      extra fluid from their heads to other parts of the body (abdomen, heart, lungs) because the
      brain cannot drain all of the fluid like normal. When these shunts malfunction or fail, this
      can cause a backup of fluid in the brain, and raise the intracranial pressure (ICP) inside
      the skull. Depending on the degree of pressure buildup, this can be a surgical emergency due
      to pressure on the brain. Currently, computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans are used to diagnose the condition, but a quick screening tool, such as
      use of ultrasound to screen for elevated ICP in the emergency department, would be of great
      benefit to the patients to expedite care. Previous studies have explored the use of bedside
      ultrasound to evaluate the optic nerve sheath diameter in children with shunts. However, to
      date, there have been no reported prospective observational studies that compared before and
      after ultrasound measurements of the ONSD in patients in whom shunt failure is diagnosed and
      treated. Of note, this study is observational and the measurements taken with the ultrasound
      machine will not be used for clinical decision making. The measurements in this study will
      have no clinical impact on patient care. The use of ultrasound to measure the ONSD is an
      already accepted application of ultrasound.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the initial and final optic nerve sheath diameters measured by ultrasound in patients who are admitted for shunt failure</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will have their ONSD measured by ultrasound in the emergency department or immediately after admission. After they either receive antibiotics or shunt revision surgery, and are no longer symptomatic from shunt failure, their ONSD will be measured again and compared to the initial measurement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Compare the optic nerve sheath diameter measurements of asymptomatic patients vs symptomatic patients who are not diagnosed with shunt failure vs those are diagnosed with shunt failure and admitted.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ONSD will be measured for all pediatric patients with CSF shunts who come to the emergency department, and then the average measurements of each group will be compared to the other two groups to evaluate if there are significant differences in the measurements.</description>

    <description>Group of patients with CSF shunts who are evaluated for concerns of shunt malfunction or failure, but either have shunt failure ruled out, or are felt to be safe for discharge to home. They are not admitted to the hospital. The optic nerve sheath diameter of these patients will be measured once in the emergency department.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Symptomatic, Admitted</arm_group_label>
    <description>Group of patients with CSF shunts who are evaluated for concerns of shunt malfunction or failure, and then are admitted to the hospital secondary to these concerns. The optic nerve sheath diameter of these patients will be measured once in the emergency department or as close to admission as possible, and then measured again while they are still inpatient, but after they have an intervention performed (medical or surgical) to relieve their shunt malfunction or failure. These patients will have their initial optic nerve sheath diameters compared to the other two populations, but they will also have their initial and final optic nerve sheath diameters compared to each other.</description>
