  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of resistance exercise and training on
      cardiovascular function of peripheral artery disease patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that strength training can promote important benefits for the
      cardiovascular system in healthy subjects and patients with chronic diseases. However, the
      effects of resistance exercise on cardiovascular function in intermittent claudication
      patients are unclear. In addition, it also do not know the chronic effects on cardiovascular
      function in these patients.
