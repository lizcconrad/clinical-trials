  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complications in patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts are common. Thus, these
      patients are frequently admitted for suspicion of a shunt dysfunction (SD). However, the
      symptoms of a SD are often unspecific and the required diagnostics are time consuming,
      expensive, invasive and may involve radiation exposure. In a prospective observational study
      it is planned to find out, how often a suspected shunt dysfunction is found, which kinds of
      shunt dysfunction are seen and if there is a correlation between the shunt dysfunctions and
      the age of the shunt. Furthermore, it is intended to find out, if there are symptom-patterns
      specific for certain shunt dysfunctions.

      All patients who are admitted for suspected shunt-dysfunction will be included. Patient data,
      detailed data about the shunt, patient's symptoms and all findings will be recorded in the
      CRF. After 4-8 weeks all patients will be followed-up to add missing data and correct initial
      findings with the benefit of a retrospective view. After 2 years, data will be analyzed.

    <description>Certain kinds of shunt dysfunctions seem to appear at a certain &quot;age&quot; of a shunt. The time after implantation/last revision of the shunt is recorded. The age of the shunt / time span after first implantation is measured in months.</description>
