  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether cerebral oxygen saturation is
      associated with an increase of NPOBC in pediatric patients undergoing major surgery.

    <textblock>
      This prospective and observational study involved consecutive patients aged between 2 and 12
      years undergoing a major surgery using general anesthesia. Cerebral oxygen saturation,
      non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and heart rate were recorded at the following
      stages of the surgical intervention: baseline, induction, intubation, surgical incision, end
      of surgery, and extubation. Preoperative anxiety was evaluated by using the modified Yale
      Preoperative Anxiety Scale, and NPOBC was determined by using the Post-Hospital Behaviour
      Questionnaire on 7th and 28th postoperative days. A logistic regression was created to
      identify factors associated with the development of NPOBC

    <description>Children undergoing urological surgery also required of locoregional blockade. Anesthetic induction was achieved with high concentration sevoflurane 6-8% (Sevorane®, Abbvie) and oxygen 50%. Anesthetic maintenance was done with sevoflurane 2-3%, 50% O2/air mixture, fentanyl 1 µg.kg.-1 iv, and rocuronium 0.3 µg.kg.-1 iv if required. Electrocardiogram (ECG), non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide and cerebral NIRS oximetry was monitoring by using an INVOSTM5100 (Somanetics Corporation, Troy, MI, USA).</description>
