  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional Neglect (NE) is a form of abuse to the child whose prevalence is high (WHO Europe).
      Experiencing NE, psycho-emotional development and brain child may be impacted generating
      psychic suffering signs may progress to severe developmental disorders. The recognition of
      suffering can prevent and treat these disorders.

      This research promotes a multi-professional device, centered on observation, collection of
      expression of the baby's psychic pain (≤ 2 years) living in vulnerable families. The
      investigators assume that this collection requires the crossing of looks of a child
      psychiatrist and a repeated observation at home by a trained nurse.

      The two devices described in these two groups are devices set up as part of the routine
      management of these patients. Usually, depending on the means of structures (human and
      financial), one of these devices may be preferred over another.

    <description>Development Quotient level will be measured by Brunet Lezine R. This questionnaire provides an objective measure of the impact of mental suffering. It will be measured by psychomotor between the 3rd and 4th month follow up.
A child with a score of QD lower or equal 85 is considered a child with developmental impairment.
- Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale suitable for measuring the assessment of mental suffering of children less than two years is considered an indicator of the intensity of suffering. This will be assessed by a nurse between the 3rd and 4th months of follow up.
A child with a CGI-severity score between 1 and 4 inclusive shall be considered a child with developmental impairment.</description>
