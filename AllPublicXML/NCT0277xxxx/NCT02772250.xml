      The study compares the efficacy of bowel preparation between the face-to-face
      re-education(FFRE group) and normal education (no-FFRE group) in patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in bowel preparation methods,bowel preparation is inadequate in up to
      one-third of all colonoscopies in reported series.Inadequate bowel cleansing results in
      negative consequences for the examination, including incomplete visualisation of the colon,
      missed lesions, procedural difficulties, prolonged procedure time and reduced time interval
      until follow-up, and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy cost.

      The adequacy of a bowel preparation is closely linked to patient compliance with both dietary
      and purge instructions.One study performed in Asia showed that non-compliance with bowel
      preparation instructions, lower education level, and a long wait for the colonoscopy
      appointment were independent risk factors for poor bowel preparation. Another study performed
      in China showed that telephone re-education（TRE) about the details of bowel preparation on
      the day before colonoscopy significantly improved the quality of bowel preparation and PDR.
      So,it is reasonable to hypothesise that efforts to improve education and maximise patient
      compliance during the preparatory period will enhance the efficacy of bowel preparation.

      The study compares the efficacy of bowel preparation between the face-to-face re-education
      (FFRE group) and telephone re-education (TRE group) in patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adequate bowel preparation quality at the time of colonoscopy defined by Boston Bowel Preparation Scale rating scores≥6 among 2 groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an established rating scale to evaluate the quality of bowel prep. The ratings will be compared among the 2 groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of compliance with instructions among 2 groups</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance was scored on a 3-grade scale based on the intake of bowel solution: 0 = optimal (intake of 100% of the solution); 1 = good (intake of ≥75% of the solution); 2 = poor (intake of &lt;75% of the solution).</description>

    <measure>Willingness to repeat bowel preparation among 2 groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The willingness to repeat the same bowel preparation,a patient's subjective evaluation of the bowel preparation was recorded by a questionnaire</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Polyp detection rate among 2 groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Polyp detection rate was defined as the proportion of patients with at least one polyp.</description>
