    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of cancer detection when
      MIRA technology is combined with mammography, by evaluating the area under the ROC curve
      (AUC) of mammography vs. mammography plus MIRA. This evaluation will be done in a Reader
      Study on a subset of women with histology confirmed cancer and healthy women with dense
      breast.
