      This mentored student research project is funded by the Graduate Research Partnership Program
      with a projected timeline for data collection in the summer of 2015. Previous research has
      shown that language experience alters the way the human brain processes speech information.
      This phenomenon takes place very early in life and is referred to as Native Language Neural
      Commitment. For instance, as the Japanese language does not have the l-r speech sound
      contrast, Japanese infants start to show difficulty in hearing differences between the
      English l and r sounds at 12 months of age but not when they were at 6 months old. Learning
      the l-r distinction later in life proves to be very difficult for the Japanese school
      students and adults. Brain imaging studies have further revealed specific brain regions that
      are changed by language learning. But the evidence in support of the Native Language Neural
      Commitment theory is based on cortical-level measures. The proposed study extends the
      measurement to the subcortical level at the brainstem. The target language that the
      investigators are interested in studying is Mandarin Chinese, which is known for its use of
      lexical tones to express different words. For instance, the Chinese syllable &quot;ma&quot; means
      &quot;mother&quot; when it is spoken with a flat tone, and it means &quot;hemp&quot; when spoken with a rising
      tone. English, by contrast, does not employ lexical tones, and it is considered a non-tonal
      language. Does the Chinese learning experience fundamental change the way that pitch
      information is coded in the human brain? Does it happen at both cortical and subcortical
      levels? Previous research has shown evidence for a positive answer to both questions. But the
      direct evidence for brain-behavior correlations at the subcortical level is still missing.

      The proposed cross-language study will test Chinese-speaking and English-speaking adults to
      investigate Native Language Neural Commitment at the subcortical level. The investigators are
      interested in differences in the two subject populations by examining the relationship
      between brainstem pitch tracking and behavioral pitch perception in linguistic and
      nonlinguistic stimuli.

      The results of the proposed project will contribute to the understanding the role of the
      subcortical brainstem in Native Language Neural Commitment, which have significant
      implications for the development of auditory/speech training programs and assessment tools
      utilizing the brainstem frequency following measure to monitor progress in second language
      learning and test clinical populations.

    <description>EEG signals to pitch changes in speech and nonspeech sounds are analyzed to obtain the brainstem frequency following responses (FFRs). Autocorrelation method will be applied to the FFRs to quantify each participant's brainstem pitch strength. Higher average autocorrelation value indicates greater pitch strength. This EEG measure is to see whether tonal-language speakers and nontonal language speakers differ in brainstem encoding of pitch information.</description>

    <description>This behavioral measure in terms of syllable perception is to test whether syllabic perception is influenced by pitch information and whether tonal-language speakers' sensitivity towards pitch differences would affect the speech perception differently.</description>

    <description>Strength of stimulus-to-response correlation will assessed. Higher correlation coefficient between the fundamental frequency of the stimulus and that of the FFR response will indicate greater accuracy of the brainstem pitch tracking.
