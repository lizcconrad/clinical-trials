  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are planning a single center pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the
      potential of a Cytoadsorbant filter (Cytosorb®, Germany) to remove cytokines from the blood
      during cardiac surgery.

      Investigators will screen all patients undergoing cardiac surgery and approach those deemed
      at risk of post surgical complications [≥ 1 among: age &gt;75 years old, double valvular
      replacement, complex surgery with expected CPB time &gt;100 min, redo cardiac surgery, pre-op
      chronic renal failure (plasma creatinine level &gt;120 mcmol/l) or chronic heart failure (LVEF
      &lt;35%)].

      Patients with end-stage renal disease (dialysis dependence), undergoing an emergency
      procedure or an off-pump procedure, those who decline informed consent as well as those
      enrolled in another conflicting study will be excluded.

      Eligible patients will be approached, consented and enrolled in the trial. Patients will then
      be randomized to either receive conventional CPB (control arm) or CPB plus Cytosorb
      (intervention arm). The target population is 30 patients (15 per arm).

      For this pilot study, investigators main outcome will be differences between the two arms in
      measurement of serum levels for IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF alpha at baseline
      (pre-operatively), on ICU admission, as well as 6 and 24 hrs post CPB.

      Secondary outcomes will be changes in coagulation factors serum levels, the need for
      vasopressors, inotropes, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy, ICU and
      hospital length of stay as well as in-hospital mortality.

      Recruitment period should span from May 2016 to April 2017.
