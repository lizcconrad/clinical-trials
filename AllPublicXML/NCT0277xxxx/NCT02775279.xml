  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compelling epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations length of telomere, are
      associated with the initiation and development of ischemic heart disease. This study was
      undertaken to investigate whether mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood leukocyte could be
      used as a risk predictor for acute coronary syndrome.

    <time_frame>From date of percutaneous coronary intervention until the date of discharging from hospital, assessed up to 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>the ratio of telomere repeat copy number(T) to the hemoglobin(HGB) copy number (S) was determined for each sample using standard curves. The derived T/S ratio was proportional to the relative telomere length(RTL). In the second step, the T/S ratio of each sample was normalized to a calibrator DNA to standardize between different PCR runs. The calibrated T/S ratio was then used as the measurement of RTL in this study.</description>

      Telomeres consist of a tandem TTAGG repeat located at ends of linear chromosomes of eukaryote
      cells that often decrease in length over time (largely due to oxidative damage and the end
      replication problem during cell division) and may trigger cellular senescence once telomere
      become critically short
