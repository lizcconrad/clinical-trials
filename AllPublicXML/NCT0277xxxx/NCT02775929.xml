  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine user preferences for antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) for HIV-1 infected partners and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) HIV-1 un-infected
      partners and to optimize targeted delivery and sustained use of these interventions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, prospective cohort study of higher-risk HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in order
      to determine barriers and facilitators to uptake and sustained adherence to ART for HIV-1
      infected partners and daily oral PrEP for HIV-1 uninfected partners. The investigators
      developed a risk score tool to identify couples at highest risk for HIV-1 transmission. PrEP
      was offered as a 'bridge' to ART in the partnership - i.e., until ART initiation by the
      HIV-infected partner and for the first 6 months after ART is started; ART was recommended
      following national ART guidelines. A subset (up to 80 couples per site) was invited to
      participate in qualitative in-depth interview and focus group discussions.

    <measure>Ability to recruit high-risk HIV-1 serodiscordant couples: Costs of screening and targeting high-risk couples decide to enroll in the cohort.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>High-risk couples were defined by a validated risk scoring tool. The cost-effectiveness analysis will follow World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and report summary estimates for the PrEP intervention which allow comparison to other strategies to decrease HIV-1 transmission among serodiscordant couples. Costs of offering and delivering PrEP as a bridging strategy to ART, including recruitment costs for targeting higher-risk couples and PrEP delivery and monitoring costs will be collected. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per HIV related infection, death and Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted will be estimated. Results will be reported as the ICER of PrEP compared to current practice per incident HIV-1 case, HIV related death and DALY averted.</description>
