    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of hydrodilatation with hyaluronic acid
      under ultrasonographic guidance plus physical therapy (PT) with that of PT alone for treating
      adhesive capsulitis

    <measure>change in constant shoulder score</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4, 12 wk</time_frame>
    <description>the total constant score ranges from 0 to 100 points, with higher scores indicative of better function. The score is divided into four sections: pain, activity of daily living, ROM and strength</description>

    <time_frame>at 4, 12 wk</time_frame>
    <description>pain intensity was measured by visual analog scale.</description>

    <measure>change in Shoulder Pain And disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 wk</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.</description>
