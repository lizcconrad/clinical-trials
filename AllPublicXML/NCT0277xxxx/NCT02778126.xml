      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as LY2606368
      in participants with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
      This study will involve a single dose of ¹⁴C radiolabelled LY2606368. This means that a
      radioactive substance, carbon 14, will be incorporated into the study drug. This will provide
      information about the study drug and its breakdown products and will help determine how much
      passes from the blood into urine, feces and expired air. After a minimum 14-day washout
      period following the [¹⁴C] LY2606368 dose, participants will be allowed to receive continued
      access to LY2606368 as outpatients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a histological or cytological diagnosis of cancer (solid tumour), with clinical
             or radiologic evidence of locally advanced and/or metastatic disease, for which no
             life-prolonging therapy exists

          -  Have the presence of measurable and/or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the
             Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours

          -  Have Body Surface Area (BSA) greater than or equal to (≥)1.62 meter squared (m²) and
             less than or equal to (≤) 1.90 m²

          -  Have adequate organ function

          -  Have a performance status of ≤2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale

             permit the patient to complete 1 full cycle of treatment (beyond the initial
             [¹⁴C]LY2606368 dose)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug with an
             investigational product or non-approved use of a drug or device

          -  Have serious pre-existing medical conditions (left to the discretion of the
             investigator)

          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis (screening not
             required)

          -  Have current haematologic malignancies or acute or chronic leukaemia

          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection

          -  Have participated in a ¹⁴C (carbon) study within the last 6 months prior to screening
             for this study

          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor
             may affect the interpretation of results
