      Comparing the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting balloons (DEB) for the treatment of
      below-the-knee peripheral arterial occlusive disease with conventional balloon angioplasty
      (BA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has established its
      position in the treatment of below the knee arterial occlusive disease with intermittent
      claudication and/or critical limb ischemia. However, the efficacy of percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with conventional balloons, is limited by the high 12-month
      restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR) rates. Local delivery of newer
      anti-proliferative drug via drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) has recently shown promising results
      in the treatment of femoropopliteal disease, and in the BTK area, a reduction in 3-month
      binary restenosis has been observed compared with historical controls treated with PTA. Drug
      eluting balloon has three potential advantages: (1) homogenous drug transfer to the vessel
      wall; (2) highest drug concentrations at the vessel wall at the time of injury; and (3)
      absence of a stent or delivery polymer.

      This study sought to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of new drug
      (Paclitaxel)-eluting balloons (DEB) for the treatment of below the knee peripheral arterial
      disease.

    <description>In the DEB group, the guide wire will be passed through the occluded or stenosed lumen and the predilatation of the target lesion with standard balloon(s) will be performed before dilatation with a paclitaxel-eluting balloon of the diameter, at least about that of the pre-dilatation balloon (Arteryguard, Rientech, Dezhou, China). The drug eluting balloons will then be inflated according to the manufacturer recommendations. The patients will then be followed every six months for a year to compare its treatment efficacy and safety with that of conventional balloon angioplasty group.</description>
