  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two exercise programs in an interventional study for manual
      wheelchair users with spinal cord injury and shoulder pain. Subjects without spinal cord
      injury will also be enrolled to compare exercise approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that the biomechanically based exercise program will
      demonstrate greater muscle activation of targeted muscles, and reduced compression risk to
      the rotator cuff tendons.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Persons with paraplegia at least 1 year post SCI. Prior to this time patients are
             still adjusting to independent function with manual wheelchairs as their primary means
             of mobility. This criteria ensures the subjects have had sufficient exposure to the
             functional demands associated with their condition.

          2. Age 21 to 60 years old; below age 21, particularly in males, the humeral growth plate
             may not have fully closed. Including subjects above this age ensures skeletal
             maturity. After age 60, even in able-bodied individuals, substantial degenerative
             changes can begin to occur in the shoulder joint.

          3. Use of a manual wheelchair as the primary means of mobility (&gt; 50% time). This is the
             population with most risk of development of shoulder pain and associated secondary
             complications.

          4. A history of unilateral or bilateral shoulder pain that interferes with at least one
             functional task. Symptoms localized to the proximal anterior, lateral, or posterior
             glenohumeral (shoulder joint) region are required. Rotator cuff tendinopathy and
             &quot;impingement&quot; syndromes involve localized pain in this region. More diffuse symptoms
             are consistent with combined shoulder/neck syndromes or radiating pain from cervical
             spine pathology.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to provide informed consent.

          2. Reproduction of shoulder pain, pain radiating down the upper extremity, numbness or
             tingling in the upper extremity, or other upper extremity symptoms during a cervical
             screening examination or thoracic outlet testing. This result would be indicative of
             primary cervical or thoracic outlet pathology.

          3. Shoulder pain of traumatic origin. Cumulative trauma disorders are of primary interest
             and most amenable to the proposed exercise interventions.

          4. History of shoulder surgery or dislocation.

          5. Recent history of fracture (within 1 year), hospitalization (within the past month),
             or cortisone injection to the shoulder (within 4 months). These conditions may
             interfere with safe or effective completion of the exercise intervention.

          6. A diagnosis or imaging findings of rheumatoid arthritis, end stage osteoarthritis,
             full thickness rotator cuff tear, adhesive capsulitis, or complex regional pain
             syndrome. These subjects may have joint disease progression that is severe, or not
             appropriately treated with a stretching and strengthening intervention.

          7. Diagnosed major depression, alcohol or substance abuse, or other serious medical
             conditions. These conditions may prevent subjects from regularly completing the
             exercise intervention

        All criteria apply to both groups excepting manual wheelchair use and SCI criteria not
        applicable to the able bodied subject group.
