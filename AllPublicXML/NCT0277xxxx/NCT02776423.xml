  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral injection using polyacrylamide hydrogel (Bulkamid®, Contura A/S, Denmark) is an
      established treatment for stress urinary incontinence. The rates of women reporting
      improvement or cure after Bulkamid injection for stress urinary incontinence range between
      64-77% with a very low morbidity. However, the indications for use are unclear. Although
      transurethral polyacrylamide hydrogel injection is inferior to midurethral slings with regard
      to expected cure rates, the procedure is associated with very low rates of adverse events in
      general and serious adverse event in particular. As such, it may be an important alternative
      for patients where surgery is not considered a safe option either because of co-morbidity or
      because of complicated incontinence. The investigators performed a prospective study to
      determine the effects of transurethral polyacrylamide hydrogel injection in patients
      considered ineligible for midurethral sling surgery.

      In this prospective observational study the investigators included female patients who
      received treatment with transurethral polyacrylamide hydrogel injection (Bulkamid®). Patients
      were considered ineligible for surgery based on significant co-morbidity, one or more
      previously failed invasive treatments, complex urinary incontinence, or previous pelvic
      radiation therapy. At the baseline visit patients underwent a routine gynecological exam
      including pelvic ultrasonography. Patients completed validated questionnaires at the baseline
      visit and follow-up for evaluation of subjective treatment success. At baseline, women were
      asked to self-report any concomitant diseases or health conditions which were noted in the
      patient records together with a standard gynecological, urological and general health
      history. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 2 and 6 months after first injection at which
      time a second injection was administered at patients' discretion.

    <description>The procedure was standardized, identical for all patients, and entirely performed in an outpatient setting. All injections were performed by a single urogynecologist. Before injection all patients received a single dose trimethoprim (Idotrim®, Orion Pharma). The patient was placed in a supine position and given intraurethral topical 2% lidocaine hydrochloride gel (Xylocain®, Astra Zeneca) for anesthetic. Using a video-urethroscope and a 23-gauge needle, polyacrylamide hydrogel deposits of 0.3-0.4 mL were injected at 12, 4 and 8 o´clock into the submucosa approximately 1 cm from the bladder neck. Patients were discharged after successful voiding.</description>

        In this prospective observational study we included 81 female patients who received

        considered ineligible for surgery based on significant co-morbidity, one or more previously
        failed invasive treatments, complex urinary incontinence, or previous pelvic radiation
        therapy.
