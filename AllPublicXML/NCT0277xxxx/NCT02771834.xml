      The incidence of osteoporosis has been increasing, as have fractures resulting from falls.

      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate bipodal postural balance in postmenopausal
      women with and without lumbar osteoporosis. The specific objective is to determine the
      relationship between the degree of thoracic kyphosis and dosing of 25 OH vitamin D with
      postural balance in postmenopausal women with lumbar osteoporosis.

      One hundred and twenty-six postmenopausal women between 55-65 years of age were evaluated and
      separated into two groups according to the bone mineral density values of their lumbar spine:
      the osteoporosis group and the control group.

      Functional mobility was evaluated through the Timed Up and Go Test. Postural balance was
      evaluated using a AccuSway® model portable force platform, in standard standing position,
      with eyes open and closed, for 60&quot;. Data were collected, stored, and processed by the Balance
      Clinic® program, configured to 100 Hz frequency, with a frequency cut-off filter at 10 Hz.

      Muscle strength was evaluated via a Biodex® isokinetic dynamometer in the
      concentric/concentric knee extension mode at 60o/s.

      Dosing of 25 OH vitamin D and thoracic spine x-rays to determine the degree of kyphosis
      measured by the Cobb angle were performed in the osteoporosis group.
