  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparative, exploratory study
      to evaluate the effect of trelagliptin administered at a dose of 100 mg once weekly or
      alogliptin administered at a dose of 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks on glycemic variation in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of trelagliptin administered orally at a
      dose of 100 mg once weekly or alogliptin administered orally at a dose of 25 mg once daily
      for 4 weeks on glycemic variation in an exploratory manner and as preliminary to examine the
      influence of the once-weekly administration and blood glucose fluctuations due to the
      difference in the daily administration in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
