  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
      anticoagulation self-monitoring coupled with an educational intervention in a minority
      underserved population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite favorable results and enhanced patient convenience, the adoption of patient
      self-monitoring for anticoagulation therapy has been limited primarily to non-minority and
      higher socioeconomic status individuals. While effectiveness has been studied, the factors
      influencing the adoption of self-monitoring of anticoagulation in minorities with the most
      barriers to accessing quality care in specialized clinics, are not known.

      Hypothesis: Patient centered education and training intervention for minority patients will
      result in effective adoption of self-monitoring of anticoagulation therapy, resulting in
      anticoagulation control of comparable quality to that seen in specialized anticoagulation
      clinic-based monitoring.

      The research objective of this proposal will be accomplished through 3 specific aims:

        1. Identify patient and provider factors that influence adoption of anticoagulation
           self-monitoring in a minority population.

        2. Adapt and refine an education intervention that both addresses identified barriers and
           emphasizes identified positive influences to anticoagulation self-monitoring.

        3. Demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of anticoagulation self-monitoring coupled
           with an educational intervention in a minority population.

    <description>TTR will be calculated for each patient using the linear interpolation method. This method has been associated with clinical outcomes such as risk for thromboembolic events, and thus was selected over other methods of expressing the TTR such as fraction of International Normalized Ratio (INR) in range and cross-section of files</description>

    <measure>Anticoagulation Related Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, Month 7</time_frame>

Anticoagulation Clinic (control): subjects will have their INR tested in clinic monthly (or more frequently if clinically indicated) via the Coaguchek® point-of-care device (which is the standard of care in the Anticoagulation Clinic) and receive dosing instructions and standardized education related to warfarin by a clinical pharmacist who provides care in the Anticoagulation Clinic.</description>

Patient Self-Monitoring (intervention): entails 3 education sessions of 90-120 minutes each (week 0, week 2, week 4): 2 provided on site in clinic and 1 in the patient's home, during which, self-testing competency and barriers and facilitators to self-monitoring will be evaluated. Subjects will follow with weekly (or sooner, if clinically indicated) in-home self-monitoring and follow-up weekly phone calls over 6 months by clinical pharmacists to guide warfarin dosing and reinforce key educational messages.</description>
