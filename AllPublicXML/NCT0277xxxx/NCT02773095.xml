  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Countries throughout the world are facing a growing non-communicable disease (NCD) burden. In
      developing countries, medicines to treat NCDs are often difficult to access or too expensive
      for many households. Novartis/Sandoz has recently launched Novartis Access, an initiative to
      subsidize a basket of NCD medicines sold to purchasers in program countries and delivered
      through the public and non-profit health sectors. This study will evaluate the impact of
      Novartis Access on the availability and price of NCD medicines at health facilities and
      households in Kenya, the first country to receive the program.

      Participants, interventions, and outcomes: Eight counties have been non-randomly selected for
      inclusion in the study. Initially, Novartis Access medicines will be sold solely to the
      Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS), the main supplier for the large network of
      private (often faith-based) non-profit health facilities in the country, and also a key
      supplier for public facilities in several counties. Of the 47 total counties in Kenya, 17
      counties were excluded because they do not purchase medicines from MEDS, and an additional 15
      counties were excluded that had not purchased at least 10 million KES worth of medicines
      through MEDS in the previous year. Three counties were excluded due to security concerns, and
      four additional counties were excluded to eliminate shared borders in the final sample, to
      minimize the risk of contamination between intervention and control counties. When
      considering counties with shared borders, those with the lower volume of MEDS purchases in
      the previous year were excluded.

      In Kenya, NCD services are provided in the public and private non-profit sectors at level 2
      dispensaries up through level 6 hospitals. Not all counties have a level 6 hospital, and for
      this reason they are excluded from the study. Counties have on average: five public and
      private non-profit level 5 county referral hospitals; three public level 4 sub-county
      hospitals; 15 public and private non-profit level 3 health centers; and 85 public and private
      non-profit level 2 dispensaries. All 184 eligible level 3-5 facilities will be included in
      the study, and 200 level 2 dispensaries will be randomly selected for inclusion. For each
      facility included in the study, one private drug seller identified as the main alternative
      for that facility will be identified and included. Private drug sellers include pharmacies,
      drug stores, and dispensing doctors.

      A total sample of 800 households will be randomly selected from the eight study counties (400
      from Novartis Access counties; 400 from control counties) using a two-stage sampling
      procedure. In the first stage, 10 enumeration areas (EAs) will be selected in each county
      with probability proportional to size based on data from the most recent census. Then, in the
      second stage, 10 eligible households will be randomly selected in each EA and recruited into
      the study. All households in the EA will be listed in a random order, and enumerators will
      proceed down the list until 10 eligible households are identified. Households will be
      eligible if at least one member at least 18 years old has been previously diagnosed and
      prescribed medicine for NCDs addressed by Novartis Access, including diabetes, hypertension,
      breast cancer, and asthma. All members of the household who fit that criterion will be
      recruited for the study. Based on the prevalence of the relevant NCD conditions in Kenya, 20%
      of all households will meet the inclusion criterion.

      In intervention counties, public and private non-profit health facilities will be allowed to
      purchase subsidized Novartis Access NCD medicines through MEDS. The Novartis Access portfolio
      includes 15 medicines to treat diabetes, hypertension, breast cancer, and asthma. While the
      portfolio includes patented medicines usually marketed and sold under the Novartis brand and
      generics under the Sandoz brand, all medicines sold through the initiative will be packaged
      with the new Novartis Access brand. The medicines will be sold directly to MEDS at an average
      cost of 150 Kenyan Shillings (KES), around US$1.50, per monthly dose. Facility-level
      administrative data on NCD medicine purchases obtained from MEDS will be used to monitor the
      implementation of the intervention.

      The primary outcomes of interest are medicine availability and price at health facilities,
      and medicine availability, price, and expenditures at patients' households. Availability at
      facilities is defined as the proportion of Novartis Access medicines and equivalents in stock
      on the day of data collection. Availability at households is defined as the proportion of
      prescribed Novartis Access medicines and equivalents in the home on the day of data
      collection. The price of NCD medicines sold by private for-profit drug sellers is an
      important secondary outcome. Patient perceptions of NCD medicine access will also be
      explored. Data will be collected at facilities and households using a structured
      questionnaire at baseline prior to the implementation of Novartis Access, at midline after
      one year, and at end line after two years. At each of these interviews, a subsample of
      facilities and households will also be administered a qualitative interview. Additional data
      will be collected quarterly from facilities and a randomly selected subsample of households
      using a structured questionnaire administered over the phone.

      The study is powered to detect a 10 percentage point increase in household availability of
      medicines due to Novartis Access at Î± = 0.05, assuming an intracluster correlation
      coefficient of 0.05, 10% loss to follow-up, and a proportion available in the control group
      of 33%.

      Assignment of the intervention: In Kenya, county health offices are responsible for bulk
      purchasing of medicines for their health facilities, allowing for random allocation of
      Novartis Access at the county-level. The eight counties selected for inclusion in the trial
      will be randomized to the intervention or control group using a covariate constrained
      randomization method to maximize balance on nine demographic and health variables: total
      population; population density; proportion of the population in urban areas; poverty rate;
      number of health facilities; physicians per capita; health spending per capita; overall value
      ordered through MEDS in previous year; and proportion of value ordered through MEDS in
      previous year by private non-profit versus public health facilities. Allocation will be
      masked from data collectors. However, it will not be possible to mask the intervention from
      participants.

      Data collection, management, and analysis: Data will be collected from health facilities and
      households at baseline, midline, and end line using a structured questionnaire. The health
      facility questionnaire has been adapted from an instrument developed by the World Health
      Organization and Health Action International and previously used in Kenya, and captures
      information on medicine availability and medicine price. The household questionnaire includes
      information on demographics, household assets, and key information on medicines, including
      whether prescribed NCD medicines are currently at the home, locations where medicines are
      most often purchased, prices paid, and overall household expenditures on medicines (and on
      other goods).

      A subsample of health facilities and subsample of households will also be administered a
      qualitative interview during baseline, midline, and end line visits. A purposeful subsample
      of five level 2 dispensaries and five level 3-5 facilities will be selected in each county
      (80 facilities in total), and one staff member will be randomly selected for the interview. A
      purposeful subsample of 10 households in each county (80 households in total) will be
      selected for qualitative interviews, which will be administered to one individual in the
      household who also completes the general household survey. Facilities and households will be
      selected for qualitative interviews to maximize variation in the viewpoints represented. The
      qualitative instrument has been designed to explore in depth key issues related to medicine
      access.

      Surveillance data will be collected quarterly from all health facilities and a subsample of
      households. For health facility surveillance, a shortened version of the structured
      questionnaire with basic information on medicine availability and price will be administered
      over the phone each month to a rotating one-third sample of health facilities, such that all
      facilities are surveilled once per quarter. For household surveillance, a random sample of
      half of all study households will be selected; half of study households will not be
      surveilled at all, to allow for an analysis of the potential effect of surveillance on
      household behavior. Those households selected for surveillance will be administered a
      shortened version of the structured questionnaire with basic information on medicine
      availability and price over the phone. As with health facilities, a rotating one-third sample
      of households selected for surveillance will be surveyed by phone each month, such that all
      surveilled households are surveyed once per quarter. A 5% subsample of surveilled health
      facilities and households will be visited in person to audit phone responses.

      Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) will be a partner on the study and will manage research
      fieldwork. IPA specializes in the design and implementation of randomized controlled trials
      to test policy interventions in developing country settings, and has partnered on several
      rigorous evaluations in Kenya in recent years. Data will be collected electronically using
      SurveyCTO software on tablets and managed using Microsoft Access software.

      Data on baseline characteristics of health facilities and households will be compared across
      groups to assess balance. Impacts of Novartis Access will be estimated using intention to
      treat analysis. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) methods will be used to control for potential
      baseline differences between groups. All analyses will be conducted using Stata statistical
      software.
