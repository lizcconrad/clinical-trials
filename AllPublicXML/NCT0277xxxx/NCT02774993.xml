  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary cavitation, a hallmark of tuberculosis (TB), is the site of high mycobacterial
      burden leading to disease transmission. The cause of tissue destruction leading to cavitation
      in TB is primarily due to the host inflammatory response. A matrix degrading phenotype
      develops in TB, in which the activity of host proteolytic enzymes, specifically matrix
      metalloproteinases (MMPs) is unopposed by their specific Tissue Inhibitors of
      Metalloproteinases (TIMPs), thus driving tissue destruction and cavitation in TB. This tissue
      destruction causes morbidity and mortality. MMP inhibition with doxycycline has shown to
      improve lung function in patients with chronic lung diseases but its use in TB is unclear.

      We hypothesise that the MMP inhibitor doxycycline will reduce tissue destruction in human
      pulmonary tuberculosis.

      Specific aims:

        -  To investigate the MMP and TIMP secretion and gene expression in M. tuberculosis (M.tb)
           - infected primary neutrophils and monocytes from healthy volunteers taking doxycycline.

        -  To investigate the intracellular signaling pathways modulated by doxycycline

        -  To investigate the effects doxycycline has on biological markers of tissue destruction
           in TB patients

        -  To assess the tolerability and side effects of doxycycline with concurrent standard TB
           therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All TB patients are to keep to their standard anti-tuberculous treatment. A standardized
      questionnaire of symptoms, side-effects and weight shall be recorded. Induced sputum and
      plasma samples from all TB patients shall be analysed for MMPs and TIMPs before and after the
      administration of doxycycline for two weeks. In addition, neutrophils and mononuclear cells
      from TB patients and these shall be stimulated with live, virulent M. tuberculosis in a
      Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. The supernatants from these cells shall be analysed for MMPs
      and TIMPs.

      Healthy volunteers shall be recruited and administered doxycycline for 2 weeks. Neutrophils
      and mononuclear cells will be isolated from blood prior to treatment, at weeks 2 and 8 and
      infected with M.tb. Cell culture supernatants and nucleic acids will be harvested. MMP and
      TIMP expression will be analysed using luminex array and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
      Intracellular signaling pathways will be examined with a human phospho-kinase array. Matrix
      destruction will be assessed using collagen quantitative fluorescent assays.
