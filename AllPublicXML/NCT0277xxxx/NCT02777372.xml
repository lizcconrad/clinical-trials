  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that aims to evaluate the psychophysiology of premenstrual mood
      disorders (PMDs) at baseline and after treatment with sertraline. Participants will include
      women with PMDs and healthy male and female controls. Participation involves a baseline visit
      to determine eligibility and three study visits that include questionnaires and stress
      reactivity assessment via an acoustic startle paradigm, cortisol, and immune markers, as well
      as hormone and genetic measures. Female participants with PMDs will receive sertraline during
      the premenstrual phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among women with PMDD (premenstrual mood dysphoric disorder), baseline arousal is heightened
      during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle compared to the follicular phase, as measured
      by acoustic startle response (ASR). Healthy female controls do not show cyclic changes in
      this measure of physiologic arousal. It has been suggested that such heightened physiologic
      arousal during the luteal phase may be due to differences in neurosteroid modulation of
      GABA-A receptor function. Research indicates that women with premenstrual mood disorders
      (PMDs) may have sub-optimal sensitivity to the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone
      (ALLO), a GABA-A receptor modulator. In animal models, intracerebroventricular injection of
      corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) increases amplitude of the acoustic startle response,
      while ALLO administration attenuates this CRF-enhanced startle. CRF-enhanced startle is
      mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Thus, ALLO appears to impact the
      BNST and anxiety, versus the amygdala and acute fear. The proposed study will examine both
      anticipatory anxiety and cued fear at baseline and with SSRI treatment. The magnitude of the
      ASR with the former manipulation would reflect BNST activity which we hypothesize is
      dysregulated in women with PMDD. Secondary aims are to examine the impact of luteal phase
      treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) on psychophysiology in women
      with PMDs and to examine the relationship between affective symptoms, stress regulation and
      immune function among these women, as well as associations with hormone levels and genetic
      markers.

    <description>During the luteal phase vs the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle in women with PMDs, compared to luteal and follicular ASR in healthy female controls. The startle response will be measured using the eyeblink reflex, measured by recording activity from the orbicularis oculi muscle. Recording will be performed via two surface disk electrodes (Ag-AgCl) applied underneath the left eye; one in line with the pupil and one 1-2 cm lateral to the first one. For the primary outcome of baseline ASR magnitude over the menstrual cycle, peak amplitude of the blink reflex will be determined in the 20-120-ms time frame following stimulus onset relative to baseline (baseline is the average baseline EMG level for the 50 ms immediately preceding auditory stimulus onset).</description>
