      Background

      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are one of the most common sporting injuries of the
      knee. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has become one of the most common surgical procedures in an
      attempt to increase joint stability and facilitate athletes to return to sport (RTS).
      Although ACLR is considered a relatively successful procedure, dynamic control risk factors
      and strength and power deficits in the involved limb are still present after patients return
      to sport.

      Dynamic multi-plane, multi-joint actions such as jumping, landing, change of direction
      cutting, have been shown to be common mechanisms of injury for the ACL in field sports .
      Returning to multidirectional sports requires a proficiency and efficiency of movement when
      carrying out these tasks. There is a lack of standardized, objective criteria to accurately
      assess an athlete's ability to safely RTS. Therefore, there is a need for research that
      simultaneously analyses sport specific dynamic tasks (3D motion analysis) and muscular
      strength/power deficits that may explain poor outcomes following ACLR. This study aims to
      further investigate movement patterns, limb asymmetry and muscle strength deficit in patients
      post-surgery to identify risk factors for re-injury and criteria for RTS.

      The purpose of this study was to:

        1. Analyse kinematic (movement descriptors) and kinetic (forces that cause movement) during
           sports specific dynamic tasks at different time-points (6 and 9 months) following ACLR.

        2. To explore the association of those findings with those who re-injure, those who have
           persistent knee pain or with those who fail to return to sport.

        3. To compare the ACLR participants with age and gender matched healthy multidirectional
           athletes.

      It is hypothesised that biomechanical analysis will identify clear risk factors for poor
      outcomes following ACLR. Analysis of ACLR athletes' biomechanics during sports specific tasks
      will aid in the identification of athletes who are not yet ready to return to sport and will
      inform the clinician of what must be targeted in specific rehabilitation protocols before
      return to sport is considered.

      Brief protocol

      Participants will be recruited from patients who are scheduled to undergo anterior cruciate
      ligament reconstruction at the Sports Surgery Clinic, Ireland. Healthy participants will be
      recruited from local multidirectional teams. Participation will be voluntary and after
      obtaining informed consent patients will be asked to complete pre-operative questionnaires to
      ascertain injury information, and the function of their knee. During surgery the surgeon will
      fill out an intra-operative questionnaire. Items recorded will include graft type, laxity,
      involvement of other ligamentous structures, type of femoral and tibial fixation, meniscal or
      chondral pathology.

      Biomechanical assessment takes place at 6 and 9 months post surgery for the ACL group while
      the healthy participants will be tested on one occasion. The 3D testing session will include
      capturing of jumping, landing, hopping and cutting mechanics through the use of three
      dimensional motion capture technology and force plates. Here reflective markers are placed on
      the skin at anatomical landmarks. These markers are picked up by the infrared cameras and
      tracked at 200 frames per second. Participants will make contact with a force plate with
      their foot on undertaking the movements. Force and marker data will be combined to calculate
      joint angles and moments. Participants will also perform a muscle strength test using
      equipment called an isokinetic dynamometer. Both the operated and non-operated limbs will be
      tested.

      Participants will also be asked to fill out validated questionnaires to monitor self reported
      knee function, their confidence in their knee and also collect data on any continuing adverse
      symptoms such as locking, giving way, swelling or pain. Participants will also be asked if
      and when they return to sport. Questionnaires will be administered to participants at pre-op,
      3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months post operatively.

      3D Biomechanical testing involves the following progressive neuromuscular challenge tests:

        -  Single leg countermovement jump - Vertical jump as high as possible off one leg.

        -  Single leg drop jump- Hop from a 20cm height onto one leg and jump as high as possible
           with as little time spent on the ground

        -  Double leg drop jump- Hop from a 30cm height onto one leg and jump as high as possible
           with as little time spent on the ground

        -  Hurdle hop - Lateral hop over a 15cm hurdle followed by a hop back to the starting
           position and a hold for 2sec

        -  Single Leg Hop for distance - maximal jump for horizontal distance on one leg while
           sticking the landing

        -  Pre-planned change of direction cut - Sprint for 5 metres, make a 90 degree change of
           direction pre-determined by the tester and sprint for a further five meters to the
           finish

        -  Indecision cut - Sprint for five meters then react to a light stimulus and make a 90
           degree cut to the left or right for a further 1.5metres

      Patient Registry

      Patient data will be inputted into the Sports Surgery Clinic medical data management
      software. Captured data will include:

        1. Patient information - Date of Surgery, Surgeon, Side of ACLR, confirmative Magnetic
           Resonance Imaging

        2. Pre-Operative data collection

             -  Pre-Operative Questionnaire- Date of injury, Activity undertaking when injury
                occurred, level of sporting activity, Injury mechanism, limb dominance, previous
                ACL injury or surgery.

             -  Marx Activity Questionnaire.

             -  ACL return to sports after injury (RSI) questionnaire- measures the athlete's
                emotions, confidence in performance, and risk appraisal in relation to return to
                sport after an ACL injury.

        3. Intra-Op data collection

           - Operative notes are recorded in theatre using a standardised in theatre questionnaire.
           This form was developed under consensus with all surgeons who complete ACL
           reconstructive surgery at the Sports Surgery Clinic. Included are graft type, laxity,
           involvement of other ligamentous structures, type of femoral and tibial fixation,
           meniscal or chondral pathology.

        4. 6 Month and 9 months post op data collection

             -  Marx Activity Questionnaire

             -  ACL RSI

             -  International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form- The IKDC subjective form is
                a reliable and valid measure to monitor symptoms and function in daily living
                activities in those with knee disorders.

             -  Cincinnati Questionnaire - a valid and reliable measure of patient reported outcome
                after ACL injury

             -  Sports Surgery Clinic return to performance questionnaire- asks whether the
                participant has returned to sport, have they injured the operated knee or
                contralateral knee and asks whether they still experience pain and rate that pain
                on a numerical rating scale.

             -  3D test battery findings

        5. 12 and 24 months post op data collection

             -  Marx Activity Questionnaire

             -  ACL RSI

             -  IKDC

             -  Sports Surgery Clinic return to performance questionnaire

      Quality assurance plan

        -  Weekly cross-checking will be undertaken by two members of staff to ensure data entered
           onto the registry is correct and contemporaneous.

        -  A six-monthly audit of the registry will be undertaken by external auditors.

      Registry standard operating procedures

        -  Basic patient contact details are inputted by administration staff.

        -  Physiotherapists and biomechanists input physical examination findings on medical data
           software.

        -  Self-reported questionnaires are completed on site using a tablet device and uploaded
           automatically to the registry once the questionnaire is completed.

        -  During theatre, the surgeon fills out the standardised intra-operative form, which is
           uploaded to the registry following surgery.

        -  For analysis or auditing purposes, data is downloaded from the Sports Surgery Clinic
           medical data management software and placed into Microsoft excel. Patient names are
           de-identified.

      Sample size

        -  Suggested sample size = 1000

        -  Sample size calculation was carried out based on current numbers presenting to the
           clinic. Clinical numbers indicate a re-rupture rate of either the ipsilateral or
           contralateral ACL of 5%.

        -  This study aims to recruit 1000 participants and follow them over 24 months. With a
           likely re-rupture rate of 5%- it is hypothesized that 50 re-ruptures will occur over the
           24 month period. This is a conservative number allowing for dropouts, and a split
           between contralateral and ipsilateral ACL injuries, which will be analysed separately.

        -  It is also aimed to recruit 50 healthy volunteers from multidirectional field sports
           teams.

      Plan for missing data

        -  Checklist to flag missing data at the end of every week

        -  Participants with missing data may be excluded from the data analysis.

      Statistical analysis plan

        -  Variables of interest include kinematics, kinetics, power, and vertical ground-reaction
           force at the pelvis, hip, knee and ankle at specific time points during different
           jumping, landing and cutting manoeuvres.

        -  Differences between involved and uninvolved legs will be calculated, and used to assess
           for asymmetry. Two group comparisons will be conducted using the Student t test or
           Kruskal-Wallis test for normal and non-normally distributed variables, respectively.

        -  Multivariable logistic regression, using variables with P values of &lt;/=0.05 from 2-group
           comparisons (those who go on to suffer a 2nd ACL injury and those who don't), will be
           used to identify the most predictive variables of the second ACL injury.

        -  A multivariable logistic regression analysis will also be conducted to identify the most
           predictive variables of patient reported subjective knee function (IKDC) and pain.

        -  Associations between intra-operative findings and outcome measures of re-injury pain and
           return to sport will be explored, also using regression analysis.
