      POEM (Per-Oral endoscopic myotomy (creating a muscle [esophagus] opening), an incision-less
      (no cutting of the surface of the body) endoscopic procedure, is an effective non-surgical
      alternative to release the muscle &amp; sphincter of the LES for the treatment of achalasia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is a disease of the muscle of the esophagus (food tube) &amp; means &quot;a failure to
      relax.&quot; The esophagus consists of 3 parts: the first part (uppermost part) is the upper
      esophageal sphincter (UES). The UES is a specialized ring of muscle which separates the
      esophagus from the throat, &amp; prevents food in the second part (body) of the esophagus from
      regurgitating into the throat. The third part of the esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter
      [LES]) also consists of a specialized ring of muscle which separates the body of the
      esophagus from the stomach, &amp; prevents food &amp; acid from regurgitating into the body of the
      esophagus. When achalasia is present, patients experience dysphasia (difficulty swallowing
      food, &amp; [sometimes] liquids), chest pain &amp; can experience recurrent pneumonia &amp; loss of
      weight.

      Current treatments for achalasia include oral medications (calcium channel blockers) to relax
      the LES (difficult to swallow pill/capsule), dilation (stretching) of the LES, (temporary
      relief) &amp; Esophagomyotomy (general surgery to cut the LES).

      POEM (Per-Oral endoscopic myotomy (creating a muscle [esophagus] opening), an incision-less
      (no cutting of the surface of the body) endoscopic procedure, is an effective non-surgical
      alternative to release the muscle &amp; sphincter of the LES for the treatment of achalasia.
