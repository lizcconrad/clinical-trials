  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to aid the development for the use of SENS-218 outside its marketed therapeutic
      indications. SENS-218 is available in Asia and is marketed as an anti-emetic (Anti-sickness)
      drug often prescribed after exposure to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy exposure can often induce
      nausea and/or vomiting.

      The study only involves the one drug, referred to as SENS-218 in this study. The purpose of
      the study is to support the development of use of SENS-218 in non-Asian population.

      The key objective of this study is to identify the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of the
      drug in healthy Caucasian population. The PK refers to what the body does to the body, for
      example, how quickly the drug is absorbed into the blood stream.

      The population who are eligible to take part in the study are healthy male and female,
      non-smoking volunteers, aged between 18 and 50 years, as determined by screening tests at
      Simbec.

      Participation in the trial will last for about 3 weeks (from first screening visit to final
      end of study visit).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a screening visit, 1 treatment period and a post study visit.

      These are outlined below:

      Screening visit ( Day -14 to Day -1)

      - Ensure subjects are eligible for the study.

      Treatment period 1 -If all screening assessments are satisfactory, subjects will be invited
      to attend Simbec to take part in the study. The treatment period consists of 2 overnight
      stays (Day -1 until the morning of Day 2). One return visit is required at the 48 hour point
      post dose on Day 3.

      Post study visit

      -Subjects will be asked to attend Simbec 5-7 days after administration of the last dose for a
      post study visit. If you are withdrawn from the study, you will still be asked to attend for
      an end of study assessment.

      Subjects may be asked to return again if we need to follow you up.

             years of age.

          2. Female subject of child bearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at the
             screening visit and willing to use 2 effective methods of contraception, from first
             dose until 3 months afterwards (i.e., until 3 months after taking IMP).

          3. Female subject of non-child bearing potential with with negative pregnancy test at the

             urine examination values within 14 days of the first dose.

          7. Subject with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined within 14 days of
             the first dose (a positive alcohol result may be repeated at the discretion of the
             Investigator).

          8. Subject with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (Hep B) and hepatitis C virus antibody (Hep C) results.

          9. Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram
             (ECG) determined within 14 days of the first dose.

         10. Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in blood pressure or pulse
             determined within 14 days of the first dose.

         11. Subject is a non-smoker or ex-smoker who has not smoked in the last 3 months
             (determined by urine cotinine &lt; 500 ng/mL at screening visit).

         12. Subject is available to complete the study (including all follow-up visits) and comply
             with study restrictions.

         13. Subject satisfies a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the study.

         14. Subject provides written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject with a clinically significant history of gastrointestinal disorder likely to
             influence drug absorption.

          2. Subject in receipt of regular medication (with the exception of contraception) within
             14 days of the first dose that may have an impact on the safety and objectives of the
             study (Investigator's discretion).

          3. Subject with evidence of renal, hepatic, central nervous system, respiratory,
             cardiovascular or metabolic dysfunction.
