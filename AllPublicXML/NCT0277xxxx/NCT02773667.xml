      Correlation analysis between estimated renal function and biological half life of 131-I
      during radioiodine treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      131-I during radioiodine treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer is mainly
      renally excreted. It is advised in the clinical guidelines that serum creatinine should be
      determined before applying 131-I and if necessary the administered dose should be reduced.
      Nevertheless no guideline gives advice in what extent the dose should be decreased. The
      adjustment is at the discretion of the attending physician.

      Aim of this prospective study is to correlate the biological half life of 131-I with the
      renal function to give objective recommendations concerning the reduction of the applied dose
      in patients with limited renal function.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The estimated renal function (estimated GFR) is measured via determination of serum creatinine and Cystatin C.
The biological half-life of I-131 is determined via whole-body dosimetry (whole-body probe and whole-body gamma camera) and blood probe measurement.
Update 2017/06/07: After analyzing the preliminary results (based on the first 48 patients) probe measurements are not longer needed in a simplified study design. Additionally, measuring the creatinine concentration is no longer needed in comparison to the Cystatin C measurements.</description>
