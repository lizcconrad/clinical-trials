    <textblock>
      Intra-spinal canal tumors are the general term of primary tumors from spinal cord or various
      tissues in the spinal canal and adjacent to the spinal cord, while the metastatic tumors are
      those from other sites other than spinal canal. Intra-spinal canal tumor is one of the most
      common diseases in neurosurgery, and surgery is the most effective treatment. Conventional
      open surgery is required to remove the posterior structures of the spine, which would lead to
      fracture of the posterior tension band, soft tissue injury, spine instability, and even spine
      deformity. So it is very important to protect and rebuild the posterior tension band for the
      stability of the spine. The team of Dr. John P. Kostuik from the Department of Orthopedics
      and Neurosurgery, the Johns Hopkins University, firstly introduced minimally invasive surgery
      for cervical and lumbar degenerative disease. However it has not been applied to the
      treatment of intra-spinal canal tumors. To date, the microsurgery of intra-spinal tumor
      through the trans-Quadrant channel pathway has not been widely performed in clinical
      practice. The investigators performed the microsurgery of intra-spinal canal tumor through
      the trans-Quadrant pathway in some patients previously and succeeded in the surgical
      treatments. The investigators analyzed the clinical data retrospectively, including surgical
      incision length, the volume of bleeding during operation, post-operative drainage volume,
      post-operative out-of-bed time point, post-operative length of stay in hospital, and
      post-operative visual analog pain (VAP) score. The group of patients using microsurgical
      technique through trans-Quadrant channel pathway showed better outcome compared with the
      group of patients using conventional open surgery. This innovation of microsurgery showed
      fewer traumas and bleeding, more rapid recovery, better prognosis and more safety in
      practice. Since there are some limitations to the retrospective study, it is necessary to
      design a prospective randomized controlled trial of the treatment of intra-spinal canal
      tumors using microsurgical technique through trans-Quadrant channel pathway.

      This study is the prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.

        1. Patient Recruitment: Patients who meets the diagnostic criteria of intra-spinal canal
           tumor and has surgical indications from May 2016 to June 2018 in the department of
           neurosurgery of our hospital could be recruited.

        2. Screening: Demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, history of diseases
           (including but not limited in diabetes, heart disease, smoking history, and operation
           history, etc.), related laboratory tests (blood routing test, liver and kidney
           functions, electrolytes, blood coagulation function, and ECG, etc.) before entering
           either group.

        3. Grouping: Patients who meets the diagnostic criteria and does not meet the exclusion
           criteria would be assigned into the experimental group and control group randomly. The
           informed consent forms should be signed before grouping.

        4. Surgery: Patients in the experimental group will receive operation using microsurgical
           techniques through trans-Quadrant channel pathway. Patients in the control group will
           receive conventional open surgery.

        5. Post-operative Observation and Follow-up: Clinical data will be collected after surgery
           and during follow-up. The time points include the 1st day, 7th day, 30th day, 90th day,
           and 180th day after surgery.

        6. Statistical Analysis: Statisticians are blinded to the clinical data and grouping. The
           software SPSS (V. 16.0) will be used in statistics.

    <description>Patients in the experimental group will be general anaesthetized and placed in the prone position. Intra-operational electrophysiological monitoring will be used. Kirschner wire will be used to identify the position of the Quadrant channel with X-ray. After disinfection and draping, an incision of 3cm long and 2-3cm lateral to midline on the tumor side will be made. Soft tissues will be separated. Graded dilators will be used to establish Quadrant channel. Kerrison clamps will be used to expose the very local posterior spinal structures. Vertebral plate will be windowed with power drill to expose dural mater, and tumors will be removed with microsurgical techniques. Hemostasis will be performed after resection. Dural mater will be closed by titanium clips, and close incision by layers.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control group will be general anaesthetized during operation and placed in the prone position. Intra-operational electrophysiological monitoring will be used. Surgeons will locate the lesion by X-ray. After disinfection and draping, the midline incision of 7-10 cm and centered by the lesion segment will be made. Soft tissues will be cut and separated to expose posterior structure of spine. The root of spinal process and half of the vertebral plate on tumor side of certain segments will be removed. The dural mater will be opened. Then surgeons will remove tumor with microsurgical techniques. Hemostasis will be precisely performed after resection, and dural mater will be closed by suturing. Incision will be closed by layers. Drainage would be placed if necessary.</description>
