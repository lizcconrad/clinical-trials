      This study plans to detect the presence of trastuzumab by mass spectroscopy in relapsed
      posterior fossa ependymoma (PFEPN) tumor specimen pre-treated with a single dose of
      intrathecal (IT) trastuzumab, as well as to evaluate toxicity of intrathecal trastuzumab in
      combination with subcutaneous (subQ) Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF) in children with relapsed PFEPN
