  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, two week, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment arm,
      parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two selected
      test teeth), controlled study, in participant with at least two sensitive teeth that meet the
      study criteria at the Screening and Baseline visits. The study will be conducted in
      participants in good general health, with pre-existing self-reported and clinically diagnosed
      tooth sensitivity at screening.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Schiff Sensitivity Score is an examiner based index, was scored immediately following administration of the evaporative air stimulus by directing a maximum one second application of air from a dental air syringe to the exposed dentine surface from a distance of approximately 1 cm. The examiner indicated the participant's response to the evaporative air stimulus, after the stimulation of each individual tooth, using the Schiff sensitivity scale as follows: 0= participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1= participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2= participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold at Day 7 and Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>A tactile stimulus was administered using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple Probe). Response to this stimulus was evaluated as tactile threshold. The constant pressure probe allowed the examiner to vary the force applied to the dentine surface from 10 g to an upper threshold of 80 g in increments of 10 g. The tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied without the participant's reporting pain or discomfort. The greater the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score at Day 14</title>
        <description>Schiff Sensitivity Score is an examiner based index, was scored immediately following administration of the evaporative air stimulus by directing a maximum one second application of air from a dental air syringe to the exposed dentine surface from a distance of approximately 1 cm. The examiner indicated the participant’s response to the evaporative air stimulus, after the stimulation of each individual tooth, using the Schiff sensitivity scale as follows: 0= participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1= participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2= participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score at Day 14</title>
          <description>Schiff Sensitivity Score is an examiner based index, was scored immediately following administration of the evaporative air stimulus by directing a maximum one second application of air from a dental air syringe to the exposed dentine surface from a distance of approximately 1 cm. The examiner indicated the participant’s response to the evaporative air stimulus, after the stimulation of each individual tooth, using the Schiff sensitivity scale as follows: 0= participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1= participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2= participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus.</description>
          <population>Analysis for this outcome was conducted on Intent-to-treat (ITT) population which included all participants who were randomized, received at least one dose of the study treatment and provided at least one post-baseline assessment of efficacy.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold at Day 7 and Day 14</title>
        <description>A tactile stimulus was administered using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple Probe). Response to this stimulus was evaluated as tactile threshold. The constant pressure probe allowed the examiner to vary the force applied to the dentine surface from 10 g to an upper threshold of 80 g in increments of 10 g. The tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied without the participant's reporting pain or discomfort. The greater the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>
