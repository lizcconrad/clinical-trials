      A proof-of-concept clinical trial assessing the safety of the coordinated undermining of
      survival paths by 9 repurposed drugs (aprepitant, auranofin, captopril, celecoxib,
      disulfiram, itraconazole, minocycline, ritonavir and sertraline) combined with metronomic
      temozolomide (CUSP9v3 treatment protocol) for recurrent glioblastoma. This is a phase I study
      for subjects of 18 years and older with glioblastoma that has relapsed after radiation and
      chemotherapy, as confirmed by histology and MRI.

      A total of 10 patients will be treated with the CUSP9v3 treatment protocol. This is a
      monocentric trial: all patients will be treated at Ulm University Hospital.

    <description>After enrollment, the subject goes into the induction cycle, which lasts 35 days. The induction cycle consists of a drug-by-drug addition and up-dosing process.
Hereafter, the subject will enter the treatment cycles (up to 12). During the induction cycle and the first 2 treatment cycles, regimen adjustments (dropping of certain drugs, dose modification of certain drugs) may be executed to accommodate to the patients' individual toxicity reactions that may occur during this period.</description>
