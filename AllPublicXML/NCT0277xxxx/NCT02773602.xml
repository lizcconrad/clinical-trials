      Comparing the duration of pain relief from caudal analgesia when adjuncts like dexamethasone,
      clonidine, or saline (salt water) are added to ropivacaine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The local anesthetic, which is currently used for caudal analgesia, is called ropivacaine. It
      works well and is safe in infants and children. Doctors commonly add small amounts of other
      medication to ropivacaine to prolong the duration of pain relief provided by a single
      injection of caudal analgesia.

      In this study, the length of duration of pain relief the child receives from caudal analgesia
      will be examined when different medications are added to ropivacaine. Specifically,
      dexamethasone, clonidine, or saline (salt water) will be added to ropivicaine and the length
      of time it takes before the child needs more pain medication will be determined.

      Clonidine has been added to caudal analgesia for infants and children for many years. It
      increases the duration of pain relieving effect of ropivicaine by itself, however, it may
      lead to prolonged sedation following the surgical procedure (an undesired effect) and it is
      expensive.

      Dexamethasone has been used for adult epidurals and nerve blocks and in spine surgeries. It
      prolongs the duration of pain relief and causes less sedation. It is commonly administered to
      children during surgery to help decrease nausea and vomiting after surgery. It is also much
      cheaper than clonidine.
