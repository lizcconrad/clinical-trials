  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical study was to compare implant survival,
      patient satisfaction, and radiographic, clinical, and aesthetic outcomes following immediate
      loading (IL) and delayed loading (DL) of single dental implants after 1,3 and 5 years of
      follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of marginal bone</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (surgery), 3, 6, 12, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Digital intra-oral periapical radiographs at different time points. The marginal bone level is measured after calibration. Measurements are taken from the implant-abutment junction to the marginal bone level (millimetres). Change in marginal bone level is calculated by comparing bone-to-implant contact level of all appointments to radiographic baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pink esthetic score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (surgery), 3, 6, 12, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intraoral photographs from the aesthetic baseline and follow-up appointments are used to register the pink esthetic score, an objective aesthetic scale were the shape,size,colour and structure of the soft tissue is rated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Oral Health Impact Profile 14 (OHIP-14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery, baseline (surgery), 6, 12, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The oral health-related quality of life is calculated using the Swedish validated version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire. The questionnaires are completed at the beginning of the treatment, at the day when the patients received a temporary crown, and at 6 and 12 months after the definitive crown placement.</description>

    <measure>Change in White esthetic score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (surgery), 3, 6, 12, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intraoral photographs from the aesthetic baseline and follow-up appointments are used to register the white esthetic score, an objective aesthetic scale were the shape,size,colour and structure of the implant crown is rated.</description>
