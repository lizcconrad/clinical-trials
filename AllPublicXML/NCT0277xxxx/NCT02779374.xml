      Currently, There is no treatment for Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Very small
      embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) are found in the ovary. VSELs are able to regenerate the
      affected ovary. Stimulation was achieved by injection of mesenchymal stem cells that is
      supposed to secrete trophic factors.

      Numerous studies in mice have proved the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in
      resuming the ovarian function after chemotherapy-induced ovarian insufficiency.

      Allogeneic BMT raised the moral conflict about the origin of the newly developed oocytes.
      Several small studies examined the use of autologous BMT both in animal and in human. The
      results of these studies were promising. Intravenous injection is simpler and less invasive
      than ovarian injection as the later involves the use of laparoscopy. However, intravenous
      injection has not tested until now.

      Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) has no curative treatment until now. It was noticed
      that some cases of POI to recover spontaneously. Furthermore, the concept of fixed prenatal
      pool of oogonia has been challenged and postnatal neo-oogenesis is currently proved.

      Very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) are found in the ovary. VSELs are stem cells
      that have noticed to survive chemotherapy induced gonadal insufficiency. Data from animal
      studies showed that stimulation of these stem cells result in regeneration of the affected
      ovary. Stimulation was achieved by injection of mesenchymal stem cells that is supposed to
      secrete trophic factors.

      Numerous studies in mice have proved the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in
      resuming the ovarian function after chemotherapy-induced ovarian insufficiency. These studies
      have been followed by researches on human being. Human studies included the use of stem cells
      from different sites including BM, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord.

      Allogeneic BMT raised the moral conflict about the origin of the newly developed oocytes.
      Although studies proved that these newly developed oocytes to be genetically traced to the
      recipient; some other studies showed that the newly developed oocytes originate from the
      donor BM. Several small studies examined the use of autologous BMT both in animal and in
      human. The results of these studies were promising. Use of autologous BMT also avoids the
      need for chemotherapy for conditioning and other related complications associated with
      allogeneic BMT. Human studies mostly used the ovarian injection of the BM. Intravenous
      injection is simpler and less invasive than ovarian injection as the later involves the use
      of laparoscopy. However, intravenous injection has not tested until now.
