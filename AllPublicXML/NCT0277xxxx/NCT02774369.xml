  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that the practice of physical exercise can improve sleep, but few
      studies have investigated this issue in the context of cancer, despite the proven benefits of
      exercise in this population. This randomized-controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare the
      efficacy of an aerobic intervention program to that of a self-administered
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to improve sleep of cancer patients. Forty-one men and
      women with insomnia symptoms and treated within 6 months for a non-metastatic cancer
      participated in the study.
