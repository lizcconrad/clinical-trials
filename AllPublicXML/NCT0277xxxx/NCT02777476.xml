      This is a post-marketing study for B-Lite® implants that carry the EC certificate for
      marketing in Europe and AMAR certificate for marketing in Israel. To date, hundreds of
      implants have already been implanted in women. The study is open for primary augmentation
      patients only. All surgeries will be performed as per standard practice at the given study
      site. No parallel surgical procedures will be performed at the same session.

          -  Genetic women between the ages of 18 and 60 seeking primary breast augmentation

          -  Patient is eligible to undergo MRI (i.e., no implanted metal or metal devices, no

             explanted

          -  The patient has realistic expectations of surgical results after discussion with
             investigator and is an acceptable candidate for breast augmentation.

             vascularity)

          -  Patient has a condition, or is under treatment for any condition, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator and/or consulting physician(s), may constitute an
