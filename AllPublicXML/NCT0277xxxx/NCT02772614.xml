      Monocentre, open, non-placebo-controlled, single-group, single-dose study. Safety
      measurements (12-lead ECG, vital signs, blood chemistry and haematology) were conducted
      before and after the study, adverse events were monitored throughout the study.

      Each subject was to receive a single oral dose of 2.5 MBq [14C]-labelled BIA 3-202 (200 mg).
      This was the intended radiolabelled dose without any losses; the actual administered dose was
      of 2.29 MBq [14C]-labelled BIA 3-202 (200 mg). Subjects were hospitalized the day before the
      administration until 264 hours thereafter.

      Whole blood samples (2 mL) for total radioactivity analysis, plasma samples (1.5 mL) for
      total radioactivity analysis, and plasma samples (7 mL) for analysis of BIA 3-202 and its
      metabolites were collected at the following times: pre-dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,
      6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 120, 168, 216, and 264 hours post-dose.

      Urine was sampled before the drug administration (pre-dose), then it was collected from 0-4,
      4-8, 8-24, 24-48, 48-72, 72-120, 120-168, 168-216, and 216-264 hours post-dose.

      Aliquots of each sample were taken for liquid scintillation counting by the investigator.

      Aliquots were separated for determination of parent drug and metabolite patterns.

      A baseline faeces sample was obtained during the screening or baseline period. Following
      dose, each faeces sample was collected in a separate container during the 264 hours post-dose
      period.

      Vomitus (if produced) was collected.

    <description>Each subject was to receive one single dose of 2.5 MBq [14C]-labelled BIA 3-202 (200 mg) together with a total of 250 mL non-carbonated water.
The study drug was given after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours after the in-house stay. During waking hours on Day 1, subjects had to have a fluid intake of at least 150 mL per hour starting 1 hour before study drug administration.</description>
