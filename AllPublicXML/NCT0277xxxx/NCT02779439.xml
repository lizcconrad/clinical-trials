  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and biological efficacy of therapeutically administered most closely
      HLA-matched third party donor-derived specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) targeting
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Adenovirus (Adv) or Epstein Barr virus (EBV) or fungi including
      Aspergillus and Candida species for the treatment of viral infection following allogeneic
      blood or marrow stem cell or solid organ transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will analyse the safety and biological efficacy of administering the
      investigational products (most closely HLA-matched third party donor-derived T cells
      stimulated with viral or fungal antigen expressing DC), for the treatment of viral
      reactivation and/or infection or fungal infection following allogeneic blood or marrow or
      solid organ transplantation. The cells will be given therapeutically after transplantation in
      patients with active viral reactivation or proven/probably fungal infection despite standard
      therapy.

      Our AIMS are to study the safety of third party donor-derived CTL infusions, their effect on
      treatment of viral reactivation as well as their effect on reconstitution of virus- and
      fungus-specific immunity, viral and fungal infection and reactivation rates after
      transplantation, viral load, and use of antiviral and antifungal pharmacotherapy.

      We will evaluate the safety of infusions with respect to the development of adverse events
      within the first 12 months post-CTL infusion and the dynamics of cell persistence by T-cell
      chimerism analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of viral reactivation or infection with CMV, Adv or EBV or invasive fungal
             disease must be present at the time of infusion as determined by:

               -  For CMV CMV detectable by antigen detection, PCR or culture in peripheral blood
