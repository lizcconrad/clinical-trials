      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when given
      together with cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation therapy, in treating patients with
      stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells
      and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab with cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation
      therapy may work better in treating patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination of MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) and standard, adjuvant cisplatin-radiotherapy in patients with high-risk,
      human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), based upon
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe 1-year disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), local-regional
      failure (LRF), and rate of distant metastases following treatment with adjuvant
      cisplatin-radiotherapy and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      II. To describe the toxicity of the combination of cisplatin-radiotherapy and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version
      (v.) 4, including immune-related adverse events (AEs).

      III. To describe the relationship between baseline programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      expression 1-year disease-free survival (DFS).

      IV. To describe baseline immune-inflammatory biomarkers in both tumor and tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs), and correlate them with 1-year DFS.

      V. To describe baseline and change in expression of peripheral immune-inflammatory
      biomarkers, including a panel of candidate tumor antigen (TA)-specific memory T cells, and
      correlate with 1-year DFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours once weekly for weeks 1-6 and
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks in weeks 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21. Patients also
      undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in weeks 1-6. Patients may also receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes in weeks 3, 6, 24, and 27.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21,
      24, 30, and 36.

          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of head and neck
             squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) involving the oral cavity (excluding lips), oropharynx
             (p16 negative), hypopharynx or larynx

          -  Patients must have undergone gross total surgical resection of high-risk oral cavity,
             oropharynx (p16 negative), larynx, or hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) within
             63 days prior to registration; note: patients may have a biopsy under general
             anesthesia in an operating room followed by definitive ablative cancer surgery
             representing gross total resection; the gross total resection has to be done within 63
             days prior to registration; if, however, patients have ablative resection but
             demonstrate rapid gross recurrence or are determined to have gross persisting disease
             requiring re-resection to achieve gross total resection, then the patient is not
             eligible

          -  Patients must have at least one of the following high risk pathologic features:

               -  Extracapsular nodal extension

               -  Invasive cancer at the primary tumor resection margin (tumor on ink); Note:
                  Patients who have a positive margin and undergo re-resection with final negative
                  margin are eligible only if they can be enrolled within 63 days of initial gross
                  total resection AND extracapsular nodal extension was also present; patients who
                  have a positive margin and undergo re-resection with final negative margin and do
                  not have extracapsular nodal extension, are NOT eligible

          -  Pathologic stage III or IV HNSCC, including no distant metastases, based on the
             following minimum diagnostic workup:

               -  General history/physical examination by a radiation oncologist and/or medical
                  oncologist within 84 days prior to registration

                  surgery; a laryngopharyngoscopy (mirror and/or fiberoptic and/or direct
                  procedure), if appropriate, is recommended but not required; intra-operative
                  examination is acceptable documentation

               -  Pre-op Imaging of the head and neck: a neck computerized tomography (CT) (with
                  contrast) or CT/positron emission tomography (PET) (with contrast) and/or an

                  84 days prior to surgery; note: this imaging data (diagnostic pre-operative scan
                  showing gross disease) is to be submitted in Digital Imaging and Communications
                  in Medicine (DICOM) format via transfer of images and data (TRIAD); the report is
                  to be uploaded into Rave

               -  Chest imaging with either a CT scan (with or without contrast) or CT/PET (with or
                  without contrast) that includes the chest within 120 days prior to registration;
                  Note: if the CT/PET with or without contrast is done within 84 days prior to

             if p16 is negative, this tissue must be submitted for central review for confirmation
             before Step 2 registration; note: if the institution finds that the patient is p16
             positive, the patient is excluded from this trial on the basis of distinct biology,
             prognosis, and low- or intermediate-risk rather than high-risk status

                  (p.o.) and still within, the required registration timeframe, then the patient is
                  eligible

               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration

                  testing is not required for entry into this protocol; the need to exclude
                  patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the cisplatin and IMRT
                  involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive; patients with
                  known HIV, CD4 counts &gt;= 250/uL, and undetectable viral loads who are stable on
                  an antiretroviral regimen may be included

               -  A diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
                  other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
                  the MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)

               -  Known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)

               -  Known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or
                  hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis c virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative]
                  is detected); Note: patients who have been curatively treated for hepatitis C and
                  have no detectable viral load are eligible

               -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
                  years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
                  immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment

          -  Grade 3-4 electrolyte abnormalities (CTCAE, v. 4):

          -  Serum calcium (ionized or adjusted for albumin) &lt; 7 mg/dl (1.75 mmol/L) or &gt; 12.5
             mg/dl (&gt; 3.1 mmol/L) despite intervention to normalize levels

          -  Glucose &lt; 40 mg/dl (&lt; 2.2 mmol/L) or &gt; 250 mg/dl (&gt; 14mmol/L)

          -  Magnesium &lt; 0.9 mg/dl (&lt; 0.4 mmol/L) or &gt; 3 mg/dl (&gt; 1.23 mmol/L) despite intervention
             to normalize levels

          -  Potassium &lt; 3.0 mmol/L or &gt; 6 mmol/L despite intervention to normalize levels

          -  Sodium &lt; 130 mmol/L or &gt; 155 mmol/L despite intervention to normalize levels

          -  Patients who are pregnant, nursing, or expecting to conceive or father children within
             the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening
             visit through 120 days after the last dose of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)

          -  Hypersensitivity to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or any of its excipients;

          -  Patients who have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study
             therapy; Note: seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu
             vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are
             live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed

          -  Patients for whom it is not in the best interest to participate in the study, in the
             opinion of the treating investigator
