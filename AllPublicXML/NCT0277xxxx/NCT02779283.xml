      This phase IB trial studies the feasibility of using a functional laboratory based study to
      determine how well the test can be used to select personalized kinase inhibitor therapy in
      combination with standard chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML). It also evaluates safety and potential efficacy. Kinase inhibitor is
      a type of substance that blocks an enzyme called a kinase. Human cells have many different
      kinase enzymes, and they help control important cell functions. Certain kinases are more
      active in some types of cancer cells and blocking them may help keep the cancer cells from
      growing. Testing samples of blood from patients with AML in the laboratory with kinase
      inhibitors may help determine which kinase inhibitor has more activity against cancer cells
      and which one should be combined with standard of care chemotherapy. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving a
      personalized kinase inhibitor therapy combined with standard chemotherapy may be a better
      treatment for AML.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine feasibility of using an in vitro small molecule inhibitor screen to select
      kinase inhibitors to add to standard chemotherapy induction in AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of the addition of the kinase inhibitors when added
      to standard induction chemotherapy.

      II. Evaluate overall objective response rates at completion of induction therapy.

      III. Evaluate need for re-induction at day 14 (±3 days). IV. Evaluate sensitivity to kinase
      inhibitors using our investigational small molecular inhibitor screen in newly diagnosed AML.

      V. Determine twelve-month overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform next-generation mutational analysis in primary leukemia samples from study
      subjects at baseline to establish a panel of known mutations for each subject and at the time
      of bone marrow recovery after induction chemotherapy to measure residual disease and evaluate
      utility of next-generation sequencing as a method compared to flow cytometry for minimal
      residual disease (MRD).

      II. Evaluate pharmacokinetics for each individual kinase inhibitor. III. Determine if there
      is a cytogenetic or other risk group that has a higher rate of treatment failure or inability
      to obtain results from the small molecule inhibitor screen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously over 24 hours on days 1-7, and
      idarubicin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Based on the results of the kinase inhibitor
      assay, patients receive either sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily (BID), sunitinib malate PO
      daily, dasatinib PO daily, nilotinib PO daily, or ponatinib hydrochloride PO daily on days
      8-29 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, and then for a
      minimum of 1 year.
