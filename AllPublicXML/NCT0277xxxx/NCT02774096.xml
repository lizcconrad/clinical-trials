  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With more and more people developing hypertension and atherosclerosis, the morbidity rate of
      Acute Aortic Dissection（AAD） has been increasing. Emergency surgery is the main treatment for
      Acute Aortic Dissection. However the secondary injury caused by reperfusion of spinal cord
      could lead to Catastrophic complications,such as paraplegia, hemiplegia or even death. So
      spinal protection is always the hot topic in clinical research.

      Xenon is an ideal anesthetic gases with the following features,fast onset of action, stable
      hemodynamics, clean and non-toxic.The animal researches have showed the protective effects of
      xenon to alleviate the ischemia-reperfusion injury of the nervous system.Those clues suggest
      that Xenon may have the potential protection of spinal cord in patients undergoing aortic
      dissection repair.In order to clarify this hypothesis, the investigators designed this
      randomized, controlled clinic trial to evaluate the protection of Xenon against spinal cord
      ischemia-reperfusion injury and the potential mechanisms
