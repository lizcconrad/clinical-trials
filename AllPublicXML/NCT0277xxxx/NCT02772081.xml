  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the administration of porcine surfactant (poractant alfa, Curosurf®)
      through a less invasive method (LISA) using a thin catheter (CHF 6440) during non-invasive
      ventilation (NIV) (CPAP, NIPPV, BiPAP) with an approved conventional surfactant
      administration during invasive ventilation and rapid extubation in terms of short term and
      mid-term safety and efficacy in spontaneously breathing preterm neonates with clinical signs
      of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

      This study will open-label, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled study.
      Neonates will be evaluated according to the selection criteria and then randomized to
      surfactant treatment via LISA or standard administration procedure (Table 1). The enrolment
      will be staggered: the gestational age will be restricted to 27+0 weeks up to 28+6 completed
      weeks for the first 30 neonates. Provided no safety concerns will raise, the enrolment will
      be then enlarge to the whole population (i.e. 25+0 weeks up to 28+6 completed weeks).
      Enrolled neonates will be evaluated in a main phase of the trial until 36 wks PMA. Their
      development will be finally assessed at 24-month corrected age as separate stand-alone visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained by parents/legal representative (according to local
             regulation) prior to or after birth

          2. Inborn preterm neonates of either sex aged ≥30 minutes and &lt;24 hours, spontaneously
             breathing and stabilized on NIV.

          3. Gestational age of 25+0 weeks up to 28+6 completed weeks, except for the first 30
             enrolled neonates in which the gestational age will be restricted to 27+0 weeks up to
             28+6 weeks.

          4. Clinical course consistent with RDS.

          5. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≥0.30 to maintain SpO2 between 88-95%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Need for immediate endotracheal intubation for cardiopulmonary resuscitation or
             insufficient respiratory drive

          2. Use of nasal high frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV) prior to study entry

          3. Use of surfactant prior to study entry and need for intratracheal administration of
             any other treatment (e.g. nitric oxide)

          4. Known genetic or chromosomal disorders, major congenital anomalies (congenital heart
             diseases, myelomeningocele etc)

          5. Mothers with prolonged rupture of the membranes (&gt; 21 days duration)

          6. Presence of air leaks if identified and known prior to study entry

          7. Evidence of severe birth asphyxia (e.g. Apgar score of ≤ 5 at 10 minutes after birth,
             continued need for resuscitation at 10 minutes after birth, altered neurological
             state)

          8. Neonatal seizures prior to study entry

          9. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the neonate at
             undue risk

         10. Participation in another clinical trial of any placebo, drug or biological substance
             conducted under the provisions of a protocol
