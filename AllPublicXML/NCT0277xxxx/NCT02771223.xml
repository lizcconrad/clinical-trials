  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged extracorporeal circulation (ECC) for cardiac surgery results in coagulation
      abnormalities, most of which related to the direct, time dependent effect of the polymer
      tubing and the pump rollers on the thrombocytes. Significant evidence demonstrates the effect
      of the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass on thrombocytes number and function, as well as on
      postoperative coagulopathy

      Quantification of the effect of ECC duration on blood coagulation and platelet number and
      function

        -  Observational study on 20 patients undergoing prolonged ECC

        -  Blood sampling every 30 minutes for platelet count, platelet adhesion markers and
           coagulation studies

        -  Blood test to be performed in Rambam Blood Bank Laboratory
