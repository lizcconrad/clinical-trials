  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I evaluation of N-MCT in normal volunteers requires sequentially increased doses.
      At each dose level, the safety and pharmacokinetic will be measured. This Phase I trial will
      have the dose range of N-MCT from 200mg - 1200mg per patient.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of N-MCT administered
      orally as a single ascending dose. Healthy male and female (non-pregnant, non-lactating)
      subjects ages 18-45, will be consented and allowed to participate in the study if upon
      screening they meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria.

      Subjects will be enrolled into one of four cohort groups sequentially. Each of the six
      subjects in each group will receive doses sequentially within 48 hours between each dose
      increase (ie, the second subject in a group will not receive a dose until 48 hours after the
      first subject received a dose).

      Cohort 1 (6 subjects, male &amp; female) will receive 200 mg, Cohort 2 (6 subjects, male &amp;
      female) will receive 400 mg, Cohort 3 (8 subjects, males and females, 2 placebo, 6 treated)
      will receive 800 mg and Cohort 4 (8 subjects, males and females, 2 placebo, 6 treated) will
      receive 1200 mg of N-MCT.

      Each cohort will be completed and the safety data evaluated prior to initiating the next
      cohort. All subjects will have plasma and urine samples evaluated for N-MCT.

      The PI of the protocol and the IDMC will review safety data (AEs), safety labs, vital signs,
      and findings through Day 7 for Cohort 1 before enrolling subjects in Cohort 2. Cohort 2 data
      through Day 7 will be reviewed accordingly by the PI and IDMC before enrolling subjects in
      Cohort 3. Cohort 3 data through Day 7 will be reviewed by the PI and the IDMC before
      enrolling subjects in Cohort 4.

      However, prior to dose escalation to a new cohort as described above, GHUCCTS IRB will review
      and approve, in expedited review, the IDMC report upon which the decision to escalate the
      dose to a new cohort is based.
