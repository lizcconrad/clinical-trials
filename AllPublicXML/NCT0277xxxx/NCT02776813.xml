               -  biopsy-proven refractory disease after frontline chemo-immunotherapy

               -  For subjects with TH-FL: relapsed or refractory disease following at least 2
                  prior regimens or following an auto-HSCT. At least 1 prior regimen with an
                  anti-CD20 mAb in combination with chemotherapy is required following documented
                  transformation

                  t(11;14) by cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or PCR):
                  relapsed or refractory disease after at least 1 prior regimen with
                  chemo-immunotherapy (prior auto-HSCT is allowable)
