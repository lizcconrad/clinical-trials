  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to assess bioavailability of a single dose of MR902 and to assess the effect of food
      on absorption
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers will receive a single dose of the investigational drug on 2 occasions and a
      reference drug on 1 occasion. Volunteers will be randomised to one of two groups, each group
      receiving a different dose strength of MR902 in fed and fasted state.

      The study involves a screening visit 21 days before first dosing and 3 overnight stays in 3
      study periods, and a post-study medical visit.

      Volunteers will receive naltrexone to reduce anticipated opioid side effects.
