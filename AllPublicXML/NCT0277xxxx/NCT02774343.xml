  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a medication called pioglitazone
      (trade name Actos) can reduce behavioral problems associated with cocaine use, improve brain
      structural changes associated with cocaine use and reduce cocaine craving and drug use in
      cocaine dependent patients.

    <measure>Craving as Assessed by the Brief Substance Craving Scale (BSCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5, week 6, week 7, week 8, week 9, week 10, week 11, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The brief substance craving scale (BSCS) is a 16-item, self-report instrument assesses craving for cocaine and other substances of abuse over a 24 hour period. The domains of intensity, frequency, and duration are recorded on a five-point Likert scale. The range of scores for each domain is 0 to 4, and the total score is the sum of all three domains. The total score range is 0 to 12, and higher scores indicate higher craving (worse outcome.)</description>

    <measure>Craving as Assessed by the Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1-12</time_frame>
    <description>The obsessive compulsive drug use scale (OCDUS) measures the level of craving for cocaine during the past week. The mean score over all time points is reported in this outcome measure (i.e., a summary score is reported). The scale was administered once weekly. It consists of 12 items. The score range is 0 to 60, and higher scores indicates greater craving.</description>

    <measure>Cue Reactivity as Assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of Cocaine Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 10, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Every two weeks, visual analog scale ratings of craving (VAS craving) consisting of 100 mm line, anchored by 0 &quot;not at all&quot; and 100 &quot;extremely,&quot; were used to assess cocaine craving right now, craving on average in the past week, and the worst craving in the past week. Data were analyzed as a total score, which is the sum of the scores for the three questions.</description>

    <measure>Brain White Matter (WM) Integrity as Assessed by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Fractional Anisotropy (FA) Value (Region - Posterior Thalamic Radiation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>DTI scans were acquired on a Philips Integra 3T magnet. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a summary measure of the integrity of white matter neurons that provides a dimensionless index of the expected movement of water molecules inside and across the neuron. Higher values of FA indicate better neuronal integrity (that is, less movement of water across the neuron). There is no range of values, as this is a dimensionless index.</description>

        <title>Craving as Assessed by the Brief Substance Craving Scale (BSCS)</title>
        <description>The brief substance craving scale (BSCS) is a 16-item, self-report instrument assesses craving for cocaine and other substances of abuse over a 24 hour period. The domains of intensity, frequency, and duration are recorded on a five-point Likert scale. The range of scores for each domain is 0 to 4, and the total score is the sum of all three domains. The total score range is 0 to 12, and higher scores indicate higher craving (worse outcome.)</description>

        <description>The obsessive compulsive drug use scale (OCDUS) measures the level of craving for cocaine during the past week. The mean score over all time points is reported in this outcome measure (i.e., a summary score is reported). The scale was administered once weekly. It consists of 12 items. The score range is 0 to 60, and higher scores indicates greater craving.</description>

        <title>Brain White Matter (WM) Integrity as Assessed by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Fractional Anisotropy (FA) Value (Region - Posterior Thalamic Radiation)</title>
        <description>DTI scans were acquired on a Philips Integra 3T magnet. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a summary measure of the integrity of white matter neurons that provides a dimensionless index of the expected movement of water molecules inside and across the neuron. Higher values of FA indicate better neuronal integrity (that is, less movement of water across the neuron). There is no range of values, as this is a dimensionless index.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>Although 21 completed the study, only 18 were analyzed for this measure. This is because DTI FA data was collected for only 18 subjects. Reasons for not completing DTI: 1 subject had a brain abnormality; 1 subject refused to do the scan; and 1 scan was not completed due to scanner shutdown for maintenance.</population>

          <description>DTI scans were acquired on a Philips Integra 3T magnet. Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a summary measure of the integrity of white matter neurons that provides a dimensionless index of the expected movement of water molecules inside and across the neuron. Higher values of FA indicate better neuronal integrity (that is, less movement of water across the neuron). There is no range of values, as this is a dimensionless index.</description>
          <population>Although 21 completed the study, only 18 were analyzed for this measure. This is because DTI FA data was collected for only 18 subjects. Reasons for not completing DTI: 1 subject had a brain abnormality; 1 subject refused to do the scan; and 1 scan was not completed due to scanner shutdown for maintenance.</population>
