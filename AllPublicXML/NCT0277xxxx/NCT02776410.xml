  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to investigate young consumers' attitudes and behaviour towards sustainable
      and healthy eating by applying a multidisciplinary approach, taking into account economical,
      marketing, public health and environmental related issues. In order to achieve this goal,
      consumers' reactions on interactive tailored informational messages about sustainable from
      social, environmental and economical point of view, as well as healthy eating behaviour in a
      group of Polish young adults will be investigated. Main research questions that will be
      addressed: What is consumer's current behaviour and perception of sustainable healthy eating?
      What are factors determining consumers' reactions to messages about sustainable healthy
      eating? What are consumers' reactions on interactive tailored communication about sustainable
      and healthy eating behaviour? About 200 Polish consumers will take part in this randomized
      controlled trial. A stratified design will be used to recruit 18-30 years old adults using
      smart phones. The sample will be represented for gender and region. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either a study or a control group. They will complete a baseline and
      follow-up survey. An application for smart phones will be developed by a professional IT
      company in order to deliver personalised messages to the participants. Intervention will take
      one month. Messages developed following the theory-linked definitions of behaviour change
      techniques will be sent to the participants every 2-3 days. The six principles of sustainable
      and healthy behaviour introduced in the campaign &quot;Livewell 2020&quot; will be used as a base to
      communicate to consumers.
