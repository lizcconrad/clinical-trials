  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will examine temporal and regional dynamic changes in the microbiome of Cystic
      Fibrosis patients to explore microbiome features that are associated with an inflammatory
      phenotype. Investigators hypothesize that temporal and spatial differences in lung microbiome
      are associated with host inflammatory responses.

      While chronic and polymicrobial airway colonization are commonly recognized in cystic
      fibrosis (CF), it is unclear what factors of the microbial environment lead to infection with
      pathogenic microorganism. This is a multi center, longitudinal cohort of adult Cystic
      Fibrosis subjects recruit4ed from NYU and Columbia to understand how changes in the airway
      microbiome may affect the host inflammatory responses in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). There will be
      three approaches to understanding inflammatory responses; 1) a longitudinal assessment of
      temporal changes in the microbiome over a 6-month period of clinical stability; 2) comparison
      of the regional differences in airway microbiome between lung segments with more versus less
      disease; 3) evaluation of functional aspects of the lung microbiome.

        Multicenter study to create a longitudinal cohort of adult CF subjects recruited from NYU
        and Columbia. A subgroup of subjects will be selected for a more invasive assessment of the
        lung microbiome with research bronchoscopy.
