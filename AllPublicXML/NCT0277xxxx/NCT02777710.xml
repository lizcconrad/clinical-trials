  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are the most common
      gastrointestinal cancers in Western countries and are both associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality. An intriguing similarity between CRC and PDAC is the fact that the
      newly developed immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially PD1/PDL1 inhibitors, seem to have
      limited efficacy as single agents in both of these tumor types. Recent preclinical studies
      point towards alternatively activated (M2-type) macrophages as possible culprits in inducing
      local immune protection from cytotoxic T cells and resistance to PD1/PD-L1 targeted agents.
      We hypothesize that CSF1R blockade will deplete the tumor microenvironment of M2 macrophages,
      thus favoring the induction of a cytotoxic anti-tumor T-cell response following PD-L1
      blockade with an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. So we propose to conduct a Phase I dose
      escalation study in order to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of a combined
      treatment associating an anti-CSF1R (PEXIDARTINIB) with an anti-PD-L1 (DURVALUMAB) in
      patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancers. Dose escalation part will
      determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      Pexidartinib given in combination with Durvalumab. Extension part will evaluate the clinical
      activity of the combination at the RP2D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a 2-part Phase I study comprising a dose-finding escalation part (to
      determine MTD/RP2D, safety and PK) followed by an extension part at RP2D. In the
      dose-escalation part, successive cohorts of 3 patients will receive Pexidartinib (given
      orally every day at escalating doses, five dose levels possible, Plexxikon), in combination
      with Durvalumab (given IV every 4 weeks at a fixed dose of 1500mg, AstraZeneca). The dose
      escalation scheme will be done using a Likelihood Continual Reassessment Method (CRML). After
      each new cohort of 3 patients is evaluated, model will be fitted and results will be
      discussed in a teleconference between the investigators, the sponsor, representatives of
      AstraZeneca and Plexxikon, and the statistician who will decide of the next dose to be
      assigned to the next cohort (Dose Escalation Meetings). In both parts, patients will continue
      to receive study drugs as long as they experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the
      investigator or until unacceptable toxicity including DLTs or symptomatic deterioration
      attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated
      assessment of radiographic data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent. If a DLT or a
      toxicity meeting the DLT definition but occurring outside of the DLT period, resolves to
      Grade ≤2 or the patient's baseline level within 14 days after toxicity onset, dosing may be
      resumed if agreed by the Sponsor at the same DL. The extension part will comprise two
      independent cohorts of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC cohort) or colorectal
      adenocarcinoma (CRC cohort) and biopsiable disease, and will allow the assessment of
      anti-tumor activity based on a Gehan design allowing to quickly identify treatments with low
      efficacy.
