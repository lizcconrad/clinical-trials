  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine(DEX) could provide dose-dependent sedation , analgesia , anti-anxiety and
      inhibition of sympathetic nerves and other effects. Because of its minimal impact on the
      respiratory , currently it was more and more widely used to sedate patients undergoing
      regional anesthesia.Many anesthetic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are often affected
      by age, and current studies with regard to the effects of age on dexmedetomidine
      pharmacodynamic are rare. This study was designed to explore the right DEX dose of different
      female Age of patients to produce suitable sedation.Dexmedetomidine be used in patients with
      combined spinal and epidural anesthesia for sedation,which is monitored by the
      Narcotrend,during the operation.The relation between Narcotrend index (NTI) and the depth of
      sedation for patients is also investigated.

      90 patients scheduled for combined spinal epidural spinal anesthesia were included in one of
      three groups. In each group,determination of median effective (ED50) doses was performed by
      the Dixon up-and-down method, an initial dose of 1.0 μg/kg dexmedetomidine, with dose
      adjustment intervals of 0.1 μg/kg in first three turning points and 0.05μg/kg in the last
      three turning points.Initial doses was 1.4μg/kg, .Sedative efficacy was defined as an OAA/S
      of ≤3,30 min after the beginning of drug administration.
