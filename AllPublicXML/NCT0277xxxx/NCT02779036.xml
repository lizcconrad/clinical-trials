    <textblock>
      In a randomized-controlled study, the effects of a structured, progressive, task-oriented
      home exercise program to optimize walking competency will be evaluated in subacute stroke
      survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of stroke individuals unable to reenter their previous community life after they
      have had a stroke. Reintegration of community life by optimizing walking function is a major
      goal of stroke rehabilitation. Because not widely available inpatient rehabilitation,
      discharged with incomplete recovery, limited numbers of technically trained physical
      therapists, financial saving, and transportation difficulty, home-based stroke rehabilitation
      setting has been interested in many developing countries.

      Task- oriented exercise is well known and accepted approach to optimize walking function with
      underlying principles of motor control and motor learning theories. This approach has been
      used in the clinical setting with close supervision, but identification of appropriate
      protocol in the community environment is on progress. To date, no proper home exercise
      program based on task-oriental principle with minimal supervision for improving walking
      competency after stroke has been proposed in stroke rehabilitation.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a structured, progressive, task-
      oriented home exercise program on walking competency in individual post stroke.
