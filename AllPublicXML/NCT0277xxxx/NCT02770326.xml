  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of FMT in patients with C. difficile and
      cancer. In previous other studies, FMT has been shown to cure C. difficile when antibiotics
      have failed, but most of these studies have not included patients with cancer. The
      investigators want to prove that FMT is safe in this group of people so that doctors will
      feel more comfortable prescribing it for their patients with cancer.

    <description>Patients with recurrent or refractory CDI who meet study eligibility criteria, will consent to undergo either colonoscopy or upper endoscopy with infusion of stool admixture. Safety will be assessed by monitoring infections that occurred within 2 weeks of the FMT procedures. Additionally, 24-hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 months post-FMT, a stool sample will be collected. The time window for each time point listed is +/- 48 hours, with the exception of the first, 24 hour, time point. The time window for the 24 hour time point is +48 hours post FMT.</description>
