      This study evaluates the discontinuation of natalizumab either immediately or tapered off in
      the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Half of the fifty (50) participants will discontinue
      natalizumab immediately and the other half will taper off the drug, having two additional
      infusions, one at six weeks- and one at eight weeks-post discontinuation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Natalizumab is a pharmaceutical intervention used in the management of multiple sclerosis.

      The decision to discontinue natalizumab therapy is often raised in patients defined as
      high-risk for PML despite good clinical efficacy. During the therapy cessation period
      following large phase III trials, a return to the prestudy disease activity was reached by
      four months post-discontinuation. Shorter therapy was associated with a trend for a more
      severe disease activity pointing to a possible 'rebound' effect after natalizumab
      discontinuation.

      This study focuses on two different approaches: an immediate versus a step-wise/tapered down
      natalizumab discontinuation protocol, both with reinstitution of a different disease
      modifying therapy (DMT) within 1-6 months from the last natalizumab infusion.
