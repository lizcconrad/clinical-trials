      In summary, there is a high medical need for patients suffering from recurrent/progressive
      PCNSL. Targeting the PD-1 pathway may represent a very promising novel approach for the
      treatment of these patients.

      The objective of this study are:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate the Overall Response Rate (CR/PR) in patients treated with pembrolizumab for
           relapsed PCNSL after MTX-based first-line therapy

        -  To evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in subjects diagnosed with recurrent PCNSL

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To describe Best Overall Response categories (CR, PR, SD, PD) in patients treated with
           pembrolizumab for relapsed PCNSL after MTX-based first-line therapy

        -  To describe individual duration of response over time

        -  To assess progression-free survival in this patient population

        -  To assess overall survival in this patient population

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess PD-L1 as a predictive marker for response to pembrolizumab

          -  Has no diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment except for a maximum dose of 4 mg/day dexamethasone or equivalent doses of
             other corticosteroids or control of brain edema, which has been stable or decreased
             for at least 1 week prior to inclusion.

          -  Is not pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within
             the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening
             visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 24 hours of first pembrolizumab infusion. lf the urine test is positive or
             cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The serum
             pregnancy test must be negative for the patient to be eligible.

             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

             vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are
             live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Drug abuse or extensive use of alcohol.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study

             weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from
             adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

          -  History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
