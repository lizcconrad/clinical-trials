  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study consisting of 3
      phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up.

      To confirm the safety, ie, the absence of overlapping toxicities of the combination treatment
      regimen, an early safety monitoring will be performed based on approximately the first 12
      subjects randomized.

      A total of approximately 72 subjects will be included in the Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
      cohort and approximately 110 subjects in the Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The enrollment period for this study is expected to last approximately 15 months. The
      treatment and follow-up periods are expected to conclude approximately 12 months after the
      last subject is randomized. Therefore, the total duration of the study is expected to be
      approximately 27 months, from first subject enrolled until the last subject last visit.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive subcutaneous azacitidine alone or in
      combination with durvalumab. The treatment phase will be conducted in 2 stages, with an
      interim analysis for futility purpose, for each of the 2 study cohorts as outlined in Section
      9. The primary analysis will follow completion of Stage 2 with additional analyses conducted
      approximately 12 months after the last subject is enrolled, as described in Section 9.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity sampling will be performed in subjects receiving the
      combination therapy to assess durvalumab PK profile and development of antidrug antibodies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For both cohorts:

               1. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior
                  to any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.

               2. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or
                  2.

               3. Female subjects of childbearing potential1 may participate, providing they meet
                  the following conditions:

                    1. Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to
                       starting any IP therapy: serum pregnancy test at screening and negative
                       serum or urine pregnancy test (Investigator's discretion) within 72 hours
                       prior to starting treatment with IP (Cycle 1, Day 1). They must agree to
                       ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study (before beginning
                       each subsequent cycle of treatment), and after the last dose of any IP. This
                       applies even if the subject practices complete abstinence[2] from
                       heterosexual contact.

                    2. Agree to practice true abstinence2 (which must be reviewed on a monthly
                       basis and source documented) or agree to the use of a highly effective
                       method of contraceptionuse from 28 days prior to starting durvalumab or
                       azacitidine, and must agree to continue using such precautions while taking
                       durvalumab or azacitidine (including dose interruptions) and up to 90 days
                       after the last dose of durvalumab or azacitidine. Cessation of contraception
                       after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.

                    3. Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at
                       least 90 days after the last dose of IP.

                  c. Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at
                  least 90 days after the last dose of IP.

                  d. Refrain from egg cell donation while taking durvalumab and for at least 90
                  days after the last dose of durvalumab.

               1. has achieved menarche at some point

               2. has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or

               3. has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does
                  not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has
                  had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

                  True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception.

             4. Male subject must:

               1. Either practice true abstinence3 from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to avoid fathering a child, to use highly
                  effective methods of contraception, male condom plus spermicide during sexual
                  contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential (even if he
                  has undergone a successful vasectomy) from starting dose of IP (Cycle 1 Day 1),
                  including dose interruptions through 90 days after receipt of the last dose of
                  durvalumab or azacitidine.

               2. Refrain from semen or sperm donation while taking IP and for at least 90 days
                  after the last dose of IP.

                  True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception.

                  5. Understand and voluntarily sign a biomarker-specific component of the informed
                  consent form prior to any study-related procedures conducted.

              19. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP
                  (NOTE: Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine during the study
                  and for 30 days after the last dose of durvalumab).

              20. Unwilling or unable to complete subject reported outcome assessments without
                  assistance or with minimal assistance from trained site personnel and/or
                  caregiver.

              21. Subjects who have had clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) or
                  pulmonary leukostasis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or CNS leukemia.

                    -  Serum total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN. Higher levels are acceptable if these can
                       be attributed to active red blood cell precursor destruction within the bone
                       marrow (ie, ineffective erythropoiesis). Subjects are excluded if there is
                       evidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia manifested as a corrected
                       reticulocyte count of &gt; 2% with either a positive Coombs' test or over 50%
                       of indirect bilirubin

                    -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 × ULN.

                  inhibitors).

              32. Suspected or proven acute promyelocytic leukemia (French-American-British (FAB)
                  M3) based on morphology, immunophenotype, molecular assay, or karyotype; AML
                  associated with t(9;22) karyotype, biphenotypic acute leukemia or AML with
                  previous hematologic disorder such as chronic myelogenous leukemia or
                  myeloproliferative neoplasms.

              33. Acute myeloid leukemia associated with inv(16), t(8;21), t(16;16), t(15;17)
