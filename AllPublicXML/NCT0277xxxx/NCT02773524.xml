  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced Gastro-oesophageal Carcinoma (AGOC) has a poor prognosis, and there is no
      established standard treatment following failure of first and second line chemotherapy.
      Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) is an investigational oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (TKI) which targets angiogenic (VEGF, TIE-2), stromal (PDGF-β), and oncogenic (RAF, RET and
      KIT) receptor tyrosine kinases, and has shown activity in other solid tumours. Regorafenib
      was shown to prolong PFS across all regions/subgroups in INTEGRATE I The general aim of this
      study is to determine if regorafenib improves overall survival in refractory AGOC.

    <description>Regorafenib will be provided by the manufacturer. The regorafenib 40 mg tablet is coated, non-divisible, grey-orange-red, oval-shaped (length 16 mm, width 7 mm, thickness 4.9-5.6 mm) and 472 mg each in total weight. The packaging configuration is 30 tablets and a 3g desiccant capsule per bottle of regorafenib 40 mg.
The tablets are stored in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a desiccant cartridge inside. The tablets have to be stored in the original bottle at the temperature indicated on the bottle label. Depending on the packaging design (desiccant type, bottle size), storage Temperature can be either not above 25°C or not above 30°C as specified on the bottle label.
The bottle has to be kept tightly closed after first opening, and the desiccant has to remain in the bottle. Once the bottle is opened the tablets have to be discarded after 7 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults (18 years or over) with metastatic or locally recurrent gastro-oesophageal
             cancer which:

               1. has arisen in any primary gastro-oesophageal site (oesophago-gastric junction
                  (GOJ) or stomach); and

               2. is of adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma histology , and

               3. is evaluable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST
                  Version 1.1) by computed tomography (CT) scan performed within 21 days prior to
                  randomisation. A lesion in a previously irradiated area is eligible to be
                  considered as measurable disease as long as there is objective evidence of
                  progression of the lesion prior to study enrolment; and

               4. has failed or been intolerant to 2 lines of prior anti-cancer therapy for
                  recurrent/metastatic disease which must have included at least one platinum agent
                  and one fluoropyrimidine analogue.

             Note: Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy will be considered as
             first line treatment where people have relapsed or progressed within 6 months of
             completing treatment; Radiosensitising chemotherapy given solely for this purpose
             concurrent with palliative radiation will not be considered as a line of treatment.
             Ramucirumab monotherapy, or immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor, will be
             considered a line of treatment.

          5. Adequate renal function (Creatinine clearance &gt;50 ml/min) based on either the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula (Appendix 2), 24-hour urine or Glomerular Filtration Rate
             (GFR) scan; and serum creatinine ≤1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN).

             Participants being treated with an anti-coagulant, such as warfarin or heparin, will
             be allowed to participate provided that no prior evidence of an underlying abnormality
             in these parameters exists.

          7. Adequate cardiac function (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% or above
             the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the Institution (whichever is lower).

             Cardiac function should be assessed within 3 months prior to randomisation, but after
             completion of any anthracycline containing chemotherapy.
