  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using FitBit activity monitors, physical activity levels will be monitored in first year
      medical students. Body Composition will be measured as well.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using fitness trackers and exercise testing, it will determine if participating in a novel
      program that incorporates wellness into the academic term will improve fitness.

      An estimate, 120 students will enroll in this study. Men and women aged 18-55 years of age
      that are just entering medical school. Students who are currently pregnant will not be
      allowed to participate in this study.

      Participation will involve 2 visits at the start of the academic school year, and two visits
      at the end of the academic school year.

      These visits will entail you undergoing a body composition scan measured by an duel energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (iDEXA) machine. The scan takes approximately 15 minutes. Subjects may
      be asked to perform an exercise stress test on a treadmill. The exercise test is
      approximately 40 minutes. Subjects may be asked to participate in a fitness program 2x a
      week, and may be asked to wear a Fitbit Flexâ„¢ activity tracker on the wrist for the duration
      of the school year. Investigators will be accessing academic grades to use for statistical
      purposes only. Subject names will never be given to any other party other than the
      investigators involved.
