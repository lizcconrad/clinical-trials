      The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes related to the current practice of
      using a jet nebulizer (JN) with aerosol mask (AM) or mouthpiece (MP) versus a vibrating mesh
      nebulizer (VMN) with a valved-mask (VM) or MP in the treatment of acute moderate to severe
      asthma in Children's Medical Center Dallas Emergency Department (CMCED). The investigators
      hypothesize that using the combination of a VMN and VM or MP will result in fewer hospital
      admissions and decrease length of stay in CMCED when compared to the current practice of
      using a JN and AM or MP.
