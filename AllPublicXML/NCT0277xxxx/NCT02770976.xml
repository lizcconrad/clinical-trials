  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the effect of a wide range of assistance levels on respiratory
      pattern, breathing variability including tidal volume and peak inspiratory pressure during
      neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) in preterm infants. The investigators also aim to
      explore whether the effects of NAVA on the electrical activity of diaphragm (Edi) signal
      amplitude, work of breathing and comfort of preterm infants.
