      Introduction Overweight and obesity are characterised by excess fat, which results in weight
      gain and is identified by the Body Mass Index (BMI). Studies show that overweight and obesity
      are the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, which
      begins prenatally. Various studies have shown that physical exercise is an important
      component of weight loss programmes and that it also benefits the metabolic profile. Other
      authors have reported that greater weight loss is achieved by a programme that includes both
      diet and exercise, rather than either of these alone.

      Aim The aim of this study is to analyse an intervention based on play as a means of improving
      the body composition of children with overweight or obesity.

      Design / Method The design of the Kids-Play study is based on cases and controls. The study
      was conducted in Granada (Spain) from October 2014 to June 2015. The analysis sample of 54
      children was divided into two groups: cases, consisting of 27 children, who participated in
      an intervention programme based on physical activity, play and nutritional advice (to both
      the child and the parents); and controls, another 27 children, who received only nutritional
      advice.

    <measure>The level of daily physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The level of daily physical activity was assessed using ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers, which were worn on the right hip by all children in the study population for seven days, except during the hours of sleep. In this way it was possible to objectively analyse whether the study group met the WHO recommended levels of activity for their age group, and to determine the differences between cases and controls.</description>

    <description>The intervention consisted of physical activity based on play, with four 90-minute sessions per week for nine months (the school year). Attendance at all sessions was recommended, and the children were obliged to participate in at least two sessions every week, in order to perform the minimum level of physical activity recommended for their ages. This attendance pattern was adopted to provide flexibility for families who might have difficulty in attending all the sessions, thus enabling them to participate in the study. In parallel, twice-monthly theoretical and practical sessions of nutritional advice were given to the children and their families. The study group performed the physical activity and received the nutritional advice, while the control group received only the theoretical and practical sessions on nutrition.</description>
