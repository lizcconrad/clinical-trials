  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare the trajectories of improvement for three different patterns of
      twice-daily rTMS in major depression: two daily sessions of dorsomedial prefrontal rTMS
      delivered at 0 min vs. 30 min vs. 60 min intervals.

             mg daily (or equivalent) or any dose of an anticonvulsant due to the potential to
             limit rTMS efficacy
