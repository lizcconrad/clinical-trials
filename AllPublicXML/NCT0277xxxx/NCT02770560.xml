  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombotic dysfunction is a common complication of tunneled cuffed catheters (TCC) leading to
      inadequate dialysis dose, need to catheter replacement with as consequence progressive
      exclusion of vascular sites. Thrombolytic agent can be used as therapeutic locking solution
      to dissolve the clotting formed in of around the catheter lumen. There are few studies on the
      optimal approach of TCC-related thrombosis with thrombolytic containing locking solution
      (dose, number of administrations, timing of administration - intra or interdialytic use). The
      primary objective of this retrospective study was to compare the efficacy of inter versus
      intradialytic Urokinase containing locking solution on restoration of the TCC blood flow. The
      investigators also assess the question of multiple administrations of Urokinase are more
      efficient than one single administration
