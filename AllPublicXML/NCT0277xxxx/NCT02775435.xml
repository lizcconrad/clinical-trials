  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of carboplatin and paclitaxel or nano particle albumin-bound paclitaxel
      (nab-paclitaxel) with or without pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) in adults with first line
      metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The primary hypotheses are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs: 1) Progression-free
      Survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as
      assessed by a blinded central imaging vendor compared to placebo, and 2) Overall Survival
      (OS).
