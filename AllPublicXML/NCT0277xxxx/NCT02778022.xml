      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PriCARE in decreasing child
      behavior problems and improving parenting capacity and skills at 2 primary care clinics in
      Philadelphia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child behavioral concerns are common among families served by The Children's Hospital of
      Philadelphia (CHOP) urban primary care centers. To address this, we developed Child Adult
      Relationship Enhancement Model in Primary Care Parenting Program (PriCARE), a scaled down
      version of Parent Child Interaction Therapy designed for urban primary care clinics. The
      objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the efficacy of the modified PriCARE to decrease
      child behavior problems and improve parenting capacity and skills and 2) understand parents'
      perceptions of the efficacy of PriCARE and strategies for improving its implementation and
      dissemination. We will perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of
      the modified PriCARE on decreasing child behavior problems and improving positive parenting
      among 2- to 6-year-old children with behavior problems and their parents at CHOP's South
      Philadelphia Primary Care Center and Karabots Pediatric Care Center. We intend to randomize
      120 child-parent pairs (240 subjects) to receive PriCARE immediately plus usual treatment
      (intervention group) and 60 child-parent pairs (120 subjects) to receive PriCARE at a later
      time plus usual treatment (control group) for a total of 180 child-parent pairs (360
      subjects). All child-parent pairs randomized to the control group will be placed on a
      waitlist and offered PriCARE after completion of data collection. Child behavior and
      parenting style will be measured at baseline (time 1), at 6-19 weeks (time 2), and at 14-27
      weeks (time 3).

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine if the modified PriCARE program decreases the intensity and frequency of behavior problems in 2- to 6-year-old children as measured by the change in ECBI score after 3-7 months compared to usual treatment for child behavior problems at CHOP's South Philadelphia Primary Care Center or Karabots Pediatric Care Center. As sub-analyses, we will determine 1) the impact of caregiver depression (as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI) on the efficacy of PriCARE intervention to decrease behavioral problems and 2) the impact of the number of PriCARE sessions attended on the efficacy of the PriCARE intervention to decrease behavioral problems.</description>

    <description>Parent-child dyads assigned to the immediate PriCARE group will receive the PriCARE intervention as soon as possible plus usual treatment. The intervention will last approximately 6-8 weeks. Each group will have 4-13 participants and 2 facilitators and will meet 6 times for 1-2 hours per session. Parents are expected to practice the skills they learn with their children between sessions.</description>

    <description>The delayed PriCARE group will not receive the PriCARE intervention until data collection for this study is complete (in 3-6 months). In addition, they will be immediately offered usual treatment. Under usual treatment, patients will be referred to a behavioral health specialist at the discretion of their pediatrician and the office social worker for additional diagnosis and treatment and/or provided with a 1-2 page informational handout on child behavior problems from the CHOP patient care manual.</description>

    <description>PriCARE is a group parent training program designed to improve child behavior, improve parent-child relationships, and decrease stress for parents. PriCARE utilizes the 3 P skills (Praise, Paraphrase and Point-out-Behavior) and includes a trauma and stress education component. The training starts with parenting skills focused on giving attention to children's positive, pro-social behaviors, while ignoring minor misbehaviors. The second phase of the training teaches techniques for giving children effective commands in order to set age-appropriate limits. We piloted PriCARE and demonstrated promising findings. The PriCARE intervention has been slightly modified from the pilot version to increase engagement and attendance.</description>
