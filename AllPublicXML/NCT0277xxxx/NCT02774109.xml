      Purpose:

      To investigate the effects of fish oil on patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.

      Material and Methods Subjects: 52 participants will be recruited from outpatient department
      of physical medicine and rehabilitation department and by poster.

      Duration: 2016.04.21-2017.03.31

      Methods: The participants will be randomly divided into the experimental group and the
      control group through the draw, with 26 patients in each group. Participants in the
      experimental group receive fish oil plus physical modality treatment. Participants in the
      control group receive placebo plus physical modality treatment.

      Assessment: Before the therapy starts, patients who match the inclusion criteria will be
      evaluated using tools mentioned below:

      General data: age, sex, body height, body weight, occupation, exercise habit

      Rate current, best and worst pain intensity of low back pain during the previous week with
      100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)

      Measure pressure pain threshold with pressure algometer

      Measure lumbar spine range of motion in flexion and extension with tape measure

      Assess endurance of back extensor muscles with Biering-Sorenson test

      Classify the pain origin (nociceptive or neuropathic) with Chinese version of the
      identification pain (ID pain) questionnaire

      Assess the impact of low back pain to daily life with Chinese version of The Roland Morris
      Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire (RMQ)

      Assess the impact of low back pain to work performance and fatigue with Chinese version of
      The Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ) and the Occupational Burnout Inventory

      Assess the impact of low back pain to sleep quality with Chinese version of the Athens
      Insomnia Scale

      Draw 10ml blood for blood test (ESR and hs-CRP)

      Participants will be followed up 4 weeks and 8 weeks after therapy starts and re-assessed of
      pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, lumbar spine range of motion, back extensor muscles
      endurance, and the impact of low back pain to daily life, work, and sleep quality. Blood test
      will be committed again after therapy course finished.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common symptom in modern society. However, nearly 85% of those who seek
      medical care for low back pain have no specific history and no specific finding in image
      study, and therefore do not receive a specific diagnosis. This type of low back pain is
      termed &quot;nonspecific low back pain.&quot; Fish oil contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid,
      including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA can reduce
      the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. They are also the precursors of the E-resolvin and
      D-resolvin that suppress inflammatory cytokine production and act to resolve inflammation.
      Several previous studies showed that fish oil has the effect of anti-inflammation and pain
      reduction without side effect that affecting stomach and renal function. Therefore, fish oil
      is considered a new type of NSAID, and many studies are investigating its effect of
      anti-inflammation and pain reduction on different diseases. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of fish oil on patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.
