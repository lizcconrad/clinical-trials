  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to define and evaluate the efficacy of Aquatic Locomotor Training
      (ALT) compared to overground Locomotor Training in improving ambulatory function and
      health-related quality of life. The investigators hypothesize, that Aquatic Locomotor
      Training is capable of producing outcomes that are as good as, or better than, overground
      Locomotor Training.

      Aquatic Locomotor Training may be another tool for therapists to utilize for clinical
      improvements in function and gait for the Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) population.

      To determine the efficacy of Aquatic Locomotor Training on improving rehabilitation outcomes
      among patients with incomplete traumatic cervical Spinal Cord Injury by assessing these
      parameters:

        1. Walking speed and endurance

        2. Functional balance and fall risk

        3. HRQoL

      To describe the feasibility of conducting Aquatic Locomotor Training as an Locomotor Training
      modality for the rehabilitation of patients with incomplete traumatic cervical Spinal Cord
      Injury.

    <description>Aquatic Locomotor Training is a Locomotor Training technique utilizing an underwater treadmill to help increase a patient's independence and function. Aquatic Locomotor Training may require up to three people to obtain desirable gait kinematics: one at each of the patient's legs, and one at the patient's pelvis; however, typically with ambulatory patients, only one therapist is utilized. Therapists are highly trained, using their legs and feet to provide properly timed underwater cues throughout the gait cycle.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Locomotor Training encompasses a variety of interventions ranging from BWSTT to overground gait training to robotic-assisted walk training. Overground Locomotor Training, depending upon the technique used, can require up to four people to complete the intervention (one at each participant's leg, one at the participant's trunk and/or pelvis, and one monitoring the computer and/or treadmill).</description>
