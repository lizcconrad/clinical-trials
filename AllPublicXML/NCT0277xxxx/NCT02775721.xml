  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor nutritional status and malnutrition are prevalent for patients undergoing treatment for
      head and neck cancer. Inadequate dietary intake is multi factorial, with patients
      experiencing dysphagia and or anorexia caused by various cancer treatments. Current standard
      practice utilizes Gastrostomy Tube placement to manage adverse nutritional effects related to
      Head and Neck cancer treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of life and educational intervention
      outcomes of Head and Neck Cancer patients who have a gastrostomy tube placed per standard of
      care.

      A high incident of Gastrostomy tube replacement occurs related to clogged, dislodged, and/or
      pulled out tubes. In addition, patients not eating or drinking after Gastrostomy tube
      placement, compounded by complications related to radiation treatment, results in decreased
      swallowing function. Inadequate swallow function, especially when combined with inadequate
      use of Gastrostomy tube, due to non-functional tube or insufficient patient knowledge in use
      of tube, results in poor nutritional status and excessive weight loss.
