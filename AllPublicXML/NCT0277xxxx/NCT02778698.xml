      This expanded access protocol is for children that cannot get enough nutrients from food and
      must receive nutrition through a vein. The standard nutrition given through a vein is blend
      that has soybean fat. If this is given over a long period of time, it can cause problems. It
      can lead to severe and/or permanent injury to the liver.

      It is believed that a type of fish oil blend, called Omegaven®, may be used in place of the
      soybean fat blend. The Omegaven® fish oil blend may greatly reduce the risk of liver injury.

      Omegaven® is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is only offered under
      an &quot;expanded access&quot; protocol as an alternative to the soybean fat blend.
