    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to determine if providing cognitive-behavioral
      therapy of Insomnia and nightmares (CBTin) and Cognitive Processing Therapy of PTSD (CPT)
      results in greater PTSD and sleep symptom reduction than CPT only. A secondary objective is
      to determine if the sequencing of CBTl&amp;N before or after CPT results in differential effects
      on PTSD and sleep symptom reduction.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1-month post-treatment (i.e., after the completion of all 18 sessions, not to exceed 22 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 (Weathers, Litz, et al., 2013) is a structured diagnostic interview and gold standard for assessing PTSD. The scale also assesses social and occupational functioning, dissociation, and the validity of symptom reports. The CAPS was revised to match DSM-5. The CAPS was revised to accommodate the changes made in DSM-5, to reduce administration time, and to facilitate learning administration and scoring procedures. The CAPS-5 will be the primary outcome of PTSD symptom severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist -DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1-month post-treatment (i.e., after the completion of all 18 sessions, not to exceed 22 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 (Weathers, Blake, et al., 2013) is a 20-item self-report measure designed to assess PSTSD symptoms as defined by the DSM-5. The PCL-5 will be the secondary outcome of PTSD symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Diary Sleep Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1-month post-treatment (i.e., after the completion of all 18 sessions, not to exceed 22 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep diaries will be used for seven days to measure subjective sleep patterns (Carney et al., 2012). Participants will be asked to make daily diary entries with an estimate of their sleep the night before (e.g., bedtime, sleep onset). Questions will also assess nightmare frequency and severity. Average sleep efficiency ((total sleep time/time in bed) x 100) derived from the sleep diaries will be the primary outcome of insomnia symptom severity.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18-50.

          -  Chronic Insomnia, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-fifth edition
             (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) assessed with Structured Clinical
             Interview for DSM-5 Sleep Disorders (SCISD).

          -  Chronic Nightmare Disorder, as defined by DSM-5, assessed with the SCISD.

          -  PTSD, as defined by DSM-5, assessed by Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress
             Scale-5 (CAPS-5).

          -  Active duty military and recently discharged Veterans at Fort Hood eligible for
             treatment at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC).

          -  History of having deployed in support of combat operations following 9/11, assessed by
             self-report.

          -  Stable on psychotropic and/or hypnotic medications and/or interventions for sleep
             (e.g., Continuous Positive Air Pressure for sleep apnea) administered by other
             providers for at least one month assessed by self-report and review of medical record.

          -  Willing to refrain from new behavioral health or medication treatment for issues
             pertaining to sleep, PTSD, or nightmares during participation in the study.

          -  Indication that the individual plans to be in the area for the 5 months following the
             first assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have been re-deployed from a theater of operation less than 3 months.

          -  Current suicide or homicide risk meriting crisis intervention as assessed by the
             Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), The Depressive Symptom Index - Suicidality
             Subscale (DSI-SS), or the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI).

          -  Inability to speak and read English.

          -  Moderate to severe brain damage, assessed by the inability to comprehend the baseline
             questionnaires.

          -  Pregnancy, assessed by self-report and review of medical record, because sleep
             disturbances due to pregnancy may be the result of different mechanisms and the
             proposed instruments and treatments have not been validated in this population.

          -  Current circadian rhythm, environmental, sleep deprivation, or hypersomnia sleep
             disorder, assessed by self-report because CBTin has not been validated in these
             populations.

          -  Other untreated sleep disorders to include individuals with clinically significant
             obstructive sleep apnea (Respiratory Disturbance Index &gt;5/hr), periodic limb movement
             disorder (PLMD; &gt;15/hr with arousals), nocturnal seizures, or a parasomnia (e.g.,
             sleepwalking, confusional arousals, nocturnal eating and drinking syndrome), based on
             criteria from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-third edition
             (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2013). Individuals meeting criteria for one of
             the above sleep disorders will be seen for clinical care at the CRDAMC Sleep Center.
             Once the aforementioned sleep disorder is stably treated, individuals meeting the
             study criteria for insomnia, nightmares, and PTSD can be reassessed for participation
             in this study.

          -  Sleep efficiency &gt;85%, as assessed by the sleep diary.

          -  Serious mental health diagnosis (e.g., bipolar disorder or psychosis) assessed with
             review of baseline questionnaires, review of medical record, and/or Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 7.0 Mania module).

          -  Currently engaged in evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD (i.e., Prolonged Exposure
             Therapy or Cognitive Processing Therapy) or Insomnia or nightmares (i.e., Cognitive
             Behavioral Therapy) by self-report and review of medical record.
