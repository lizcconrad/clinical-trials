    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation
      or rectal bacteriotherapy is superior to standard vancomycin in patients with recurrent
      Clostridium Difficile infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial infection in the western
      world. CDI is associated with high morbidity and mortality and is a great burden for the
      health care system leading Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to identify it as
      one of three most important/urgent threats to public health.

      Despite antimicrobial treatment of CDI, 20% of the patients have recurrence of CDI. Due to a
      dysbiosis in the gut microbiota the antimicrobial treatment seems to be less effective.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an alternative treatment for recurrent CDI. Studies
      have shown a cure rate up to 90% in patients with recurrent CDI. One alternative to FMT is
      rectal bacteriotherapy (RBT) which is a standardized bacterial culture made in the laboratory
      consisting of 12 different bacteria. RBT has never been investigated in a clinical trial.

      The project is a randomized controlled trial including 450 patients with recurrent CDI will
      be, after accepting participation, allocated to receive vancomycin alone or vancomycin
      followed by either FMT or RBT. The patients will be followed up for 180 days. Cure is defined
      as resolution of CDI symptoms 90 days after treatment.

    <description>Clinical cure is defined as patient-reported abscence of Clostridium difficile infection 90 days after treatment. The investigator will call the patient by telephone and fill out a digital questionnaire. Number of patients with clinical cure of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection will be divided into two groups according to numbers of recurrences of CDI;
Group 1; patients with one recurrence
Group 2; patients with 2 or more recurrences. The division will be done based on patient records and the questionnaire. The information will be aggregated in the digital journal unique to this trial. The numbers of patients with clinical cure in the two groups will be compared to see if one group response better to study treatment than the other.</description>
