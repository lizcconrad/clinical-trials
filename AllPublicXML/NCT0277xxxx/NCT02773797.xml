  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A variety of medications have been used to treat the anxiety, discomfort, and fear associated
      with continuous and sudden episodic breathlessness in patients with advanced respiratory
      disease. Opioids and benzodiazepines, used alone or in combination, are commonly prescribed
      for this distressing symptom. Clinicians are concerned about the adverse effects of opioids,
      especially respiratory depression, so they frequently prescribe benzodiazepines. Recent
      studies have shown that benzodiazepine use is associated with adverse respiratory outcomes in
      older adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Dexmedetomidine may be an
      alternative to current drug therapies for breathlessness. Dexmedetomidine produces a dose
      dependent sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without respiratory depression or cognitive
      dysfunction.

      The drug can be administered intranasally (IN-DEX) to induce light to moderate sedation of
      several hours duration.

      The objective of the research is to assess the dose dependent safety and efficacy of
      intranasal dexmedetomidine compared to intranasal saline (placebo) in clinically stable
      patients with severe COPD. This will be accomplished in a staffed acute care setting with
      routine vital signs monitoring and continuous pulse oximetry. Patients will be assessed
      objectively and subjectively for their level of sedation by validated sedation scales.

      The study is an extension of a similarly designed pilot study which did not include a placebo
      comparison. Results of the study will be helpful to design additional trials with intranasal
      dexmedetomidine in acutely symptomatic COPD patients, exertional dyspnea and exercise
      performance, and dyspnea treatment comparisons.
