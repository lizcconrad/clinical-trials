  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether vitamin D is effective in the prevention of
      hepatocellular carcinoma in those patients with chronic hepatitis B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will be identified from the follow-up cohort of chronic hepatitis B in
      the third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (3rd SYSU). The hepatologists at the
      3rd SYSU's Infectious Disease Institute will ask each potential participant if she/he is
      interested in participating. If the patient expresses an interest in the study, one of the
      researchers will meet with the patient when he/she is at the 3rd SYSU for a regular
      appointment and will describe the study to the potential participant. If a patient continues
      to be interested in participating, she/he will be given a copy of the review board approved
      consent document to read. The consent document will be used as a guide for explaining the
      study in detail to the patient. The participant allocated to the experimental group will be
      contacted by one of the investigators on the research team and instructed to begin taking 2
      tablets per day (800 IU total) of vitamin D3 besides their regular anti-virus treatment.
      Those patients allocated in the control group will be informed that they are not to take any
      vitamin D3 and they will be followed as controls for this study. The researcher will
      investigate general treatment benefits and the potential to reduce the development of
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as liver cancer. Improvement of treatment benefits
      will be determined by interviews with patients, the level of HBsAg and HBeAg, the development
      of liver fibrosis and evidence of HCC on routine imaging.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 with chronic hepatitis B and under the oral
             anti-virus treatment followed at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen
             University, Guangzhou, China, will be offered entry into this study. The diagnosis of
             chronic Hepatitis B will be based on that they had been positive for hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg) for at least six months, and were positive for HBeAg or
             negative for HBeAg with detectable HBV DNA at screening.

          -  No evidence of HCC on entry imaging study.

          -  Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score under 22 (a MELD score over 22 would
             predict a 3 month mortality rate of approximately 20%).

          -  Not currently participating in another intervention study.

          -  Not pregnant or lactating, and willing to use effective contraception during study
             period.

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent according to national/local regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma within 6 months after enrollment,

          -  a serum alanine aminotransferase level more than 10 times the upper limit of normal,

          -  an elevated serum creatinine level,

          -  any diagnosis of kidney stones,

          -  a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism or other serious disturbance of calcium metabolism
             in the past 5 years,

          -  any evidence of autoimmune hepatitis, coinfection with hepatitis C or D virus or human
             immunodeficiency virus,

          -  other serious concurrent illness (e.g., alcoholism, uncontrolled diabetes, or cancer),

          -  treatment with immunomodulatory within the 6 months before screening,

          -  treatment with any investigational drug within the 30 days before the study began.
