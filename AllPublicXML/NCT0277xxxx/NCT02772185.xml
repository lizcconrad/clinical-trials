  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind, sham-controlled clinical trial aiming to compare the long-term
      effects of stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Sixty early AD patients will take part in
      a phase II/III clinical study over a 1-year period. The study involves transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS), cognitive training (CT), detailed neuropsychological and
      neurological testing. These assessments will occur at baseline, then again at two month (end
      point). Those who achieve clinical improvement with neurostimulation and cognitive therapy
      will be invited to receive treatment for 12 months as part of a follow-up study.

      The patients will be randomized into 1 of 4 groups: active tDCS plus real CT, active tDCS
      plus placebo CT, sham tDCS plus real CT, sham tDCS plus placebo CT. Each group will receive
      treatment for 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week for 8 weeks.
