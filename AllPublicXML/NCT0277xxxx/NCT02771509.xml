  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of BB3 in preventing AKI
      compared to placebo when administered to patients at risk for developing acute kidney injury
      (AKI) following cardiac surgical procedures involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angion Biomedica Corp. has developed a small molecule hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor
      (HGF/SF) mimetic, termed BB3, which exerts significant nephroprotective effects in several
      preclinical renal injury models. Angion intends to develop BB3 as a therapy to prevent and/or
      treat acute kidney injury. BB3 is a new molecular entity and the proposed treatment is novel
      since no drug is currently available with an indication to prevent and/or treat acute kidney
      injury.

      This is a randomized, prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter study. Patients who will be undergoing a surgical procedure involving CPB and are
      at elevated risk pre-surgery for AKI will be eligible to participate in the study. Patients
      will be randomized 1:1 to receive either BB3 or placebo (normal saline) immediately after
      surgery. Study drug will be administered for a total of 4 daily intravenous (IV) infusions.
      The first post-operative dose MUST be started within 4 hours of completing CPB. The second
      dose will be administered 24 ± 2 hours after completing CPB, and the third and fourth doses
      will be administered 24 ± 2 hours after each previous dose.

      Patients will be followed for safety, PK (in a subset of patients), and efficacy up to Day
      90, with Day 1 being the day of the first infusion of study drug. Patients will be assessed
      daily through Day 7 and then on Days 14, 30 and 90.

      Efficacy endpoints include assessment of post-CPB renal injury, expressed as percent increase
      in sCr above Baseline over time and the maximum percent increase in sCr following CPB, from
      24 hours after end of CPB through Day 5; the proportion of patients reaching each KDIGO stage
      or having no AKI at specified time points through Day 30; and analyses among patients who
      develop AKI assessing time to recovery or reduction in KDIGO stage.

      Approximately 100 patients will be randomized; 50 patients will be randomized to BB3 and 50
      patients to placebo.
