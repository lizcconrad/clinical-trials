  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the project is to assess whether there is an interaction between the
      effects of ethanol and energy drinks on driving performance.

      Secondary objectives include: to evaluate subjective effects (drunkenness) after
      administration of alcohol and energy drinks, to assess pharmacokinetics of alcohol, caffeine
      and taurine after alcohol and energy drinks administration and to assess if there is an
      increased risk of bleeding when both drinks are taken together.

    <textblock>
      Consumption of energy drinks improve psychomotor performance and alertness. These drinks
      contain mostly caffeine, taurine and vitamins. Its consumption associated with ethanol may
      reduce feelings of drunkenness as the stimulant effects of caffeine could counteract the
      depressing effects of ethanol on the central nervous system. Reducing the perception of
      intoxication may predispose the intoxicated person to engage in risky behaviors such as
      driving under the influence of ethanol and therefore can increase the risk of a traffic
      accident. Furthermore, the combination of both beverages may increase the risk of bleeding in
      case of injury as anticoagulant effects have been described for ethanol while antiplatelet
      effects have been described for caffeine and taurine. A randomized clinical trial will be
      performed in healthy volunteers administering 4 treatment conditions: alcohol+energy drink,
      alcohol+placebo of energy drink, placebo of alcohol+energy drink and placebo of
      alcohol+placebo of energy drink. A multiple dose will be administered separated by 1 hour.
