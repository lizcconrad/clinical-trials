  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to compare the verification accuracy and hearing-aid outcomes
      between the traditional, fitting approach where the patient is present during the visit and a
      coupler-based fitting approach where the patient is not present and mailed their hearing
      aids. If the coupler-based fitting protocol tested in this study as effective as the
      traditional fitting protocol, then patients receiving replacement hearing aids may circumvent
      a face-to-face visit.

      This study will incorporate a verification technique that simulates the patient's actual ear
      during probe microphone verification measurements, called real-ear to coupler difference
      (RECD). Because the patient's ear is not used during the RECD measurement, but rather
      simulated, the patient would not need to be present during the RECD verification. This RECD
      hearing aid verification can occur in the clinic after which the hearing aids will be mailed
      to the patient. This study will compare the fitting accuracy and outcomes between the two
      approaches.

    <time_frame>1 month post-fitting</time_frame>
    <description>The listener nominates up to five listening goals. After hearing-aid use, the listener assesses two outcomes for each goal. One outcome is the degree of change? relative to the patient's unaided experience. Responses are recorded on a categorical scale from 'worse' to 'much better'. The second outcome is the final satisfactory 'aided' ability for each goal as measured on a categorical scale from hardy ever (10%) to almost always (95%).</description>

    <measure>Device Oriented Subjective Outcome (DOSO) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-fitting</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is comprised of 28 items making up the following six subscales related to listening performance with hearing aids: (1) speech cues, (2) listening effort, (3) pleasantness,(4) quietness, (5) convenience, and (6) use. Responses from 'not at all' (1 point) to tremendously (7 points) are recorded for each item.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-fitting</time_frame>
    <description>The SADL questionnaire has 15 items that examine self-reported hearing-aid satisfaction. The following four subscales are included: (1) positive effect, (2) negative features, (3) personal image, and (4) service and cost.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  no more than a moderate sensorineural hearing loss (defined as &lt; 60 dB HL pure-tone
             average at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz AU)

          -  experienced BTE hearing-aid users who are obtaining replacement VA-issued BTE hearing
             aids coupled to a custom earmold that is simply an upgrade in model with the same
             style earmold

          -  ability to read and write in English as determined by reading a few sentences from the
             consent document aloud so that self-report measures can be completed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  outer or middle ear pathology as determined by otoscopy, immittance, and/or
             audiometric testing (e.g., conductive or mixed losses)

          -  lack of phone or non-use of the phone as the participants will be required to conduct
             a telephone interview after they obtain their replacement hearing aids

          -  unwilling or unable to be mailed hearing aids

          -  co-morbid condition that would preclude their participation as determined by a chart
             review
