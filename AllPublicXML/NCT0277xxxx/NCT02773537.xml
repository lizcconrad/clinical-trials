  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this pilot study will be to develop a clinically meaningful,
      patient-centric, and pragmatic protocol to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of
      different strategies for achievement of the ideal balance between analgesia and functional
      mobility following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain management for total knee replacement (TKR) patients has evolved rapidly over the
      previous decade. The most recent advances in anesthesia include peripheral nerve blockade,
      which offers the promise of earlier postoperative mobilization in addition to effective pain
      relief. The rapidity with which these advancements have been adopted seems to have outpaced
      the science to support them. The result has been the institution of countless combinations of
      perioperative pain management strategies in centers nationwide with little standardization,
      consistency, or objective evidence. The extent to which these various strategies achieve safe
      and effective perioperative pain control or functional preservation remains poorly defined.
      This prospective randomized control trial will aim to identify meaningful patient-centric
      outcome measures, differentiate from among three perioperative TKR anesthetic and analgesic
      strategies, and provide a template for interdisciplinary collaboration among orthopedic
      surgeons, anesthesiologists, physical therapists, and patients. With the knowledge gained
      further study will continue to refine the most optimal early pain control protocol.

      All primary TKR patients undergoing surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina who
      are able to receive spinal anesthesia will be randomized prior to surgery to one of three
      forms of lower limb nerve blockade: 1) Continuous femoral nerve catheter plus single
      injection sciatic nerve block, 2) Adductor canal catheter plus selective tibial nerve block,
      3) Adductor canal catheter alone. All patients will receive additional standardized pain
      medications as well as early mobilization with physical therapy. The primary outcome measure
      will be postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS), with secondary measures to include
      validated patient-reported outcome measures, objective functional measures (timed-up-and-go
      (TUG), patient satisfaction scores, length of stay, discharge disposition, and complications.
      The investigators plan to enroll approximately 90 patients. This will allow us to reach our
      randomization goal of at least 75 patients while taking into account withdrawals. The 75
      patients will be randomized into the three treatment three treatment arms over a 6-month
      recruitment period, with a 3 month follow-up for patient reported outcome and satisfaction
      data. A focus group will facilitate patient engagement and provide information for generation
      of a preference survey to guide future study design.

    <measure>Functional Outcome Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 days after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Functional outcome measures will be administered by members of the physical and occupational therapy team, who typically evaluate and treat patients once on the day of surgery and twice daily each day thereafter. They will document the patient's ability to perform independent terminal knee extension and grade knee buckling with ambulation on a scale of 0-2 during each encounter. Additionally, in the morning of postoperative day #1, a Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living score will be calculated. On the morning of postoperative day #2, the therapist will document distance walked by the patient, passive range of motion (flexion and extension), a timed up-and-go test (TUG), and calculate the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) score.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>At three months, a random subset of four patients from each randomization arm will be invited to participate in a focus group. The purpose of the focus group will be to facilitate patient engagement with the hope of fulfilling our primary aim of this study, which is to identify the most meaningful outcome measures for perioperative analgesia among the TKA patients themselves. Qualitative data obtained during the recorded session will prompt discussion related to the overall patient experience in addition to individual experiences related specifically to analgesia, postoperative mobility, transitioning to the out-patient setting, and involvement in a randomized trial.</description>
