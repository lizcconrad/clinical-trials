    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare two closed-loop strategies in terms of glycemic
      control in Type 1 Diabetes during a camp setting.

      The proposed study is a three-segment feasibility study. One segment is a proof of concept
      study (with two parts) conducted as in-patient clinic study ,the second segment is two-arms,
      cross-over, randomized and single-center and the third segment is four-arms, parallel,
      randomized and single-center, in diabetes camp study in subjects with type 1 diabetes on
      insulin pump therapy.

      Segment 1 will be divided into two parts: part 1 is a single arm pilot study aim to asses
      logistical and safety issues in 12 patients and part 2 is a randomized cross over study aim
      to evaluate glucose performance using closed-loop control. Part 2-is a randomized cross-over
      (two arms) in-patient study: A total of 12 patients will participate in this part of the
      study. Following the run-in period subjects will be randomized to participate in two periods
      of closed-loop treatment, each period will last 36 hours in hospital setting. During the
      first period, glycemic control will be controlled by the Hybrid closed-loop system and during
      the second period by Hybrid Logic closed-loop system. The sequence of treatment first period
      HCL therapy than AHCL or vice versa will be randomly assigned.

      Segment 2 is a randomized cross-over (two arms) Camp Study including up to 30 patients.
      Following the run-in period subjects will be randomized to participate in two periods of
      closed-loop treatment, each period will last 2days in a camp setting, the total duration of
      the camp will be up to 6 days. In one period, glycemic control will be controlled by the
      Hybrid closed-loop system and another period by Hybrid Logic closed-loop system. The sequence
      of treatment first period HCL therapy than AHCL or vice versa will be randomly assigned.

      Segment 3 is a randomized, parallel (four arm) Camp Study including up to 80 patients.
      Following the run-in period subjects will be randomized to participate in one of 4
      intervention arms of closed-loop treatment in camp settings. The duration of the camp will be
      12 days in which glycemic control will be controlled by one of 4 versions of closed-loop
      system: Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) or one of 3 versions of Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL).
