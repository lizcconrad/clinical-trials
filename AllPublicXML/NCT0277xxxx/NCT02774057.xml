  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by chronic
      inflammation limited to the mucosal layer of the colon. Anemia is a consistent clinical
      feature of IBD. It is encountered in one third of IBD patients, and is the most common
      extraintestinal complication of this disease. Anemia has a significant impact on the quality
      of life of affected patients. Many patients with IBD frequently complain of chronic fatigue
      commonly caused by anemia and this may be as debilitating to patients as abdominal pain and
      diarrhea. Anemia in IBD is multifactorial, but is most commonly the result of iron deficiency
      anemia (IDA) and rarely due to anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Oral iron supplementation has
      been used traditionally for the treatment of IDA but studies have shown that it may result in
      disease exacerbation by increasing oxygen free radicals within the lumen of the gut via the
      Fenton reaction. A recent study done in University Hospitals Birmingham, United Kingdom, has
      shown that treatment with oral iron results in failure to control anemia in 2 out of 3 IBD
      patients, which is in part due to the side effects reported by over half of patients.
      Captafer is a new iron-free oral preparation that contains a special type of oligosaccharides
      from fish muscle tissue able to make the intestine absorb 3 to 5 times more iron in
      comparison to the &quot;meat factor&quot;. Moreover, Captafer contains other vitamins and supplements
      that improve anemia.

      Twenty patients from the outpatient department at AUBMC will be enrolled in this open label
      cross-over trial. Patients with active left sided ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or
      active extensive disease with proven IDA will be enrolled. Study patients will receive the
      treatment following informed consent and will be followed up regularly by the study
      coordinator for side effects, compliance and adherence. A blood test for hemoglobin and
      hematocrit and other biomarkers of iron stores and repletion will be done on all patients at
      baseline and then after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of therapy. In case patients did not tolerate
      either treatment, they will be switched to the other treatment after a washout period of 2
      weeks.

      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Captafer which is an
      iron-free (one fixed non disclosed dose) food supplement given twice daily, to oral iron
      therapy given at a dose of 195 mg twice daily for the same period of time in an open label
      cross-over trial in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease patients.

      Primary endpoint:

      Tolerability

      Secondary endpoints

      Response to iron repletion as using hemoglobin and hematocrit as surrogates Compliance and
      adherence (monthly pill count)

      The study sample size was calculated based on the primary end points of tolerability with a
      significance level (α) of 0.05, a Power (1-β) of 0.8 with an expected 90% tolerability and
      adherence for Captafer vs. 50% for oral iron. At these parameters, and taking a
      non-inferiority limit of 5%, the sample size was calculated to be 20.

    <description>A 4 point (0,1,2,3) numerical scale will be used to assess the presence and frequency of drug related side effects experienced throughout the study, with scoring done at 4 instances: at baseline prior to initiating the first arm of therapy, at the end of the 6 week treatment period, at baseline after the completion of a 2 week washout period and prior to crossing over, and at the end of the cross over 6 week treatment period. Scores are as follows: 0 = Never, 1 = 2 to 3 times per month, 2 = 2 to 3 times per week, and 3 = daily.</description>
