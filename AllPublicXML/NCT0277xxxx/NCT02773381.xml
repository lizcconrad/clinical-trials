    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of oral
      semaglutide compared with placebo on postprandial glucose and triglyceride metabolism, energy
      intake, appetite sensations and gastric emptying in subjects with Type 2 diabetes
