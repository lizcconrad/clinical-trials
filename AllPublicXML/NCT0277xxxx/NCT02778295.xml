      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of a Fabry
      disease from plasma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a progressive, inherited, multisystemic lysosomal storage disease
      character-ized by specific neurological, cutaneous, renal, cardiovascular, cochleo-vestibular
      and cere-brovascular manifestations.

      Annual incidence is reported to be 1 in 80,000 live births but this figure may underestimate
      disease prevalence. When late-onset variants of the disease are considered, a prevalence of
      approximately 1 in 3,000 has been suggested. Fabry disease is pan-ethnic. The clinical
      picture covers a wide spectrum ranging from mild cases in heterozygous females, to severe
      cases in classically affected hemizygous males with no residual alpha-galactosidase A
      activity. These patients may have all the characteristic neurological (pain), cutaneous
      (angiokeratoma), renal (proteinuria, kidney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopa-thy,
      arrhythmia), cochleo-vestibular and cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attacks, strokes)
      signs of the disease. Female patients may have very mild to severe symptoms. Pain is a common
      early symptom of Fabry disease (chronic pain characterized by burning and tingling
      paresthesia and occasional episodic crises characterized by agonizing burning pain). Pain may
      resolve in adulthood. Anhidrosis or hypohidrosis may occur causing heat and exercise
      intolerance. Other signs include angiokeratoma, corneal changes, tinnitus, chronic fatigue,
      cardiac and cerebrovascular abnormalities (left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmia, angina,
      dyspnea, and nephropathy). Fabry disease is a disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused
      by deficient or absent lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A activity related to mutations in the
      GLA gene (Xq21.3-q22) encoding the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. Deficient activity results
      in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) within lysosomes, believed to trigger a
      cascade of cellular events. Definitive laboratory diagnosis involves demonstration of marked
      enzyme deficiency in hemizygous males. Enzyme analysis may occasionally help to detect
      heterozygotes but is often inconclusive due to random X-chromosomal inactivation, making
      molecular testing (genotyping) of females mandatory. In childhood, other possible causes of
      pain such as rheumatoid arthritis and &quot;growing pains&quot; must be ruled out. In adulthood,
      multiple sclerosis is sometimes considered. Fabry disease is transmitted as an X-linked
      trait. The existence of atypical, late-onset, variants and the availability of specific
      therapy complicate genetic counseling. A disease-specific therapeutic option (enzyme
      replacement therapy using in vitro engineered alpha-galactosidase A) has recently been
      introduced and its longterm outcome is under investigation for both preparations available,
      but is promising. Enzyme enhancement with pharmacological chaperones is currently under
      investigation in clinical trials. Conventional management consists of pain relief with
      analgesic drugs, nephroprotection (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin
      receptors blockers), antiarrhythmic agents, pacemaker or implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator, dialysis and kidney transplant. With age, progressive damage to vital organ
      systems develops, possibly leading to organ failure. Endstage renal disease and life
      threatening cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications limit the life expectancy of
      untreated males and females with reductions of 20 and 10 years, respectively, versus the
      general population. New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize
      specific metabolic alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow
      diagnosing in the future the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry 7,5 ml
      EDTA blood or a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis of a
      Fabry disease in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing
      has been done, sequencing of a Fabry disease will be done.

      The analyses are done in the Centogene AG Schillingallee 68 D-18057 Rostock Germany
