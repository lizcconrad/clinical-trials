  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is determines if metered dose inhalers are as effective as breath actuated
      nebulizers for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients
      presenting to the emergency department. Half of the participating patients received albuterol
      via the metered dose inhaler whereas the other half received albuterol via the breath
      actuated nebulizer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Albuterol administered via metered dose inhalers with spacers are more effective than small
      volume nebulizers in the treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations. There is also
      supporting data that the breath actuated nebulizers are also more effective than small volume
      nebulizers. The effectiveness of breath actuated nebulization compared to MDI for treating
      asthma exacerbations is less well defined.

      Metered dose inhalers with spacers are more readily available to the general population, are
      easily transportable and do not require a power source. Demonstrating equal effectiveness of
      albuterol delivery systems for treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations would enable
      physicians to confidently utilize clinical encounters as opportunities to educate families on
      management of asthma exacerbations using their home appliance.

    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patient disposition is measured as subjects requiring further treatment and being admitted to hospital. We record the number of patients in each cohort that required admission to the hospital after being evaluated and treated in the Emergency Department.</description>

    <measure>Emergency Department Length of Stay</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Emergency department length of stay is defined as the point of time when the patient checked into the Emergency Department to the time of final disposition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Tachycardia After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as anytime after initiation of therapy when the patient's heart rate exceeded age adjusted normal sinus rhythm heart rates for their age. Not uncommonly, patient's experience tachycardia as an unintended side effect of receiving albuterol. Tachycardia can result in a patient requiring further observation in the Emergency department and therefore increasing Emergency Department length of stay. We want to determine if indeed tachycardia is unavoidable, or if its presence suggests that patients are receiving too much albuterol or if albuterol is being given by the wrong appliance.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to BAN were evaluated for proper breath actuation technique. For subjects unable to coordinate breath actuation, the RT attached an appropriately sized mask to the device, changed the setting to continuous nebulization and returned upon completion of the treatment. Albuterol dosing was based upon the subject's weight and presenting symptom severity. Children presenting in the mild and moderate severity category weighing less than 20kg, received 2500mcg of albuterol. Children weighing more than 20kg, received 2500mcg of albuterol if their presentation met mild severity criteria, or 5000mcg if they met moderate criteria.</description>

    <description>The breath actuated nebulizer (BAN) device is a device that converts liquid medication, in this case albuterol, into an aerosol. It consists of a mouthpiece, a medication reservoir, and connective tubing that attaches to a compressor. This BAN device delivers medication when the patient takes a breath, but it can be attached to a mask and set to continuous nebulization for patients that are not able to coordinate their breaths.</description>

          <description>Subjects randomized to BAN were evaluated for proper breath actuation technique.

Children presenting in the mild and moderate severity category weighing less than 20kg, received 2500mcg of albuterol. Children weighing more than 20kg, received 2500mcg of albuterol if their presentation met mild severity criteria, or 5000mcg if they met moderate criteria.
Breath Actuated Nebulizer: The breath actuated nebulizer (BAN) device is a device that converts liquid medication, into an aerosol. It consists of a mouthpiece, a medication reservoir, and connective tubing that attaches to a compressor. This BAN device delivers medication when the patient takes a breath, but it can be attached to a mask and set to continuous nebulization for patients that are not able to coordinate their breaths.</description>

          <description>Albuterol administered via MDI and spacer device with weight and severity based dosing. For weight less than 20 kg: mild and moderate disease 540mcg of albuterol per dose. For weight greater than or equal to 20 kg: mild disease 540 mcg of albuterol per dose and moderate disease 1080 mcg of albuterol per dose.
Metered Dose Inhaler: A metered dose inhaler (MDI) is a small hand held pressurized canister device that contains both a medication, in this case albuterol, and a propellant. Pressing the device delivers 90mcg of albuterol. The MDI is attached to a spacer device, which is a one way holding chamber which allows the medication to be delivered over a series of breaths.</description>

          <title>Pediatric Asthma Score at Presentation</title>
          <description>The Pediatric Asthma Severity Score is a composite score based upon the patient's respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, retractions, work of breathing and findings on auscultation. The score ranges from 5-15, with the higher score being associated with a more severe asthma exacerbation. A mild score ranges from 5-7, a moderate score of 8-11. The minimum score obtainable is 5, the maximum score is a 15. Any subject with a presenting score above 11 was not eligible for participation in this study as these would be classified as a severe exacerbation.</description>

        <description>Defined as anytime after initiation of therapy when the patient's heart rate exceeded age adjusted normal sinus rhythm heart rates for their age. Not uncommonly, patient's experience tachycardia as an unintended side effect of receiving albuterol. Tachycardia can result in a patient requiring further observation in the Emergency department and therefore increasing Emergency Department length of stay. We want to determine if indeed tachycardia is unavoidable, or if its presence suggests that patients are receiving too much albuterol or if albuterol is being given by the wrong appliance.</description>

            <title>Albuterol by Metered Dose Inhaler</title>
            <description>Albuterol administered via MDI and spacer device with weight and severity based dosing. For weight less than 20 kg: mild and moderate disease 540mcg of albuterol per dose. For weight greater than or equal to 20 kg: mild disease 540 mcg of albuterol per dose and moderate disease 1080 mcg of albuterol per dose.
Metered Dose Inhaler: A metered dose inhaler (MDI) is a small hand held pressurized canister device that contains both a medication, in this case albuterol, and a propellant. Pressing the device delivers 90mcg of albuterol. The MDI is attached to a spacer device, which is a one way holding chamber which allows the medication to be delivered over a series of breaths.</description>

            <description>Subjects randomized to BAN were evaluated for proper breath actuation technique. For subjects unable to breath actuate, the RT changed the device setting to continuous nebulization, provided an appropriately sized mask, and returned upon completion of the treatment. Albuterol dosing was based upon the subject’s weight and presenting symptom severity. Children presenting in the mild and moderate severity category weighing less than 20kg, received 2500mcg of albuterol. Children weighing more than 20kg, received 2500mcg of albuterol if their presentation met mild severity criteria, or 5000mcg if they met moderate criteria.
Breath Actuated Nebulizer: The breath actuated nebulizer (BAN) device is a device that converts liquid medication, in this case albuterol, into an aerosol. It consists of a mouthpiece, a medication reservoir, and connective tubing that attaches to a compressor. This BAN device delivers medication when the patient takes a breath, but it can be atta</description>
