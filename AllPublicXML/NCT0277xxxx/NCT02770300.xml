  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to test the safeness and clinical effectiveness of a
      novel exoskeleton for the upper limb (Arm Light Exoskeleton Rehab Station, ALEx RS) developed
      at Wearable Robotics srl, for the force assistance of stroke patients during
      robotic-rehabilitation.

      The secondary study aim is to design and test an automatic personalized robot-based upper
      limb motor rehabilitation protocol targeting the specific kinematic performance of each
      patient.

      Finally, the study also aims to define the &quot;neuro-biomechanical state&quot; of the patient and its
      evolution during the therapy by studying cortical signals and muscular synergies. This
      information will be used to improve the personalization of the robotic treatment by targeting
      not only the motor performance but also the cerebral and muscular activity of the patient.

      The study is longitudinally designed in order to test the safeness and clinical effectiveness
      of ALEx RS over time, and to monitor the clinical effectiveness of the automatic personalized
      robotic therapy from the beginning until the end of the treatment. Moreover, in order to
      estimate the long-term clinical effectiveness of the treatment, the assessment methods
      proposed in the clinical trial will be repeated one month after the end of the treatment.

    <description>The control group of patients will perform a conventional therapy without the use of the exoskeleton. The conventional therapy will consist in a traditional treatment of occupational therapy or physiotherapy without the use of the robotic device. The therapist will provide a specific conventional treatment comparable with the robotic treatment in terms of session time and therapeutic goals (i.e., 45 minutes per session, about 100, 150, 200 and 250 movements respectively for the first, second, third and fourth week). The level of difficulty of the exercises will be increased by the physiotherapist according to the degree of impairment of the patients.
The muscle and cerebral activity during the execution of the conventional therapy could be acquired.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The rehabilitative task will be constituted of 3D reaching movements covering a sphere of fourteen centimeter of radius in front of the patient. The initial rehabilitative task will be the same for all the patients belonging to this group and the workspace will be extended accordingly to the therapist evaluation during the following training sessions. In order not to bias the comparisons of the effects of the different rehabilitative treatments, the therapist assisting this group during the rehabilitation will be the same for all the subjects belonging to this group and he/she will not take part in the rehabilitative treatment of the other groups. Initially, the patients will execute reaching movements in different directions in the horizontal plane. If the therapist will evaluate that the movements have been sufficiently recovered, reaching movements in the other planes will be proposed.</description>

    <description>ALEx RS is a complete system specifically designed to support the rehabilitation of stroke patients. In particular, this system is equipped with a robotic arm exoskeleton conceived for the force assistance, integrated in a Virtual Reality system that allows implementing rehabilitative exercises highly interactive and engaging for the patients. It is proven that the use of this type of devices in rehabilitation can provide high intensive, repetitive, task specific, and interactive treatment of the impaired arm and an objective and reliable mean for monitoring patients' progress.</description>
