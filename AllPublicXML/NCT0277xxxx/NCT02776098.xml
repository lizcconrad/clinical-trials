      This study will investigate the link between glucose abnormalities and elements critical to
      muscle function including mass, composition and energy metabolism. the primary goal of the
      study is to determine whether Cystic Fibrosis (CF) disease is associated with muscle
      dysfunction, especially in the presence of glucose intolerance. This is a longitudinal cohort
      study of 3 main groups: CF subjects without Cystic Fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), healthy
      matched controls and CF subjects with newly diagnosed CFRD started on insulin therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease that primarily affects the lungs but also
      confers a high risk of diabetes, with up to 40-50% of adults experiencing Cystic
      Fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is associated with an accelerated decline in lung
      function, nutritional status and survival and despite treatment mortality in patients with
      CFRD remains high. Airway inflammation and susceptibility to infections caused by
      hyperglycemia, and the catabolic effect of insulin deficiency are posited mechanisms of
      CFRD-associated morbidity. Respiratory failure caused by airway disease is well known but the
      contribution of respiratory muscle dysfunction may be critical. In Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      (T2DM) glucose and insulin defects are closely correlated with muscle function. The pulmonary
      muscles are crucial to respiration and airway clearance in CF. Muscle function is dependent
      on its mass, composition, and energy metabolism. Lean body mass (LBM) deficits are present in
      CF and improvement in LBM improves pulmonary function. Using T2DM as a model for muscle
      dysfunction, the study hypothesis is that glucose intolerance exacerbates LBM deficits,
      negatively affects muscle composition, and alters muscle metabolism leading to respiratory
      muscle dysfunction and a decline in pulmonary function.

      CF subjects without CFRD and healthy controls will undergo 3 study visits (baseline then
      annually for 2 years) and CFRD subjects will undergo 2 study visits (baseline and 6 months
      after baseline). Evaluations will include neurologic exams, anthropometric assessments, 3-day
      dietary recall, MRI scans, oral glucose tolerance tests (CF subjects only), blood work,
      pulmonary function testing, muscle strength testing, exercise testing, bone density scans,
      and adverse event assessment.

        This is longitudinal cohort study of 3 main study groups: CF subjects without CFRD, Healthy
        matched controls and CF subjects with newly diagnosed CFRD started on insulin therapy.
        Healthy controls without CF will be recruited and will be matched for age, sex, ethnicity,
        and body mass index (BMI) to CF subjects. Subjects with newly diagnosed CFRD will also be
        enrolled. This study will be carried out over a 5-year period.

        CF subjects without CFRD (26) and healthy controls (26) will be followed annually for 2
        years. CF subjects with newly diagnosed CFRD (10) will be followed for 6 months.
