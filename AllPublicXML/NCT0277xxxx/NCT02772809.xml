    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors with hemiplegia will be evaluated by rehabilitation professionals and asked
      to perform a battery of assessments to test the viability and usability of a force-feedback
      robot that adapts to each individual subject's performance. Subsequently, they will be asked
      to complete post-assessment questionnaires that provide feedback to the researchers on their
      observations and thoughts about the therapy devices.

    <textblock>
      TheraDrive is a low-cost robotic system for post-stroke upper extremity rehabilitation. The
      system uses off-the-shelf computer gaming wheels with force feedback to help reduce motor
      impairment and improve function in the arms of stroke survivors. Preliminary results from
      various studies have shown that the original TheraDrive system lacked a robust mechanical
      linkage which could withstand the forces exerted by patients, lacked a patient-specific
      adaptive controller to deliver personalized therapy, and was not capable of delivering
      effective therapy to severely low-functioning patients. A new low-cost, high-force haptic
      robot with a single degree of freedom has been developed to address these concerns. This
      study has two purposes: first, to test the viability and usability of the new robot system
      alongside the original TheraDrive system; and second, to test if low-functioning patients
      benefit, and if so how much, from using force-feedback therapy as opposed to devices with
      zero impedance. This will be done by recruiting approximately 36 human subjects. Exercises
      will be performed by study subjects and an adaptive controller will monitor patient
      performance to ensure that exercises are difficult but doable, which is important for
      maintaining patient motivation. It is hypothesized that not only will the new system be
      viable, but that it will provide better robot-assisted therapy to a large variety of
      patients, especially low-functioning stroke survivors with hemiplegia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stroke survivors at least 18 years of age with hemiplegia.

          -  The subject's stroke must have occurred at least 3 months prior to enrollment in the
             study.

          -  Low and Moderate functioning stroke survivors as measured by Fugl- Meyer

          -  Not depressed

          -  No more than Mild Cognitive Deficit

          -  Participants must be able to sit upright for 4 hours at a time in Part A of the study;
             and 2 hours at a time, 3 days a week, for Part B of the study.

          -  The subject's stroke must have occurred at least 3 months prior to enrollment in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Greater than mild cognitive deficits

          -  Greater than mild depression. A member of the research team will administer Beck's
             Depression Inventory (BDI) to each study participant over the phone. If the
             participant is found to have greater than mild depression, as measured by the BDI,
             they will not qualify for the study.

          -  Receiving rehabilitation on the upper limb.

          -  Received Botox injections within the past 3 months.

          -  Suffering from contractures (chronic loss of joint motion) or debilitating spasticity
             in the upper extremity.

          -  Experiencing greater than mild pain, and/or the PI determines that the participant
             should no longer continue working with the novel therapy devices, the study will be
             stopped.
