  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rape is unfortunately a common experience among women, affecting between 13 and 20%. In
      addition, up to 50% of all rape victims experience significant and persistent psychological
      distress. While cognitive-behavioral interventions have been found to be successful at
      alleviating distress among victims; the majority do not seek out these services, often
      because of feelings of stigma and self-blame. One potential method for circumventing these
      barriers is through online administered treatment. Thus, the current project is designed to
      conduct an initial evaluation of a 12 to 16-week, therapist-facilitated, multi-media,
      cognitive-behavioral, online intervention tailored specifically for rape victims. The
      effectiveness of this program at ameliorating distress among college women who have
      experienced rape and have current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated.
      Reductions in psychological distress was the primary outcome and was assessed at
      post-intervention and at three and six month follow-up periods. The effectiveness of the
      intervention was compared to a psycho-educational website.
