      The proposed study is to validate a non-invasive imaging technique to evaluate the myocardial
      perfusion reserve in comparison with a validated invasive technique, the measure of coronary
      flow reserve (CRF) with thermodilution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is a public health problem. The measurement of myocardial perfusion
      reserve is a prognostic factor supplemental.

      Its measure should influence the treatment and the follow up of the patients. The measurement
      of CRF by by one pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guide wire is a validated technique to
      evaluate the myocardial perfusion reserve but it is an invasive technique.

      In this study, the investigators will compare this method with a non-invasive method:
      completely automated analysis and quantification of myocardial blood flow from DICOM files
      corresponding to stress and rest images was developed with a new camera CZT SPECT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Myocardial scintigraphy with pharmacologic stress and abnormal results

          -  Coronarography indicated

          -  Informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant woman

          -  Patient with terminal illness

          -  Terminal renal failure

          -  Allergy to iodine

          -  Informed consent impossible

          -  Patient under legal protection

          -  History of coronary artery bypass surgery

          -  Contraindications for adenosine: asthmatic patients, second or third-degree AV block
             without pacemaker or sick sinus syndrome. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg.
             Recent use of dipyramidole or dipyramidole-containing medications. Methyl xanthenes
             such as aminophylline caffeine or theobromine block the effect of adenosine and should
             be held for at least 12 hours prior to the test. Known hypersensitivity to adenosine.
             Unstable acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome.
