  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacodynamics of single doses of
      abediterol given by 2 different devices in participants with asthma. Abediterol (AZD0548) is
      a potential for once daily treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) in fixed dose combination (FDC) with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a novel
      anti-inflammatory agent. The aim of the clinical studies is to enable further investigations
      in participants with asthma and COPD to evaluate and develop abediterol as an effective long
      acting bronchodilator with an acceptable safety profile compared to other inhaled
      bronchodilators on the market, for the treatment of asthma and COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blinded, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, six-way
      William's design, crossover study to assess the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and
      safety of abediterol single dose, given by dry powder inhaler or pressurised metered-dose
      inhaler, in patients with asthma, on inhaled corticosteroids. During the screening period,
      all patients will take their own baseline inhaled corticosteroid for 2 weeks. Patients on
      long-acting β2-agonist/ inhaled corticosteroids will be switched over to the respective
      inhaled corticosteroid monocomponent. Patients will be provided salbutamol as rescue
      medication for use throughout the study. Abediterol is an investigational product in early
      stages of clinical development, therefore individual participants in the clinical studies may
      not have a clinical benefit, especially in view of alternative therapies (bronchodilators)
      being available for the treatment of asthma and COPD.

    <measure>Change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-dose IP administration on Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary variable is the change from baseline in trough FEV1. Baseline for FEV1 will be defined as the mean of the two measured values for the corresponding variable (2 measurements 30 min apart, at -45 min and -15 min, before the morning IP administration), prior to the morning investigational product (IP)administration on Day 1 of each treatment period. If both are missing the screening value will be used instead. Trough is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 h and 24 h after the morning IP administration. If one of the values is missing, the other one will be used as trough.</description>
