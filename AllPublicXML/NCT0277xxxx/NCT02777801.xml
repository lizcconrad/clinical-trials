      There has been no report on whether the patients with gastric cancer who are also inactive
      Hepatitis B carriers should receive prophylactic use or preemptive Use of an Anti-viral Drug
      Entecavir. This open, randomized controlled clinical trial aims to compare the impact of the
      prophylactic use or preemptive use of an anti-viral drug Entecavir on the outcomes of
      patients with gastric cancer who are also inactive hepatitis B carriers during chemotherapy
      and the subsequent follow-ups.

    <textblock>
      Patients with gastric cancer who are also inactive hepatitis B carriers are enrolled and
      randomized into two groups as following. Patients in experimental group are treated with
      entecavir prophylactically in the dose of 0.5mg p.o. every day from the initiation of
      chemotherapy till 6 months after the end of chemotherapy.Patients in active comparator group
      are only treated with entecavir in the dose of 0.5mg p.o. every day from the time that the
      DNA copies of hepatitis B virus are more than 100 IU/ml till 6 months after the end of
      chemotherapy.
