    <textblock>
      Adults (18 years and over) and children (10-17 years of age) scheduled for surgery to correct
      scoliosis will be included in this study, for which participation will last 6 months. Each
      age group of participants will be randomized to two cohorts: one cohort will receive standard
      of care, while the other will also have their standard radiographic images used in the
      construction of a three-dimensional visualization of the spine. Questionnaires administered
      before and after surgery, in addition to health information collected throughout the course
      of the study, will indicate whether the three-dimensional model has an effect on the
      planning, performance, and outcomes of surgery. Participants in this study will not be asked
      to do anything outside the standard of care. The only manipulated variable in this study is
      the construction of the three dimensional model, which is made from information collected
      during the standard of care, and requires no further action on the participant's behalf. The
      results of this study may show that three-dimensional visualizations can be of value to
      spinal surgeons, and positively affect patient outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The biplanar low-dose EOS system and its associated sterEOS workstation (EOSÂ®, EOS Imaging,
      Paris, France) allows 3D spine reconstructions. The EOS system presents some advantages over
      MRI or CT Scans. The weight bearing position allows assessment in the functional position and
      the radiation exposure is 800-1000 times less then CT scans, allowing full spine acquisition
      even in pediatric patients. Selected anatomical landmarks are utilized to reconstruct a 3D
      model of the spine allowing global assessment as well as localized analysis.The aim of the
      study is to assess the clinical relevance of 3D stereographic reconstructions (from sterEOS
      3D) on patients, adults and children, who undergo spine surgery. This study will observe the
      value of 3D parameters at three different steps of the standard of care surgical procedure:
      preoperatively, peri-operatively, and post-operatively. The goal of this prospective study is
      to observe how 3D reconstructions could enhance the planning, the surgery and the post-op
      analysis and outcomes. This pilot study could help to understand which and how 3D parameters
      could improve adult and pediatric spine surgery.
