      The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate the dental implant placement using two
      different CBCT-derived templates and to study the related factors that affect accuracy so as
      to support the further clinical application of the technique. Thirty patients with partial
      edentulous denture are recruited. They are randomized to two groups. A radiographic guide is
      prepared before CT/CBCT scan. The CT/CBCT scan DICOM ﬁles are loaded in a planning program
      and converted into 3D computer images. A surgical template is fabricated through this virtual
      planning. After 6 weeks, if the implants are judged stable, the patient has the option of
      replacing the ﬁxed prosthesis. Patients are recalled for oral hygiene maintenance and
      prosthetic controls every 6 months for the entire duration of the study.
