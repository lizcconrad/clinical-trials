  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well PROSTVAC -V/F works in stopping prostate cancer
      from coming back or relapsing. This study will also look at the safety of PROSTVAC-V/F.

      This study is for adult male patients who have recently undergone radical prostatectomy and
      are at high risk for relapse. The purpose of this study is to look at the effect PROSTVAC-V/F
      has in preventing or prolonging relapse after surgery. PROSTVAC-V/F is an investigational
      drug.

             pN1 lymph node disease; positive surgical margins; pre-operative PSA of &gt; 10ng/mL
             Patients with pT3a disease who lack one of the above criteria, and who refuse adjuvant
             radiation, may also be enrolled.

             drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy.

          -  Subjects must have had a negative bone scan, and CT of abdomen and pelvis within 16
             weeks prior to registration. Additional forms of imaging (Prostascint scan, MRI) may

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pure small cell carcinoma of the prostate

          -  Radiographically-demonstrable metastases at any time prior to the time of enrollment

          -  Presence of any major medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             precludes participation in the study

          -  Neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy of any kind

             epidermis

          -  Active infections requiring systemic therapy

             syndrome, scleroderma, myasthenia gravis, Goodpasture's syndrome, Addison's disease,
             Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or Graves disease). Persons with vitiligo are not excluded.

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes. Subjects with diabetes mellitus are not excluded if the
             condition is well-controlled (A1C &lt; 7.5).

          -  Vaccination with live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to day 1 of PROSTVAC-V/F
             administration or vaccination with a killed vaccine within 14 days prior to day 1 of
             PROSTVAC-V/F.

          -  Inability to avoid close contact or household contact with the following high-risk
             individuals for three weeks after the Day 1 vaccination or until the vaccination site
