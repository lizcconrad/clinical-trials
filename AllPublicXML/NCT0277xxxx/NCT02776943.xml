      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of transplantation of
      umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells（UCMSCs） in patient with Knee cartilage damage.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human cartilage only has limited regenerative potential. Transplantation of umbilical cord
      mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) is a promising strategy given the high proliferative capacity
      of MSCs and their potential to differentiate into cartilage-producing cells - chondrocytes.
      The acquisition of ucMSCs does not require invasive surgical intervention or cartilage
      extraction from other sites as required by other cell-based strategies. The investigators
      inject allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells to the cartilage lesions in patients via
      intra-articular injection method, and to investigate the efficacy and safety。
