    <textblock>
      Frailty is a syndrome characterized by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to
      stressors. The proposed research will evaluate the association of frailty with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD). The prevalence of frailty increases with age and with CKD, but studies are
      needed to determine whether frailty is associated with worsening of CKD and whether
      intervention to treat frailty can improve physical functioning and health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) as well as slow progression of CKD.

      The intervention is a 6-month prospective interventional pilot study targeted to each domain
      of frailty. Subjects will be screened into the study by testing each domain; only those who
      meet criteria for frailty will be included in the study. The clinical intervention, which all
      subjects will receive, will begin immediately upon enrollment and completion of baseline
      measurements. Upon enrollment the 3 most recent previous outpatient serum creatinine
      measurements (up to 1 year) will be used to determine baseline slope of estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR). The main objectives of the pilot study will be to gain knowledge in
      the successful implementation and completion of an intervention targeted toward frailty.
      Ultimately information ascertained from this pilot will serve as a springboard for planning
      of a randomized trial aimed at addressing all the domains of frailty, which is key given that
      previous studies have only implemented interventions aimed at a single domain or in pairs,
      but no studies have evaluated the extent to which frailty can be reversed through a cohesive
      intervention addressing all domains together. The intervention outlined in this proposal is
      comprehensive and focused while maintaining feasibility.

    <description>The number of steps achieved over the 6 month period will be assessed. Pedometer data is collected each week. Based on the weekly achieved counts a new goal is generated for each participant. This assessment will include study investigators collecting step count logs from the participant on a weekly basis.</description>

    <description>Change in physical functioning will be assessed using the short physical performance battery (SPPB). Investigators will compare baseline Short physical performance battery (SPPB) score to 6 month score to determine change in functioning as a result of the intervention.</description>

    <description>Source of these participants will be the same as those who screen into the study; patients with chronic kidney disease receiving care at the San Francisco Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Based on initial screening if participants meet criteria for frailty participants will be enrolled in the intervention arm.

    <description>Slowness/weakness: Physical therapy(PT) strength and gait training. A standardized strengthening program will be prescribed, to be performed at home. Additional in-person PT training will be provided to those who are severely deconditioned .
Weight loss/malnutrition: A licensed nutritionist specializing in kidney disease will meet with participants for 3 one-hour one-on-one nutritional counseling.
Low physical activity: Participants will receive individualized walking recommendations using a pedometer. Walking activity will be assessed weekly, and new goals for increasing steps in the following week will be set.
Exhaustion: Those who meet criteria for severe depression using the center for epidemiologic studies depression (CES-D) scale will be immediately referred to psychiatry for counseling for patient safety. All others will participate in cognitive behavioral coping techniques.</description>
