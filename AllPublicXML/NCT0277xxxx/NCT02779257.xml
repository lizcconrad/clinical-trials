    <textblock>
      Pasireotide binds to somatostatin receptors sst2 and sst5, which can lead to significant
      hyperglycemia. The investigators would like to administer pasireotide as a treatment for
      refractory hypoglycemia in the setting of metastatic insulin-producing pancreatic
      neuro-endocrine tumor.

          1. Aged 18 years or older

          2. Biopsy-proven (primary or metastatic lesion) metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of the
             gastrointestinal and pancreatic location with disease determined by CT scan or MRI

          3. Patients with history of clinical syndrome symptoms (e.g. hypoglycemia)

          4. Patients not controlled by treatment with currently available somatostatin analogues.

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN

               -  INR &lt; 1.3

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 3x ULN,

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          6. Written informed consent obtained prior to treatment to be consistent with local
             regulatory requirements

          7. Is suffering from a serious or life-threatening disease or condition

          8. Does not have access to a comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment (i.e.,
             comparable or satisfactory treatment is not available or does not exist)

          9. Is not eligible for participation in any of the IMP's ongoing clinical trials or has
             recently completed a clinical trial that has been terminated and, after considering
             other options (e.g., trial extensions, amendments, etc.), the clinical team has
             determined that treatment is necessary and there are no other feasible alternatives
             for the patient

         10. Meets any other relevant medical criteria for compassionate use of the investigational
             product

         11. Is not being transferred from an ongoing clinical trial for which they are still
             eligible

         12. There are meaningful human clinical data to support an assessment that the potential
             benefits to patient outweigh risks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to somatostatin analogs or any component of the
             pasireotide LAR or s.c. formulations.

          2. Patients with abnormal coagulation (PT or aPTT elevated by 30% above normal limits).

          3. Patients on continuous anticoagulation therapy. Patients who were on anticoagulant
             therapy must complete a washout period of at least 10 days and have confirmed normal
             coagulation parameters before study inclusion.

          4. Patients currently using warfarin / warfarin derivatives

          5. Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.

          6. Patients who are not biochemically euthyroid. Patients with known history of
             hypothyroidism are eligible if they are on adequate and stable replacement thyroid
             hormone therapy for at least 3 months.

             years are allowed to participate in the study.

             pasireotide medication. They should not father a child in this period. A condom is
