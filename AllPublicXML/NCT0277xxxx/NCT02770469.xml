  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the TOGETHER (Together Overcome and Get Empowered Through Health Education
      and Relationships) program was to examine the effectiveness of one of the first
      linguistically and culturally tailored intervention programs to increase quality of life
      among Korean American breast cancer survivors.

    <textblock>
      This study employed a randomized trial design, consisting of a standard and enhanced
      intervention group. Participants attended seven weekly sessions and one follow-up session
      that lasted for about 2 hours each. All sessions were conducted by two Korean female
      bilingual licensed clinical psychologists.

      The specific aims of this study were to: (1) Implement and evaluate the effects of tailored
      intervention on perceived stress, coping and quality of life among Korean American breast
      cancer survivors; and (2) Conduct a process evaluation to assess the feasibility and fidelity
      of the intervention, which will provide data that can inform the development of future
      interventions.
