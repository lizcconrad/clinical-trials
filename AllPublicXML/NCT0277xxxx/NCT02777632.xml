    <textblock>
      The purpose of this work was to study the incidence, types, risk factors and causative
      organisms of bacterial infections in HCV Egyptian patients following Liver Transplantation.
      Moreover, to identify the emerging resistant strains and their proper antimicrobial therapy

      This prospective descriptive study has been done at Tropical Medicine department in the
      period between January 2014 to November 2015.

      After the approval of the scientific and ethical committee of Ain Shams University Hospital,
      Patients with HCV positive end stage liver disease (ESLD) eligible for liver transplantation
      Ain Shams Center for Organ Transplant (ASCOT); Ain Shams University, (fulfilling the
      inclusion criteria) were included in the current study. Forty five patients were recruited
      and each one was followed-up during a period of 3 months following transplantation.

      Included patients were divided into 2 groups:

      Group 1 included patients who had a postoperative single episode of infection. Group 2
      included those patients who had more than 1 episode of postoperative bacterial infection whom
      were further evaluated for the presence of emerging strains and/or antibiotic resistance.
