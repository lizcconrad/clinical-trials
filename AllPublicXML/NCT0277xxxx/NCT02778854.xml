  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic efficacy of liquid
      biopsy in different specimens and in different methods compared with tissue detection .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collect plasma and other specimens from patients who are newly diagnosed with NSCLC or with
      drug-resistant and plan to receive gene detection to complete the diagnostic test for liquid
      biopsy .Participants who come from diagnostic test and plan to receive tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKI) therapy will be collected plasma and other specimens every month during the
      regiments and monitor the changes of driver motion to predict the prognosis of targeted
      therapy.
