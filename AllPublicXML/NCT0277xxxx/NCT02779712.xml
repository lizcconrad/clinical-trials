  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke has an enormous impact on both individual and society. Novel treatments are required
      to relieve this burden and remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is one such approach. RIC
      refers to applying non-lethal ischaemia to an area distant from an organ you are trying to
      protect (e.g. the brain). Pre-clinical animal stroke studies have shown RIC to be
      neuroprotective and help restore functional outcome when compared to control. These outcomes
      are achieved simply by transiently occluding the blood supply to a limb (e.g. the arm) very
      soon after the stroke occurs. The mechanisms of protection are unclear but may be due
      enhancing the body's ability to protect itself from further injury by favorably altering
      cerebral blood flow or reducing the detrimental effects of oxygen free radicals. Ischaemic
      conditioning (IC) is an intervention already applied during cardiac surgery to protect the
      heart from damage and it may be effective after an acute myocardial infarction. The
      investigators therefore plan to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial assessing the
      feasibility of applying RIC (4 cycles of blood pressure cuff inflation for 5 minutes) in
      patients within 6 hours of ischaemic stroke. The primary outcome is feasibility of RIC.
      Secondary outcomes include tolerability, safety and clinical efficacy. The results will
      inform the design of future trials of a potential intervention is that is pragmatic,
      non-invasive and simple to administer.
