      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      vaccine therapy in treating patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that persists or
      progresses over a long period of time. Vaccines made from DNA may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill cancer cells that express HCV infection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of the HCV DNA vaccine, consisting of INO-8000 (HCV
      antigen DNA) alone or co-administered with INO-9012 (interleukin [IL]-12 adjuvant DNA) (DNA
      plasmid encoding interleukin-12 INO-9012).

      II. To identify a dose of INO-9012 (IL-12 adjuvant DNA) for co-administration with INO-8000
      (HCV antigen DNA) based on induction of HCV-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma production by
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 26 weeks compared to baseline in HCV-infected
      participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces a &gt; 1 log
      decrease (or undetectable) in HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) level at weeks 14 and 26.

      II. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces an
      end-of-treatment undetectable HCV RNA (end-of-treatment virologic response - EVR) at 26 weeks
      and a sustained virologic response (SVR) at 36 weeks.

      III. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces other
      parameters of cluster of differentiation (CD)8 and CD4 T lymphocyte responses as measured by
      flow cytometry, and antibody responses to HCV antigen at weeks 14 and 26.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of INO-9012.

      Patients receive INO-8000 intramuscularly (IM) and DNA plasmid encoding interleukin-12
      INO-9012 IM (dose levels 2-4) followed by electroporation (EP) at day 0 and at weeks 4, 12,
      and 24.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 48 and 76.

    <description>Change in production of interferon-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be based on a one-way analysis of variance model using data from all dose levels at the 2-sided 5% level. Mean change (and % change) and the associated 95% confidence intervals in the production of IFN-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells for all evaluable participants enrolled at each dose level will be computed, and compared across the dose levels in an exploratory fashion using graphical approaches, one-way analysis of variance models etc. to ascertain a dose-response curve.</description>

    <description>The point estimate (and the associated 95% confidence intervals) for primary immune response endpoint will be estimated within each arm and formally compared using a chi-squared test (or Fisher's exact test, if the data warrant). A logistic regression analysis will also be utilized to adjust for potential baseline covariates considered critical for this population.</description>
