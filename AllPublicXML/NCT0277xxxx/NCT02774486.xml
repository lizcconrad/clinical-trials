  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary cause of being overweight is an imbalance in calories consumed and energy
      expenditure. A surplus in energy intake might result in body fat deposition and thereby body
      weight gain. Therefore, food intake regulation is crucial to control the body weight gain.

      Appetite regulation plays an important role in determining the food intake, which is a
      complex process influenced by the individual (physiology and psychology) and environment.
      Satiation (process that leads to the termination of eating) and satiety (decline in hunger,
      increase in fullness after a meal has finished) are the precursors of appetite regulation,
      which may be induced by various food components such as macronutrients, water, alcohol and
      non-digestible polysaccharides. High viscosity and swellable/bulking food components such as
      dietary fibre are expected to elicit stronger satiation/satiety than the macronutrients or
      clear liquid. Due to its unique physicochemical properties, dietary fibre has been recognized
      as potential ingredient that helps to enhance the sensation of satiety in the upper gut by
      increasing gastric distension and delaying gastric emptying, which subsequently reduces the
      food intake.

      IQP-AK-102 comprises of a proprietary blend of dietary fibres known to promote a feeling a
      fullness. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IQP-AK-102
      on appetite reduction in overweight subjects during a 4-weeks interval.
