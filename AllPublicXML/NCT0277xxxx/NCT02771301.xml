      Eligible patients that provide written informed consent will undergo apheresis to collect
      blood mononuclear cells for vaccine production. All patients will receive mature dendritic
      cells for a total of 12 vaccine doses.The DC vaccine will be given subcutaneously every four
      weeks. Peripheral blood will be taken two weeks after injection each time to monitor the
      immune response.

          -  The tumor can be resected and tumor resection rate ≥80%;

          -  IDH1R132H mutation can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry or real-time quantitative
             PCR;

          -  Peripheral blood lymphocytes absolute value is not less than 0.8 × 106;
