      This is a retrospective observational study to assess the relationship between peak systolic
      global longitudinal strain measured on pre-cardiopulmonary bypass trans-esophageal echo
      images predicts post-operative low cardiac output syndrome defined as the need for an
      inotropic support during 24 hours or longer.
