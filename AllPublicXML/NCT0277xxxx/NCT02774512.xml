      This is a monocentric prospective non randomized phase 0 clinical trial targeting patients
      with colon cancer for whom an upfront surgery has been advised by the pluridisciplinary team.
      The surgical management should not be changed or delayed. The patient is seen in consultation
      by one of the two surgeons. The patient receives information and consents to participate to
      the study. A specific colonoscopy is performed in order to take biopsy for biological
      studies. According to the expression level of ZAK-0, the patient is included in the
      corresponding arm: ZAK-0 expressor or ZAK-0 non-expressor. Then the patient receives
      nilotinib orally at the dose of 800 mg/day (400 mg twice a day) for 7 days. The patient is
      scheduled for surgery the morning after the last take of the nilotinib (12 hours). When the
      colectomy is performed, the surgeon collects different tumoral samples which are immediately
      delivered to the laboratory. There are no additional changes in the clinical follow up.

    <description>Each patient will receive nilotinib 800 mg/day every day for 7 days. Study treatment will be taken twice a day (400 mg - 2 capsules) by oral route with an interval of approximately 12 hours between two doses and should not be taken with food. The entire capsule should be swallowed with water. No food should be consumed for 2 hours before taking the drug and for at least 1 hour after it.</description>
