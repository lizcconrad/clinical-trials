  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, healers are willing to look after, two out of three French citizens have
      already appealed to them at least once during their lives. Many healers in good faith are
      exercising their magnetism as a &quot;gift&quot; often inherited from elders. Now, they create interest
      of doctors who do not hesitate in some cases to ensure their cooperation, to implicitly
      recognize their mysterious talents. Some serious studies have examined these practices:
      Several studies have been conducted on the influence of biofield therapies in pain,
      depression and fatigue in cancer disease. The investigators propose a study of the effect of
      magnetism on the wart disease whose cure is objectively assessable.

      Sixty-two subjects in total would be included, comparing 2 proportions observed: the
      proportion of healing in the group treated with a &quot;real&quot; biofield therapist (recognized and
      affiliated to the National Group for Alternative Medicine in France) to the proportion of
      healing in the group treated with a &quot;fake&quot; biofield therapist (someone assessed as not having
      capacity to magnetize). The &quot;fake&quot; biofield therapist, placebo, has been trained to replicate
      gestures during a training validated by an independent recognized biofield therapist.

      If the results are in favor of magnetism, this pilot study would encourage additional
      investigations to determine whether the practice of magnetism may be a paramedic
      specialization.
