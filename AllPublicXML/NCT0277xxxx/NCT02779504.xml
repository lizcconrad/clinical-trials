  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Agluna® (antimicrobial ionic silver surface technology) is used to treat the surface of
      the METS (Modular Endoprosthetic Tumour System) medical devices, in order to reduce the risk
      of post surgical infections after orthopaedic endoprosthetic replacement surgery.

      This Post Market Clinical Follow up study is designed to retrospectively establish the
      infection rate of a cohort patients who have received an Agluna® Treated METS implant and
      compare the clinical data to patients that have received an untreated METS implant; in order
      to provide evidence to support the investigators' clinical claims.

      This post-market clinical follow-up study will be a retrospective data comparison study of a
      series of Agluna® treated and untreated METS™ modular prostheses conducted at the Royal
      National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore. The expected sample size will be 106, with 53
      patients in each treatment arm (Agluna® treated vs untreated). However there will be an
      initial pilot of 20 subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the study conduct and to identify
      if any further study design modification are required.

      The primary outcome is the estimation of the infection rate over 12 months following an
      Agluna (silver) treated METS™ endoprosthetic surgery. This will be compared to the infection
      rate of non-Agluna Treated devices in a similar population. Incidence of infection will be
      measured according to the accepted definition of periprosthetic joint infection from the
      American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. The study follow up period is 12 months after
      implantation. Secondary objectives are to examine the health economic impacts of using the
      Agluna® Treated METS™ Modular Tumour System in comparison to the untreated METS™ Modular
      Tumour System and to establish clinically relevant superiority of the Agluna® Treated METS™
      Modular Tumour System in comparison to untreated METS™ Modular Tumour System.

    <description>To examine the health economic impacts of using the Agluna® Treated METS™ Modular Tumour System in comparison to the untreated METS™ Modular Tumour System, health economic questions will be addressed by analysing the costs of both treatments arms based on different models with varying assumptions for costs.</description>

    <description>To establish clinically relevant superiority of the Agluna® Treated METS™ Modular Tumour System in comparison to untreated METS™ Modular Tumour System, Investigation of superiority will be done analogously to the primary analysis. If the confidence interval lies completely below 0 superiority can be concluded. Additionally, to evaluate a clinical relevance the difference in infection rates will be analysed and interpreted numerically.</description>
