  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test an investigational drug (Not FDA approved), ARN-509 given in
      combination with Leuprolide acetate (FDA approved) in men diagnosed with high-risk prostate
      cancer who have already selected to have surgery to remove their prostate gland as part of
      their treatment plan. The main purpose of this study is to determine how tumors make
      androgens (male hormones), which makes these tumors more aggressive and resistant to hormonal
      therapy and how a short period of treatment with ARN-509 and leuprolide acetate prior to
      surgery can affect the production of these hormones in normal and malignant prostate tissue.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the differential effect of neo-adjuvant leuprolide and ARN-509
      on dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration in benign prostate tissue based on HSD3B1
      genotype.

      Secondary Objective(s): To evaluate the differential effect of neoadjuvant leuprolide and
      ARN-509 on other androgen (testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol,
      5α-androstanedione (5α-dione), androstenedione (AD), androsterone and 5α-androstanediol)
      concentrations in benign and malignant prostate tissue based on HSD3B1 genotype.

      To compare the level of DHT, T, DHEA, androstenediol, 5α-dione, AD, androsterone and
      5α-androstanediol between normal and malignant prostate tissue after neoadjuvant treatment
      with leuprolide and ARN-509

      To determine the safety of the combination of Leuprolide and ARN-509 administered prior to
      radical prostatectomy

      To evaluate prostatic specific antigen (PSA), FKBP5, TMPRSS2, EZH2, H3K27 and UBE2C tissue
      expression (via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR))
      in benign and malignant prostate tissue after treatment with Leuprolide and ARN-509 and
      ARN-509.
