      This study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing an online self-help course
      ('Kindness for Mums') with a wait-list control. A battery of self-report measures will be
      administered online at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 6) and at follow-up (week
      12). Baseline data will also be used to examine the relationship between self-compassion and
      wellbeing.
