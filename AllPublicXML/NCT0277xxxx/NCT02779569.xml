      To develop a highly effective and safe protocol, a multi-center, prospective clinical trial
      was conducted in China, with aims to evaluate the grade III and IV hematologic toxicity and
      clinical efficacy of subcutaneous injection of ultra-low-dose decitabine (5 to 7 mg/m2) for
      treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), while decitabine at a dose of 20 mg/m2 as a
      control.
