    <textblock>
      The new device we are looking at is called the MarginProbe. It is a disposable probe which
      measures the margins of tissue removed to check they are clear of cancer cells, during breast
      conservation surgery. After specimen radiology, allows the Surgeon to remove further tissue
      if necessary, during the same operation if any involved margins are identified. This
      minimises the need for further repeat operations.

      Previous studies carried out elsewhere in the world (USA and Israel) have identified that the
      probe reduces re-excision rate but there has never been a study in the UK.

      The trial involves randomly allocating patients once they are in theatre, to either the
      MarginProbe procedure after breast conserving surgery and radiology has been completed, or
      not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 60% of all patients diagnosed with breast cancer (48000 annually in the UK) undergo
      breast conserving surgery (BCS. Surgical removal of the cancer aims to reduce the risk of
      local recurrence and patient mortality. In order to minimise the amount of tissue removed,
      excision up to the cancer-free area (margins) is undertaken. Further surgery, following
      initial breast cancer surgery, is required in 25% - 30% of patients because of disease found
      at the edges of the tissue removed.

      Reducing the need for further operations benefits patients (by reducing the number of
      operations required, improving cosmetic outcome and minimising anxiety) and the NHS (by
      realising economic benefits).

      MarginProbe, a disposable probe which measures the margins of tissue removed during breast
      cancer surgery, allows the surgeon to remove further tissue during the same surgical
      procedure to clear any involved margins, minimising subsequent re-operations. Four hundred
      and sixty patients in 6 specialist Breast Units will be randomly allocated after BCS (and
      specimen radiology), by telephone randomisation, to either:

        -  MarginProbe assessment of the surgical specimen with re-excision of margins if required;

        -  Standard BCS (clinical and radiological clear margins) whereby the wound will be closed
           and the surgery completed (standard UK practice).
