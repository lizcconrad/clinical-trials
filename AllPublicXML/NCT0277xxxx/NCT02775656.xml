      The purpose of this observational follow-up study is to collect data systematically on
      pregnancies and offspring of women who become pregnant while participating in a Certolizumab
      Pegol (CZP) study or whose pregnancies have otherwise been reported to UCB due to potential
      CZP exposure during pregnancy.

    <measure>Percentage of newborns with major congenital malformations</measure>
    <time_frame>At 20 weeks gestation or greater</time_frame>
    <description>The prevalence of major congenital malformations (MCMs) reported will be calculated by dividing the number of offspring with MCMs by the total number of live births and fetal losses with an MCM for all enrolled pregnancies and then stratified by treatment during pregnancy. The prevalence of MCMs will be calculated as soon as there are at least 50 prospectively-enrolled patients with an available outcome. Stillbirths and induced abortions (at 20 weeks gestation or greater) with reported MCMs are included in the estimate of the MCM prevalence.</description>

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be presented for the numbers of maternal pregnancy-related adverse events (AEs), adverse birth. Frequencies and proportions of adverse pregnancy will be presented using descriptive statistics. Analyses may include (but are not limited to) stratification by trimester of exposure, gestational age at time of consent, maternal age, and geographic region.</description>

        The study population consists of women who become pregnant while enrolled in a Certolizumab
        Pegol (CZP) study, or whose pregnancies otherwise are reported to UCB due to potential CZP
        exposure during pregnancy, and any resulting offspring. All pregnancies reported while the
        patient is enrolled in the CZP study are eligible regardless of treatment arm in the CZP
        study (eg, commercial or investigational CZP, placebo, or comparator treatment), pregnancy
        outcome (eg, live birth,spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, stillbirth) or any
        treatment decisions following discontinuation from the clinical study or report of the
        pregnancy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy is identified while the patient is participating in an interventional or
             noninterventional Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) study conducted by UCB, or a development
             partner, regardless of phase or treatment arm (ie, commercial or investigational,
             placebo or comparator treatment), or whose pregnancies were spontaneously reported to
             UCB due to potential CZP exposure during pregnancy

          -  Sufficient information to classify the pregnancy as prospective or retrospective is
             available

          -  Full initial reporter (ie, woman or healthcare provider (HCP)) contact information
             reported to allow for follow-up (name, address, telephone number/email address) and
             contact information for at least 1 applicable HCP if initial contact is the woman

          -  Consent to participate is provided

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancies in which the resulting infant is over 1 year of age at the time of
             informed consent will not be eligible to participate in the study
