  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal Acoustic Reflectometry (AAR) is a reliable and reproducible technique that has been
      studied in our department over the last 6 years. Sound waves pass into a balloon placed in
      the anal canal and are used to measure the cross-sectional area. By gradually increasing and
      decreasing the pressure in the balloon the investigators can measure the pressure at which
      the cross-sectional area starts to increase and decrease, and the anal canal starts to open
      and close. This assessment mimics the natural opening and closing of the anal canal and the
      effect of squeezing the muscles.

      Rectal intussusception occurs when the rectal wall telescopes into itself distally and is
      termed prolapse when it protrudes through the anal canal. Not all patients will require
      surgery and, for some, it can lead to debilitating symptoms of constipation, pain and faecal
      incontinence. Currently, the Oxford grading system through radiological testing is used for
      classifying severity of rectal intussusception and prolapse; however this does not give us
      sufficient information about the anal sphincter muscles.

      The gold standard investigation of the anal sphincter muscles has been manometry which
      measures anal canal pressure at rest and during squeeze. However, it has limitations. In
      previous studies AAR has shown promise in the assessment of faecal incontinence and, that
      unlike manometry, it has been able to distinguish between different types of incontinence.
      Thus far, it has not been studied in patients with rectal intussusception and it is hoped
      that AAR parameters may provide an indication of when rectal intussusception becomes overt
      rectal prolapse. This can inform the clinician to guide further management of a group of
      patients with a condition that can have significant impact on quality of life.

    <description>AAR parameters may differ depending of grade of rectal intussusception. The outcome will only be able to be established upon full recruitment of patients and target number of patients in each group. Once fully recruited grouped analysis can be performed to establish any difference in AAR parameters depending on the grade of rectal prolapse</description>

    <description>AAR measurements will be taken from patients with suspected intra-rectal intussusception or rectal prolapse. Subgroup analysis will be performed after grading of rectal prolapse according to the Oxford Grading system. The subgroups will be:
Oxford Grades 1 &amp; 2 - intra-rectal intussusception
Oxford Grades 3 &amp; 4 - intra-anal intussusception
Oxford grade 5 - Overt Rectal Prolapse</description>
