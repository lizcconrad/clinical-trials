  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the role of a
      personal trainer for non-metastatic breast cancer survivors to improve physical activity and
      well-being (in terms of quality of life).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After breast cancer treatment, many women are faced with effects of treatment such as changes
      in appearance, fatigue, and reduced quality of life as compared to the pre-disease state. An
      intervention to increase physical activity may be helpful to improve well-being and outcomes
      for women treated for breast cancer.
