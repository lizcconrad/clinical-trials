    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of LY900018 in participants with a
      common cold, some of whom will also take a nasal decongestant. The study will investigate how
      the body processes LY900018 and the effect of LY900018 on the body. The study will last up to
      30 days for each participant.

             nasal discharge associated with at least one other symptom of common cold, as
             determined by the 8-item Jackson cold scale at screening and prior to dosing of period
             1.

             conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs or known to potentiate or predispose to undesired effects.

          -  Presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, neurological,
             psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic or dermatologic disease.

          -  Presence of severe fever (more than 39.5 degrees Celsius) at screening or prior to
             dosing of period 1.

          -  Presence of clinically significant findings on nasal examination or bilateral anterior
             rhinoscopy, such as structural abnormalities, nasal polyps, marked septal deviation,
             nasal tumors.

          -  Presence or history of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.

          -  Presence or history of significant hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
