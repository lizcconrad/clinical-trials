  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an intervention designed to train persons who inject
      drugs (PWID) and are infected with hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV in communication skills to 1)
      promote new HCV treatment and care 2) risk reduction and 3) recruit their social network
      members for HIV and HCV testing and linkage to care.

      The investigators propose recruiting 300 HIV/HCV co-infected PWID (i.e. Index participants).
      Half will be randomly assigned to the experimental condition and half to the equal attention
      comparison. The experimental intervention will include 8 group sessions that focus on
      communication to social network members, medical adherence and risk reduction skills, 2 dyad
      sessions with network members, monthly booster sessions for 6 months, and mHealth cuing of
      behavior for 6 months. These Index participants will be followed for 24 months (3, 6, 12, 18,
      &amp; 24 month assessments). Participants who test positive for HCV will be linked to the Johns
      Hopkins Viral Hepatitis clinic to assess liver function and HCV chronicity and if applicable
      offered HCV treatment. Additionally, 450 network members will be recruited and will be tested
      for HIV and HCV and followed longitudinally to examine the social diffusion and social
      network factors associated with adherence among the Index participants.
