      The investigators will collect a range of physiological, behavioural and environmental data
      using current mHealth and home-monitoring systems, environmental databases and patient
      characteristics, to determine to what extent asthma control and the occurrence of asthma
      exacerbations can be predicted.

    <textblock>
      This observational study occurs alongside participants' normal asthma care. Participants will
      be asked to attend their normal GP and hospital appointments, and to continue to take their
      medication as determined by their usual healthcare team.

      In addition to their normal care, participants will attend an induction visit and complete a
      12-month home-monitoring period with 2 phases:

        -  Phase 1: one-month period of daily monitoring of asthma

        -  Phase 2: eleven-month period of weekly monitoring of asthma. Patients will be invited
           for a further 2-week period of daily monitoring between 2-9 months of Phase 2. The
           purpose of the second phase of daily monitoring is to assess the influence of
           seasonality (different seasons) on the patient's asthma.

      A variety of measurements will be made at an induction visit and over the 12-month
      home-monitoring period, as detailed below:

      Induction visit

      Demographics - Age (yr), gender, nationality, ethnicity, body mass (kg), height (cm), body
      mass index (BMI), comorbidities, medication, previous moderate and severe asthma
      exacerbations in preceding 12 months, previous severe asthma exacerbations requiring hospital
      attendance / admission (No in preceding 12 months), number of intensive care admission for
      asthma (ever), smoking history and social economic status.

      Questionnaires

        -  Asthma control will be assessed by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). [A patient's
           asthma control status will be classified as Controlled (ACQ≤0.75), Partly Controlled
           (0.75&lt;ACQ≤1.5) or Uncontrolled (ACQ&gt;1.5)].

        -  The typical diet of participants will be assessed via the Global Allergy and Asthma
           European Network (GA2LEN) food frequency questionnaire.

        -  Sinusitis/rhinoconjunctivitis will be determined via the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22
           (SNOT 22)

        -  Anxiety and depression will be determined via the hospital anxiety and depression score
           (HADS)

        -  Characteristics such as health directed behaviours and self-monitoring will be
           determined using the Health education impact Questionnaire (HeiQ)

        -  Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-AQLQ)

      Clinical tests

      - Atopic status will be determined via previous skin-prick test or blood test results.

      (If a patient's atopic status is unknown, a standard skin-prick test or blood test will be
      conducted).

        -  The diagnosis of asthma will be verified via a previous test result, using one of the
           following; a bronchodilator reversibility test, one-week peak flow monitoring or a
           bronchial challenge test. (If a patient's asthma diagnosis has not been verified from
           one of the tests listed above, they may be performed at screening visits)

        -  Lung function (spirometry) will be conducted according to ERS guidelines

        -  Airways inflammation will be determined by the level of Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide
           (FeNO) according to established guidelines

        -  Exhaled Breath Temperature, as measured by the X-halo device

      Phase 1 (first 4-week daily monitoring)

      The measurements in Phase 1 will be collected during the first 4 weeks of monitoring, and

    <description>Severe asthma exacerbations are events that require urgent action on the part of the patient and physician to prevent a serious outcome, such as hospitalization or death from asthma. The occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations is an important marker of poor asthma control. Severe asthma exacerbations are defined by the occurrence of at least one of the following:
Use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection), or an increase from a stable maintenance dose, for at least 3 days. For consistency, courses of corticosteroids separated by 1 week or more should be treated as separate severe exacerbations.
A hospitalisation or ER visit because of asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids.</description>

    <measure>Moderate asthma exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year &amp; preliminary analysis after 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>A moderate asthma exacerbation is an event that, when recognized, should result in a temporary change in treatment, in an effort to prevent the exacerbation from becoming severe. Moderate asthma exacerbations are defined by occurrence of at least one or more of the following:
deterioration in symptoms,
deterioration in lung function,
and increased rescue bronchodilator use. These features should last for 2 days or more, but not be severe enough to warrant systemic corticosteroid use and/or hospitalization. ER visits for asthma (e.g., for routine sick care), not requiring systemic corticosteroids, are also classified as moderate exacerbations</description>
