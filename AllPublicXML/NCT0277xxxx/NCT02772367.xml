  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether cells from a biopsy taken from the
      patient skin can be transformed into cardiomyocytes the changes in cardiomyocyte (heart
      muscle cells) when grown in a special culture medium outside of the body. The structure and
      function of these cells will then be studied to determine why some patients with breast
      cancer who are treated with chemotherapy including anthracycline (e.g. Doxorubicin) and
      anti-HER2 therapy (e.g. Herceptin) develop decreased heart function.
