  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase 1b study to investigate the safety and side effects of combining the
      ROR1-targeting monoclonal antibody, cirmtuzumab, with paclitaxel for patients with HER2
      negative, metastatic breast cancer. Cirmtuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal
      antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called receptor-tyrosine-kinase like
      orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) on the surface of breast cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab blocks the growth
      and survival of the breast cancer cells in laboratory tests. ROR1 is rarely expressed on
      healthy cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental and is not approved by United States
      (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      -  This is a phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, fixed dose study in patients with HER2
           negative metastatic, or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer.

        -  Cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion weekly
           during treatment up to six 28-day cycles. Paclitaxel alone may be continued after
           cirmtuzumab has been discontinued if the patient is receiving benefit.

        -  Blood and tissue samples will be collected at pre-specified times to enable
           pharmacokinetic and correlative studies.

        -  Adverse events (AE) will be monitored throughout the trial. Reporting of AEs will be in
           accordance with CTCAE version 4.03.

        -  Assessment of tumor response will be performed by physical examination and/or by
           radiographic imaging and according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
           (RECIST) v.1.1.

        -  Patients will be assessed at 28 days following the last dose of cirmtuzumab to assess
           tumor response and at 56 days following the last dose of cirmtuzumab to assess any
           adverse events and to document any concomitant cancer therapy.
