      This study aims to compare the resource impact, acute toxicity and feasibility of different
      pan-lymph node radiotherapy techniques. Radiotherapy using wide tangents with the patient in
      breath hold will be compared against volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in free
      breathing in the main trial. A parallel study will asses the accuracy of VMAT treatments
      using voluntary deep inspiratory breath hold compared to an active breathing controlled
      breath hold device.

    <textblock>
      Following publication of results of two large randomised clinical trials, pan-lymph node
      radiotherapy (pan-LN RT) (including treatment of the internal mammary chain) is set to become
      standard treatment in patients with lymph-node positive breast cancer. Traditional pan-LN RT
      techniques deliver high radiation doses to the heart and lungs which can cause long-term
      side-effects in women many years after their treatment. Modern techniques including
      breath-holding and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can reduce doses to heart and
      lungs but the investigators do not yet know which technique(s) are best in terms of resource
      costs, short to medium-term side-effects, and day to day accuracy. This study will compare
      the time taken to deliver pan-LN RT using breath-holding versus VMAT and will collect
      side-effect data up to one year following treatment as well as modelling long-term cardiac
      risks based on heart doses delivered. The results of the main study will help guide
      clinicians and departments in selecting the best pan-LN RT techniques for their patients. A
      parallel study will evaluate the combination of breath-hold and VMAT using a machine-based
      technique called the active-breathing controlled (ABC) device against a more simple voluntary
      breath-hold technique were patients simply take a breath in and hold it for up to 20 seconds
      at a time. These techniques will be compared in terms of their day-to-day accuracy. If the
      simpler technique proves as accurate as the ABC-technique, this will establish the simpler
      technique as a less resource-intensive standard of care adoptable by other radiotherapy
      departments.
