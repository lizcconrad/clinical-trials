    <textblock>
      Human autologous serum is commonly used in the treatment of dry eye disease. However,
      different patients may have different effect with autologous serum treatment. We would like
      to find if different autologous serum had different component of cytokines in different
      etiologies of dry eye.

      Dry eye is an important issue in the filed of ophthalmology and has great influence on the
      quality of life in many patients. Traditional treatment was mainly focused on artificial tear
      supplement. Inflammatory factors are identified in the recent days and are thought to play an
      important role in the etiology of dry eye. Anti-inflammatory agent like topical
      immunosuppressant has become another choice in the treatment of dry eye.

      Conventional artificial tear has similar biochemical features and osmolarity with natural
      tear but lacks the anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, autologous serum has been applied
      as a substitute of natural tear because it has more anti-inflammatory cytokines. Clinical
      trials have shown that autologous serum drops improve ocular irritation symptoms, and
      conjunctival and corneal dye staining in dry eye.

      However, in the manufacture of autologous serum, it is hard to standardize every step and
      control quality. What's more, the patient may have different etiology of dry eye, including
      primary Sjogren's syndrome, secondary Sjogren's syndrome, other autoimmune disease, or ocular
      graft versus host disease. The etiology of dry eye may have different response to autologous
      serum. However, we don't know if the autologous serum from different patients' have different
      components and the different components of cytokines may have different treatment efficacy.
      This is what we want to know in this study.

      Since human autologous serum is needed for cytokine analysis, we proposed this project to
      collect human serum from volunteersã€‚
