    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well B-mode ultrasound imaging works in detecting liver cancer
      that is early in its growth and may not have spread to other parts of the body. Diagnostic
      procedures, such as B-mode ultrasound imaging, may help find and diagnose liver cancer and
      find out how far the disease has spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the use of quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy to detect early
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as an inexpensive and widely available quantitative (i.e.
      robust) method to confirm disease in developing countries.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo B-mode ultrasound imaging of the liver over 15 minutes.

    <measure>Spectral intercept</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spectral intercept (SI) is mostly related to the number scatterers and their density in the tissue. Changes in the SI have been demonstrated to occur due to different pathologies and result from treatments that change the structure of the tissue being imaged.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Healthy Volunteers

          1. Patients over 18 years of age.

          2. Must have no known medical problems and have had a full medical exam within 6 months
             of the study. If healthy volunteers have not had a full medical exam within 6 months
             of the study, one of the ultrasound physicians will conduct the medical exam prior to
             any study procedures.

        For HCC patients

          1. Patients over 18 years of age.

          2. Patient with confirmed diagnosis of HCC, and untreated or Patients with Suspected HCC
             (Suspected HCC nodules should preferably be smaller than 3 cm and preferably within 6
             cm in depth of the transducer head to minimize attenuation) and untreated or Patients
             at a higher risk of HCC undergoing a screening program by Ultrasound.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For Healthy volunteers

        1. Patients who are not likely to comply with the protocol requirements.

        For HCC patients

          1. Patients should not be taking other Investigational Agents.

          2. Concomitant medications for treatment of the target lesion.
