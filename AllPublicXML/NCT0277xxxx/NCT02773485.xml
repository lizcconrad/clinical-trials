    <textblock>
      The study evaluates impact of high dose radiation on overall survival in patients with
      unresectable nonmetastatic cholangiocarcinoma. The study randomizes patient between systemic
      chemotherapy alone and systemic chemotherapy and high dose radiation

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently the standard of care of unresectable non-metastatic cholangiocarcinoma is
      chemotherapy which has a median survival of 11.7 months (ABC-02 study). While this study
      included almost 60% of patients with cholangiocarcinomas (intrahepatic, extra hepatic and
      hilar), almost 73-76% of patients in each arm had metastases to begin with. And while the
      overall survival of the entire cohort was significantly improved by gemcitabine plus
      cisplatin compared to cisplatin alone, the hazard ratios for intrahepatic {0.57 (0.34-0.94)},
      extra hepatic {0.73 (0.43-1.23)} and hilar cholangiocarcinomas {0.59 (0.32-1.09)} were all
      insignificant. Even though concurrent chemoradiation+/= brachytherapy has been used for
      management of cholangiocarcinomas for more than 3 decades the lack of level I evidence
      prevents from it being recommended as the first line management across multidisciplinary
      clinics.

      While either modality alone rarely yields survival of more than 12 months, recent reports of
      improved median survival with combination of high dose radiation and systemic chemotherapy
      necessitates investigation into role of combination of high dose (chemo) radiation and
      systemic chemotherapy.

      All patients with diagnosis of nonmetastatic unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who fulfill the
      study eligibility criteria will be evaluated for study participation. Patients will undergo
      upfront randomization into one of the study arms (systemic chemotherapy alone vs Systemic
      chemotherapy+ High dose radiation) The study stratification criteria will be done according
      the primary site i.e. Intrahepatic vs Extrahepatic.

    <description>Irrespective of arm allocation Baseline Positron Emission Tomography(PET) scan and hepatic function assessment will be done. Those randomized to this arm will receive systemic chemotherapy delivered on day 1 and 8 every 3 weekly, with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2. After first 4 cycles patients will undergo repeat Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography(CECT)/PET scan. If CECT/PET scan shows stable/ responding disease then patients will continue to receive the same chemotherapy. In case of locally progressive/ systemic disease on chemotherapy patients may be considered for second line palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care. The use of radical chemoradiation is not allowed on disease progression in this arm. However palliative radiation may be used.</description>

    <description>In those randomized to radiation arm with receive high dose radiation with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in addition to systemic and concurrent chemotherapy. The gross tumor will comprise the high dose volume. The adjacent areas of suspected microscopic disease will form the low dose volume. When only external radiation is used the aim will be to deliver 52.5-60 Gy/ 25 fractions to the gross disease and 45 Gy/ 25 fractions to suspected microscopic disease along with weekly gemcitabine (300 mg/ m2) .</description>
