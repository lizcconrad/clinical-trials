  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonography (US) is an operator depended image modality that is difficult to reproduce
      and interpret by others. Competence of the US operator is crucial for reliable diagnostics
      but no evidence-based certification of head and neck US skills has been developed.
      Investigators conducted an experimental study aimed to explore diagnostic accuracy and
      establish validity evidence for certification standards in surgeon-performed ultrasonography.
