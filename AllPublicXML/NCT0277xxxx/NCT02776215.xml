        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females who are legally blind [defined as having a visual acuity of 20/200 or
             less in the better-seeing eye with best conventional correction (glasses or contact
             lenses) and/or a visual field of 20 degrees or less in the better-seeing eye], 3 to
             &lt;18 years of age or males and females with SMS and 3 to &lt;16 years of age with a
             nighttime sleep complaint and 3 to &lt;18 years of age or males and females with ASD and
             3 to &lt;18 years of age with a nighttime sleep complaint;

          2. Weigh at least 16 kg;

        3 Diagnosis of SMS determined by a prior positive genetic test result as indicated by
        parent/guardian; Diagnosis of ASD as indicated by parent/guardian; or a diagnosis of Non-24
        as determined by DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for the Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder,
        Non-24-hour sleep-wake hour type:

          1. A persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primarily due to an
             alteration of the circadian system or to a misalignment between the endogenous
             circadian rhythm and the sleep-wake schedule required by an individual's physical
             environment or social or professional schedule;

          2. The sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both;

          3. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
             occupational, and other important areas of functioning.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For blind subjects only: Subjects who have a probable diagnosis of a current sleep
             disorder other than Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder that is the primary cause of the
             sleep disturbance based on clinical investigator medical judgment;

          2. For blind subjects only: History (within the 12 months prior to screening) of
             psychiatric disorders including ADHD, Neurodisabilities, Major Depressive Disorder,
             Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Axis II Disorders, delirium or any other psychiatric
             disorder, that is not being successfully treated or has not been resolved and that in
             the opinion of the clinical investigator would affect participation in the study or
             full compliance with study procedures;

          3. History of intolerance and/or hypersensitivity to melatonin or melatonin agonists;
