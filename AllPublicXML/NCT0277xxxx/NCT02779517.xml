    <textblock>
      By developing an affordable mobile service robot for therapeutic activities in a health
      center environment, this project addresses the issue of both the high cost and man-power
      required to provide rehabilitation for stroke survivors and other patients. Our goal is to
      measure users - clinician and patient - responses to a telepresence robot, VGo, that has been
      modified with a humanoid torso robot, NAO, to facilitate remote communication between the
      patient and clinician, and to complete supervisory exercise coaching.

      This is a short demonstration and survey study. Clinical staff and patients will be gathered
      together and our idea for the mobile service robot will discussed. A demonstration of the
      telepresence feature of the robots and the NAO robot greeting and helping them with simple
      exercises will follow (e.g., pick up and object that is handy and lift their hands over their
      heads). The approximately 30-minute demonstration part of the study will start with an
      introduction and explanation about the project and a short speech about the Rehabilitation
      and Robotics Lab. After the demonstration the oral consent will be read and surveys will be
      handed out to those study participants who agree to complete them; if necessary, the research
      team will assist the study participant with the survey. Surveys will then be collected, and
      the group will be thanked by the research team.

    <description>The goal is to build a low-cost mobile service robot that will focus on the simple, but key, repetitive, data-driven tasks that robots do well. Rather than attempt to create a robot helper that mimics humans, the goal is to free human caregivers from the time-consuming tasks that robots can accomplish with facility, thereby allowing humans to focus on tasks that humans do best (i.e. human contact).</description>
