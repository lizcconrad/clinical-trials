  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrates are the main determinant of post-meal glucose excursion. However, fat and
      protein have been shown to also impact the postprandial glucose control, adding to the
      complexity of meal insulin calculation. Few studies have looked at the effect of
      macronutrients other than carbohydrates on postprandial glucose excursions with the
      closed-loop strategy. The objective of this study is to test whether the single-hormone
      closed-loop strategy can achieve similar post-meal glucose control with meals with a fixed
      carbohydrate content, but high in protein and/or fat when compared to a meal with a fixed
      carbohydrate content only.

    <description>Interventions will be undertaken 1 to 5 days after sensor insertion. Subjects will be admitted at IRCM at 6:30 am in a fasting state. At 7:00, single-hormone closed-loop will be initiated. At 8:00, if glucose levels are between 3.5 and 12.5 mmol/L, the meal will be served. Patients will have 20 minutes to consume the meal. If glucose levels are not in this target range, the meal will be delayed for a maximum of 45 minutes. If after 45 minutes, glucoses levels are still not between 3.5 and 12.5 mmol/L, the test will be cancelled and rescheduled. The test meals will be: 1) 75g of CHO; 2) 75g of CHO + 35g of protein; 3) 75g of CHO + 35g of fat; or 4) 75g of CHO + 35g of protein + 35g of fat. The intervention day will end at 13:00.</description>

          4. Severe hypoglycemic episode within 1 month of screening.

          5. Agents affecting gastric emptying (Motilium®, Prandase®, all GLP-1 analogs) as well as
             oral anti-diabetic agents (Metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors) if not

             kept stable during the entire protocol.

          6. Oral steroids unless patients present a low stable dose (e.g. 10 mg or less of
             prednisone per day or physiological doses, less than 35 mg/day, of hydrocortisone
             Cortef®). Inhaled steroids at stable dose in the last month are acceptable.

          7. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator (e.g. unstable
             psychiatric condition).

          8. Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to change pump
             parameters, follow algorithm's suggestions, etc).
