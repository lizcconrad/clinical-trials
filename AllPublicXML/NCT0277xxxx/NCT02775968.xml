      This study is based on the hypothesis that the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in children is
      different from adults. Cephalosporins and macrolide antibiotics are the common drugs for
      children with community acquired pneumonia, the investigators aim to study the population
      pharmacokinetics of cephalosporins and macrolide antibiotics in children receiving the drug
      for treatment of community acquired pneumonia, and to correlate it with treatment
      effectiveness and incidence of adverse effects.

      Potential Impact: This novel knowledge will allow better and more rational approaches to the
      treatment of community acquired pneumonia. It will also set the foundation for further
      studies that will be able to test improved therapies that may increase treatment response in
      vulnerable children.
