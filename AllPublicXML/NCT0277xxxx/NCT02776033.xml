  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study with GSK2982772, a receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase
      inhibitor, in subjects with active plaque-type psoriasis (PsO). The primary objective will be
      to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of GSK2982772 60 milligram
      (mg) twice daily (BID) for 84 days in Cohort 1 and 60 mg thrice daily (TID) for 84 days in
      Cohort 2. In addition, a number of experimental and clinical endpoints will be employed to
      obtain information on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy in subjects with
      active PsO. There will be two Cohorts of subjects. In Cohort 1 after a screening period of up
      to 30 days, approximately 30 subjects will be randomized to receive either GSK2982772 60 mg
      BID or placebo for 84 days (12 Weeks), followed by a follow-up period (28 days). In Cohort 2
      after a screening period of up to 30 days, approximately 24 subjects will be randomized to
      receive either GSK2982772 60 mg TID or placebo for 84 days (12 Weeks), followed by a
      follow-up period (28 days). The total duration of participation is approximately 20 Weeks
      from screening to the last study visit.

        Use of parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) antibiotics (antibacterials, antivirals,
        antifungals, or antiparasitic agents) within 60 days before first dose.

        A history of opportunistic infections within 1 year of screening (e.g. pneumocystis
        jirovecii, cytomegalovirus, pneumonitis, aspergillosis). This does not include infections

          -  A history of malignant neoplasm within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated
             cancers of the skin (basal or squamous cell carcinoma) or carcinoma in situ of the
             uterine cervix that has been fully treated and shows no evidence of recurrence.

             protocol, or changes to those treatments, within the specified timeframe.

        Other medications (including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements) will be considered
        on a case-by-case basis, and will be allowed if in the opinion of the Investigator the
        medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse that would interfere with the ability to comply with
             the study.

          -  Subject intends to sunbathe or use a tanning device (sun bed or solarium) within 14
             days prior to Day 1 and until completion of the follow up visit (Day 112).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study treatments, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical

          -  Received a live or attenuated vaccine within 30 days of randomization OR plan to
             receive a vaccination during the study until completion of the follow-up visit.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer before the first dose of
             study medication, or plans to take part in another clinical trial at the same time as
             participating in this clinical trial. Subjects who were randomized into Cohort 1 are
             not eligible to be re-randomized into Cohort 2.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;11 g/deciliter (dL); hematocrit &lt;30%, white blood cell count
             =&lt;3,000/millimeter (mm)^3 (&lt;=3.0×10^9/L) ; platelet count &lt;=100,000/microliter (µL)
             (&lt;=100 × 10^9/L); absolute neutrophil count &lt;=1.5×10^9/L at the screening visit.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. As
             potential for and magnitude of immunosuppression with this compound is unknown,
             subjects with presence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) should be excluded.
             Subjects positive for HBsAg and/or positive for anti-HBcAb (regardless of anti-HBs
             antibody status) are excluded.

          -  A positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus 1 or 2 at screening.

          -  Exposure to more than 4 investigational medicinal products within 12 months prior to
             the first dosing day
