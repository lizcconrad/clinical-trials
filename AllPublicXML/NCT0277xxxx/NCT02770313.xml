  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine how effective repeated fasting over 26 weeks (6
      months) is at improving risk parameters that are surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular
      diseases, metabolic dysregulation and cognitive impairments.

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to water-only fasting or to their ad libitum usual diet, with
      randomization performed within strata based on fasting history (≤180 hours or 181-720 hours
      of total fasting for &gt;12 consecutive hours per episode in the previous two years). Subjects
      will be assessed at 4, 13 and 26 weeks following randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female, 21-60 years of age,

               -  who are not currently taking a statin medication,

               -  who have either pre-diabetes (clinical diagnosis, hemoglobin A1c ≥5.6%, or
                  untreated fasting glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL within 6 months of screening) and are not
                  taking medications to control diabetes OR diagnosed, diet-controlled type 2
                  diabetes but do not require medications to control diabetes OR one or more of the
                  components of the metabolic syndrome measured within 6 months of screening (other
                  than fasting glucose level &gt;100 mg/dL, i.e.: 1. systolic blood pressure ≥130
                  mmHg, or diastolic ≥85 mmHg, or use of an antihypertensive medication, 2.
                  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dL for males or &lt;50 mg/dL for
                  females, 3. triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL or use of a non-statin triglyceride-lowering
                  medication (e.g., fibrate, niacin), 4. waist circumference ≥40 inches (102 cm)
                  for males or ≥35 inches (88 cm) for females, or body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2),

                  90-189 mg/dL OR are 40-60 years of age with either LDL-C of 90-129 mg/dL OR LDL-C
                  of 130-159 mg/dL and &lt;7.5% ten-year risk for heart attack or stroke based on the
                  Pooled Cohort Risk Equations

                  intolerance to the medications or who have one or more contraindications to
                  statins and thus cannot take them but meet other study inclusion and exclusion
                  criteria.

          2. Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained

          2. Individuals who have fasted more than 15 hours per episode more than once per month
             during the past two years (i.e., &gt;720 hours over two years), except for those who fast
             during multiple weeks once per year (e.g., Muslim, Baha'i) who will be allowed to
             begin participation starting at two weeks after their preferred annual period of
             fasting ends (e.g., Ramadan or the Baha'i fast) and ending at six months prior to the
             beginning of the next annual observance, as long as they do not fast routinely outside
             of the one annual period of fasting.

          3. Refusal to drink water while fasting.

          4. Prior diagnosis of a chronic disease (i.e., defined as symptomatic coronary artery
             disease, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular thromboembolism,
             chronic kidney disease stage III or higher, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             immunodeficiency, solid organ transplant, eating disorder, type I diabetes, dementia,

             within the last 5 years other than cancer of the skin excluding melanoma).

          5. Pre-diabetics or diabetics on diabetes medication.

             to the subject and/or compromise the quality of the clinical trial.
