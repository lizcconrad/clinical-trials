      Background:

      Drug resistant tuberculosis is a serious public health problem that threatens the health of
      human life and the development of society and economy. At present, the diagnosis of
      drug-resistant tuberculosis mainly depends on traditional drug susceptibility test. But it is
      limited in Mycobacterium tuberculosis slow growth speed, traditional solid drug sensitivity
      test usually need to 3 months to results, delay the development of drug resistance in
      patients with effective treatment. Probe melting curves resistance detection technology is
      the recent emergence of a new molecular biology and drug resistant tuberculosis detection
      technology, probe melting curves with different fluorescent labeled probe coverage detection
      specific to M.tuberculosis drug resistance determining region, through changes in the melting
      point of the probe hybridization, acquire mutation information of detection region, shorten
      detection time and detect nonuniform resistance.

      In this study, by selecting a nationally representative in different levels of hospitals
      jointly launched multi center, large sample clinical assessment, completed the comprehensive
      evaluation of sensitivity, specificity and health economics of drug resistant pulmonary
      tuberculosis, especially resistance to multidrug and extensively drug-resistant TB patients
      detection,in order to evaluate the rapid, accurate and economic and appropriate technology of
      drug resistance pulmonary tuberculosis detection.

      In order to accomplish the overall goal of the project, in the framework of the overall
      design, according to the principles of the core tasks are divided into four sub topics,
      namely:

      Sub topic 1 of the core mission is included in 3100 cases of smear positive pulmonary TB
      suspicious symptoms, from which selected more than 1000 cases of drug-resistant pulmonary
      tuberculosis patients, using MGIT liquid culture and drug sensitivity test as the gold
      standard,evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of probe melting curves in detction of
      resistance of four kinds of anti tuberculosis drug to Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Sub topic 2
      core task is including at least 500 cases of culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients
      and treatment follow-up, using MGIT liquid culture and drug sensitivity test as the gold
      standard, evaluate the application value of probe melting curves for monitoring spectrum
      changes of drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during pulmonary tuberculosis
      treatment.

      The core mission of sub topic 3 is to project implementation of hospital as the research
      site,acquire the cost-effect evaluation and analysis by comparing probe melting technology
      with Mycobacterium tuberculosis MGIT liquid culture, and drug sensitivity test with xpert
      MTB/RIF technology.

A sputum sample is collected from the patient with suspected TB. The sputum is mixed with the reagent that is provided with the assay, and a cartridge containing this mixture is placed in the GeneXpert machine. All processing from this point on is fully automated.The test simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and resistance to rifampin (RIF) in less than 2 hours.</description>

    <description>Probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA) is a powerful tool for mutation detection based on melting temperature generated by thermal denaturation of the probe-target hybrid, which performed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis's drug resistant monitor. The method was explored two dual-labeled, self-quenched probes, TaqMan and shared-stem molecular beacons, in their ability to conduct FMCA. Both probes could be directly used for FMCA and readily integrated with closed-tube amplicon hybridization under asymmetric PCR conditions. Improved flexibility of FMCA by using these probes was illustrated in three representative applications of FMCA: mutation scanning, mutation identification and mutation genotyping, all of which achieved improved color-multiplexing with easy probe design and versatile probe combination and all were validated with a large number of real clinical samples.</description>
