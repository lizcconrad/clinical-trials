  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how an investigational treatment (maribavir) is
      handled by the body when administered with two already approved drugs (digoxin and
      dextromethorphan). The study will also look at the safety and tolerability when maribavir is
      coadministered with digoxin and dextromethorphan versus digoxin and dextromethorphan alone.
