  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective, observational study compiled data from all consecutively admitted patients
      older than 18 years at ICU University Hospital in Olomouc in the period from 1 January 2011
      to 31 December 2015 who fulfilled the criteria of HAP. The aim was to determine the severity
      of the specific risk factors of early and late HAP. Risk factors were divided into factors
      from the patient and from the hospitalization. Furthermore, an assessment of their
      relationship to mortality.

      The primary outcome was to evaluate the relationship between risk factors and the development
      of early/late onset HAP. Another outcome was assessed to evaluate the relation of risk
      factors early/late onset HAP and mortality. The crucial time for evaluating the presence of
      risk factors was their presence from hospital admission to the moment of fulfilling the
      criteria for pneumonia. Risk factors were divided into two groups, on factors of the patient
      (uncontrollable) and by the hospitalization (controllable). Factors of the patient were:
      gender (male/female), age at enrollment (years), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
      Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, multi-organ failure presence (MOF), hypertension, ischemic
      heart disease (IHD) chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), continual use of renal replacement
      therapy (CRRT), acute renal insufficiency (ARI), diabetes mellitus (DM), Chronical
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), immunosuppression or leukopenia &lt;1.5x109/l, impaired
      consciousness with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) &lt;8 tracheotomy, head trauma/neurosurgery,
      abdominal surgery-thoracotomy. Side factors hospitalization were: aspiration into the lungs,
      urgent intubation, reintubated, sedation, bronchoscopy, nasogastric intubation, enteral
      feeding continuously/intermittently intolerance of enteral nutrition, physiotherapy, repeated
      transport of the patient from the ICU, length of hospital stay, length of mechanical
      ventilation, 30-day mortality.

        The study included patients hospitalized in the ICU Department of Anesthesiology and
        Intensive Care Medicine, UH Olomouc. On inclusion did not affect the method of ensuring
        lower airways (invasive/non-invasive) or results (positivity/negativity) taken
        microbiological samples from the lower airways (endobronchial aspirate or bronchoalveolar
        lavage) as approximately one third of samples can be microbiologically negative even when
        overt bronchopneumonia. Patient cohort consisted of all patients older than 18 years who
        met the clinical criteria and HAP were consecutively admitted to the ICU.
