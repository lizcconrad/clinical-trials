  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multicountry, open-label, Phase 1b/2a dose-escalation study to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC-220 when administered as monotherapy and in
      combination with dexamethasone. The study will consist of an escalating dose-escalation
      portion (Part 1) as well as an expansion of each cohort (ie, Cohort C: Monotherapy (MonoT)
      and Cohort D: Combination treatment with 2 drugs (DoubleT) at the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) to further evaluate safety and estimate preliminary efficacy (Part 2).

    <textblock>
      Subjects assigned to CC-220 monotherapy who develop PD will have the option to receive
      Dexamethasone (DEX) in addition to CC-220 after consultation with the Medical Monitor. The
      dose of CC-220 will not be higher than the dose of CC-220 used in combination with
      dexamethasone that has been tested and is considered safe. Progressive disease must be
      confirmed in accordance with International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG) criteria.

      The starting dose of DEX will be 40 mg Once daily (QD) on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day
      cycle for subjects who are ≤75 years of age. For subjects who are &gt;75 years of age, the
      starting dose of DEX is 20 mg QD on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 day cycle. This treatment
      will continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity or the subject withdraws consent.

      To address the duration of response endpoint, all subjects with a minimal response (MR) or
      better who discontinue study treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study for a reason other
      than PD will be followed for response assessment every 28 days until PD or a new myeloma
      regimen has been started.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.
