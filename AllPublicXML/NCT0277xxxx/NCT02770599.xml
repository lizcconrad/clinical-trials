  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) refers to two chronic diseases (Crohn`s disease and
      Ulcerative colitis) both complex disorders requiring a long-term management, with significant
      healthcare resource consumption. Traditionally IBD patients has been treated by a variety of
      health care professional including doctors with specialist qualifications, assistant doctors,
      general practitioner or scarcity of follow-up-service. Lately there has been a shift in the
      health care service from conventional follow - up (CF) to a rising numbers of health care
      models in term of Multidisciplinary team (MDT) also including care for IBD patients. MDT-
      models have been identified as important for continuity in patient centred care where nurses
      have a key role within the team by enhancing patient care. Patients have directly access to
      the IBD nurse who performing independently consultations at the IBD - Policlinic. This study
      will test the hypothesis that MDT including an IBD - nurse is preferable concerning; patient
      reported Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Quality of Care (QoC), and clinical outcomes
      including adherence. This will be a retrospective clinical quality survey with a single time
      point measurement, with consecutive recruitments of patients in the course of a 12-month
      period. Data will be collected from medical records and patient questionnaires. Investigators
      plan involving 300 participants aged &gt;18 and &lt; 80 recruited from Medical departments in North
      Norway and from Diakonhjemmet in Oslo. Half will be from CF-models and half from the IBD -
      MDT. The study have approval from the local Ethics committee and application to the Data
      protection Officer has been submitted. All participants are asked for provide written
      consent. The results can potentially contribute; to a better utilization of health care
      resources, improve quality of health and quality of care. In a nurse-perspective, this
      organising model can be valuable in recruiting nurses by presenting a new challenging task
      concept, and identify the gaps in their own knowledge and skills. A well-established MDT can
      also be reasonable in a cost effective way by decreasing hospitalisation and fee up clinical
      spaces for the gastroenterologist.

    <description>Health Related Quality of Life measured by The inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). This is a disease specific valid, reliable and sensitive instrument for clinical trials designed to measure the effects of the IBD on daily function and quality of life during the past two weeks. An absolute change on 16 of 224 points in total score has been used to define a minimum clinically important difference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of care</measure>
    <time_frame>during autumn of 2016</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire QUOTE IBD focus on GP-care and medical specialist care. This is a short, valid and reliable questionnaire. The answers is divided into four categories: &quot;not important&quot; - fairly important - important - extremely important&quot; and &quot; no - not really - on the whole yes - yes&quot;.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence associated to IBD medications</measure>
    <time_frame>during autumn of 2016</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) is a validated 8-question measuring scale for medication adherence in IBD patients. The patients can score from 0-8 points, where score &gt; 2 = low adherence and a score of 1 or 2 = medium adherence.</description>
