      Open label phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers designed to assess changes on steroid
      profile after green tea consumption.

      Anabolic androgenic steroids are included in the list of banned substances in sports by the
      World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) because of its ability to improve the performance of
      athletes.

      Testosterone glucuronization by UGT2B17 isoenzyme (Uridine Diphosphate Glucuronyltransferase
      2B17) is inhibited in vitro by green tea flavonols like epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate
      (EGCG) and catechin gallate.

      Therefore a diet rich in green tea could interfere in androgens' glucuronization and cause a
      change on the steroid profile of the athletes that could be considered a false positive.

      A clinical trial designed to assess changes on steroid profile in healthy volunteers after
      green tea consumption will be conducted. Subjects with different UGT2B17 genotype will be
      recruited (10 of each type: ins/ins, ins/del, del/del) to study if the genotype can modulate
      the results obtained.

      Urine samples obtained before and during 7 days of green tea consumption will be used to
      compare steroid profile. Blood samples will be also collected to assess EGCG
      pharmacokinetics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Understand and accept the study's procedures and sign an informed consent form

          -  Body mass index (BMI=weight/heigth2) between 19 and 27 kg/m2, weight between 50 and
             100 kg.

          -  No evidence of somatic or psychiatric disorders as per past medical history and
             physical examination

          -  EKG, blood and urine tests taken before entry into the study within the normal range.
             Minor and transient abnormalities may be acceptable if, according to the Principal
             Investigator's criterion and the state of the art, they are felt to have no clinical
             relevance, entail no danger to the participant, and don't interfere with the product's
             assessment. These abnormalities and their non-relevance must be specifically justified
             in writing)

        Exclusion Criteria:

             symptomatic drugs taken during the week before the experimental session will not
             constitute an exclusion criterion if it can be assumed that it has been completely
             eliminated on the day of the experimental session

          -  Smokers of &gt;10 cigarettes/day

          -  Consumption of &gt;40 g/day of alcohol
